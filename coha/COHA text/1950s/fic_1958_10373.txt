Commerce , as though their combined right arms were hung on a single hinge , reached for the coffee cup . There was the clink of metal on glass as Mayor Bogard rose and tapped for order . The young alert faces turned toward him like a battery of lights . He spoke in the platitudes of the commanded and ungifted . Ladies and gentlemen . Members of the Baranof Chamber of Commerce . Honored Guests . We have with us . It is my great pleasure . One who . Known to all of you . Magnificent record . War . And now .. . The General rose , and they remembered him in the days of his command . He , too , remembered , for as he spoke , simply and somewhathaltingly , his expression was embarrassed and insecure as that of a television master of ceremonies who suddenly interrupts the flow of entertainment with a commercial plug for the sponsor 's line of lipstick , cold cream and hair lacquer . The blue eyes were strained , he had taken off his bone-rimmed spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent , placating mask of a weary man past middle age . He wished , oh , so deeply , that they would just let him stand and be introduced and sit the hell down . But he had a speech to make ; he had a speech to make ( or had made a speech ) in Juneau , in Anchorage , in Fairbanks , now in Baranof and later , perhaps , in Nome and God knows what icy wilderness . So . " Friends . . . this vast empire called Alaska . . . nature has indeed been lavish . . . we of the world of business and economics and others at the helm of the nation 's political ship of state . . . the welfare of this magnificent Territory at heart . . . " The closing words were momentarily lost as a jet from Kinkaid Air Base streaked past high , high in the heavens , its maniacal screech in the thin icy air taunting the man who stood there addressingthe cynical guests of honor and the young attentive members of the Baranof Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Boardof National Fish Pack Company , sat down to respectful applause . " Dave next , I bet , " Bridie said . " Czar wo n't talk , he 's too smart , hep101lets the others sluice off at the mouth . I do n't know 's I can sit listening to that Distelhorst . " In the dining-room doorway a little knot of people had gathered . They were quiet , polite , orderly . They stood there out of curiosity , interest , or because , late in making application , there had not been space for them at the luncheon table . Craning , Chris Storm could just glimpse Addie Barnett near the doorway , and behind her the ugly , beautiful , civilized face of Paul Barnett , his myopic eyes round and protuberant behind the thick spectacles . Chris knew that this Chamber of Commerce luncheon would be a week old before he could translate it into Northern Light news columns . She knew , too , that by his passion and integrity it would , miraculously , be fresh and exciting news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the merry face of Ross Guildenstern . Her gaze met his , her eyebrows went up in questioning . He grinned mischievously . " Why , there 's Ross ! " Bridie exclaimed . " What 's he doing here ? " Decker snapped , disgruntled . " At a Chamber of Commerce lunch ! " " Why not ? He flies a commercial plane , does n't he ? " Chris retorted . " Or maybe he 's just here to see how his pupil makes out in the speaking department . That was quite a briefing he gave Mr. Distelhorst in the car . " Again Oscar Bogard stood up , again the murmur of voices died away as the clink of metal on glass called for quiet . This time Bogard 's mien was not solemn and reverent . He was jovial , chummy , informal . " Well , folks , I guess I do n't have to spend any valuable time introducingour next speaker . I 'd rather save the time for him . You all know what Dave Husack stands for --  " Grinning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oddly , it came late , it was scattered and strangely perfunctory . In that split second of unexpected silence a woman 's voice spoke crisply and unexpectedly from the crowd in the doorway . " It is n't a patch on what Alaska 's standing for . "  |p102There  was a ripple of shocked but irrepressible laughter . It was plain that the remark had not been meant for the public ear . " That was Addie Barnett , " Chris whispered . " She 'll feel awful . " " Paul there ? " Bridie asked , craning to view the hallway . " She probably was talking to him . " " Red-haired girls , " Ott Decker observed , sagely , as the burst of startled laughter died down , " are always trigger-happy . " Dave Husack stood up , an imposing figure , his high color even rosier than usual , so that a stranger might have thought that this fresh ruddy man had just emerged from a Turkish bath , a hot towel , a shave , a shampoo . He had whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead , the warm food-haunted room took on a woodsy scent . He spread his great arms wide . His voice was smooth , his manner folksy , his tone blandishing . " Alaskans ! Fellow Americans ! Pioneers ! I want to thank the little lady who made that timely little remark . If I could have chosen it as an introduction I would have  --  even though my good friend , your able and honored Mayor Oscar Bogard here , stated that I needed no introduction . Yes . You good and wonderful people have stood for a lot of things from a wise government and a well-intentioned group of national men of business . And you have grown impatient and fretfulat times . And why ? For the same reason that a strong healthy willful child is impatient at the restraints laid upon it by devoted and wise parents . A child can not be left to govern itself until it has learned experience , wisdom ; until its muscles are strong enough to carry it and its knowledge wide enough to guide it . A child can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not walk until it has learned to stand . Alaska has had a magnificent history of adventure and courage . The years to come may be even more magnificent . This vast northern empire , now a Territory struggling toward manhood among the family of the United States , will some day achieve that adult goal , and will stand forth , a great state among great states  --  one of the greatest , in my humble opinion , if it is allowed to mature . But that time should not be forced by men  --  yes , and women , too  --  whop103would try to use this glorious Territory for their own profit . If properlyguided , however , by a benevolent and wise father  --  " " But , Papa ! " shouted a great resonant voice from the crowd in the doorway . " I 'm over fifty years old , I know the facts of life , I want to live before you kill me with the greed you call paternalism . " " Oops ! Here we go ! " said Ott Decker . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I sort of hoped he would n't , this time . " But her face was brilliant with a smile of anticipation . Dave Husack faltered , stopped , he turned a look of outraged dignity upon Oscar Bogard . " Mr. Chairman ! " The faces of Oscar Bogard , Czar Kennedy , Dave Husack , Sid Kleet wore identical expressions of scowling resentment . They knew an old enemy . Only General Cass Baldwin and Wilbur K. Distelhorst seemed puzzled and uncomprehending . " Dad 's blood pressure , " Bay Husack said to Dina . There was a stir in the doorway . A towering figure came forward . Every head in the room swung toward him . " Excuse me , will you , if I interrupt for just a minute ? I have n't been asked to speak here today , and I 'm not going to make a speech . I just want to distribute a few copies of this week 's Northern Light . " " Now , Thor ! " Oscar Bogard remonstrated . " This is an outrage ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm Thor Storm carried a sheaf of newspapers , neatly folded . In a region of tall men his height was notable . The frame was big-boned , unburdened by fat . The hood of his parka was pushed back , its border of wolf formed a nimbus above the goldand-silverhair , the pink cheeks , the startlingly blue eyes . It might have seemed an almost cherubic face except for the eyes . There was nothing angelic about these as , moving swiftly , he placed a neat bundleof newspapers at the end of each long table . " Just pass these along , will you , one to a person ? " His manner was genial , his tone conversational , his enunciation curiously cultivated and charming . " It wo n't be news to you , Dave ; or you , Sid ; or you , Oscar ; and certainly not to you , Czar old pardner , as they used top104say in those Rex Beach books . But it will be news to the rest of you Chamber of Commerce people and all Alaska . You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Suddenly he stretched forward his great right arm , his forefinger pointing , he looked strangely like a prophet of old as he stood there . " Bayard Husack ! " he thundered . But this time it was Czar Kennedy who interrupted , his voice leisurely , almost purring . " Just a minute , Thor . I can have you arrested , you know , for causing a disturbance in a public place . " Thor Storm turned a beaming face toward Kennedy . " Will you do that , Czar ? " His tone now was earnest to the point of entreaty . " I 'd consider it a favor . Paul and Addie here would send it out A.P . and every newspaper in the United States would run it . Canada too . Do that , will you please , Czar , old pardner ? " " You 're getting senile , you know , " Czar observed , as though the two were engaged alone in a private bitter quarrel of long standing . " I could have you committed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story that would be ! What testimony I could produce , what witnesses I could call , what deeds I could unfold , what secrets I could relate ! " Oscar Bogard 's clashing of metal against glass as he attempted to restore order sounded like the efforts of a Swiss bell ringer . " Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! " He now thwacked the table with the flat of his hand . " This is not Alaska of the Nineties ! This is Alaska today . " He turned his gaze away from the offender . " General , my apologies . Commissioner , please believe that this is not the way Alaskans behave . We may be a little crude and even rough in ways , but our manners  --  " " Slaves ! " roared Thor Storm . " Worms ! Second class citizens of the greatest democracy in the world ! Voteless tax-paying men and women of Alaska , and your fathers and mothers before you for sixty years . Manners ! Manners ! Wholesale plundering by them for anotherfifty years , or freedom for you ! Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rustling like the sound of a sudden wind rushing through the leaves of a forest as the members of the Baranof Cham/ber of Commerce opened the pages of the weekly Northern Light and began to read . Chris Storm plucked her white parka from the back of her chair and came over to the patriarchal giant standing there , facing the room . She linked her arm through his , she looked up at him . " Let 's go now . You were wonderful , but you know the doctor said you were n't to get excited . Let 's go now . " Dina Drake had been concentrating on the application of a fresh coating of lipstick , her gaze intent on her own reflection in the tiny mirror . Now she glanced up . " What 's the matter ? Is he crazy or something ? " " Like a fox , " Bay Husack said . From the beginning no two men could have been moreunlike than Thor Storm and Czar Kennedy . Yet here they were in Baranof , the town to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other by unbreakable bonds of love and hate , of hardship shared , of common adventure , of family blood , of tragedy , and  --  strongest of all  --  by Christine Storm , their granddaughter . The intricate fabric of life that united these two septuagenarianswas now of indissoluble weave , light as the dry Baranof snow , strong as the sinew of a caribou . Together they had come to this weird wild land . They had planned and worked and fought together , each had been left wifelessand childless in young manhood , neither had remarried , each waged a silent persistent battle for the welfare  --  as they saw it  --  of the girl Christine . Each loved Alaska in his own way . Baranof had been their home for fifty years and more . They were a universe apart . Thor Storm still lived in a log cabin as he had in his virile twenties . It boasted electricity and plumbing of a sort now , but structurally it was basically unchanged . Baranof and the whole Territory respectedhim , admired him , were baffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not quite understand . Books . Always blatting about freedom and democracy . Well , hell , too much freedom here in Alaska if you ask me , the unknowing said . When tragedy came upon both men the town thought they would leave the North Coun/try to go back Outside , away from the sights and sounds that had so brutally twisted their lives . They had stayed . But Czar Kennedy  --  there was a man they could understand . A picturesque and romantic figure from youth to old age , he had a quiet word and a smile for everyone . To look at him , Baranof boasted , you 'd think he did n't have one penny to rub against another . In appearance a composite of Shakespearian character actor , way-down-East cracker-barrel philosopher , fresh-water college professor , with , perhaps , just a dash of Mississippi River gambler . From this mixture he emerged handsome , approachable , benign , somewhatscholarly . He never read a book . You sometimes saw him eating his breakfast at the drugstore soda counter , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best house in town , had that Swede Gus there could cook him anything he wanted for breakfast from fish to omelet . Sometimes he secretly paid for the breakfast of a boy or girl there at the counter , and he would vanish before they had finished their meal . " No charge , " the counterman would say to this one . " What do you mean , no charge ! You giving away this morning ? " " Party paid for your breakfast . Told me to say you 're his guest this morning . " This pleased and impressed some , but it rather annoyed others . Strangely enough  --  or perhaps not so strangely  --  the least solvent were the most annoyed . It downgraded them . " What does he think this is ! A Salvation Army soup kitchen ! Giving out with two bits to make himself feel good ? " One morning at eight o'clock Addie Barnett caught him at the coffee counter . It was Northern Light weekly press day , and she had been at the office since five A.M. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterman for Czar 's breakfast and had slipped away to station herself , unseen , behind the revolving bookrack . The counterman rather enjoyed going into the customary routine . In reverse , this time . " No charge , Mr. Kennedy . " " How 's that ? " sharply.  | " Party paid for your breakfast . Said you 're their guest this morning . " Rarely caught off guard , Czar now was in a temper . " You ca n't do that . I do n't like it , understand ! " " Oh ? Well , you do it . " " That 's different . " The counterman was a newcomer to Baranof . " Yeah ? How do you figure that ? " Addie Barnett ran the story in next week 's Northern Light . The two old men had been young vital men when first they had met so casually aboard the battered argosy that dumped them on Alaska 's gold-flecked sands . Tall tales of romance descriptive of vesselssuch as this were popular in the turn of the twentieth century . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Seattle toward the strait of Juan de Fuca , through days and white nights of wildly magnificent scenery . The black-mustached gambler with the diamond shirt stud , the rugged woodsman with heart of gold and muscles of iron , the hero of the cool head and the hot passions  --  all the stereotypes of fiction  --  were missing . This boatload of adventurers headed for Alaska in derby hats and decent baggy-kneed suits and starched white collars . They were , for the most part , as unequipped as infants to battle the wilds that loomed ahead . Shoe salesmen , teachers , doctors , lawyers , small mechanics , clerks , bookkeepers , urged by the hunger for gold rather than by the spirit of adventure ; farmers , some of them , weary of endless chores , poor crops , capricious weather . They were dazzledby the rainbow rumors that , four decades earlier , had lured their hardier forebears out of the eastern and midwestern States , over prairies and plains to the hills of California . Even the dozen or so women in The Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore no resemblance to the frolicsome females of dance-hall fiction . They were deep-bosomed firm-fleshed women of almost matronly aspect . They had a look of robust health , as well they might , considering the bizarre pioneering they were to encounter . They were entering Alaska as members of the Oldest Profession . They were to becomep109familiar enough with the sight of calloused male hands joggling mooseskin sacks filled with golden nuggets or yellow dust ; pokes , these were called , and they made a pleasant sound as they were tossed , plumply , on a table or bar or bed . But eggs were a dollar each  --  if you could get one . A decade , two decades later  --  and certainlytoday  --  you were to see many of these gay girls magically transformed into wives and mothers , erring perhaps a little too much only on the side of respectability ; officially presiding at club meetings , Sourdough gatherings , church-benefit suppers , arriving at these fiestas proudly bearing their contribution of a baked ham , or a meat loaf , or a devil's-food cake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shipboard , bound for the golden shores , they were an almosttouching sight in their unnautical garments ; trailing skirts , vast leg-o ' - mutton sleeves , ruffled jabots , flower-laden hats , veils , kid gloves . You expected to see an incongruous parasol unfurled on a sunny deck corner , and , in fact , a girl whose delicate complexion was one of her trade assets did just that one day without causing any comment . Through bits and snatches of Bridie Ballantyne 's reminiscence and chatter Chris Storm had learned much about the lively doings of these early Alaska girls . Thor and Czar had told her little of them , not so much through a prim sense of what was seemly for a teen-age grandchild , as because of the fact that the two men themselves had had as little as possible to do with the so-called dance-hall girls , either now on shipboard or later , on land . For the benefit of posterity Bridie should have talked into a tape recorder . There were no tape recorders in Baranof , so Bridie talked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine . " Men , " Bridie Ballantyne said , reflectively . " Men men men . There 's always been too many of them here in Alaska . In comparison , that is . " " Are there ? " Chris had said , rather naively , at sixteen . " Are there ? I 'd never noticed . " " You 'll notice when you get to Seattle , all right . Not that you wo n't always have plenty of beaux . Anywhere . But here there 's never beenp110enough women to go around , always twenty men to every woman and I guess that gave us a puffed-up notion of our importance . Not that I had an easy time of it when I came here , a girl . Easy ! I thought I 'd die . But the most of the men here were over-polite then , and are to this day  --  to the women , I mean . Those days , next to gold , and maybe food and drink , why , women were the most precious article , you might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside . Outside it 's more women than men . Any woman , those days in Alaska , who was n't cross-eyed , pockmarked and mustached , was precious . Come to think of it , even that did n't stop Ideal Hackers . And it 's a living description of Ideal . " " What a name  --  Ideal ! Was that really her name ? " " Ida . She was one of the girls on the Line , she was so downright scrambled-looking they nicknamed her Ideal . " " That was mean . " " No , she loved it . Eyes , complexion , mustache and all , she could have had her pick of a dozen men . I heard she was bowlegged in the bargain , but lucky for her women wore long skirts those days , trailing the mud and the dust and the snow , whichever . " " What happened to her , poor thing ? " " You do n't have to be weeping for Ideal . She married Hermie Hackers and settled down to housekeeping , smug as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the copper crowd around 1906 . Now Ideal 's a widow , lives in one of those Nob Hill hotels in San Francisco , a whole suite , they say her living room 's forty feet long with a view of the Golden Gate . She looks twenty years younger than she did fifty years ago . Got her eyes straightened when the money first began to pour in , got her skin peeled like a banana , got her face lifted and her mustache electrified off , I heard she even had her legs broken and reset , I would n't put it past her . I hear she calls Seattle the provinces . And Alaska ! Well , leave us not be sordid . " " I love to hear you talk about those days , " Christine said as she had a hundred times before . " It was n't so long ago , really , for all you 're only sixteen . " Bridie gazed at the girl , thoughtfully , lovingly . " I do n't know.  |p111Sometimes  I think maybe you 've been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , one pulling you one way , one heaving anotherdirection , it 's a wonder your arms and legs are n't out of joint , let alone your head . " " What 's wrong with me ! " the girl demanded , gaily . " I may not turn out to be the femme fatale that Ideal Hackers was but I 'm not so awful , am I ? " " Do n't be fishing for compliments , you wo n't get them from me . You 'll have to work a little harder for them in Seattle , too , so you might as well get used to it . Competition there , you 'll find . " " Darling Bridie , it 's too late for you to try to break me down . You three have been working like slaves to build me up ever since I was born . " " It 's terrible any more how pleased you are with yourself , these days . Still and all you 've come through these years pretty well , consideringyou 've been reared by three old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a wonder you did n't turn out unbearable . Next thing you 'll be what Thor calls a rounded character . I hope not . Everybody ought to have anyway one slab side . " The three had given her all they had . From Thor she had absorbed a knowledge of the humanities ; the habit of reading , a feeling for nature and for history . From him , too , she had learned to use her mind and her muscles ; practical things such as cooking , and how to handle a gun ; later , how to set a stick of type in the gritty little print shop of the Northern Light . Czar , in benevolently practical terms  --  or so it seemed  --  stressed the value of money , of power , of position , of security . To Christine he imparted surprisingly cynical advice . " Making friends of people like those will never get you anywhere . " He might be speaking of Paul and Addie Barnett , or Ott Decker , or the young half-breed Eskimo , Ross Guildenstern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridie , but he was smart enough not to risk that . " I do n't want them to get me anywhere . I just love them . " " That 's a childish way to talk . "  | " I do n't choose friends , " she said , very grand , " for what they can do for me . " He could have said , If it were n't for me you 'd be nobody , if it were n't for my money and my connections and my brains you 'd be behind the counter in the Five-and-Dime at best . But he was too canny for that . He had his plans for her , as clear-cut as the blueprintsby which he had achieved the Kennedy Block , the Baranof Daily Lode , the Ice Palace . " You 're going to meet people who are people . Not riffraff nobody knows about . You know some of them already . Dave Husack and his wife . And Sid Kleet . You 'll meet the cream . " Then , mildly , almost as an afterthought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She laughed then , and came over to him and hugged him , her fresh young cheek against the lined one . " You 're an old-fashioned darling . You 're not trying to marry off your granddaughter to the Seattle rich and mighty , are you , Gramp ? " " He can have his pick of any girl in Seattle . Or New York or Washington , for that matter . You 'll be lucky if he takes you to the drugstorefor a Coke . " " I do n't like Cokes , " Chris retorted , somewhat maliciously . Curiously enough , it was from Bridie as well as from Thor that the girl had got her sense of history , her feeling for background , for beginnings . Few young people had it , but then , few girls , as Bridie succinctly put it , had three old crocks instead of a young father and mother to bring her up . It was from Bridie , too , as well as from Thor , that she had got a sense of comradeship with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and its people had somehow , paradoxically , been responsible for this . Every matron in Baranof attempted to have a hand in the girl 's upbringing ; and certainly every unattached widow or spinster , with an eye out for the widowered Thor or Czar , yearned over her . But it was Bridie who took over , Bridie was for Chris her Juliet 's Nurse , social guide and fashion mentor . It was Bridie who said , " I do n't care what the other kids are doing , you 'll wear your fur parky as long as it 's zero . Now do n't make me have to tell your grampas. "  |p113Later  , as Chris approached young womanhood , Bridie brought her taste in dress to bear on the girl 's problems . " Your coloring , yellow hair and black eyes , you can wear anything , I suppose ; only can you ? Because what goes with your hair would fight your eyes . The thing that saves you is your complexion . By rights you ought to be sallow , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! You 're a blonde and a brunette and whatever they name in between . Blue is a good color for you , you can wear pink , too , and green and even yellow though I would n't advise it , hair or no hair . If you 're sunburned your black eyes will make you look native . And if you 're too pink and white your yellow hair will kind of wash out . You 've got your work cut out for you the rest of your life , Chris , dressing . " Perhaps if all historical data of the past half century in the Alaska Territory had been lost , swept from memory and from record , leavingThor Storm , Czar Kennedy , Christine Storm , and this Bridie Ballantyne only , there might still have emerged from these informal records a fairly comprehensive history of the manners and mores and events of the time and place . Occasionally , in her childhood , Chris had burst into rebellion against the three middle-aged guardians of her life . But when she rejected them she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three against the other two . She had been a small girl when first a playmate in the course of a squabble had confronted her with the ultimate threat . " I 'll tell my mother on you . " " I 'll tell my Grampa Thor on you , then . " " Pooh , who 's afraid of him ! " " I 'll tell Grampa Czar . " " Nobody 's afraid of grampas . " " I 'll , " summoning her last defense , " I 'll tell Bridie . " " She ai n't your mother . She ai n't anybody 's mother . You have n't got a father or a mother or anything . " Shocked , Chris rallied all her forces , the black eyes glaring , the pink cheeks scarlet . " Is that so ! I 've got Grampa Thor and Grampap114Czar , they 're better than anybody , they 're better than anybody 's mother , and I 've got Bridie . And Alaska . I 've got Alaska . " " Alaska ? " Puzzled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and I 'm Alaska history . " Stunned , the other regarded a moment the wild-eyed infuriated little figure of her antagonist . Then , " You 're crazy , " she announced , decisively , and ran home . In her childhood she was a question-asker , as were most children of her age , but in her case the custom burgeoned into a habit that sometimes irritated Bridie and enraged Czar . Thor encouraged it . " When you do n't know a thing  --  ask . I 'll always answer if I can . " She had been fascinated by the story of Bridie 's arrival in Baranof so many years ago . At twelve , through a series of questions , Chris dug to the core of this situation . " That place where you nursed the ladies that were sick with smallpox  --  whywas it called the All Nations ? " " The people who lived there came from different countries , I guess . Or , claimed they did . " " You said they were all ladies living at the All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . " " Why ? Was it a boardinghouse just for ladies ? " " Kind of . " " Were they married and did they have children ? " " Well , no . No , they did n't . Were n't . " " Why not ? " " You ask too many questions for a little girl . " " That 's what you say when it 's something you do n't want to answer . I 'll ask Grampa Thor . " " No . No , I would n't do that . He 's busy . " " He says he 's never too busy to answer my questions . " " There 's things you 're not old enough to understand . " " If they were n't married and did n't have husbands did they work to earn money ? "  | " In a way . Now run along and do n't bother me , ca n't you see I 'm busy ! Children your age have lots of time to learn things later . " " Did they earn money at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic methods that , a quarter of a century later , psychiatrists were to put into general use . " They lived there and kept people company  --  lonely people  --  men who had n't got their families with them , their wives and children and so on , and were working the creeks for gold , those days . " " Did they love them ? " " Did who love who ? " " Did the ladies at the All Nations love the men who were lonely . " Bridie started as though some one had jolted the chair in whichshe was sitting . After a moment she said , quietly , " In a way . " " Well , if they loved them why did n't they marry them ? " " Sometimes they did . " " If they did n't marry them did they pay them for loving them ? Is that the reason they earned money ? " " Yes . And that 's just about enough from you . Who do you think you are , a schoolteacher or something , questions questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the back of my hand . " " When I grow up nobody will have to pay me for loving them . I 'll love them for nothing . " To compensate , the three saw to it that her parka was of the finest pelts , its hood faced with wolf ; her dresses , often as not , ordered from Seattle . Bridie , through the years , had achieved a great reputationfor style . Fond Baranof said that Bridie Ballantyne was the Ten Best-Dressed Women in Alaska . Best-Dressed Member of the City Council . Best-Dressed Alaska Public Relations . Best-Dressed  --  uh  --  Mature Type . Best-Dressed Candidate for the Legislature . BestDressedAlaska Pioneer and Sourdough . And so on . Even in her later years Bridie 's neatness never was besmirched like the food-stained bosoms of the elderly whose spots were decked with an unavailing facade of chains , beads and brooches . " There never was a diamond big enough to cover a grease spot , " she saidp116in one of her sententious moments . " Even if you ca n't see the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neat , " Bridie counseled the girl . " That 's all there is to it . I learned that when I was student nurse in the Old Country , and in Seattle . You know the way young nurses always look pretty . Specially to men 's way of thinking . Half the time they 're plain as posts , but you get white or blue-and-white up under the face , and put plenty of starch in it so it rustles and smells fresh , and a broad stiff apron band that makes the waist look tiny , why , you 'd give off the effect of spring flowers in a paper frill . Neat does it , before style or richness , to my way of thinking . " So now , when Bridie said , " That dress is tacky , " Chris discarded it . When Czar said , " That boy acts all right , but he 'll never amount to anything , " she was likely to defend him , though doubting her own sense of values . Thor said , " Read that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Hamilton , and always will be . He thought of the United States in terms of people , not as an example of the capitalistic system . They were both right , but people are more important than any system . " She won the negative side of the Baranof College Forum debate on " Would Hamilton Have Been a Better President Than Jefferson ? " It spoke well for the three , and for Christine 's disposition and strength of character , that she did not emerge as an insufferable example of overconfidence . She had been president of her class at Baranof ; voted the most popular girl on the campus ; best-dressed co-ed ( she wore clothes identical in style with those of the other girls , but the effect was , somehow , distinctive ) ; the recipient of a half-dozen invitations to every social or athletic affair from ice hockey to the annual prom . Frequently , in the course of growing up , she deliberately or involuntarilyacted against the judgment or the wishes of one or two or even all three of her mentors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when such behavior came up for discussion . " Leave her alone . She 'll learn that way . "  |p117Of  all the passengers on the scabrous vessel that hadshoved off from Seattle , Alaska-bound , probably the only two who had themselves in hand , who knew the plan they definitely would follow , once ashore , were the Norwegian Thor Storm and the New Englander Zebedee Kennedy , whose far background was Scotch-Irish . These two had not been dazzled by mad stories of gold lying like pebbles strewing the Bering Sea shores at Nome , or the creeks of Baranof ; or forming chunks in the Fairbanks or Juneau lodes . They had come together on deck one evening after the greasy supper . The other passengers were swarming inside the ship 's shabby saloon , drinking , shouting , stamping to the whine of harmonicas or intent on the shuffle and slapslap of grimy playing cards . There the air was malodorous with smoke , food fumes , unwashed bodies and the acrid smell of unspoken fear and apprehension , the effluvia one encounters in courtrooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and quiet on deck . Each had marked the other before meeting . They were set apart from the rest in bearing , in the light of intelligent purpose that was reflected in their faces . They wore a confident and resolved expression , quite different from the nervously grimacing features and the feverishly glittering eyes of the other men . Each had recognized in the other the unusual , the purposeful . The man who was to be known as Czar Kennedy saw with the shrewd eyes of the born trader , the canny commercial opportunist . Thor Storm looked out at the worldp118through the eyes of the natural student of the humanities , his gaze colored  --  and perhaps handicapped  --  by love , compassion and curiositytoward the human race . Both were tall men , but Thor Storm towered above Kennedy , his was the physique of a giant , but without the giant 's usual pinhead . Kennedy , slighter in build , seemed almost fragile beside him . The casual observer would have mistaken Kennedy for the scholar , the thinker , with those curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square punishing jaw . The thick crown of black hair was worn longer than ordinarily , and it had a natural wave . In later years , as he turned into his fifties , and the wavy black locks were powdered with white at the temples and the forelock , he took on an almost poetic look , with a touch of the ham actor . Thor Storm , with those great shoulders , the merry eyes , the pink cheeks , the yellow hair that seemed almost to sparkle , appeared the man of physical action and material mind . Nature had played a trick on both these men , and on the world in which they functioned . Now the two young strangers stood at the boat rail , mysteriously drawn together by a magnetic force that was to bind them for life . They seemed to be gazing at the almost shockingly magnificent view of water and snow-capped mountains and sunlit north night sky . Each saw the other out of the corner of the eye . Kennedy 's coat collar was turned up against the fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , the charmer , spoke first , he flung an arm in exposition of the splendors before them . " I bet you never saw anything like that beforein broad daylight at ten o'clock at night . " " Great mountains like these , no . But daylight at night , yes . " " How 's that ? " " I was born in the North Country . " " You mean here ! " " No . Not here . " Piqued , Kennedy pressed on . " I suppose you 're hell-bent for gold , like the rest of those fools in there ? " He jerked a thumb in the di/rection of the lights , the shouts , the music . As the man did not reply at once to this blunt question Kennedy added , hastily , " No offense meant . They seem a poor lot , those in there . " " Perhaps not as lacking as they seem . They must have courage of a sort , or they would n't be here . I suppose you could say that of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ! They 're dissatisfied and want something better  --  freedomor land or peace or money . The early ones crossed the sea to Massachusetts or Virginia , the later ones crossed the continent to California or Oregon . They started because they were dissatisfied or curious or ambitious or adventurous . The frightened and the cautious stayed behind , even if they were dissatisfied . And they let the world roll over them . We 're all different in the same way  --  you and I and those men  --  and even those women , too  --  or we would n't be here . " " Do n't lump me in with that parcel . They 're after gold . You get bit by that craze it is n't courage drives you . It 's a kind of  --  he searched for the word  --  " a kind of frenzy takes hold of you . Now , you do n't look like that , wild-eyed . " " No , I 'm not after gold . " Again the silence . " What then ? " Persistence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thor Storm looked down at the water churning below , and then up at the Northern sky so strangely bright above them at this night hour . " New strange people . New adventure . New discovery . Like my ancestors who discovered America . " " You do n't look like an Italian , or talk like one . " " I was born in Norway . My people for cen  --  all my people have been Norwegian . " " Well , say , Columbus discovered America , any kid knows that . He was Italian . " " The Norsemen touched here long before Columbus . And the Eskimos were here before that . But it does n't matter . If you think those men in the saloon are fools I suppose you 're not looking for gold , either . " His accent was almost pure Oxford English.  |p120This  unconscious elegance of speech . irritated Kennedy into a boasting loquacity unusual in his canny pattern of behavior . " Not me ! I 'm too smart for that . Let them freeze in the wilderness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's gold , anyway ! " Thor Storm turned to look at this man , then , deliberately . He smiled a little . " Gold is a soft metal chemically formed in the earth . It is n't as beautiful as quartz or common mica or even copper . But there 's less of it and it 's more difficult to find , and nations have made it the medium of exchange . If they decided on coal , for example , or oyster shells , or coral , then those would have been precious . Like wampum used by the North American Indians . " " You sound like a smart fella , " Kennedy said , grudgingly . " No , I 'm not what you would call smart . I 'm only intelligent . " " Well , I am . I 'm smart . " Curiously , there now was no note of boasting in his voice . It was said as a simple statement of fact . " I 'm headed for the camp they call Baranof . They say that 's the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin you alive and throw your bones into the Bering Sea . Baranof I hear they 've put up wooden houses and a land office and a bank and there 's talk of running a any sense out of what you said  --  new people  --  new discovery . Where 's the money in that ? " " No money . " " Then I ca n't figure it . You one of those scientific fellas looking for the North Pole ? " " No . " Zebedee Kennedy was angry now , his hands gripped the rail , he spoke very quietly as always when he was at high emotional pitch . " You murdered somebody ? " Thor Storm laughed then , a great rich rollicking laugh that boomed on the clear air and echoed from the menacing whitecappedmountains . He put a hand on Kennedy 's shoulder  --  an incongruoushand for a man of his build  --  long-fingered , sensitive , the hand of generations of aristocrats . " No , I am not a murderer running from justice . I 'm here becausep121there 's never been anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roamed the world through the centuries for plunder and for land and for adventure . Europe and Asia and Africa and America North and South . Just a few years ago Oregon and Washington and California . But those were warm and lovely lands . Sun and rich valleys . But this ! This is as it was when the world began , when it was just made . It is like being at the beginning of the world . You wait . You 'll see . " " Say , you wait a minute , will you ! Just a minute . I 'm not figuring on any place that 's like the beginning of the world . I 'm going to fetch up in a town . A town with a future . " " The future there can be anything you want to make it . It can be a model for civilization . There is Alaska , raw as the day the world was born . The Russians have been there maybe a hundred years or so , but they have n't made a mark . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're in on it the day after Creation . Like gods . It 's all there , waiting for the work of our hands "  --  he hesitated a moment then finished , almost shyly  --  " and our spirits . " Now there was something of distrust and disappointment in the narrow look with which Kennedy regarded his deck companion . " Your collar 's turned the right way , but you sure talk like a preacher . " A quarter of a century later they could laugh about it , ruefully . A hundred times Kennedy had said , almost nostalgically , " Do you recall that night out on deck ? A pair of babes , for all we knew what we were up against . Even you , with all your books . " " We were better off than the others , " Thor reflected . " We did n't just stay in Alaska because we had nothing we wanted to go back to . We were both crazy about it in a queer way . And we were both doing what we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered old boat , Thor Storm had known that everything in those next decades in Alaska would be larger than life , out of drawing , fantastic , so that the reasoning mind rejected it while actually living it . He had tried to convey something of this to his fellow passenger.  |p122But  Kennedy , a realist , was not possessed of imagination . He was merely , as he said , smart , with an almost prescient sense of material values . " This whole thing , " Thor now persisted , and swept the air with one great arm that included the ship , its passengers , the overpoweringmountains , the sea , the endless sky and the singularly vital air , " this whole thing is ridiculous . " Kennedy stared at him , suspecting a joke he did not understand . " How d' you mean ? " " It 's ridiculous to happen in a civilized country like the United States in the twentieth century . People rushing in and grabbing whatever they want . For two hundred  --  three hundred  --  five hundredyears or nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder it has survived . But it has . Now they 're swarming into this wildernesslike the Spaniards into Mexico , like the forty-niners into California , like the Sooners into Oklahoma . It 's the last of it , I think . There can be no more unless someone discovers a new continent , or the day comes when we can somehow reach the other planets . " " Looks like you know an awful lot about this country , and all  --  about the United States , I mean  --  that is , for a foreigner . " " Everyone in the United States is a foreigner , or the son or grandsonor great-grandson or great-great-grandson of a foreigner . Everyoneexcept the red Indians , and , in Alaska , the Eskimos . All the others are foreigners . " " Say , " Kennedy drawled , amused , " you go to calling those men in there foreigners to their faces , why , you 're liable to get yourself into a hell of a brannigan , puny-looking as they are . " " I 'm glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , Kennedy had been listening . The veiled eyes were lifted now to Thor 's earnest face . " Well , anyway , I know that each of us alone is bigger than any two of them in there , together . And not only size . I 've been thinking that , smart as I am , and you with your special education , why , we might think of workingtogether , like . Maybe not pardners , exactly . But working to-gether. "  | " What makes you think I 've had a special education ? " " The way you talk . I 've heard Boston talk , and New York , too , but you do n't talk like an American , or a Swensky either , even if you are . It 's more what they call an English accent , is n't it ? Special . " " My t  --  that is , I had an English teacher , perhaps I imitated him . " He had almost said , My tutor was an Oxford man . He led the subjectaway from himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska , you and I , with these other men . What makes you feel you are smarter than they ? Probably you are . But why do you think so ? " " Because they 're going to work themselves to the bone scratching crumbs of gold out of the ground , and I 'm going to get it away from them , in comfort , by selling them the thing they 'll need and want . Not little piddling things . Big . They 'll need boats to get up the rivers  --  sizable boats , I mean  --  and I 'm going to get hold of a boat and maybe run it . My folks back east were seafaring men . These ninnies yelling their lungs out in there "  --  he jerked his head toward the crowded saloon  --  " they 'll have to have places to live in , wagons for hauling , I bet there is n't a horse in all Alaska . I 've already got connectionsin Seattle . Let those poor suckers in there dig the gold . I 'll get it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not talking about . " The fair-haired giant looked at him then long and steadily . " Women ? I hear they 're scarce , too , up there . Scarcer than almost anything else needed . These girls on board were congratulating themselves . " " I 'm no pimp . I 'll make my pile and get out , but I 'll make it fair and square enough . Everything legal . " Everything legal . Years later Thor Storm sometimes recalled this phrase with wry amusement . And , he told himself , it was . Even if Czar and the Big Boys had to make the law themselves and lobby it through Congress under their own steam . Now , standing there at the ship 's rail , he said , " I see . It sounds a practical scheme . " " Damn right it 's practical . I 'm not just going it blind . " " You say you 'll make your pile and get out . If it 's money you'rep124after  --  and nothing else  --  I would n't get out too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska . It may be as big as all Europe . It 's like a seventh continent . I 'd say that gold is the least important productthey 'll take out of it . There are precious and valuable things in Alaska  --  furs and metals and coal and timber . And fish . " " Fish . " Kennedy 's tone was contemptuous . But Storm was paying little attention to the man beside him , he seemed to be ruminating aloud . " Of course Bering was a Dane , though the Russians financed his voyage . What a voyage , poor man . But Steller , the botanist , the ornithologist  --  he was the first white man actually to set foot in Alaska . Did you know that ? Most people do n't . " " No , ca n't say I did , " Kennedy replied because it seemed expected of him . The fella was kind of cracked , after all . " It 's true . He was nine months on Bering Island , for example , and of course he was on Kayak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy conceded , politely . " Do you know , " Storm continued , absorbed in his topic , " how Steller proved that Alaska was part of America , part of the North American continent ! " " Ca n't say I do , exactly . " He wished himself out of it by now , castingan almost wistful eye toward the noisy saloon . " How was that ? " " The bluejay . " " How 's that again ? " " The bluejay . Steller knew that the eastern bluejay and the westernbluejay were to be found nowhere but in the Western Hemisphere . And be actually saw one and shot it and examined it . It 's in his diary and there is his magnificent book De Bestis Marinis publishedin 1751 . What wonders that book revealed ! Would you believe that until that time the world actually never had heard of the sea otter , the sea lion , and the fur seal ! " " That a fact ! " " That news alone brought the Russian fur hunters in droves to Alaska . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sea cow ! That was the real Steller triumph . What about the sea cow ! "  | " Yeh . Sure . The sea cow . " Kennedy shook his head placatingly . The feller was crazy as a coot . He began to edge toward the saloon and safety . " But that 's all in the past , " Storm went on , his tone regretful . " They 're almost mythical animals now , except the fur seal . Man 's greed destroyed these magnificent and valuable creatures years ago . " " Damn shame . Well , kind of chilly out here , guess I'll --  " " And now the real gold in Alaska  --  do you know where that is ? " Kennedy had turned away . But something in the man 's earnestface and manner cautioned him to wait and hear . " Where 's that at ? " " The rivers . The inlets . The bays . There are millions and millionsthere , waiting to be discovered . " His words were exciting but histone was quiet , thoughtful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back to the giant . " Gold in the rivers , huh ? Anybody knows that . Rivers and creeks . This feller Steller write something special about that , did he ? In his book  --  De Something ? " " Not gold . Fish . " " Fish ! " Kennedy yelled , in disappointment and anger . " That 's the dumbest joke I ever did hear . I do n't need any dumb Swede to tell me there 's fish in Alaska . " Storm seemed not to have heard . " Millions of fish , " he repeated , musingly . " Salmon . Millions and millions of salmon , enough to supplythe world . For years and years and years . And timber . And coal . And metals . Those are the things to make Alaska a place of permanentvalue . Long after this little gold rush , as they call it , is over , those still will be there . Basic industries to make an empire out of a wilderness . " Kennedy thought ( with one small part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those Fourth of July orators back home . But he no longer felt chilly . He stared hard into the man 's face , his own face tense . He tried to be casual . " Yeah ? What else besides ? " " Land , I suppose . Town land in a new world like this . "  | " Take a lot of money  --  fish canneries , timbering , real estate . " " I do n't know about that part of it . I only know what I know . You said you had  --  what was that word ?  --  connections  --  you said you had important connections in Seattle . Perhaps they would furnish the money . " Kennedy coughed a little preliminary cough . " We been standing here , gabbing , I did n't even tell you my name . Kennedy is my name  --  Z. Kennedy . Stands for Zebedee , out of the Bible . Zeb , everybody calls me . Pardon me being blunt , but I do n't make you out , exactly . You talk like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a man of education and so on . Next minute you 're an explorer like Columbus or the Vikings . I only went through sixth grade but I know about the Vikings , a little anyway . You got the yellow hair , but you 're lacking the helmet and spear and so on . I do n't believe I got your name , sir . " " My name is Storm . Thor Storm . Thor after one of the Vikings , you know . Remember ? " " Pleased to make your acquaintance . " His right arm extended , the two men clasped hands . " You sure appear to know a lot about Alaska . " " It is n't what I know . That is n't much . It 's what I feel . This can be Valhalla . We can be gods . " Kennedy began to look uncomfortable again . " Well , I do n't know 's I want to be any god , exactly . I just figure to make my pile and get out . " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay and make this a proud place . It 's a proud place already  --  the native Indians and the Eskimos . " " Now wait a minute . They 're nothing but savages . Dirty savages . " " The Eskimos are a civilized and resourceful people . They do not fight wars , they do n't kill one another . They share . " " Civilized ! " " Well , perhaps not in our way . In their own way . And how civilizedare we , after all ? " Kennedy now laughed , disarmingly , his manner was open andp127friendly , his eyes were cautious , speculative . " That 's what I always say . Uh , by the way , for all our talking here , and it 's been darn interesting to hear you go on , I do n't know yet what you do . For a living , I mean . What 's your line of work ? Back home , I mean . " " I fish . " Then , at the look of blank disappointment amounting almost to shock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come of sea people . Like yourself . And chiefly I study about people and places , their background and their life today because of that background . And then I write about them . " " Write ! Books , you mean ! " " I 've written one . Nobody much read it , the first one . I hope to write another someday . " " Write about this , you mean ? Alaska and so on ? The gold rush ? " " That 's only a small part of it . An incident , really . Now , the Eskimos --  " But this was too much . Huffily , and with haste , Kennedy began to backtrack . " Books and Eskimos , they 're not in my line . What you said about millions of salmon in the rivers  --  and coal  --  and metals  --  and so on  --  that 's different . That 's likely to be important . If you know , that is . " Craftily he tried to gauge this man whose inner quality eluded him . And was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vikings and his fish , or did he know ? If he actually could prove this knowledge , then what was the basis of the future relation between the two ? Quite simply Storm said , " I know this region , though I never have seen it . " Suspiciously , " How 's that ? " " There are records and early histories , there are scientific books in the libraries and archives of many cities  --  Copenhagen and St. Petersburg and New York and others . " " You 've seen those ! " " Yes . " " When ? " " When I was sixteen  --  eighteen  --  twenty  --  all my life . " " You must have had money to travel and jaunt around like that.  |p128Archives  . " To this the man said nothing . Kennedy 's face hardened . " I want to know just where I stand , " he said . It was to become a business slogan with him , a safety catch used through future decadesin all the preliminaries to his plans and schemings . " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll want your share of anything comes out of this . If we go in business together , that is . " Hastily added . " Business ? " Thor Storm shook his head , a look of amusement lighting his face . " Business is not for me . I know nothing of business . " " But you just said . Damn it , you said you knew where things could be found . " " I do . I can tell you . I can tell anybody . " " No ! " Kennedy yelled . " Me ! Tell me ! " Thoughtfully , and  --  to Kennedy , maddeningly  --  he presented his terms . " All these things  --  all the riches of this great rich Alaska region  --  mustbe put to the good of the region itself . Not like the history of other parts of the United States in the old days . They grabbed and they schemed and they kept it for themselves  --  the land and the metals and the forests and the streams . This time , the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . All of them . " Kennedy stared at the man Thor Storm , at the guileless face , the quiet eyes . Something in their gaze caused him to shift his own eyes . He laughed , then , a little short bark of discomfiture which he hastily tried to change into a cough . " Well , sure . That 's the way to look at it . " Desperately now he persisted . " We could make a go of it together . After all , you have to use money , same as everybody . Like you said , it 's the medium of exchange . I do n't want to lose track of you . Where you heading in , exactly ? " " Baranof , like you . As a base , at least . Then out from there , up and back and around , as far as I can go . " " Baranof . " Zeb Kennedy let out a great breath , smiling . His shouldersthat had been hunched and tensed , relaxed . " Now , about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fish and coal alone , they add up to food and fuel . Everybody needs food and fuel , everywhere . "  | " And friends , " Thor added . His smile , for the first time , was quizzicallyamused . He put forward his great hand . " Luck to you , " he said . " And hoping you will make that pile  --  as you say  --  whether boats or houses or gold or fish . But for the common good . That is the only share I want in it , " It was the beginning of their half century of friendship and enmity.  |p130Bridie  Ballantyne had been the first picture bride to cometo Baranof . Perhaps this was because Baranof , from the beginning , had taken on a definitely solid aspect . Other settlements  --  Nome , Ketchikan , even Juneau  --  had had a wilder history . It was as though Baranof , and Baranof 's early sourdoughs , sensed that this was to develop into a substantial town . Her coming had been the result of a joke fundamentally more stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetrated it belonged to a lesser layer of the town 's citizenry in those early days . Drunk when the joke was devised , they were mildly resentful of the already successful Czar Kennedy . Probably they never would have conceived this jest if both Czar and Thor had not , each in his own way , been unique . " Who does he think he is ! " a prospector might say , after his fourth drink . " Keeping to himself , so high and mighty . We 're not good enough for him . Even the girls ai n't good enough for him . Him and that big Swede , too . Who do they think they are , anyway ! " " You 're just sore because your claim dribbled out on you , " a more reasoning one would say . " Why do n't you do like Czar does ? Use your head . " " Czar Kennedy , he uses everybody 's head , " the disgruntled one announced with a flash of drunken clarity . " Everybody he meets , he picks their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cobras do n't pick brains . Leastways , if they did they 'd have a sorry meal off yours . "  | " Oh , so that 's the way it is ! You 're in Czar 's pay , the way a lot of them are . " " I 'm in nobody 's pay . I work my own claim . " " Yeah ? Well , maybe I 'm smarter than he is , some ways . Or you , either . " If Thor Storm and Czar Kennedy had been philanderers , or even fairly steady patrons of those early-day saloons and Line houses , lonely when alone , driven to the false comfort of drink or the fleetingsolace of the town women when oppressed , Bridie Ballantyne never would have known Alaska , much less become one of its most respected citizens . Czar and Thor took a drink now and then at the bar of the Rocker Saloon or the Poke of Gold . But it was known that they were not drinkers . They were polite and friendly toward the girls , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Creek Road . But no woman claimed them , the two stood apart . Both , to the other citizens of the haphazard town , came and went mysteriously . Baranof admired the two men , sometimes grudgingly . They sensed that in each there was something distinctive . " Not stuck up , though . I mean they do n't exactly act like they think they 're smarter than other people . " Then , wryly , " Say ! But they are , at that ! " Confined as the Baranovians were by barriers of mountains , water , trackless tundra and killing cold , everybody 's business was everybody'sbusiness . News traveled by what was called the mukluk grapevine . Mukluks are Eskimo boots of soft strong mooseskins , or caribou . News , then , that travels on foot , silently . They say they say they say . They tried to extract news of Czar from Thor , and to verify Thor 's puzzling pattern of life through Czar . Each was loyal to the other , though by now their differences were many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and process of thinking . The men were in direct antithesis . That crazy Swensky he goes off alone with his dog team up to the Eskimo villages , they say he learned to talk Eskimo , he writes pieces about them , they say when he 's up there he lives right in with them , dirt and all and eats the stinking stuff they eat , raw . Summersp132back here he goes out in the salmon season with the boat crews that bring in the big catch for the canneries , July and August . They say he works like that , summers , so he can do his writing , winters , real scientific writing . He 'll talk to you about it , if you come right out and ask him , but for all he 's so good-natured and all , why , you feel he 's kind of studying you , he kind of studies everybody , friendly , mind you , but there 's a look in his eyes like he is n't only listening to you , he 's storing away what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskimo girls but he is n't as big a fool as that , I mean he 's kind of crazy but he 's no fool . Leastways , he ai n't as crazy as all that . Any Eskimo will lend you his wife , anybody knows that , if that 's what you want . Thor Storm had been absent from Baranof for more than a year . Isador Raffsky , the fur trader from Oogruk , came down with the news . Authentic news . " The missionary minister of the Presbyterian mission up near Kotzebue married them in a regular church ceremony , right in the Mission Church . A year ago , almost . The baby has black hair and blue eyes . A boy . Christopher Storm his name is . " " So the girls around here were n't good enough for him , " the boys jeered . " He had to be choosy and get him a real select Eskimo squaw . Say , I always knew he was nutty , but I sure did n't think he was really crazy like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose , and expecting our womenfolks to call . " With a great show of casualness a questioner would approach Thor . " Have n't seen you for a coon 's age , Thor . You been away ? " " Yes . " " Far ? " " Any place is far in Alaska , is n't it ? " " I see Czar 's made another trip to Seattle and back . Way he goes Outside , you 'd think it was across the street . What 's he do so much in Seattle ? " " Business , I suppose . He 's a man of business , Czar . " " There was a fella here to see him last month , you were gonep133that time , too . Must have been one of those Seattle or San Francisco millionaires , he had a coat was fur-lined , and cloth on the outside , I guess the Eskimos are n't so dumb after all , that 's the way they fix their parkys . Anyway , one of the boys saw it , says it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And a gold watch chain this thick , you 'd think he was the one had struck Bonanza Creek . Know who he was ? " " No . Who ? " " I 'm not telling you , I 'm asking you . " " I do n't know . " " They say it is n't all business strictly with Czar , those trips Outside . I notice he do n't have much to say to the nice girls here in town , or the other kind either . They say he goes around with highclasssociety in Seattle and they say he 's making up to Einar Wendt 's daughter , the Tacoma lumberman . Lumber king , some call him . They say she 's real plain-featured . And no chicken . Still and all , I guess Czar knows what he 's after , he usually does . Like the fella says , you ca n't sometimes see the woods for the trees . They say he 's fixing to marry her . Is that right ? " " It sounds a practical plan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , no daughter of Einar Wendt is going to come to Alaska to live . Czar 'll have to settle down in Tacoma , for all he says Alaska is the only place for him . " In Czar 's presence , one of the men essayed a mild joke about this rumored courtship . Czar did not openly resent this , his face remained impassive , perhaps the cold blue-gray eyes became a degree more icy behind the screen of the long black lashes . A little later the joker found himself somehow in trouble . He had difficulty with his credit at the store . Big Lena , at the Nugget , treated him coldly , finally refused to have anything to do with him . Then an inexplicable dispute arose concerning his claim on Heekarree Creek . There was no proof that Czar had had anything to do with all this . But the disgruntled joker decided for himself . Two or three friends were told of his little plan  --  just enough to carry it through . Sober , they never would have started it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When , terrified by their own success , they tried to stop it , it was too late . They placed an advertisement in the Seattle Post . PICTURE BRIDEWill exchange letters and photos with young respectablesingle lady of good appearance who can stand up to adventure and maybe roughing it in Alaska with young gentleman of steady habits who wants a lifetime partner to share his poke of gold . No shady characters or fly-by-nights need apply . Object matrimony . Send photo . Life in Alaska healthy and has got a fine future . Address : P.O. Box 19 , Baranof , Alaska . They had a dozen replies , but they decided on Bridie 's because hers was the briefest , the plainest . Her letter was literate enough , but there was about it a simplicity that the jokers mistook for ignorance . She had been six months now in the United States ; the vast overpoweringsize of it had filled her with pangs of loneliness and even fright , courageous as she was by nature . More in a spirit of fun and adventure than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back by the return boat a photograph of the unknown Box 19 . Czar Thor , it said his name was . Queer enough name , Bridie thought . But the photograph banished any criticism of the name . The handsome , almost spiritual , face ; the magnificent eyes , the wavy hair , won the girl 's heart . This was romance . This was the Ameriky she had dreamed of when she had carried the heavyladentrays in noisome hospital corridors . She sent her photograph then , and a second letter . Looking at her picture  --  the honest eyes gazing straight out at you from the decentpurposeful face  --  and reading her simple , self-reliant letter  --  the pranksters found the situation less hilarious than they had expected . They had meant to show the picture , the advertisement , and thep135letters to Czar just to kid him a little in the presence of the boys and girls if they could catch him , some evening , at the Rocker or the Poke . But it did n't seem so funny now , and anyway Czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridie 's last letter created panic . She was coming . By the time this letter was received she would have left . In a handwriting that was dashing in a childlike way , she stated her facts . " . . . from Ireland to the hospital in Lancashire , and there I got my training and then to America and my cousin in this Seattle . . . . I thought I never would see the end of the way , days it was to cross this big land . . . job in the hospital here in Seattle but the training is different to what we get in the old country . . . this Alaska you hear nothing else these days only Alaska , it sounds a fine big place and I was always one for adventuring and new sights . . . . " " God Almighty ! " The joker who was reading this letter looked up at his fellow conspirators . " This one 's coming . She 's left . Boys , I 'm getting out of here until this blows over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , thank God , Czar ai n't here but he 'll be back maybe even by the time she . . . look , I 'm getting the hell out of here for a spell , anyway . Right now . " Bridie Ballantyne took the small sum she had somehow hoarded  --  the great heavy American silver dollars that , big and shining though they were , still seemed to buy so little in this hugeous west place Indian-named Seattle  --  pagan Indian images mind you , to be had in the shops down by the river . It was a staggering journey by boat , by train , by boat again . When first she had come to Seattle some of her old-world rosy coloring still bloomed in her cheeks . But before she left for Alaska , what with the hospital work , the preparations for the journey , and a clutch of doubt and fear at her vitals , she looked quite gray-faced as she came aboard . The suit she had managed to buy for the journey was just the latest thing in Seattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of satin banding from the knees to the hem . The bodice had the new leg-o ' - mutton sleeves and a high ruched collar . Therep136was a jacket too , mind you , of the same stuff as the dress , and its sleeves were even bigger than the bodice sleeves , as they had better be . Topping this splendor was an ulster with a good collar , it buttonedright up to the throat , warm brown-and-gray woolen stuff , no shoddy for Bridie Ballantyne ; and her hat was a broad-brimmed sailor sporting not a mere wing but an entire bird nesting in a sort of copse of flowers and shrubbery . Even in that day Bridie knew what the well-dressed woman was wearing . Her mother , back home in Ireland , had been a seamstress . In the dour Lancashire hospital of her student training days , beforeever she had set foot on the New World , she had bolstered her energy , her spirits , by singing a familiar song as she scrubbed and swabbed and emptied slops . Thousands of immigrant boys and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Liffey Banks , Your Mourne Waters wide , I 'm sailing for Ameriky , Whatever may betide . Whatever may betide . Well , good or bad , it was too late now , she told herself as , days later , she stepped off the boat . There was no one to meet her , scan the faces though she would . She clambered up the refuse-strewn beach to the main street of the town , a street of log cabins and tents . She stood a panic-stricken moment staring at mountains and water and sky . Seattle had accustomed her to the impact of lavish panoramas , but compared to this , Seattle was cosy . She lowered her gaze from the vast vision to the nearer sights . Sordid dwellings , dirt , bearded men . She never had seen a human settlementsuch as this . Up the travesty of a street there was a log house outside of which an American flag hung limply from a pole , for there was no wind . The sun was warm yet the air was cool and heady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right enough . People seemed to be coming in and out , a group of men in good cloth suits and derby hats stood outside , talking with serious faces , like men of businessp137and property , not roughs . She left her luggage there on the beach  --  the two old-country valises that held everything she possessed , includingher nurse 's uniforms . She clutched to one side a handful of skirt and petticoat to lift them out of the mud , but not so high as to show her ankles  --  she knew what was right and proper ; and mud would dry and could be brushed off with a whisk . She was reassured , as she plodded along , that everything  --  ulster , hat , gloves , high-buttoned shoes  --  all were as they should be . When she reached the place with the flag she hesitated . The men looked at her with interest , they seemed still to be discussing a topic of real importance and now it seemed to her that she herself was , incredibly enough , a possible part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held not only interest but conjecture . As Bridie stood , hesitating , uncertain , one of the men  --  an older man with a settled look about him , and some gray in his mustache  --  came toward her . " Are you the nurse , ma'am ? " he asked . Falteringly , " Yes , I 'm a  --  I 'm the nurse . " The man 's face cleared , he seemed almost to beam . Panic-stricken , she thought , But that ca n't be him , he does n't look like the picture , so old-looking , surely that ca n't be him . The man turned to the others , he waved a triumphant hand . " Here she is , boys ! " he shouted . " Here 's the nurse . " The other faces beamed , then . " What difference does it make , " she asked , almost resentfully , " that I 'm a nurse ? " The older man laughed at this , a little ruefully . " We 'd about given up , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nome , if you can call that nearby , but it got so we figured nobody would come , Seattle or anywhere , though we tried . Nobody would come on account it was smallpox . " " Smallpox ! " " Seven of them down with it now , two new ones at the All Nations , and Ideal at the Lucky Streak , her face 's a sight they say , like a red raspberry patch , and fever . " Now be looked at her as though for the first time , doubtfully . " You look young , " he said , " for a nurse.  |p138Doctor  's off up north . But I bet you know what to do for smallpox , first off . " " Balsam of Peru lotion , " she replied , automatically . " Balsam of Peru lotion . Apply to pustules . For relief . " " Sure thing ! " the man agreed , triumphantly . " That 's the stuff . The girls do n't want no men around  --  for a change . Not , " hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " jeered someone in the group . " Well , maybe you are , but Thor ai n't , " the man retorted . " Thor went and fixed them some tea and tried to help , did n't you , Thor ? " " Thor ! " Bridie repeated , stiff-lipped . She looked up at a giant of a man who now stepped forward from the crowd  --  a man well over six feet tall with a short golden beard and eyes that were different from the other men 's eyes , serious but friendly , too , and smiling . " Where is your luggage , miss ? " he said . His words and voice were different , too , something like that London doctor who had been head of the Lancashire hospital . Gazing at him Bridie gasped , " Are you English ! You did n't say you were English . " " Heh , Swensky ! Heh , Thor ! " a voice called . " You an English swell ? " Heedless of this , still gently smiling , the big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage if you 'll point it out to me . Possibly there may be a room for you at Mrs. Belcher 's boardinghouse , a respectableplace , I can assure you of that . But I 'm not sure she 'd want you there after you 've seen your patients . After all , Mrs. Belcher has two small children , it might be a risky thing --  " " Oh , no , no ! " she cried . " It 's a mistake ! " Soothingly , he went on , " If Mrs. Belcher objects , you can stay in my cabin and I 'll move in with someone else until it 's over . Czar 's moved out , anyway , it will be quite all right . " Desperately , she cried , " But you 're not him ! His name is Czar  --  wait a minute "  --  she groped in her reticule for the photograph and fished it out , her hands shaking  --  " Czar Thor , his name is . Mr. Czarp139Thor , Box 19 , Baranof , Alaska . I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not him ! " The big man took the photograph from her and gazed at it in silence . He looked down at the girl 's face upturned to his  --  the plain , fresh decent face upturned to him . One of the other men had peered over his shoulder . " Kennedy ! " the man yelled . " It 's Czar Kennedy ! " Then he , too , stared at her . " Why , say , miss , Czar 's left for Seattle and Tacoma to be married . He left on the boat last week . He 's married by now . " Years later , when Christine was a woman and the mother of children , Bridie still found herself answering the questions questions questions put to her by this insatiable lover of the always mysterious Alaska . Bridie could answer the questions freely and frankly now and she had miraculously retained , old as she was , the astringency , the piquancy of her verbiage . She loved to hear the ripple of Christine'ssudden laughter when the answer to a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that first day . Come , like a ninny , to marry a man who 'd never heard of me , and finding myself nursing a bunch of girls down with smallpox in a House . Not one of them died , I 'll say that for myself , but then they were a husky bunch , they had to be to stand this climate then , no conveniences . Conveniences ! Well , we wo n't go into that . A gold-rush camp , rough as a bear 's den . They were kind of like children , those girls . Their minds , I mean . Dullthinking , most of them . They 'd sit in their wrappers , afternoons , in the back yard , fenced in , it was , wearing Mother Hubbard wrappers , there was a hammock I remember , slung between two posts . They 'd wash their hair and fluff it out in the sun , summers . And the waiter  --  he was a Negro fella  --  he brought them beer and sandwiches on a tray , and they talked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , maybe , it was about the size of a handbill . Sometimes they played games , like little girls . I 've seen ' em play jacks , even , on the back steps , and fight over the little rubber ball . "  | " An easy life  --  for that day . " " A hard life . " " Bridie darling , do n't be offended  --  but were you ever  --  after all , you 'd been tricked into coming to Baranof  --  were you ever tempted to give up and go into one of the --  " " I was a nurse , " Bridie said , simply . " I never could understand why you did n't many either Grampa Thor or Grampa Czar  --  anyway , after both my grandmothers died or whatever it was . At least , I suppose Grampa Thor 's wife died , too . My other grandmother . Does n't it sound mixed up ! But anyway , why did n't you ? I 've seen those pictures of you , you were young and  --  and fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and direct . " " That was it , I guess . Straight and honest and direct . I do n't mean to sound crabby . Truth was , I was in love with both of them , it sounds crazy , but it is n't . They were n't in love with me . There I was , looking after you when your ma died that awful death , nursing everybody , and I was in the house , either Czar 's house or Thor 's , day in day out , crackling around all starched and bossy and independent . Everythingplain and aboveboard , like you say . I was like a loaf of bread in the house . There 's always a loaf of bread in any house , poor or rich , there it is , if it 's only half a loaf or a bit of the heel , it 's bread , you do n't get excited about it , you take it for granted . That was me . " " But Mrs.  --  Mrs. Ballantyne . Of course now everybody calls you Bridie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . Hardly anybody knows that . I was discouraged , I guess , about Czar and Thor . Czar was looking higher than me , and Thor was in the clouds , he had to be democratic , he was hell-bent on beingdemocratic , he had to be more democratic than the usual run , so he married as much outside of his own line as Czar had outside of his  --  but in what they call reverse . I was married one week to a fellow from Nome , I 'd put by a bit of money , nursing , and he skipped out with it . It was pretty hard to skip out anywhere in Alaska those days , there was nothing to skip in or on except by dog sled or boat . So maybe the varmints got him , I never heard . I just kept my namep141Ballantyne and left it at that . Chris , I 've almost forgotten how he looked . Is n't that awful ! " " You 're wonderful , Bridie darling . You 're as vital and wonderful today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman . I 'm not talking in complaint . I 've had a fine ride of it , the people and the scenery every inch of the way . The world owes me nothing . Now I 'm an old old woman , and not really needed . " " Do n't say that . We all need you . I need you , the children need you . Everybody --  " " Nope . Not so . Who cares about the old , really ? Well , I 'll tell you , Chris dearie . Nobody . They say they care , they say ai n't she wonderfulnow , my , she 's young for her age , look at the way she gets around , her mind is clear as a bell ! But they do n't really care and why should they ? It 's only natural . I say to myself , I say , you 've had your nice ride , you 're old , the new models come along , the old ones only block traffic on Gold Street , they have to pull over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fast ones , the big bright-colored bluepaintjobs . " " Addle Barnett was saying only yesterday she never saw any-one --  , ' " I know , I know . Addie 's a fine girl . I 'm not complaining . Only I want you to know I 'm old  --  but not foolish . "  | " My family tree , " Christine Storm , much later , explained to bewildered Outsiders , " is a forest . I do n't expect visitorsto grope their way through it . I often get lost , myself . " By the time she was twelve , she had pieced together the intricate pattern of her brief life , and that of the three adults  --  Czar , Thor , and Bridie  --  who governed it . Thor Storm never had stunted the growth of her curiosity . One of the results of this encyclopedic plan was that , at sixteen , she knew as much ( and possibly more ) about Alaska 's politics , people , prospects , resources and injustices as any Seattle , San Francisco , New York or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at twelve . What what what ? Czar Kennedy turned her off with a grandfatherly , " Because I say so , that 's why . " Sometimes she would repeat to Bridie bits and pieces of conversation remembered from Thor 's Bergsonian philosophy or Czar 's blandly material view of life . Bridie would discount this , briskly . " Pay them no mind , child dear . They 're not talking to you . They 're talking to each other through you , like a jealous couple . In a way , you 're the wife of both of them , and I 'm their widow . No , forget about that , Chris child dear , forget I said that , I was gabbing . Just forget that now . They love you and that 's all that matters , so just let the talk flow off your little shoulderslike a cape , like an easy garment , warm and light , as it 's meant to be , I 'm sure . " A merry child she was at twelve , yet thoughtful ; lighthearted andp143strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet worldly , like Bridie Ballantyne , her duenna , nurse , mother , all in one ; canny , too , like Czar , but without his hard shrewdness . " Real streak of Eskimo in her , too , " Baranof said , but fondly , " on her father 's side  --  anyway , that is , if it 's true that old Thor married an Eskimo half-breed girl up there near Barrow , years ago , and they had this son he brought down here alone to Baranof one day , calm as you please , no one knew if the girl had died or left him , or what . Nobody ever saw the mother but the baby grew up here , he married Czar 's daughter , he was Christine 's father . Yes , it does sound mixed up , I suppose , to you , but not to us old Alaska sourdoughs it does n't . Nothing surprises us , nothing mixes us up  --  cold , heat  --  blond , dark  --  rich , poor  --  old , young  --  good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're more civilized than they are Outside . " By the time she was twelve or thirteen nothing surprised Christine , nothing shocked her . At that age she said to Thor , " Everybody died , did n't they ? " " Not everybody , Christine . " " My father and my mother and my Gramma Kennedy and Gramma Ewok . That 's everybody but you and Grampa Czar and Bridie . Why ? " " I do n't know . Life here is rougher , in some ways , and harder , than in other places . " " Outside , you mean ? " " Yes . " " But it 's nicer too , is n't it ? " " I think so . " " I do , too . " She had been nowhere . " But if it 's rougher and harder why did you and Grampa Czar come ? And then stay here ? " " You know all about that as well as I do . You know we came on the same ship . Czar came to earn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair and legitimate ambition . I came to study Alaska , in a way , and I thought it would give me a feeling of freedom , and it did . I did my work and Czar did his . So we 've both lived the life wep144wanted to live . We 've lived history . Anybody who lives even a year in Alaska is history . " From the vantage of her grade-school knowledge Christine disputedthis statement . " You have to be dead to be history . History is war . And long journeys to places like the Pilgrim Fathers . In history you wear different clothes and do brave things or bad things , and anyway you 're always dead if you 're history . At the end , I mean . " Thor might have retorted flippantly , " Are n't we all ! " But he cared too much for that . He cared too much about the child Christine ; and about Alaska . To him they were not merely a beloved human being and a region at once familiar , dear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human race . " History is just people , Christine . History is n't only yesterday . It 's today . We 're making history right now , this minute , here in Alaska . There is no history without people , any more than there is sound without hearing . If a great tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it , it falls without sound  --  no , forget that , it will only confuse you . What I am trying to say , child , is that for about three quarters of a century now  --  ever since 1867  --  Alaska has been a living example of United States history . And you are part of it . You are history . " The child stared at him . " Me ! This minute ! " " This minute . You . " " Are you history , too ? " " I am . And so is your Grandpa Czar . And Bridie . " " Well , my teacher did n't say so . " " Then you tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Oregon a hundred years ago , or two hundred or three , are history , but they did n't know it then . Alaska is history made while you wait . People who live through such things and stay with it , and their children , and their grandchildren --  " " Like me ? " " Yes , like you , Christine . Those people have what is called the elan vital . " " What does that mean ? "  | " I was going to tell you . It means a vital drive , a strong life force . Enthusiasm . Vigor . They endure , they last , in spite of everything  --  hardships , and enemies , and hunger , and fear . It 's a wonderful thing to have , it 's the most valuable quality you can possess . Whole nations have it . The English people have it , and the Norwegians . Perhaps a few besides . The Jews , too . They 've persisted these thousands of years in spite of incredible horrors . It is a quality that ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must spring from within . The United States has had it for centuries . Boiled down , the essence of it is the will to keep your spirit and independence even at the cost of your life . But now things are too easy , too lavish , too rich in the United States , we 've grown soft and careless . The vital drive has weakened , we let others act for us , they think for us , even play our games for us . The drive now is n't much more than a mechanical thing at the wheel of a big shiny automobile . We 're losing it . It may already be lost . " " Alaska too ? Is it lost in Alaska too ? " He stared at her . His great arm gathered her to him , he held her close . " I was thinking aloud , Christine . Well , Alaska . Yes , Alaska still has the elan vital , perhaps it is n't only because of climate and struggle , perhaps it is n't even because we 've always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that the pioneer stock is still running strong in our veins , first and second generation still . Even the new ones , the late-comers , who leave their homes for money or freedom or adventure , like all pioneers . It takes a vital drive to do that , and that does n't wear out for a few generations . Perhaps someday soon there 'll be thousands of miles of roads in Alaska , as there are in the states of the United States . Or the sky will be humming with planes all the way from Ketchikan clear up to Point Barrow . But in Alaska now we 're still far away from the rest of the world . " " Grampa Czar says we are n't . He says pretty soon no place will be far away from any place . He says Russia is right up there "  --  excitedlyshe pointed in the direction that might be north  --  " he says any minute look out bingo ! "  |p146He  took her small hand in his great one , the steady blue eyes looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about that , never mind about all that , little Christine . What were we saying before ? " " History . I 'm history , you said . " " Oh , yes . Well , that 's important just now . Being history . There are even men alive today who can remember when this land was Russian land , before it became part of the United States . One old man even claims he was there when it happened . He lives in the Old Pioneers ' Home in Sitka now . Of course there 's no record to prove it . He was born in Sitka , it was called New Archangel then , it was the capital of Russian America . " " I know that , " she interrupted , pertly . " That 's in our history book about Alaska , but that 's long ago . " " Not so long , if a man remembers it . I do n't say that I believe him , but it could be true . He was just a boy . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  let 's see  --  the date was 1867  --  about eighty years ago , the old fellow 's almost a hundred  --  well , it could be , certainly . But maybe he just read about it , or heard someone tell of it . It was very dramatic , the day they took down the Russian flag and ran up the American flag . But no very old man would be likely to remember it the way he tells it . I 've heard him . " " How does he tell it ? " " He says he remembers the soldiers lined up in the Russian set-. tlement . The United States had bought all of Alaska for seven million dollars . Imagine that ! " But at the look of incomprehension on her face he interrupted himself contritely . " That does n't mean much to a little girl . But it 's interesting to know that most of the people of the United States were very angry at a man named Seward because he was the man who advised them to buy it . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred times that , and more . So that was n't such a bad bargain , was it ? " " Go on . The soldiers were lined up --  "  | " Oh . Well , there were the Russian soldiers on one side , and the American troops in blue uniforms lined up on the other side . " " The other side of what ? " " Of the flagpole , with the Russian flag flying at the top of it , ninety feet up in the air . The Russian flag had a double golden eagle on it , it was called the Imperial Flag of Russia then . There was an ocean breeze up there on the hill where they all stood , and the flag was very pretty , waving and snapping in the wind . They were in front of the house of the Russian Governor , Prince Maksoutoff . The Russianofficers wore uniforms of scarlet with gold braid . There was a salute from the artillery of the Russians and then a salute from the artillery of the Americans , all very dramatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to lower the Russian ensign --  " " What 's an ensign ? " " Flag . They began to lower the Russian flag and it fouled in the halyards "  --  he caught the question before it was uttered  --  " that means the flag got caught and snarled in the ropes that were pulling it down . This man says he really saw this . So they sent an American sailor up the pole to loosen it , but he could n't work it loose , and there were all those people with their faces turned up toward him , looking at him and the flag . He could n't work it loose and he was sort of desperate then , and nervous , so he tore it down and threw it and it landed on the heads of the Russian soldiers . That was bad . " " Why was it ? " " Because the flag of a country is n't just a piece of cloth , it 's the sign of the country , the emblem , it 's something you treat with great respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and the Stars and Stripes  --  the United States flag  --  went up , and the cannon boomed , and they made speeches , first the Russian officers and then the United States officers , and then everybody cheered except one person , and they say she cried as if her heart would break when the Russian flag was lowered and the land that her husband had worked for and believed in passed from the rule of the Czar of Russia to the rule of the United States . " " To Grandpa Czar ? "  |p148Startled  , " No . " But then he laughed a little , ruefully . " Who was the one who cried as if her heart would break ? And did it ? " " Her name was Princess Maksoutoff , and she was the wife of the Russian Governor , and they left Alaska then , forever , and went back to Russia . No , it did n't break , it seldom does , " he said , contritely . He thought he must be more careful in his figures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and beautiful princess ? " " All princesses are young and beautiful , " Thor Storm said , gently , remembering the gaunt and long-toothed princesses of Scandinavia ; and remembering his own childhood and youth , so incredibly unlike his life here in the past half century . Shuttled back and forth from the cushioned comfort of Czar 's house to Thor 's neat little log cabin  --  three months with Czar , three months with Thor  --  even an adult might have been shredded by this split existence . That Chris survived as a whole human being  --  though scarred  --  was miraculous . Oddly , she was happier in the three-room shack at the water 's edge than in Czar 's ample house with its bouncy mattresses , its thick carpets , its plate-glass windows . Through the protective panes she could see the splendid panorama of sky and water and mountains , yet here the child never had the feeling of security , of belonging . The world looked unreal and distant , somehow , viewed through all that glass . At Thor 's cabin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daily life , she did not view them merely ; she partook of them . Together she and Thor trudged the hills , fished the waters , slogged through the tundra gathering the delicate low-growing wild flowers , picking the low-bush wild cranberries for jelly . There were blueberries , too , and salmon berries . Thor held forth in terms of philosophy and economics and history . She was too young to understand it all , but much of this must have stuck in her memory and been preserved in her emotionalstorehouse . Years later she brought it forth , undimmed , like golden coins retrieved from a buried treasure chest . Not only Thor , but often Czar and Bridie , spoke to her in adult terms , and thoughp149she often was confused by this she thrived on their competitive affection . At mealtime Czar , pointing with a knife or fork , would say , " Eat that lettuce , it costs a fortune , lettuce does . " Or cabbage or beans or any green growing thing . " Freighted all the way from Seattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then let 's not have it any more , " Chris suggested , brightly . " I do n't like it anyway . " " Like it or not , you 'll eat it , young lady ! " " Why do I have to ? " " Because I say so . " Thor made a sort of game of his lessons in food values . " Nature has a wonderful way of taking care of you , if you 'll only heed her . Take salmon . " " Ugh ! The natives eat it all the time , you can smell it even when they walk past you down the street . " " Salmon is a cold-water cold-climate fish . It 's fat . And fat is fuel that protects you from the cold . Up north , in Barrow and Oogruk and Kotzebue and all the villages , the Eskimos eat seal oil and whale blubber  --  do n't make a face , it is n't bad , with berries and so on  --  and that keeps them warm . Keeps them alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough green stuff . Meat and potatoes and sweet stuff , that is n't good enough . Remember to eat green things when you 're with  --  when you 're not with me . " " Why ? " " Because they 'll make your hair curly and your cheeks pink and your eyes bright . And that means you 're healthy . There are elements in them that keep you well . Vitamins they 're called . " As a sort of game they scoured the countryside for their own greens . " The Eskimos , " he told her , storybook fashion , " go out and hunt for green stuff as though they were hunting for meat or fish or furs . There 's sourah , that 's the yellow stuff inside the pussy willow , they call it willow meat . And there 's wild chard , and there 's a plant they call asakluk , it grows in sandy places . And lots of others . Theyp150pick them and wash them and store them for the winter in a seal poke . " " Seal --  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seal poke . It 's quite a trick . Now , let 's go out and see what we can find . Greens or berries that are good to eat . " No such fancies spangled her months with Czar Kennedy . She lived in the finest house in Baranof , she wore dresses bought in Seattle , she ate the best the town afforded . On one of his rare trips to Seattle Czar even took Christine with him . In her early girlhood this journey was by no means the casual fling through the firmament that  --  thanks to the airplane  --  was to bring the mainland a mere handful of hours away from distant Arctic shores . Most Alaskans did not dream of staying at the Olympic Hotel when they visited Seattle , that first Outside stop . It was too grand , too costly . They chose one of the small side-street hotels where they knew they would encounter fellow territorials whose tastes and pocketbooks matched their own . With or without Christine , Czar stayed at the Olympic . The hotel staff knew him , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many national business conventions might be crowding the lobby , the halls , the restaurants . Long ago the room clerks , bellhops , waiters had learned not to be deceived by the baggy clothes , the battered old hat above the ascetic face , the veiled eyes . Bridie Ballantyne , provoked perhaps by some fresh evidence of ruthlessness , had said with characteristic acumen , " That face of Czar 's , and the look of it , it 's like you were looking at one of those paintings of the prophets , mild and understanding everything , and forgiving . Then all of a sudden he looks at you , you notice his eyes , and they 're like that FBI man was here once during the War . Cold steel . " This glimpse of the Northwest metropolis had dazzled the child , and puzzled her . Like an Alice in Wonderland she stared , confused and sometimes unbelieving , at the hotel 's luxurious appointments , at the wide streets , the amazing hills , the shopwindows , the handsome houses , the cloud-crowned office buildings.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child said . " Why does n't it ? " " No money . " " Then why does n't Seattle give them some money ? " He stared at her , startled . He had been hearing this question lately , from other sources . Then he laughed . " No , that would n't do . That 's the wrong way round . " Not wishing to leave her alone in the hotel , or on the street , he took her with him when he had a business conference in this office or that , with Dave Husack or Sid Kleet or any one of a half dozen other Northwest nabobs . " Now you sit here , " Czar would say as they entered the outer reception room of one of these luxury office suites , " and read a book or look at these folders with all these pictures in them , I wo n't be long . " " I want to come in with you . " " You ca n't . We 've got business to talk about . " " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . I 'll be quiet . " Sunk in the depths of a vast leather armchair , a book in her lap , the child was so quiet that the men actually forgot her presence . This room , in whatever building ( with the exception of Sid Kleet 's bare and gritty office ) always was baronial . Invariably its many windows looked out upon Seattle 's glorious bay and mountains . The ceiling was high , the room vast , the walls mahogany- or oak-paneled . The visitor trod on the ruby and sapphire , emerald and topaz of an oriental carpet . Paintings of ships and mountains and waters seemed to reflect the view one saw through the windows . Models of ships stood on the mantel shelf . The fireplace was cavernous , the desk a plateau , the leather-upholstered chairs gigantic . The child sat quietly , quietly , every object in the luxurious room , every color , storing itself in her memory . She heard every word the men said . It did not interest her , she understood none of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservoir into which every fluid thing from trickle to torrent finds its way . She liked the scent of the cigars the men smoked , sitting well back in their chairs , their legs spread comfortably , their eyes approving the long lavender-gray ash that clung sop152tenaciously in proof of the costliness of the oily brown cylinder . They talked quietly , leisurely , one would have thought , from their manner , that their subject was , perhaps , philanthropy . " Thing to do is put pressure on him , give him the screws . " " Lubbock says he wants to see the situation from every angle before he makes his report . " " Lubbock would n't know a salmon from a herring if he ate it . " Sid Kleet 's dry nasal voice . " Gentlemen , I would like you to give me authority to by-pass fisheries commissioners and directors and little stuff like that . " " What have you in mind , Sid ? " It was Czar 's question , his tone one of mild interrogation . He knew the answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's legal representative . " Go over their heads , " Kleet barked . " To who ? " " You damn well know to who . Cabinet Member . Senator . They 'll get action . " " What 'll you do with Lubbock ? " " Same as we did with Diener . Get him . " " Yeh , but how about old Storm ? " Dave Husack demanded . His voice , booming from that barrel chest had the effect of a bellow in the quiet , almost somnolent , room . Czar waved a cautioning hand toward the child . Very early in her childhood Bridie had impressed upon her the vileness of tattling . " Now do n't you go tattling to Czar about Thor , or Thor about Czar . You got anything about either of your Grampas , why , just come and tell me . " " Would n't that be tattling ? " " No . I 'd be a kind of a judge , like Judge Gannon here , I 'd think about it , not leaning to one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix whatever is wrong . I 'd do the best I could for all three . " As Chris 's keen mind missed practically nothing , and as she had almost total recall , the plums that fell into Bridie 's lap were rich and juicy . This office conference , for example , conveyed quite innocently in Christine 's childish terms , sent Bridie scurrying to the office of thep153Northern Light . She was discreet , she did not give her source , she merely hinted . " We 'll be able to block that plan , " Addle Barnett said . " We 'll merely print it in full . " " Each one , " Paul Barnett observed , " will think the other blabbed . And they 'll all probably blame old Einar . " Thor said , almost sadly , " It 's like that old cartoon of Nast 's  --  the famous one  --  of the circle of political thieves each pointing to the man next him and saying , He did it . ' They 're old-fashioned plunderers , but it still seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle office , as Czar cautiously indicated the child at the far end of the room , some atavistic instinct told Christine to shut her eyes . The men saw the golden head , snuggled in the engulfing depths of the vast chair by the window , touchingly cushioned against the plump tufted leather . She was breathing lightly , regularly , the innocent half-smile of pleasant dreams curving the lovely lips . Czar relaxed . " She 's asleep . " Dave Husack did not relish this cosy interlude in the battle of big business . " You should n't of brought her here in the first place . " Czar 's tone was mild , paternal . " Never you mind , Dave , about what I should or should n't do . Though it 's real thoughtful of you toward the child . I make it a rule never to go any place I could n't bring her to if I was so minded . " His eyes were cobalt . " How 's that again about who was it ? " old Einar Wendt asked . Czar 's father-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , he had come to Seattle from Tacoma for this meeting , he wanted to get on with it and go home . He cupped his right ear with his hand , he spoke in the high monotonous voice of the deaf . " Storm ! " Husack bellowed . " Thor Storm , you know him , the old crackpot who runs that paper . " " What about him ? " " He 's raising a stink , that 's what . Papers outside are copying his stuff , he 's been running articles and editorials and so on , he 's got a column full of snide remarks about me and Kleet and the wholep154cannery crowd . He comes right out with names in Washington , right in the government , it 's libel , we could sue him for a million dollars only the poor old moosehead --  " " No libel suits , " Sid Kleet snapped . " Too much publicity in libel suits . There 's other ways . " " Such as what ? " Mort Caswell demanded . The Caswells were Ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ships , and old old Mortimer , and old old old Mortimer in the days of the Yankee Clippers long before his descendants had transferred their sea heritagefrom the Atlantic to the Pacific . It was said that the first Mort of the New England line had run slave ships , and now young Mort ran slave ships of a sort , though legitimately . The Caswell Clipper North Coast Line made sure of that . Cannery workers from the mainland for two or three frantic summer months  --  thousands of cannery workers shipped to Alaska , shipped back home again to California , to Washington State , to Oregon , their summer wages , unspent , burstingtheir pockets . Young Mort and any surviving old Morts were no fools , they realized that planes , rather than ships , would now be the means of transporting the cannery workers and every other passengerAlaska-bound . So now the Caswell Clipper Air Line was about to add its glint to the spangled Arctic skies . This massive mahogany office in whose great chair Chris now sat so comfortably cuddled was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortyish ) and young young Mort ( twentyish ) each would one day soon fly his own small pleasure plane and have only a somewhat remote loyalty for the ship models which now sailed the mantel shelf and the walls . " Such as what ? " Mort Caswell asked of Kleet . He was bored with these Old Boys , he had been bossed by the Old Boys of the long Caswell line for years and years , he had a club date for lunch and golf . " When the lifeblood stops flowing to your heart , what happens ? " Kleet asked the group in general . The older men shrank back in their chairs as though Mort had thrown a live snake in their midst . " I bite , " young Mort said , rather contemptuously . " And I 'll savep155time by answering . The heart stops beating and you die . R-r-right ? " Sid Kleet scarcely unclenched his teeth to say , " Right . " He turned his malevolent glance away from the younger man , toward the oldsters , a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeblood of a newspaper ? Advertising . And when the advertising stops , what happens ? The newspaper dies . So , gentlemen , if we tactfully convey to the Baranof businessmen , and so forth , that they 'd better quit all advertising in Storm 's weekly Northern Light and confine it to the Daily Lode , or else their business might fall off , why , in practically no time that stink you spoke about , Dave , will kind of evaporate away . " " " No , " said Czar Kennedy , mildly . He had been sitting motionless ; not smoking , not waggling a foot as the others did , or tapping the arm of a chair with nervous fingers , or crossing and uncrossing his knees . " No . " Quietly . " What 's the objection ? " Czar had kept his battered soft hat on , as he frequently did indoors . Pushed back from his brow it had the effect of a rather rowdy halo . Now as he gazed dreamily into space , a half-smile on his benevolent face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manywindowedroom , he was one of the kindlier prophets of the Bible , in store clothes . " No objection , Sid boy  --  that is , no objection to the plan as a plan . It 's a clever idea , well thought-out , and workable , I 'd say . But I believe in competition . Now , you say advertising is the lifeblood of the newspaper publishing business , and so it is . But competition makes a horse race , as the fella says . I 've always been a great believer in competition . Thor moves out with his weekly , why , some other fella moves in with a weekly , some new crackpot , young , the woods seem to be full of them lately , maybe he 'd be hard to handle . Now , Thor , we know his gait and speed and conformation and staying power . But you get a dark horse in there , he 's anybody 's guess . So I say , let sleeping dogs lie . " " But he ai n't sleeping ! " Dave Husack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , " You 're mixingyour metaphor . " But no one heard him . " You mean you wo n't go along with this ? " Dave Husack demanded of Czar . " Not for the present , " Czar said , gently . " Not for the present , Dave boy . " Einar Wendt , whose chin had been sunk on his chest , raised his head now and smiled amiably upon the group like a child just awakenedfrom sleep . Indeed the crumpled ancient face was like that of an old old baby . But the eyes were shrewd and crafty . His mouth formed an 0 before he began to speak , as though in warning . He said everything  --  or almost everything  --  twice . " Know what I think ? " he piped in that high thin voice , " I think Czar 's a little bit scared of Thor , a little bit scared . And I think he ca n't get over the feeling that he and Thor used to be pardners in a way . And then there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's boy  --  or was . You ca n't loosen ties like that , not so easy . It killed my daughter , marrying into that family , but Czar goes his own way , nothing can turn him aside , nothing can turn him aside . " Czar wagged his head from side to side , as though in admiration for a child  --  or in sympathy for senility . " Einar , you 're a great old guy . Yessir , you 'll always be yourself , no matter how old you get . " Mort Caswell now shuffled the papers on his desk , he pushed back his chair and leaned forward , half rising . " Well , gentlemen , I do n't believe there 's anything more just now , we 'll be meeting again tomorrow , I hate to be the one to break this up , but I have a business Iuncheon appointment at one --  " Dave Husack stood up , a towering figure . " Anyway , that advertisingidea is kid stuff . " Belligerently he turned his empurpled face towardSid Kleet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storm and they 'll feel he 's getting a tough deal , they 'll stick by him , that 's the way those crazy Alaska people do . There 's other ways , better . When the time comes , stop his print paper supply . He gets his paper from Canada , do n't he ? We can stop it altogetheror if we ca n't do that we can make it so they 'll have to routep157it to him to Seattle and then all the way across from Seattle to Baranof , he wo n't be able to afford that , nobody could . And his printers . Get after them through the union and no printer will work for him , would n't dare to , or linotyper either . You ca n't get out a newspaper without print paper and printers and linotype operators , can you ! So there you are , boys , and what d' you say lunch ? " Three now were standing . Only Czar remained seated , his hands clasped easily in his lap , his face tilted up toward the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ruminating , " has got a young fella there in the Northern Light , working for him , he 's got a little bit of money in the paper , too . Barnett , his name is . Paul Barnett . He 's a Harvard boy , no less , but smart , you 've got to hand it to him . Real smart . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Sid Kleet snapped . He rarely allowed himself to show irritation , but Dave Husack had offended him deeply , he was impelled to strike out at someone , anyone . " Nothing . Maybe nothing . Only , when you talk about taking away the Northern Light 's advertising and stopping the print paper and so on , why , you do n't know Thor and you do n't know Barnett . Paul and Thor both can set up a paper by hand if they have to , and they 're both licensed linotype operators , and they can run the press and do the leg work getting the news , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're no friends of mine , but I 'm telling you , just in case . And Thor ? Boys , Thor would get that weekly out , believe me when I say it , if he had to print it on toilet paper with a lead pencil . " He rose leisurely and walked the length of the great room to where the child sat . He placed a hand tenderly on her shoulder . " Christine . Christine child . " She opened her eyes , she looked up at him . " Grampa Czar , I 'm hungry . " " Well , sure . So am I. We 'll go back to the hotel and we 'll have a fine lunch . Rock crab and ice cream . " She jumped from the chair , shook herself like a puppy . " I do n't want to have lunch at the hotel , I 'm tired of the old hotel , I want top158have lunch down by the water at that place where the vegetables are all spread out , like a garden . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can eat those little tiny shrimps out of a paper bag . " She was startled by the whoop of laughter from the men . " Czar , you sure picked yourself a girl wo n't break you , " Dave Husack shouted . Her hand in Czar 's they walked down to the waterfront , and to the color and sound and delicious smells of mingled fruits and vegetablesand berries and coffee and crullers and cheese and fish and apple pie and flowers of the Farmers ' Market . " I did n't like those men , " she said . " Where we were . " " Why not ? " Something warned her not to reveal what she had heard . " They are n't like the people in Baranof . " Triumphantly he said , " That 's just it . That 's why I brought you along with me to Seattle . I want you to get used to the way people act Outside . When you get older you 're going to school Outside . Here , maybe . And you 'll meet people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your mother , too , before she marriedthat  --  that mongrel . " She sprang to the defense of the father she never had known . " My father was Grampa Thor 's son and my mother was married to him and I am their daughter and I was born in a caribou  --  " " Stop that ! Never mind about that ! " Czar shouted in a rare display of emotion . " I do n't want you to talk about that , understand me ! " " Why ? " " Because I say so . " " I told that Mrs. Husack about it that day you left me at her house and I had tea with her and her friends and one of them said it was  --  wait a minute  --  that lady said ma-cabber . Oh , what a ma-cabber story ! What 's that ? And they all stared at me . " " Then do n't talk so much . Now you listen to me , Christine . By the time you 're eighteen I 'll about own Baranof and a good chunkp159of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here will be eating out of my hand . You 're going to come into money someday . Big money . People are going to try to take it away from you , but you 'll be too smart for them . I want you to know what it 's good for and how to handle it . " " I know what it 's good for and how to handle it , too , " the child announced , with pride . " When I go to the Nugget Drugstore for a chocolate nut bar I give the man ten cents and then he gives me a chocolate bar . " " Oh , my God ! Chocolate bars ! " But then he reflected aloud , cannily . " Well , thank God , everything 'll be in trust . "  |p160From  the hill which was the campus of Baranof Collegeyou beheld a view to send the soul soaring if ( Baranof realists said ) it had n't been too cold to stand there in the winter ; and too mosquito-infested in the summer . From October to April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great inlet , the mountains . Mount McKinley , king of them all , could be seen for a hundred miles in all directions , and during the brief summer , when the white world changed miraculously to green , he sometimes donned his rare ruby and diamond crown for all to behold . Lovers strolled the roads and paths of the college hill , or sat stifling in their cars , the windows shut tight against the winged stingers . Students taking the summer courses said , " Look ! You can see old McKinley as plain as the Ice Palace , almost . " " How about a movie ? Want to go to a movie ? " For throughout the summer months here in Baranof it was daylightall day , it was daylight all night , and sunshine is not favored of lovers . The young moderns preferred the kind gloom of the little bars and the motion-picture theaters and the cloistered privacy of a high-backed bench in a coffee shop . Ivied walls and cloistered halls and Gothic facades of stone were not characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , the buildings on the hill began to form quite an impressive group . Between two World Wars they had somehow grown to a dozen solid forthright structures whose doorway inscriptionsread ; School of Mines ; School of Engineering ; Chemistry andp161Metallurgy , Business Administration , Agriculture , Geophysics , Home Economics , Arts and Letters . Here , in this sturdy little power plant of learning Alaska youth of incredibly varied background  --  Scandinavian , German , Polish , Eskimo , Russian , Indian , Negro , American , Canadian  --  gained knowledge of botany , zoology , political science , history , business , music , anthropology , genetics . Young people in sweaters and ski pants and mukluks trudged the hill and swarmed the classrooms . They studied and skated and skied and danced and courted and parted and married and graduated and found jobs . They behaved like college students . There was no building called the Kennedy Building in the group on college hill . It was not that Czar Kennedy was opposed to formal education . He believed in it , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no money in it for Kennedy enterprises . Education for learning 's sake was not a good investment . " College education is a fine thing , " Czar said . " For certain professions , that is . Medicine , law , and so on . I do n't recall that Edison or Ford or Rockefeller had a college education . " Modestly , he did not include his own name . They came to him , singly and as committees . Thor Storm argued with him , and Bridie Ballantyne argued , and Dr. Glenn Shields and  --  in later years  --  the Paul Barnetts , and Matt Berg of the town 's one bookstore , and assorted mothers and fathers of small children who , in ten or twelve years , would be of college age . " Maybe , " these said , " if we could get private donations and benefactions in wills , and so forth  --  not that we expect anyone to die  --  goodness no !  --  but if we make a start maybe the government would grant Alaska some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , for states . " " Well , now , that sounds like a wonderful idea "  --  then , as his hearers brightened  --  " someday in the future . Just now a college in Alaska would be a failure . Take here in Baranof , for example . If people want higher education for their boys and girls , why , they can send them Outside . Broaden them . Give them a picture of life outside the confinesof the Territory . " Thor had said , " Who can afford that ? You can . But who else ? "  | " Now Thor , " Czar chided him , smiling tolerantly . " You 've been in Alaska as long as I have . Do you honestly claim that there are enough college-inclined young people in Baranof to justify a college here ? " " Who 's talking about Baranof only ! They 'd come from every part of the Territory , north as far as Barrow , south to Ketchikan , boys and girls , white and Native and Eskimo . " Czar was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had trained himself to wait until the seething had subsided , giving meanwhile the appearance of deep thought as he tapped his cheek with a pencil or gazed through the window at the sky . " Mm , tell you what , Thor . I have n't exactly figured it all out . Dollars and cents , I mean . But I 'd be glad to do that , and then I 'll go over the figures with you and your committee . " " What figures ? " " The cost of living in Alaska against the cost of living Outside . Even in a big city like , say , Seattle or San Francisco or Los Angeles even , or Portland . Any one of those college towns a kid could live cheaper than here in Baranof , supposing that they came here from other Alaska towns , like you say , such as Nome or Fairbanks or Juneauor off in Sitka or in Valdez . They could go to a real college Outside cheaper , and get a taste of Outside life in the bargain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of their transportation and board thrown in , it would be cheaper . Look at what food costs here , and clothes and rent . They 'd be fools to come here to a little jerkwaterhome institute called a college . And your Eskimos and Natives that are going to make students  --  I do n't want to be impolite to an old pardner , and laugh in your face . " Which he now proceeded to do , but gently . This was years ago , and the straggling little town certainly seemed to justify Czar 's pessimism . Yet somehow a building or two was added to the rather ramshackle one on the hill . And another . And another . Curiously enough , Czar Kennedy had not counted on the resilience and the love of adventure that youth had now , as it had had when he himself was a young ambitious man on his way to the Northp163Country . And he had not counted on the effect of the Mad House Painter of Austria . The little college staggered to its feet like an infantlearning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the Aleutian Islands and took them handily . And then the young American boys came in , thousands of them , and took them back , and thousands of them died doing it . And then the United States Army Bases sprang up , and the crystal Alaska air was torn by the screeching and thundering of fighter and bomber planes . Now young men wrapped in white like pranksters on Halloween stepped forward to the open doorway of a plane high in the sky , and at a given word they stepped out into nothing , knowing that life depended on the jerking of a cord that might whimsically refuse to respond to the pull . Like great snowflakes they drifted down out of the sky and the ghostly figures found protective coloration with the billions of other actual snowflakes that blanketed the Alaska landscape . Beneath the white covering they bore lethal weapons that were no part of a prankster 's equipment , and in their heads was knowledge of how one might survive for a brief time on a terrain which ordinarily did not predicate human survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have bred in these men a deep distaste for the wild relentless North Country . A curious thing happened . Scores of them who had frozen and sweated in the numbing cold and the clammy heat of the Arctic mountains and tundras and forests and waters now , with their GI college rights in their pockets , elected to come back to the Territory to gain an education at Baranof College . School of Mines , they said . One of the best in the whole country . Engineering . Agriculture . And  --  I do n't know  --  it 's a kind of a free feeling . What I like , there 's nothingcoming at you , know what I mean ? It 's busy , but it 's quiet . No dodging . The fishing is great . And hunting ! Boy , is this the happy hunting ground ! Moose . And bear ! Browns thirteen feet high on their hind legs . And polar bears , their hide would cover the whole floor of this room . I 'm going to get me a bear if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going to be the last . They came , unbelievably , from California , and from Oregon andp164Nebraska and Illinois and the Carolinas . They never talked of the War , you would not have known they had been snowflakes , if you had not seen in their young faces certain deeply etched lines which ordinarily are found only in old faces . They added fresh life to the town of Baranof . Some of them stayed and became Alaskans and bred Alaskans . Army bases ringed the town . Gay-hued private cars and drab army cars and trucks swarmed the pavements , and pretty young mothers and vigorous young men and perambulators and strollers and toddlers imparted to Gold Street a virility that hit you with the impact of a blow . Perhaps Bridie 's maternalism stemmed from those days when she , a young , frightened , homesick girl , had come to Baranof , alone and lonely . She knew and understood about some of those men  --  scarcely more than boys  --  surrounded by thousands at close quarters at Morgensternor Kinkaid Air Bases , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On leave they washed , shaved , dressed with extra care ; boots were shined , uniform brushed . They lounged around Baranof 's Gold Street , they dropped in at the juke box joints , they slipped coins in the slot to be lulled or soothed by the tranquilizer ; artificial music . A mechanical sound hammered out " You 're a Livin ' Doll , " or the whining self-pitying ballads of the day  --  why did you leave me . . . was it to grieve me . . . you in my arms . . . you have those charms . They sat in the USO big room listlessly reading an Outside newspaper a week old . The colored boys huddled in a corner watching TV . You rarely saw them standing on a street corner , these boys , surveying a passing Alaska world in the dim cold , calling out an unconvincing and unconvinced " Hello , Gorgeous ! " to a bearlike female figure so muffled in hood , parka , mukluks , mittens , that it was impossible to tell whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingle with the ground , or very rarely . You did not see Air wives shopping in Baranof . They lived an intensely concentrated social life on the vast base , as did their martial male mates . The women belonged to clubs on the Bases , they attended teas , cocktail parties , dances , movies . Their children went to Base schools.  |p165As  Bridle put it , somewhat sniffily for her , " Air does n't mingle with us peasants . But those kids  --  those boys around  --  they kill me . The look on them . " The girls began to arrive from everywhere . Again they were followingthe men into Alaska , but they were not at all like those girls who had come at the turn of the century . They looked terribly young in the inadequate pale blue coat and the little high-heeled pumps , hatless , the pretty dress belling out over the bouffant nylon petticoat , as they stepped off the plane into the icy airport . No one in Baranof quite knew how Bridle Ballantyne had become unofficial welcomer , chaperone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these girls who , suddenly prim and apprehensive , descendedout of the air into the waiting arms of an equally stiff apprehensiveyoung man in Air Force uniform or in parka and mukluks . Everyone in Baranof knew Bridie , so perhaps , in the beginning , one of the Air Force men or one of the construction workers or one of the Baranof College students had said to her , meeting her on the street or in the USO , " Uh , Mrs. Ballantyne , I 'm , going to be married day after tomorrow , I thought you 'd like to know , you been mighty nice to me getting me acquainted round , and so on . I 'm having some trouble getting her a place to stay overnight , she 's coming in on the noon plane from Seattle tomorrow . " The girl on the plane had kept her hair in pins until the last possiblemoment and had then rushed to the lavatory to unpin the curls that sprang in lovely tendrils to frame the flushed or pale face ; the eyes wide with sudden doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell which was heartbeat and which the throbbing of the great plane 's engines . She put her hand to her breast where his Air Force ring hung suspended by a slender gold chain . There had been young men on the plane , and these had eyed her with interest and speculation and longing , but now they relinquished their fantasies . Her face was pressed against the window ; as the plane taxied in , her eyes searched the figures at the airport gate . There he was , and beside him and speaking to him was a white-haired woman who looked a little like her mother , only more smartly dressed . The eagerp166young men in the plane said , one to another , give it up , boy . She 's fetched . There had arrived dozens  --  scores  --  hundreds of these in Baranof in the past few years . Addie Barnett had been one of them , and Paul Barnett had been the man at the gate , peering nearsightedly at the figures spilling from the plane 's maw . And now Bridie met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . No one quite knew why she did it . Bridie knew , and perhaps Thor Storm . He once said to her , " It 's because of the way you came to Alaska that day , is n't it , Bridie ? " " I guess so , " she admitted , and closed her eyes for a moment as she remembered the girl in the picture hat and the long sweeping skirt who had clambered up the beach in response to a cruel joke . " Maybe so . I want them to feel they 're doing something serious . And for life . Not just flying up here in a plane , like for a college stunt or something . I ca n't make out whether they 're younger than brides used to be or I 'm just getting older . Little of both , maybe . In crazy times , like now , people always seem to get married younger . War times , and after wars , when folks are scared and nervous . They want company , I suppose , and can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talk to , and love . And be loved by . " The thing grew so that it became one of her many projects and , urged by Thor Storm and the Barnetts , the town finally voted her a tiny salary for the work . Most of this dribbled away to the young couples , though they scarcely noticed it . A wedding cake bought by Bridie at the Sweet Tooth Bakery ; a bunch of somewhat frostshockedflowers for the altar ; a prayer book for the girl ; a festive boutonniere for the bashful bridegroom . Now she had an impromptu sort of office in a remote corner of the Ice Palace lobby . No one quite knew how she had come by it . Even the superintendent was mystified , and it was known that Czar Kennedy had refrained from ousting her only because Bridie 's position in the town 's affection had somehow mysteriously become more solidly established than his own . In the beginning he had demanded of the Ice Palace staff , thenp167of the tenants , and finally of the City Council , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a First Aid to the Lovelorn or something ! Next thing they 'll be sleeping in the lobby and the Ice Palace will be a flophouse . I want her out of there . " But she stayed . Her desk was a ramshackle affair salvaged when the Miners ' National Bank next door went in for modern decoration . Daily Bridie sat at this desk for hours , while over its time-scarred top passed such tales of romance , failure , nostalgia , love unrequited , love fulfilled , hopes , despair , as would have staggered any recipient less sturdy than Bridie . Aside from a disorderly clutter of papers , pamphlets , scribbled notes , plane-and-railroad timetables , the desk 's surface was likely to hold a vase of drooping flowers or a brownedgedcorsage bouquet left over from last night 's club dinner ; a chocolate cake contributed by a women's-club cake sale ; a pair of hand-sewn mukluks , palpably an offering ( she would n't have worn them caught in a ten-foot blizzard on a mountaintop ) ; half a cup of cold gray tea ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride and bridegroom . That same photograph  --  at least , it looked the same , though the boy and girl were always a different boy and girl  --  was tacked or taped all over the walls of the cluttered corner . Inevitably Chris Storm was drawn into this haphazard project . She found herself repeatedly acting the role of bridesmaid at the weddingof two people she never before had laid eyes on . The pattern of the weddings almost always was the same . Bridle conferred with the scared and inarticulate young bridegroom . He sat in her makeshiftoffice , his young face serious and strained . He had been confronted , stunningly , with the fact that the girl from North Dakota or Michigan or Alabama was coming up to Alaska to live with him forever after , amen . This he had asked her to do , but now , confronted with the reality , his mind rejected fact . Whoever he was , he thought of the other young men like himself  --  at the Air Base or on the ConstructionJob or a student at Baranof College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a two-room rental or even a trailer , the girl seemed forever to be doing the washing and wheeling thep168baby and complaining about the cost of food and looking shapeless with the next baby coming . Gone , he realized in a desperately quiet panic , were the hours when you could lie on your bunk , readingand smoking or just looking up at the ceiling , or sleeping ; the nights down on the Strip , close to one of the girls , or listening to Gamboge , that yellow boy entertainer , who sang fit to bust your heart . " Now , " Bridie would say , and he tried to listen as he sat there at her desk side , " now you want to get her a nice corsage , I 'd say one orchid is better than a whole bunch of other flowers , they just love ' em . I 'll order it for you if you want me to . " " Say , I wish you would , ma'am . " " Seven dollars at Gresen 's Florists , Matty 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fern and all , it looks like a million dollars . You got the ring ? " He looked stricken . " Gosh , no ! I forgot . I 'll get it now . " " That 's all right . Wait till she gets here . They love to pick their own wedding ring . Besides , size . " Chris was sixteen when first she found herself taking part in these somewhat touching festivities . Usually the bride arrived in Alaska unaccompanied , and the bridegroom , himself a comparative newcomer , had no backlog of young feminine relatives or friends sturdy enough to act as attendant on the flustered girl . Certainly his local girls were more likely to be resentful toward the occasion , rather than helpful . " Snort McHugh told me you 're going to be married . " " Uh , yeah . " " When ? " " Well , she 's coming on the noon plane Tuesday , we 're planning for that afternoon , or Wednesday morning if I can find a place for her to stay Tuesday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even told me you were engaged . " " We were n't  --  that is , exactly . I did n't think she 'd ever make itp169here . So far , and all . And different . And her folks are n't crazy about the idea . She just took off and came . Or will . " " That 's just lovely . Congratulations . " " Well , thanks . Say , I suppose you would n't  --  an old friend and all  --  I suppose you would n't want to act as b  --  uh , no . " " Thanks awfully . Tuesday is all jammed up . I 'm going off skiing with a boy friend , and I 've got a dinner date that evening , and then another friend has asked me to get together with the bunch at his place --  " Bridie herself always was willing to act as temporary mother of the bride , chaperon or matron of honor . But she felt that a young girl should be in attendance . " Gray hair is kind of grim , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A young face is what you want , not one that looks like a warning . " Chris 's first wedding was that of Paul Barnett and Addie . Addie was twenty-six when she arrived in Baranof for her wedding , and to the seventeen-year-old Christine she seemed middle-aged , or almost . A college girl . Majored in journalism , had run the college paper , and had even had a year of general reporting on a Boston daily . Chris knew about newspaper offices . Since her childhood she had had the freedom of the grubby little composing room , editorial office and print shop of Thor Storm 's Northern Light . The big building which housed Czar Kennedy 's Daily Lode was a different matter . Czar did not want his granddaughter running about that humming hive . " A newspaper office is no place for little girls , " he said . " You get caught in one those rollers , or a belt or something . " " I do n't go there . I like the front office where they come in with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and rattle it off fast , it 's exciting . I think a daily paper is more exciting than a weekly , I wish Grampa Thor 's was a daily , too . And I like the linotype machines , the way that arm reaches over , and takes a handful of type , and drops it , just like a human being , almost . " " You just keep away from there , Christine , hear me . " So she spent hours , ink-smeared and happy , in the dim dusty little shop of the Northern Light , listening to shoptalk , hearing almostp170heedlessly the news , the politics , the sociological problems , the social life , the scandals and tragedies and merriments of the region . Some of this she did not understand , but much of it stayed in her mind , and as she grew older she was , unconsciously , a modern gold mine of Alaska riches . In time Thor Storm 's weekly Northern Light actually was to exceedin circulation Czar Kennedy 's Daily Lode . This was due to Addie Barnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news gathering and news dispensing as other women might possess a talent for acting or singing or cooking or designing or buying or selling or painting . It was at the Barnett wedding that Christine Storm met Ross Guildenstern for the first time . It was spring and the long days and the white nights had already begun in Baranof . The little wedding party had assembled to meet the incomingbride . It might have been considered a rather odd little wedding party in any place but Alaska , which was so much less provincialthan , say , New York or London or Los Angeles . Besides the bridegroom there was Bridie Ballantyne , matron of honor ; Thor Storm ( Barnett 's boss ) ; Christine Storm , bridesmaid ; Ross Guildenstern , groomsman . Chris looked at the young half-breed Eskimo without designating him as a young half-breed Eskimo . She merely thought that he was enormously attractive and she thought that this might be only in contrast with the other males of the wedding party . Paul Barnett , tall , loose-jointed , long-jawed , spectacled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient in the eyes of the girl of seventeen . When the energetic red-haired Addie descended the plane steps and came toward the waiting group Chris thought her rather plain and old for a bride . Then Addie had smiled and had called out , even before she reached the waiting bridegroom , " I never saw anything so dazzling in my life ! " " Who ? Me ? " Paul Barnett asked . " Certainly not . The scenery between Juneau and here . " She stood looking up at him a moment , he down at her , with a sudden terriblep171shyness . Then she stood on tiptoe , he bent to her , his arms went round her . " Scenery ! " Bridie said . " Well , that 's more like it . " The young bride seemed to find nothing extraordinary in the weddingattendants ; the elderly man and woman , the girl of seventeen , the handsome olive-skinned young man . An hour later she was Mrs. Paul Barnett , properly married in church by the Reverend ( Flying Missionary ) Mead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ music , bridal bouquet . The little group had scarcely reached the vestibulewhen Addie said , " I 'd like to see the Northern Light office . " " Not now , for the love of heaven , girl ! " Bridie , the romantic , was outraged . " We 're having the wedding lunch at Nick 's Caribou , Thor here is giving it , wine and all . " " Afterward then ? " Gently Thor said , " Yes . Perhaps lunch first would be the thing . And then the office . Do n't expect anything like your Boston plant . This is a small-town weekly . And an Alaska small-town weekly . " Christine thought this was not at all the way a new bride should behave , but the bridegroom was grinning and shaking his head waggishly . " Remember what I told you yesterday , Thor ? I said you and I would be lucky if we could keep our jobs after Addie came in . " It was not that Addie Barnett lacked the qualities of warmth and affection . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She became a fond and capable wife and mother , but she was a born newspaper woman , as in love with her profession as a stage-struck actress with hers . She was inquisitive about every manifestation in life ; brash , courageous , alert ; she had the gift of making anything  --  a Sourdough gathering , a women 's church sodality cake sale  --  seem an interesting event . She had what is tritely called a nose for news . Baranof was to find this irritating or amusing , depending on person and circumstance . Before the day was finished Addie knew almost as much about Baranof as many others who had lived a full year there . The red hair seemed to send out sparks , the face , plain in repose , was brilliant with animation.  |p172On  the drive from the church to the restaurant she sat between her husband and the Reverend Mead Haskell . " Just Mr. Haskell , " he said , in answer to her first question . " Or Mead . We do n't do much about titles and forms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's working so hard , and there 's a kind of all-in-it-together feeling . " " Are n't you young to be minister  --  pastor  --  anyway , head of a church like that ? " " I 'm only an assistant  --  and a part-time assistant , at that . I 'm a missionary . I fly back and forth between the Eskimo villages . " Now she turned to look at him more closely . Intelligent compassionateeyes , rather good-looking in a conventional way . He might have been mistaken for an advertising man , an insurance salesman , a lively young merchant . Paul patted her knee proprietorially . " No , he is n't called the FlyingParson . Up here they 're just about all flying parsons  --  the Catholicpriests and the Protestant ministers and the missionaries . Mead used to be Air during the war . Now he buzzes all around the Arctic in a little Piper Pacer , carrying nurses and women missionaries and medicine and phonograph records and stuff . " Even Addle appeared momentarily unable to digest this . " Phonographrecords ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskimos something beside God and religion , " Mead explained , matter-of-factly . " Their taste in music is awful , like most kids ' . The boys buy those old twenty-five-cent records . They like hillbilly tunes . That dismal nasal whining , over and over , seems to fascinate them . It 's soothing , I suppose , in that icelockedworld . And the really cheap stuff . Lyrics . I told you I loved you in twenty-two bars . Now you can buy your own beer . ' SometimesI get so fed up with it I yank the record off the spindle and take it outside and spin it whirling and flipping and skipping across the snow and ice the way you 'd skip a flat stone across a pond . I suppose I should n't do it . I bring them good records . " He seemed to be brooding about this . Then he glanced up , peered out . The Ice Palace . " Here we are . There 's Nick in the window . "  |p173Nick  had arranged a corner in the vast private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , one table . But you do n't want ' em all crowdingin on you , day like this . " He turned his back a moment . There was the unmistakable pop of a champagne cork . " On me . " He held the smoking bottle aloft for a moment . " Bollinger ' 47 . The bride and groom ! " " Now , Nick , " Thor remonstrated . " You know this is my party . " " That 's right . The champagne 's just so I get in good with the press . " And vanished . " I 'm going to like it here in Alaska , " Addie said . She looked around the table . " I like it already . " " Wait , " Ross Guildenstern said , " until the Eskimos boil you in seal oil , and the polar bears gobble you up , and the snow is over the rooftop , and there 's nothing to eat but caviar and champagne and Persianmelon and tenderloin of beef . " " Are all Eskimo men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My bride , " Paul Barnett said , plaintively , " on her wedding day . " The others laughed , but Ross said , gravely , " Wait till you see me in my pilot 's uniform . Kill you . " It was then that Chris , delighted , said , " I did n't know you were a pilot , Mr. Guildenstern . " Suddenly she felt very adult and worldly . Her first glass of champagne , her first wedding party . " I only fly a freight crate . Maybe some day they 'll give me a passengerplane . " " Why not now ? " Addie demanded , in character . He shrugged . " Eskimo , I guess . " " Nuts , " said the Reverend Haskell . " You flew in the war when you were about five years old , or thereabouts . " " That 's different . " " But Guildenstern ? " Addie pressed on . " My father was Danish . But no relation to the gentleman you 've met in the book . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guildenstern 's left temple , just below the hairline , there was a scar , it showed a thin white tracing against the darker skin.  |p174Chris  looked at it , fascinated , she felt an impulse to touch it , a strange impulse which was followed by a still stranger and more pervasive feeling . She must remember to ask her grandfather or perhaps Paul Barnett about that scar . Addie Barnett saved her the trouble . " Is that scar on your temple a war memento ? " " Not really . " Mead Haskell took over . " He 's war shy . " He glanced round the table . " Tell them the story , Ross . " But Guildenstern shook his head . " No old soldier 's reminiscences . They went out with the Civil War . " Paul Barnett said , " Mead , tell them about the time Father Gilhooleywas caught up there . " Then he and Mead began to laugh in the annoying way people have who know the joke . Thor Storm said , " If it 's as funny as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bridal party is a fine thing . " " That one ! " Ross jibed . " Some version of it in every country in every language in World War II . " Mead Haskell looked injured . " It really happened . But it 's grown kind of apocryphal , all the way from the South Pacific to Iceland . Well , this Father Gilhooley  --  you know him , Thor , he used to be up in Atkasuk  --  he 's a young missionary flying a little Piper and he has n't logged a million miles by a long shot . But he 's learning fast , kind of an eager beaver , and he gets up to Oogruk with the nurse he 's carrying and the runway is socked in . He ca n't come down , there 's no place to go , there 's no airstrip near . He calls down : " I 've got to come in . ' " ' Stay up . You ca n't come in , ' Ground Control says . " ' I 've only got gas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ' I 've got a nurse with me . ' " ' Stay up . ' " ' My engine 's coughing . ' " ' Ca n't come in . ' " ' God 's sake what 'll I do ! '  | " ' Repeat after me : Yisgaddal v'yiskaddash sh'meh rabbo , b'olmo d'vro kir'useh v'yamlich malchuseh , b'chayechon uv'yomechon uv'chayeh d'chol bes yisroel --  " Mead Haskell broke off into helpless laughter in which Ross joined . The others wore the resentful expression of the uncomprehending . " Very funny and all , I do n't doubt , " Bridie said , crisply . " But maybe if we knew what it meant it would seem funnier . " Contritely , Haskell and Ross became suddenly almost solemn . " Sorry . You see , Ground Control was a Jewish boy , and what he sent up to Father Gilhooley to repeat after him was the Hebrew Prayer for the Dead . " The faces of the others remained thoughtful . Christine was frowning . " Did he  --  did they die ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I saw Father Gilhooleylast week up in Kotzebue . " Ross Guildenstern said , " Your story 's a flop , Mead . You just wo n't learn . " " " Tell yours , " Mead urged . " At least it is n't supposed to be funny . " But he would not . Christine heard it later and remembered it always . So did the others , including Addie . But by that time World War stories were not even back-page news . It looked almost like a toy , a silver and scarlet toy , standing there on the runway , if any unknowing eye had seen it . But it was Alaska winter night . There in the tiny cockpit Ross Guildenstem took it up thirty-two thousand feet , at which point the plexiglass top blew off as completely as you would chip the top off a soft-boiled egg . With it went his oxygen and the headpiece that was his only connection with the mechanical reception of the world below him and perhaps around him in the air . But almost before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . Consciousness returnedas the plane nose-dived toward the earth . Instinctively he knew he must pull the ship up again into the comparative safety of the faraway sky . The toy was not planned for cruising in a lowp176altitude , the fuel would not last down there . He was safe as long as he could stay high , high . He pulled the plane up . Up . Get her up get her up get her up . There . Twenty-five thousand . Now again he lost consciousness . Again he awoke as the plane dived . Now , miraculously , below him in darkness , was the almost imperceptible suggestion of what might be Kinkaid Field . No headphone . No connection . Well , there was Kinkaid below him , if it really was Kinkaid and a goddamned miracleanyway even if he could n't set the ship down . No chance of settingit down , they must hear him down there , they could n't get to him , he might put her down on top of the General 's house for all he knew , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of his , they must look funny in bed , at that . Helpless he looked down at what might be Kinkaid Field , no gas ; helpless , the unseen faces must be turned up toward him , up there dead or alive in the little silver and scarlet toy that was dropping so swiftly toward the earth . In the small hut near the runway , Ground Approval Control repeated , " You 're too low ! You 're too low ! " though Ross could not hear him . Ground Control forced himself to resist the impulse to crouch and hug the floor as the toy seemed to skim the hair of his head . Ross came down almost gently , he put the plane down on the field in the darkness and they came running toward him and then the blackness came down over him again , he was a bundle , limp but living , as they lifted his body in the clumsy straps and trappings , the face battered and bloody . Nice work , they said to the unconsciousform . Nothing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A month later he was out of the hospital and flying another dainty silver and scarlet toy.  |p177Now  the real battle for Christine began . She was seventeen ; no longer a child , not yet a woman . " Washington State University is the place for her , " Czar said . " I do n't want her to go east to school , the way my  --  the way her mother did . No good came of that , that 's sure . Seattle , I can keep an eye on her , I 'll go see her , she can come home holidays . " " What 's wrong with Baranof College ! " Thor argued . " We 've got a course there in the humanities that Washington ca n't touch . And politicalscience and modern history and racial  --  " " That settles it ! What am I supposed to do ? Stand there while you make a long-faced Commie out of my Christine ! She 's going to Seattle . She 's going to mix with her equals . " Bridie , distracted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawks , now entered the fray . " Why do n't you let the child decide for herself ? Seventeen years old , she 's got a mind of her own . " " She has n't had the experience to decide a thing as important as this , " Czar said . " But she 's experienced enough to live in Seattle alone ? " " She wo n't be alone . Mrs. Husack and Dave and the Caswells and Kleet and that whole crowd will be looking after her . " " I was afraid of that , " Thor said . Bridie , fuming , burst into the battle again . " You two talk about Chris , you 'd think she was a slave or idiot or something . I 've always asked her opinion and let her try and decide  --  so have you , Thor ,  |p178I  'll say that for you  --  about anything she could . I always said , which do you like , the pink or the blue . You two are n't thinking of her , you 're thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't understand , Bridie . " " Understand ! I 've understood for seventeen years and more ever since I fed her with a medicine dropper . And I suppose Bridie Ballantynehas n't understood you these years and years , and Thor , too . I understand wolves trying to tear a lamb to pieces when I see ' em . " Czar shook his head , gently . " Hysterical . " He turned away from her , he looked only at Thor , it was as though the two men were alone in the room , battle-locked . " Christine is going to the university in Seattle , by the time she 's finished there she 'll be twenty-one , a woman grown , she 'll know how to behave in decent society . Louise Husack will be more like a mother than a chaperone , she says her house will be Christine 's second home . You might as well know I sent Christine 's application to the university three years ago . " Thor stood up now , the towering frame seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely dark , but the rosy face was mild , the tone reasoning . " I 'm as much Christine 's guardian as you are . You know that . Untilshe comes of age . After that she 'll be on her own . She 's adult even now , in her thinking . She must n't be bullied or tricked to do anything without her consent . " " She 's going to Seattle and civilization . " " Only if she wants to . And I think Alaska is civilized . " " She 's going around with a lot of mongrels here . And people too old for her . Radicals , to put it in flattering terms . That Guildenstern , I hear he 's been taking some kind of GI course at Baranof , and flyinga bush crate . " " That young man , " Thor said , " could make a plane singlehanded if he had to , out of oil drums and a Model T Ford . " " They 're all natural-born mechanics , those monkeys , I 'll say that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't want to know.  |p179But  that 's not saying I 'm going to allow my granddaughter to run around with one of them . " Cheerfully Thor chided him . " Now now , Czar , are you pretending you 've forgotten Christine is part Eskimo herself ? " Always ivory pale , Czar 's skin now took on a curious clay color like the waxen skin of the dead . His voice was low , monotonous , too controlled , as though it might have risen to a scream if he were to unleash it for only a moment . " I know that my daughter married your son . I suppose he was your son . I wish she had died first . " Bridie had often been witness to scenes between these two highpoweredmen , but early in this encounter she had sensed a feeling stronger , more passionate , than ever before . She once had seen a crude local painting of two moose bulls horn-locked in battle . She thought of this now . Bridie flung out her arm then , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that in front of me , Czar Kennedy , and go free of it . You 're wishing Chris herself dead when you say that , or never born at all . Shame to you ! " Czar ignored her . He was looking at Thor as one would stare , remotely , at a stranger . " I do n't know who you are . And I 'm going to find out . Fifty years , and I do n't know anything about you . Nobodyin Alaska does . " " There 's nothing to know , Czar . Nothing of any importance to you or to me or to Christine . " " Uh-huh . That 's why you 've kept your life a secret ? With your books and your wanderings and always yelling about freedom , and living in a log cabin like a pauper . I 'll tell you what I think . You 're a criminal . I 've thought so ever since I first saw you . You 'll have no rights to Christine , I 'm damn sure of that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone Baranof . I 'll spend all the money it takes . I 'll make it my business to find out . " " I would n't do that if I were you , Czar . " " I bet you would n't . Everybody knows me , knows where I came from , and my father 's name and my mother 's , and their fathers ' and mothers ' names , like any decent American family . Time I 'm through ,  |p180I  'll bet I 'll find out Christine has got a double taint on her , father and grandfather . " Addlepated though she might seem at times , Bridie Ballantyne , in a crisis , represented pure reasoning . " That case , I 'd think you 'd be better off , and Chris too , letting it lay . Unless you want to make a martyr out of her . Spite , if I ever saw it , Czar Kennedy . Pure mean spite . Spreading things around people should n't know , and none of their business . If I was to spread around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cops-and-robbers movie . And that includes you , Czar Kennedy . Maybe people know who you are , but do they know what you are ? I do . And Thor does . " Thor smiled down on her , his pink face radiating pleased surprise . " What have you been reading , Bridie ? " " You know I do n't get time to read . I 've just been listening to you for years and years , and Chris ever since she was old enough to make sense out of what you 've told her . " Czar got to his feet then , he pointed a finger , his arm outstretched , like an accuser in an old-fashioned melodrama . " That 's it ! He 's poisonedthe child with his crazy talk . Anti-American through and through . " " Know what I think ? " Bridie demanded , crisply . " I think you ai n't well , Czar . Putting it politely , that is . " He stared at Bridle with a cold and baleful eye . " Keep out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is between Thor and me . " " That 's right , " Bridie agreed , with awful affability . " I only brought the child up and kept her alive when --  " " Let 's go now , Bridie , " Thor suggested , quietly . " Running out , eh ? Scared . " Czar sat down now , he seemed suddenlyrelaxed as though his suspicions were at last justified . " I 'm just doing this to protect Christine . " " Not for your own satisfaction ? " Thor 's tone was quizzical , but the blue eyes were serious . " You must have taken me for a poor fool all this time . Why , years ago , when we first got here , they 'd take pictures of the crowd of us somewhere , one of the boys had struck it rich , maybe , or there was ap181jamboree of some kind , citizens of Baranof and so on . You always slunk away before the camera snapped . No man hides out unless he 's got a good reason for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And let me tell you , " Thor remarked , cheerfully , " slunking and hiding is a difficult feat for a man who is six feet four . " Bridie tactlessly and involuntarily giggled at this . A grayish film seemed to come down over Czar Kennedy 's eyes . " I 'll get detectives . Private detectives . They 'll trace you right back if it takes years . " The ruddy giant shook his head sadly . " I wish I could make you understand why you want to destroy me . I know . Your hatred is understandableto me . " " I do n't hate you . Though I know if it was n't for you my wife would likely be alive today , and my daughter , too , and I 'd probably have other grandchildren for my old age . " " That 's not the reason . It goes deeper than that . You ca n't forgive me for having shown you the way to success . You want to believe you started yourself , as everyone else believes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Even if it turned out that you made it a destructive way for Alaska ? " Lines of hatred carved themselves on Czar 's face , they curved from his nostrils to his lips , they were imbedded between his eyes . " You 're just evading the issue . I only know you 're not a fit person to have any guidance of my granddaughter . Bridie , here , that 's different . I know about her , I went to the trouble of looking up her past , she was a decent enough girl , her family in Ireland were decentpeople , she trained and nursed in a hospital in England , like she said , she nursed in Seattle , she came here and took care of those girls with the smallpox  --  well , she was only doing her work , after that she conducted herself in this town in a decent --  " " You 'll stop right there , Czar Kennedy , sitting there and acting like you 're God ! You with your banks and your newspaper and your buildings and your money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , is it ! ' Well , you ain't. "  |p182Mildly  , Thor interrupted Bridie 's tirade . " Why this sudden change , Czar ? We 've shared Christine 's upbringing , with Bridle as ballast , all through her childhood . " " It does n't matter so much what you tell a child . A child 's way of life is n't so important . She 's a young lady now -- - " " Oh , Czar , Czar ! Once you 've baked a cake , you know , you ca n't take the eggs or the milk out of it or the flour or the butter or the spice . They 're baked in , they 're ingredients of the whole , they 're in forever , until the actual thing itself is destroyed . Human beings are like that , too . Everything that goes in stays in . Christine is almost baked by this time , there 's only the icing to put on , plain or fancy . " " Oh , I 'm sick of you and your talk , Storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to make it impossible for you to have anything to say about my daughter 's child . I 'll tell you now , frankly , I 've been getting a line on you , they got as far as Minnesota and then it quit . But they 're working on it . No matter how far and how long and how much money it takes . " Thor nodded reminiscently as though surveying with pleasure a serene past . " Yes , I came to Minnesota and I worked in the wheat fields and in the woods , lumbering , with all the other Swenskys , as they called us  --  Norwegians like myself , and Danes and Swedes . All Scandinavians were Swenskys in America , I found . It was n't a bad life for a young fellow . Everything was big  --  the lakes and the hills and the fields and the forests . But I had n't come to America just for that , so I started across country , across this enormous land , from the North to the East , to Midwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had been in the countries of Europe , many of them . But this took my breath away , I had hoped it would be like this , and it was . Then I heard about this new Alaska land . Alaska was what I wanted , a new world not yet begun , or scarcely . That 's how we met . And well met , Czar , no matter what you say . It brought us Christine . " " No travel talks , please . Anyway , I know all that . They got that for me . " " It must have been disappointing . Just another big Swensky in a place full of big Swenskys. "  | " I 'll find out . I 'll find out . And when I do I wo n't have to sit and listen to you . My life is an open book . " " Dull reading , too , " Thor said , as though to himself . " In spite of all you 've managed , a monotonous life . Power is all you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all your life . " Suddenly Czar , the low-voiced , the self-contained , began to shout . " You leave my grandchild alone , Storm . I 'm warning you . Next week I 've got a man going over to Norway , he 'll track you , fifty years is nothing to him . " Bridie , the erstwhile nurse , looked at him and saw danger in the face , now flushed , that habitually was so colorless . " Now Czar , you 'll be sick , a man of your age . A stroke , if you 're not careful . " He glared at her . " Get out of this , Bridie . What are you doing here , anyway ! This is between the two of us . " Thor had been silent , his clear blue eyes fixed on Czar , speculatively . It was a look that Czar translated into defeat as Thor said , " You win , Czar . You can save yourself all that money for detectives and travel . They 'll trace me easily enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a villain in an old-time play . But now he seemed again suddenly benign , the beatific mask slipped down , a fine glaze , over his face . " Come to your senses , h 'm ? " Bridie was not accustomed to the role of listener . " Thor , do n't say something you 'll be sorry for . Alaska 's full of people who want to let their past life stay in the past . The world everywhere is full of people like that . What of it ! It 's what you are now , counts . " But Thor did not heed her . " I 'll make a bargain with you , Czar . If I tell you the truth about myself  --  and you can prove it easily  --  will you credit ten thousand dollars to Christine 's account in the Miners ' National Bank ? " " Take me for a fool ! " " It costs money to send men to Copenhagen and London and Paris and Stockholm and Oslo and New York . Salaries and ships and planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much cheaper to give it to Christine and let me tell you now . Besides all the trouble . "  | " How will I know you 're telling the truth ? " " You will know . From past experience . " He laughed then as at a little private joke . " But I warn you it will sound ridiculous . " " How do you mean  --  ridiculous . " He was suspicious at once . This was not a word he had expected . " Look here , I do n't want Bridie around in this . " But Bridie grasped the arms of her chair , she dug her heels into the heavy carpet , braced for the worst . " Do n't think you can make me go . Never . You 'll have to carry me out , the two of you . I 'll screech murder every inch of the way , they 'll hear me from this to the top of the lee Palace . " Thor laid a hand reassuringly on her shoulder . " Stay then , Bridie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He glanced at Czar . " For that matter , another promise from you . " " No , you do n't ! And I 'm not so sure about the first . I hand ten thousand dollars over to Chris . What for ? She is n't of age , what do you do ? Get it away from her ? " " If it was money I wanted I could have had plenty of it these past years . More than even you have piled up . I want Christine to have a little of her own . It 's a risky world for a penniless woman and she ca n't depend on you . She may not want to live the life you want for her . Then you 'll punish her . " " You talk too much , like most old men . Gab gab gab . " " I 'll make it brief as possible . You 'll write a check now , made out to Christine for ten thousand dollars . Bridie will hold the check until I 've said what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or both of you  --  feels that I 'm a possible disgrace to Christine  --  " "  --  then I 'll be sole guardian , " Czar finished for him . Thor considered this a moment , in silence . " Yes . With this second provision : Neither of you will ever speak of what I 'm going to tell you , to Christine or to anyone else . " He smiled genially at the palpitatingBridie . " That 's going to be harder for you than for Czar , here . " He waited a moment . " Promise . " " I promise . " She raised her right hand , dramatically . " Oh , Thor , I hope it 's nothing too bad , though who 's free of black moments ?  |p185I  always say , if everybody had killed the person they 've said , one time or another , they 'd like to kill , why , the world would be depopulatedby now . " Czar had taken a slim little checkbook from an inner pocket , his pen from another . He wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could rise , Bridie had whisked across the room to snatch it . Almostmenacingly Czar warned her . " None of your tricks , Bridie Ballantyne . I 'm not above taking it from you by force . " He looked at Thor . " I 'll promise , but it 's for Christine . " Bridie began to giggle again , what with nervousness and an overwhelmingIrish sense of the ridiculous . " It 's as good as a play , but I feel foolish . " " So do I , " Thor said , very low , as though to himself . " Stop mumbling ! Get it out ! Unless you 're making a fool of both of us . " " No . No , I 'm not . The truth is , Czar , I come of a stock and class that would be called old-fashioned now , here in modern American Alaska . I come of the Scandinavian nobility  --  Norwegian as you know  --  but the Norwegian royal family is all mixed up in its history and its politics with the Swedish nobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Czar repeated the word , dully , as though not quite hearing . He did not , in fact , understand what Thor was trying to tell him . " What d' you mean  --  nobility ? " " I was nowhere in line for the crown , I do n't mean that . But I was a student , I wanted only to study and know . Everyone knew that Oscar would resign in time  --  " " Oscar ? " Czar said , almost feebly . " The King . But of course he was n't a Norwegian , he was a Dane , and then when he gave up the crown in 1906 , Haakon came in  --  another Dane  --  he had been Prince Charles of Denmark , as you know --  " " Well , sure , " Bridie gasped. "  --  and his wife , Queen Maud , was English , the youngest daughterp186of Edward of England . By that time I had gone , and well out of it . I was to have married a Danish --  " "  --  princess ! " Bridie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Czar said , slowly . " I do n't believe a damned lying word of this stuff . Ridiculous , you said . And ridiculousit is . " Simply , Thor said , " My papers are in the bank box in Seattle . They 've been there for years and years , since the day you and I met on the boat that brought us here . You can see them . I want you to . " Smiling , he turned to Bridie . " No , Bridie , my dear , she was n't a princess , though she 's a princess now , if she 's still alive , which I think she is n't . A nice girl , I remember , though a shade dull , and rather long in the tooth . " Bridie drew herself up , she seemed to gain inches in stature , she looked about her from heights not attainable by the herd . " All these years , " she said , in a voice of awed wonder , " all these years here I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . " " I 'm sorry to spoil your dream , Bridie , but that is n't quite so . All the aunts and uncles and cousins would have had to be killed or removed before the political hand could fall upon me . I was hardly more than a boy  --  a student  --  but I always disliked form and ceremonyand fuss  --  though there was little of it all at that democratic court . They 're more democratic , really , than we are here in the United States . I was proud of them in this last war . What courage , what dignity , when the country was occupied and over-run . I sometimesthought they might all be destroyed ; and the cities . When I heard what the barbarians did to Holland . Well , I was out of it half a century before that . Every now and then some young rebel beats his wings against the golden bars . Usually it does n't turn out quite right . Take that young King of England  --  young enough , at least  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only exchanged a golden prison for a shabby brass one . " " If all this fairy-tale bunk is true , how is it they have n't been after you all these years ? "  | " I was n't important enough . If I were to go back now , no one would remember me , or care . " " That girl  --  what became of that girl you did n't marry ? " Bridle , the romantic . " She married someone else , I once came on a magazine picture of her taken with the family . They all looked alike , those girls , but I recognized her , she had n't changed so much . An old lady , very thin and spare , she looked just as she used to , not even much older , though half a century had gone by . She sat straight as a stick in her good satin dress and her good rope of pearls and her long jaw and her nice eyes , as though some one had etched some wrinkles with a pencil on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court convention had n't changed , really . " Almost  --  but not quite defeated , Czar put a last question , foolishly . " If it 's true  --  and I do n't swallow it by a damn sight  --  what do you want here ? What are you doing here ? What have you got out of it ! " " I 've lived the life I wanted to live . I 've earned my living as you know , fishing in the summer season , trapping in the winter , I 've studied the people , I 've read and learned . And I started the little weekly paper . And I 've written . In another three years Christine will be twenty . Twenty ! I was twenty only yesterday . I 've seen this great icy treasure land plundered and almost wrecked by men like you , Czar . It 's an anachronism in this day and age , it 's like a story you 've read out of the past . But I 've put it all down , day after day , year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Russians , the traders , the Hudson 's Bay crowd , the New England shipowners , this place they called Seward 's Folly and Seward 's Icebox when it becamepart of this country . And then Congress after Congress and Administration after Administration that would allow no settler to take title to land , or clear a bit of wilderness land and claim it . And the plunderers , the robbers with their lobbies in Washington . I 've got it all down now  --  or almost all . Maybe no one will ever read it . The history of this Alaska , locked in her ice palace , with Outsiders holding the golden key . " Czar stood up , his hands in his pockets , he began to pace the room ,  |p188he  threw a glance over his shoulder at Thor , as though to catch him unawares . Suddenly , " Christine know this ? Any of it ? " " No , no ! I told you that . That 's the bargain . " " What would her  --  uh  --  her title be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of a fella whose father is supposed to be a  --  well , anyway , was -- - " " You see how foolish it sounds ! Counts are passe and barons and kings and queens and princesses . Even bogus kings like you and that great noisy Husack and little Kleet who is like a jackal at one of the twelfth-century courts  --  even you are passing . By the time Christine is a woman and has children of her own you and all your kind will be as mythical as old-fashioned royalty . I hope . " But Czar was not listening , he was pursuing his own thoughts . Almost wistfully he mused aloud . " I 'd have liked Christine to be a  --  what was it ?  --  a  --  " " She is n't . If you repeat any of this I 'll deny it . I 'll deny it as a joke . Old Thor , the Swensky . Thor , the blacksmith . What a snob you are , Czar ! You build banks and movie houses and high buildings . You pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You two , " Bridie commanded , emerging from her daze , " stop calling each other names and get practical . It was Chris 's schooling started this , so let 's go back to it . " She eyed Czar craftily . " I 'm holdingthis check for ten thousand , made out to Chris . I guess you do n't think what Thor 's been telling us is a disgrace , exactly . Well , then ? " " Let 's have her in , " Thor said , " and done with it . It 's her education , it 's her life , no three old people should make this decision for her . " " Now ? " " Now . " " Where is she ? " Czar demanded , irritably . Bridie , very brisk now , was already at the telephone . " Down at the Northern Light , probably , waiting for the breakup news to come in . She and her crowd got together made a pool , five dollars apiece ,  |p189Chris  bet on the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual winter . " " Oh , stop clacking and get her , " Czar said . " I want this settled now . Today . " " Neurotic behavior , " Thor observed ; and strolled over to the glassfrontedbookcase where he stood surveying the titles , a look of unbeliefon his face . " No , " Bridie was saying , at the telephone . " No , nobody 's sick . I tell you , Chris , they ai n't . It 's just important , something 's got to be settled . No , now . Right now . I do n't care if you might win a hundred thousand dollars in the ice breakup , anyway it 's always won by some construction worker nobody ever heard of . Well , you get yourself over here , your Grandpas say . " Bridie hung up . " She 's coming . " She held at arm 's length the check in her hand . " What you boys want to do with this ? One of you put it in the bank , for Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Czar snapped . " But it 's not to be used till she 's twentyone . Interest till then . And she 's not to know . " " Pooh ! A lot of fuss over a bit of money like that . Your friends spend that for a nice little car , in the States . " She began to bustle needlessly about the room , straightening a window shade already straight , plumping a cushion , adjusting a lamp shade . Thor had resignedly taken a book from the shelf and was seated reading , his steel-rimmed spectacles slipped halfway down his nose . Czar , at his desk , jotted down figures on a scrap of old envelope . When a car stopped abruptly with a snort of engine and a squeal of brakes , the three stayed as they were , frozen in attitude , like figures in a children 's game of statue . Four heads could be discerned at the car windows . " Unless it 's something serious make it snappy , " a voice called . " We 'll wait . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehensively from one to the other . " What 's the matter ! What happened ! " Czar put down his pen , Thor closed his book , Bridie came over to her and plucked at her parka . The girl shrugged away from her , her eyes were wide with alarm.  | " Nothing . Nothing , " Czar said , smoothly . " What is it ? Come on ! I 'm braced for it . Something dreadful has happened . " The three looked a little foolish now that they were confronted with the lovely anguished face . Mischievously Thor explained , " Czar here wants to discuss some plans for your education . " She stared . She repeated the word . " You mean nobody 's sick , and you 're not killing each other , and the house has n't burned down ? " She looked so terribly young and vulnerable ; they felt so old and foolish . " Well , " Czar began , sheepishly , " we felt the time has come to decideabout your education . The three of us , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all ? " Thor sat smiling at her over his spectacles . Czar said , " All ! " somewhatfeebly . There was a moment of awkward silence before Bridie bustled into jumbled speech . " Three people trying to do their best for you , wanting you to get the education they did n't have "  --  then , hastily , eying Thor  --  " anyway , two of us . And all you can say is all . Czar says Washington State , Thor says Baranof --  " Chris cut in like a whiplash . " And you 've brought me here , scared numb , to talk about education when the breakup is due any minute , you can hear the ice groaning  --  of course my bet was n't until next week  --  but it may freeze again and if the ice starts moving and the tripod starts wiggling they 'll get the flash first thing at the Northern Light --  " A horn sounded outside  --  not loudly , not impertinently , just a small questioning squawk. "  --  and besides , I 've decided about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring it up just today ? " " We realize , " Czar said , heavily deliberate , " that the annual ice breakup is more important to you than any four years of college , no matter where .... Still , the ice break comes every year at about this time , and you 'll only be eighteen once  --  unless I 'm mistaken . " She melted then , she became their child again for a moment , she looked at them and her young face that had been hard with resent/ment mirrored a pang of understanding and compassion . In a little rush she kissed Bridie , she kissed the protesting Czar , she kissed Thor , her fresh cheek pressed a moment against their unresilient skin . " I decided long ago . I 'm going to Baranof two years and then to Washington State two years . I put in my applications long ago , Ross told me you have to , with all those GI rights --  " Czar turned a baleful eye on Thor . " See what I mean ? " "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again outside , a querulous pip-pip . " They 're waiting for me . Oh , how you scared me , you bad darlings ! " She was out of the room , she was outside , they could hear her calling as she ran . " I 'm coming ! Nothing . Not a thing . They just --  " " Learn you , I hope , " Bridie said to the two silent men . " She 's grown up . "  |p192Later  Baranof boasted that Chris Storm could pilot a floatplane , drive a car , mush a team of nine huskies , paddle a skin boat , handle an outboard motor , cut up a seal with an ulu and mix the best sourdough pancakes in Baranof . Only this last accomplishmentmade her the envy of the town 's more solid citizens . She had inherited her sourdough starter from Thor , who had originally come by it from a prospector on one of his Far North journeys . Melting , feather-light , delectable , the golden circlets were a more potent asset than all of Christine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helped pull in a beluga white whale , caught king salmon . She could knit and wear a sweater expertly . In her second and last Baranof College year Chris appeared at the final big dance in a slinky black strapless dress . The effect , with all that blondeur , was devastating . All the other girls were in bouffant pink or blue or white . Anyone less fundamentally liked than Chris would not have had a female friend left by midnight . Most of the male population of Baranof would have been more or less in love with her if they had not been  --  again more or less  --  afraid of her . She did too many things too well . Biceps-flexers and six-footers were most easily discouraged . Thor said , " Self-reliance , Christine , that 's the important thing in Alaska . In life . I want you to be able to do all the things an Alaskan may have to do , one place or another . " Czar , fuming , protested . " Is he trying to make one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p193How  's it happen they have n't got you playing fullback on the Baranof football team ! " Bridie 's objection was more practical and pungent . " I never yet saw a woman could catch a husband because she could do everythingbetter than he could . It is n't nature . Breaks them down to see a girl outsmart them . " " I do n't want to catch a husband . Anyway , not for years and years and years . And he 'll come without catching . " " The way you girls dress nowadays , I guess the men think they do n't have to marry you . Those shorts in the summer , nothing on you from here down . And in the winter , at the dances , nothing coveringyou from here up . Reminds me of a joke the nurses used to tell in the hospital when they were washing the patients , they  --  no , I guess not . Anyway , all I know is , if the girls in the Last Chance and the Poke and the All Nations when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd worn that kind of getup , why , the men would 've taken off their coats to cover them ; or run them out of town . An ankle-length skirt on the street was considered fast . " " Do you think that was good ? " " Well , no , I do n't . Not now . Things change . The way girls dress now is better . Healthier , I mean . Necks free , legs free , waist free , you can breathe right . But there 's always the chance of overdoing a good thing . That 's the trouble . " " The trouble is I 've got three parents . You do n't like this , Grampa Czar does n't like that , Grampa Thor likes something else . Why ? I do n't try to do anything other people do n't do . " " Yes , but you do them all , and better . Next thing you know , you wo n't have a friend speak to you , boy or girl . Miss Perfect . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling . Anyway , I can always count on you , ca n't I ? " " Maybe so . " She tried to make it sound grudging . " There I 'll be , like the girl in those nasty ads , always a bridesmaid , never a bride . Wo n't it be wonderful ! " The two old men had solemnly shaken hands on their pact as they had clasped hands in their first agreement many years before . Therep194was something fantastic about their unspoken understanding that two years of this vital girl 's life would belong to Thor , two years to Czar . But Christine went blithely on , living the carefree existence she always had known , strangely unspoiled by the omnipresent and omniscient Thor and Czar and Bridie . Do this . Do that . We 're here to protect you . Each old man was , in his own way , fanatic . Czar 's plans for Chris were drawn up complete in his mind , a mental blueprint . Thor sensed this , he had two years in which to circumvent these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not ethically explain to Christine , he had no one to whom he could confide his apprehensions except Bridie ; and he knew she would not wholly understand . " I 'd like you to understand how I feel about Christine 's education these next two years , Bridie . I 'm not planning to change her . I want her to grow . I want her to emerge free just as I want to see Alaska emerge free . I 'm afraid Czar thinks of her as being expendable just as Alaska is expendable to him . Do you see what I mean ? He gave Alaska movies and shops and newspapers and high buildings , all with his name on them . His brand . So he 'll give her clothes , Outside travel , parties , piano , television , Husacks , Caswells , luxury . To use her as he uses the lobbies in Washington . " " Now , Thor , fair 's fair . Czar loves Chris as much as you do . He 's loaded with money . It 's only natural he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his only grandchild . " " Bridie , Bridie , that is n't what I mean ! " Alaska , too , went blithely about its business of life , now surroundedin the air , on the ground , under the ground , on the sea , under the sea , and on the mountaintops by the most modern and appalling machinery of war , against war , and for war . Armies , planes , radar , directed missiles , rays , spotters . Alaska lived like a prankish boy smoking a cigarette in an arsenal . Christine 's childhood years of close association with the three who were thrice her age had established a fundamental pattern of thinkingand doing . She took part in the social life of the college and thep195town , but there was some complaint among the more amorous young men and the frivolous young women . " Chris is fun , " they said , the one to the other . " She can do anything . But then she sounds off about politics and territorial rights and absentee owners and stuff . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who is n't ! But does she get steamed up about it ! You 'd think she was addressing Congress or something . " In her spare hours Chris was likely to be seen drifting in and out of the Daily Lode city room , or happily ensconced at a desk in the Northern Light office , reading proof or typing a column of college news . Best of all , she liked the evenings spent at the Barnetts ' . Housing shortage  --  that condition which , since the end of World War II , had taken on the proportions of an epidemic  --  was an old story in Baranof . Since the early Nineties , when the first tent of the first prospectors was tipsily pitched on the beach , Baranof had outgrown its shelter . Construction workers poured in ; government workers , civil , professional , business . They sent for wives and childrenand these swarmed off the planes and adapted themselves , cheerfully or complainingly , to a fantastic new way of life . The DEW Line  --  the magic Distant Early Warning of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to weave its web across a frozen waste that never before had known the foot of man . Robots in heavy boots and wool-lined jackets and carrying metal boxes of their precious tools clumped down the plane stairs . " Five hundred a week , and grub , " they had argued with their protestingwives back home . " Five hundred a week for Cri 's sake , for six months ! And when I get back we can build us a house right here and live in it the rest of our lives , and a yard for the kids . It 's only six months . A year at the most . Suppose it was a war ! You 'd get along without me . You 'd have to . " The terrible loneliness of distant places sometimes was too much for them . The curious lack of pressure , the strange , almost hypnotic power of the climate and the magnetic air , wooed others . For some , the boundless fishing and hunting made a male paradise . They sent for wives and children ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always were those who , seized with the claustrophobiafamiliar to the region , bound to any one of a score of towns ringed by towering mountains , vast waters , morasses of tundra , wastes of snow and ice , went berserk . These crowded the courtrooms , filled the jails . Anything with four walls and a roof , in which a man could stand upright , was a dwelling . Paul and Addie Barnett lived in an abandoned saloon . It had been a relic of Baranof 's early gold-rush days . In two years Addie had transformed the battered boarded-up structure into one of the most attractive dwellings in town , and certainly the most popular . Before his marriage Paul 's bachelor quarters had been one grubby room at the rear of the Northern Light print shop . A cot-bed , a chair , a lopsidedchest of drawers , a shelf for books ( they had overflowed onto the floor ) and such flotsam and jetsam as might wash up from the front office ; galley proofs , a pile of old Outside newspapers , a spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod  --  standard Alaska equipment , these  --  though Paul was not inclined toward sports . Before Addie 's arrival Paul had desperately tried to find a house or part of a house or two rooms somewhere , anywhere . The Ice Palacewas an unattainable dream . Defeated , he had attempted to lighten the grimness of his little room . Bridie and Christine took over . They hung curtains . With a cover and gay cushions they tried to transform the bed into what they termed a studio couch . Paul , with Addie 's red hair in mind , fondly painted the walls the clear blue she loved . Linoleum now covered the gritty floor , a blue cotton rug in front of the couch broke the bareness of the room . Finally , on the day of her arrival as though in desperation to convince himself that this now was a home fit for a bride , Paul had bought and hung a somewhat grim local painting of mountains , ice , and snow , and had arranged a bowl of flowers on the precariously slanting chest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little two-room apartment on the top floor of an old remodeled mansion facing the Charles . Her more solvent beaux , her editors , her old Boston family friends andp197an occasional lavish newspaper interviewee had accustomed her to the dim cosiness of the Ritz bar and the delectable cuisine of the stately pillared Ritz dining room facing the Public Garden ; or to the succulent broiled lobster at Locke-Ober 's , the scarlet shells and claws gleaming in contrast with the smoke-blackened oak walls . After the wedding , Addie and Paul , his arm about her , had stood in the doorway surveying this wistful little makeshift dwelling . For the tenth time , Paul repeated the plaintive facts . " Now you know why I kept writing you not to come , though I wanted you so . I wanted to get a decent home for you , first . There is n't a house in town . Not a shack , even . The week before you came I began to think about how I could murder a whole family  --  any family living in any house  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the slant of that chest ! " " It 's perfect , " Addie said in a tone that would have convinced anyone who was not looking at the room . And at that moment the big press out front began to run off the weekly edition , thump thump thump thump , shaking the whole rickety building . They looked at each other , grinning , then they broke into hysterical laughter , leaning on each other for support or perhaps solace , their arms tight about each other . They settled down in Baranof without a honeymoon . Perhaps settling down was scarcely the term to apply to the newly wed Addie . She was , some thought , a shade too bossy for a bride . She called him Barnett , for example . Not Paul , but Barnett . When she did this he looked bemused with adoration , as though she had addressed him with some fragrant endearment distilled from the very essence of love . " Look , Barnett , " she said now . " I 've traveled across the entire United States from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever it 's called , to get to you . And I 've got . Here I am . Honeymoonor no honeymoon , I want to stay and catch my breath . I do n't want to start to go back Outside where I just came from . " " Start to go back Outside where I just came from , " he repeated ,  |p198his  head critically cocked . " What sentence construction for a Radcliffegirl ! " " Someday we 'll have a honeymoon . We 'll go to California or Honoluluor Greece or Italy . Just now , Barnett darling , can we afford a house or something  --  if we can find it ? " " I 'm not  --  we 're not poor . Of course nobody 's rich in Alaska . Except , perhaps , Czar Kennedy . It 's just that everything costs three times as much as it does anywhere else . Everything goes out of Alaska , and nothing stays in . Including money . Nobody can save any money  --  that is  --  money . " " I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course I 've read all the editorials and articles in the Northern Light . But I want you to talk to me about it . Because we 're going to work on it , are n't we ? And on getting a house . A house in order , and then Alaska in order . Golly , Barnett , this is going to be wonderful ! " Paul Barnett was no worm . " My brain and your drive , we 'll have to watch it . That 's the way dictatorships are made , if you 're not careful . " She did find the house . And she did have a share , with Paul , in shaping the Territory 's battle against the rapacious enemy . The house was a time-ravaged and abandoned saloon , known in its heydayas The Placer Gold . The business center of the town had grown away from the once-pretentious two-story building . Now its dirtfilmedbroken windows stared out like old cataracted eyes , upon a respectable residence street . Gold Street , three blocks distant , had become the main business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indignantly demanded that the building be condemned and demolished . But it was one of the many pieces of property owned by the town 's most fantastic character , Butterfly Megrue . Even the City Council , the Chief of Police , and the Citizens ' Committee for a Bigger Busier and Better Baranof shrank from tangling with Butterfly . Butterfly , fifty years ago , had been a Baranof dance-hall girl in the best fictional tradition of those lively ladies . Fragile-seeming , in those days , her eyes had been a heartbreaking violet , her hair a true golden , her skin pink and whitep199and poreless as Chinese porcelain . Strangers , now encountering Butterflytramping the streets of Baranof in a mismated pair of men 's broken shoes , rags of castoff clothing and a travesty of a picture hat topped by a gangrenous flower , thought that this was , indeed , a Butterflybroken on the wheel . Little did they know of the punishment the wheel had taken . Thriftily and cannily she had come by her real estate in the early days of the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old bottles and newspapers and cardboard boxes and tin cans . She was said to collect fabulous rents , her taxes were second only to Czar Kennedy 's , she lived in a one-room rat 's nest . Her invectivewas blue as a king 's blood . Baranof regarded her with every courtesy , compassion and kindness . There was something touching and truly spiritual in the town 's protection of this raddled relic . There was considerable risk attendant on venturing a " Good morning , Butterfly ! " She might return the greeting with a smile that would have been poignantly lovely had it not been for the broken brown teeth ; or she might envelop you with a spume of obscenity . Once , on a particularly gaudy television program celebrating Baranof'sold Sourdough Days , Bridie Ballantyne had rashly invited Butterfly to speak as one of the many guests . The Mayor had spoken ; the President of the City Council ; the town 's leading merchant , Wade Zangs , of the Far North Trading Company ; Ott Decker , Secretaryof the Baranof Chamber of Commerce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went into a somewhat nervous introduction . " You 've listened to what the well-known men citizens of Baranof have had to say . The Old-Timers , the Young-Timers and the GoodTimers . So now let 's hear something of the thoughts of a lady who has been a citizen of Baranof since its earliest days  --  though she does n't look it . Successful in real estate , in commercial ventures ... " Butterfly Megrue had been washed brushed dressed . Even the cruel glare of the camera 's eye , and the years of neglect and malnutritionwere defied by the triumphantly lovely bone structure of the face . Battered , beaten , degraded , the line from the cheekbonep200to the jaw , from the brow to the mouth , from the mouth to the chin , still had the indestructibility of marble . " Butterfly , " Bridle cooed , " will you tell us what you think of Baranoftoday , compared to the town you knew so many years ago ? " Butterfly stared out , a direct and malevolent glare . " I sure will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonsabitchin ' government tax collectors --  " Instantly she was off the air . Neither the Lode nor the Northern Light would use it , naturally . But the mukluk grapevine served as well . It was this formidable nymph against whom Addie Barnett , the newcomer , was to do battle for a home . The bride had been six months in Baranof and three months pregnant before her desperate eye alighted and lingered , with a horrible yet fascinated speculation , on the gruesome shambles of what had been the old Placer Gold saloon . Its elaborate fretwork , its second-story gabled overhang , the proportions of the erstwhile barroom , set her imagination soaring . She picked her precarious way around to the side of the structure and , partially cleansing a small surface of dirt-encrusted window with a handkerchief and spit , made a shield of her hands as she peered . A high-ceilinged room , surely forty feet long and twenty wide , wainscoted with what actually looked to be mahogany . Remnantsof what once had been a mirror still clung to one wall , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reflected . Her heart pumping hotly with excitement she slithered and teetered to the rear of the house , ascended the four steps to the back door , tried the knob , the door yielded . The remnants of a kitchen . Mice droppings , cobwebs , the dust of years . With a fearful glance about her she went into the big front room . For some reason she tiptoed . A broken stairway led to the second floor . She paused . Then , with a look behind her , she cautiously ascended the stairs . One small room at the back . A second room . And at the front a third with a fine semicircular curve that once had been a bay window . That was the overhang she had noted outside . Three rooms . Three bedrooms ! In this last room there was a broken slop jar and , on thep201floor in a corner , a large china washbasin ornamented with a pattern of flowers and faded gilt . As she stared at these mementos Addie recalledhaving seen a washbowl like it filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique shops . Price , fifty dollars . She stood a moment , breathing deeply , her eyes shut . She clatteredswiftly down the perilous stairs , was out of the house ( shutting the back door carefully ) . Paul Barnett , bent over his desk in the Northern Light office , sprang up startled at sight of her . She was breathing fast , her eyes were wide . " What 's the matter ! What 's happened ! " " I 've found a house . " " What house ? " She described it . He said , " You 're crazy . " " It could be wonderful . You know what they 've done to old wrecks in Boston . I 've got two thousand dollars saved . I 'm going to buy a lathe . You were going to buy a car . What do we want with a car ! Nobody can drive more than twelve miles out of Baranof in any direction , and you know it . Car ! We can have a house . Three bedrooms ! " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were streamingunheeded down her cheeks . " Butterfly Megrue wo n't sell any property . She wo n't repair anythingand she wo n't sell anything . " " I can try . Will you let me have one thousand dollars ? " " You know you can have anything I 've got . " Then , at something in her face , " No monkeyshines . No murders . " " just money and strategy , Barnett dear . " She wrote it , saw it set up , read proof on it , smuggled it in when he was busy elsewhere . SORE EYES AND EYESORESAn object of beauty is sometimes called a sight for sore eyes . An eyesore has quite a different meaning . In Baranof , the ramshackle wrecks of what oncep202were houses or buildings , now fallen into decay , are eyesores . They not only offend the gaze of the passer-by and give the visitor the impression of an impoverished and neglected town , but they are a potential hazard to lives in case of fire or collapse , There is said to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to order the destruction of these buildings . It is rumored that the buildings designated are the one midway in the block on GlacierDrive between Fox and Fifth ; another on Otter between Snow and Tillicum , and others at .. , Butterfly had visited the Federal Building , the Mayor 's office and the Northern Light before the week 's grist of papers was fully off the press . It was said her screeches made the noise of a jet plane just then passing overhead seem , in comparison , like the cooing of a dove . Addie was waiting . " Come on in here , " she said , maneuvering the distraught creature into the back room . " Now just sit down , Butterfly , and tell me all about it . " For a few minutes she listened quietly to the flood of invective . " Look , Butterfly , I have a plan . You can fool them . If Barnett and I promise to clean up the place , and paint it and sort of mend it , so that it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you agree to rent it at ... " The thing was done . Papers were signed , a payment made . It was not until two weeks later that Thor Storm heard the story , and then it was too late to do more than lecture Addie Barnett on the Alaska code of ethics . Addie had attacked the rehabilitation of the house with a fury of efficiency . Rags , mouse nests , unspeakable mattresses , broken bits of wood , cobwebs , sawdust , paper  --  all the refuse of a house abandoned for years  --  had to be not only removed but hauled away . Back-yard bonfires were considered madness in that region of dry air and wooden housing . Paul and Addie actually were occupying the great front room and the kitchen of the old saloon while the work of reconstruction was going on . They worked evenings , early mornings , Sundays . Thor ,  |p203newly  returned from a two weeks ' trip to the north , scanned the two back numbers of the Northern Light . He then turned his attention to Addie 's tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , children , I hear you have a house . " " Is n't it wonderful ! " Addie trilled , with perhaps a shade too many flute tones . " You happy about it , Paul ? " Paul was silent a moment . Then he looked straight at the man whose loyal disciple he had chosen to be . " I 'm happy to have a house . There are other aspects of it I 'm not so happy about . " " That 's good . " He smiled his strangely sweet childlike smile . " I 'd like to talk to you a minute , Addie . And Paul . " " Now ! " She rattled the sheets of copy paper in her hand . " I 'm just trying to get this stuff out , we 're going to press at three --  " " No , not now , Addie . Not here . I 'll drop in on you at the house tonight about eight . " " Oh , dearie , it 's a mess ! I do n't want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his face . A compassionate sternness carved lines upon it . " I 'll be there at eight . " The long days had already begun . Eight in the evening was bright daylight . They had had their supper in the kitchen , they were busy with measurements which , calculated to cut off a twelve-foot section from the long front room , would provide a partitioned dining room . " Oh , dear , he probably remembers this place from the bad old days . " Addle was being pert in an attempt to conceal her nervousness . " Will he reminisce ? " Paul , in shirt sleeves and work pants , balancing on a ladder as he jotted down figures , gazed down upon her with love and tender reproach . " I hope so . But he does n't do much of that . I think he has something else to say , tonight . " " Sh ! There he is . Come in , come in ! " She ran to the door . Paul heard her say , perversely , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the old days . " " Not as many as I should have , perhaps . " He entered the bigp204room , he stood looking about it , a giant of a man , ruddy , the shock of yellow hair silvered now . " In those days "  --  Addie threw a triumphantlook at Paul  --  " the saloon was the warm pleasant place that welcomed you for the price of a drink  --  or no drink . It was the clubhouse , cheerful and hospitable . And the girls were a comfort and a help to many a lonely man . " He stopped abruptly , he measured the room again with his encompassing gaze . " Paul , this is a fine room . It can be a good home for you and your family , until you can build one . Addie began to talk with great vivacity . " Do you know what I 've noticed since we began to clean and scrub up ! On dampish days the most delicious saloony smell comes out of the floor and the walls and the woodwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice and cheap perfumery  --  I hope it 's patchouli , it always is in the novels  --  and sawdust and beer and cigars . Maybe it 's ghosts . " The two men were looking at her quietly , fondly . Her voice trailed off . Silence for a moment . Here it comes , Addie thought . But Thor Storm only remarked , as though suddenly recalling a message , " Oh , I saw Ross Guildenstern , he was pilot on my trip up to Oogruk . He told me to tell you he wants to give you a polar-bear rug if you 're going to put in a fireplace . Or even if you 're not . He shot it himself this past winter . " " How wonderful ! " Addie trilled . " I saw him only last week . He did n't mention it . " " Eskimos do n't like to be thanked . " " How interesting ! " Addie murmured . Paul came down from the ladder . " I 'll bring you a chair from the kitchen , Thor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . " " Tell her then . Or do you want me to ? " " You 're young and in love . I 'll say it . " " What in the world are you two talking about ! " Her tone was a little shrill for the smile that accompanied it , " Have I murdered somebody ! " " Murder and rape and theft and all the sad crimes committed Out/side are to be found right here in Alaska . I have no jurisdiction over those . I just report them in the columns of the Northern Light . But the conduct of the newspaper  --  the physical and ethical conduct  --  that 's my business , and Paul 's . We accept paid ads and announcementsif they are respectable . But the news and editorial columns of the paper ca n't be used for personal gain . You 're a newcomer to Alaska , Addie  --  " " Oh , you 're all so snobbish about your Alaska . I know what you 're going to say . But what have I done that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was falling down  --  " " You are on the staff of the paper , and you used its columns for your own personal gain . You ran a news item that was entirely untrue . You knew it was untrue . " " But people are complaining . Just last week Ott Decker told me that the Chamber of Commerce and the City Council --  " " That was after your article , " Paul interrupted , quietly . " It 's a good thing , then . Now maybe they 'll do something about it . " " What you did was n't a good thing . " two are making a fuss about a tiny little nothing . " " That tiny nothing , blown up in the Daily Lode , could undo everything I 've tried to accomplish for the good of Alaska in the past fifty years . " She turned to her husband , she grasped his arm and shook it as though to rouse him to her defense . " Tell him , Barnett ! I had to have a house . I had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd bring up my child in the back room of a newspaper office ! Maybe what I did was n't exactly according to the newspaper code . But my reason for doing it was right . Tell him , Barnett ! Tell him ! You two standing there like prophets out of the Bible or something . " " Security , " Thor said , quietly . " All women want security . And they 're right , in a way . But the whole country may go down to ruin if people want security more than anything else . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about ! " Addie sobbed.  |p206Paul  's arm came round her , he grinned fondly down at the distraughtface . " Yes you do , Addie . You 're just playing dumb . Rememberwhat that writer said  --  I 've forgotten his name  --  but he said : You ca n't go on the street to earn a trousseau. "  |p207It  was June . Three months of Arctic summer , three monthsof daylight twenty-four hours around the clock before the wintry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced every growing thing into fabulous maturity . A month ago there was ice on the rivers and lakes and inlet . Now they were merry with the shouts of swimmers . The cabbages , the roses , the rhubarb , the delphinium seemed to spring overnight ( or overday ) from seed or bulb to full-grown product . Christine Storm , too , in those blindinglybrilliant months , emerged from the chrysalis of girlhood into womanhood . " In a way , then , " Thor had said that first week in June , " these next two years belong to me , so far as Chris 's education is concerned . In a way . " The two men were conferring warily in Czar 's little private apartment on the top floor of the Lode Building . No one would disturb them there ; no cat-footed Gus , as at Czar 's house ; no Bridie burstingvolubly into a meeting planned without her ; no Chris sauntering in with a fondly amused , " What are you two evil guardians plotting against your defenseless grandchild ? " " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze was directed coldly past and beyond Thor , as though surveying with distaste the two years that lay in the future . " I ca n't see that . In what way ? " Quietly , patiently , Thor reviewed the facts so well known to both . " We know she 's going to be at Baranof College for two years . That was what I had hoped . Christine had decided that for herself . I wasp208pleased , naturally . It 's understood . So nothing has to be settled about that . " " Nothing ? " " Of course there 's her tuition and her other expenses . They 'll be paid by me . If she prefers to live out at the college I 'll pay her board and room at the dormitory . " " Dormitory ! " Now at last Czar turned his gaze full on the other . His eyes were agate . " When she goes to Seattle two years from now she 'll be on her own . Those are your two years . It may be that here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free of two old men . " " Free of two old men ! " Czar shouted . Now Thor broke into a roar of laughter . He threw back his fine head , the blue eyes all but disappeared behind the lines etched at the temples . He wiped his eyes while Czar glared . " Sorry . But perhaps you do n't realize that for the past five minutes you 've been repeating the tag end of every sentence I 've uttered . Like an echo . " Now he threatened to burst into laughter again , but controlled himself . " Very funny . " Icy cold , unsmiling . " Am I to understand you are planning to have my granddaughter live at a college dormitory here in Baranof ! When all her life her home has been the finest house in town ! " " Part of my granddaughter 's life has been spent with me in the very fine log cabin I 've lived in for fifty years , off and on . " " It would be a disgrace . It would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a barracks at Baranof College  --  if you can call it a college . " " I did n't say she was going to . I said , if she wanted to . She 's a woman now , even if you do n't admit it . I think she should make her own decision . " " And you have the money for all this ? Two years of this ? " " I will have , from month to month . " " Your paper is in a state of permanent bankruptcy , I understand . " " I would n't say that . We have a fine circulation , but never enoughp209advertising to balance that . Perhaps you know a little more about the reason for that than I do . Long ago you barely prevented them from stopping my advertisers altogether with threats . My tardy thanks for that , Czar . " " Who told you that ! " He stopped himself , abruptly . " That 's ridiculous . Why should I bother with such small potatoes ? Even if I wanted to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Czar . You 're plotting with plotters , you never can be sure that one of them is n't plotting against you . , " You have n't any money  --  that is , what I 'd call money . " " You 're right , Czar , old boy . Not money as you think of it  --  you and Husack and Caswell and Kleet and all the yacht-and-Cadillac crowd . But a living . And the Northern Light is a living for the Barnetts , too , and the others in the front office and the back shop . It earns its way . I do n't take much out , myself . Anything that comes in to me I try to feed back into the paper . Keeping it healthy and functioning . It is n't just a newspaper , you know , Czar . " " I could wipe it off the map tomorrow by lifting my hand . " " You could , once . Maybe you still could . I 'm not so sure now . And even if you did , another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a little tremor  --  a barely noticeable shakiness  --  in that hand . Figuratively speaking , of course . All over the world , I mean . If you 'll excuse my calling attention to it . Perhaps you may have noticed it , yourself . Almost everybody 's got the shakes , in one form or another . Yours might be called the lobby shakes . Virulent in WashingtonD.C . " " Commie talk , " Czar observed , not even taking the trouble to be disdainful . He rose , now , like royalty ending an interview . " Wrong there , Czar . They 've got the shakes worse than any of us . " " Let 's be practical . I 'll do this for you  --  or for her , rather . She can live part time at the house , as she always has , and part time at your shanty , though it 's a bad arrangement , now that she 's a young woman  --  as you say . " " She 'll decide that for herself  --  as a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses for two years . " " She 'll have everything the other girls have . The salmon fishing brings me in quite a bit , if it 's a good season , and your friends ' fish traps do n't take them all . Writing a piece now and then for one of the magazines , Alaska 's getting to be quite fashionable , Bridie told me there was a piece about it in Harper 's Bazaar , she says Florida and the Riviera are now out . Bridie knows about these things . It 's wonderful , all the things Bridie knows . " In restrained fury Czar knew that he was being gently ridiculed by this visionary giant . " Sometimes lately , Thor , it seems to me you 're showing a kind of early senility . Try to keep your mind on Christine , will you , for a minute . Now , during the summers  --  " " I 'm glad you brought that up , Czar . I was just coming to it . Christinewill spend her summer vacations with me , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . She 's going to see Alaska and hear Alaska . For two years she 's going to eat and drink Alaska . She 's goingto love it and hate it , like all good Alaskans . But when she 's finished she 'll know Alaska from Point Barrow down to Juneau ; from the North Pole to the Banana Belt . Then she 'll be ready for your Outside crowd . Ready . Armed . Prepared to make her own choice . And that 's what you 'll have to agree to let her do . You have agreed . " " I could stop you now , before you ever start . " " No you could n't , Czar . Look ! " He stretched his two great arms straight before him at shoulder level , hands parallel to the floor , fingers outstretched . " See that ! No tremor there . No shakes . " Czar tapped his own forehead , eying Thor significantly . " Nor here , " Thor added , and brought his hands up to touch his brow . Bridie managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part . " Do you know what they 're like ? " she said to Addle Barnett that autumn of Chris 's freshman year . " They act just like a husband and wife that 's divorced . Pulled apart but kind of sticking together because of the child . And in the end the child ruined . But I 'm going to try to see to it that Chris ai n't . " A strange pair  --  the massive old man and the lovely young girl  --   |p211as  they traveled the next two years up and down this glittering almostmythical world of the Arctic . Sometimes Bridie joined the two , a vivacious and gallant third in her modish clothes that defied cold , discomfort and occasional danger . " I can rough it looking civilized , " she argued , stoutly . " Time I was up to Ottawa and Montreal , three winters ago , I did n't see anybody going around dressed like bears . Sweden either , I bet , or Finland , though I 've never been . But I will , someday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , " Thor said , gently . " It will be . And better . Give it a chance , that 's what it needs . " Christine learned . Thor talked . Thor pointed to this and that and those . He was not too voluble , not too insistent , he was rarely prosy or boring . He spoke with passion and power and knowledge and purpose . He talked as a lover talks of his beloved . This was his life , his dream , his Alaska . Casually Thor would say , " The Eskimos are dying off , of course . Killed by civilization . Overheated houses , canned food , alcohol , motors , starches , inaction , infection . " " But some of them  --  there are a lot who  --  like Ross Guildenstem , for example . " " Yes , the breeds survive pretty well . That mixture of Eskimo and Scandinavian stock , or Russian stock , or German or English or American . That is pretty sturdy stuff . " " Like me . " " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual Eskimo left  --  that is , an Eskimo with no Caucasian strain . Long ago the Russian and the Scandinavian and the English explorers and hunters and whalers took the Eskimo women . Then the American gold hunters . And now the new rush of construction workers , the technicians , the flyers , the lonely men in the army bases , isolated . The whole modern crew . It ought to make a pretty good specimen of American . It has , through the years . You know  --  the mixture as before . When the railroadswere first strung across the country a lot of the Irish immigrant section hands married Indian girls or Mexican girls , or had them.  |p212Now  take young Ross Guildenstern you spoke of . He 'll probably marry a girl who is n't a breed at all . " " Oh ? " " Their children will be one fourth Eskimo . Their children 's childrenone eighth . First thing you know , we 'll have an Eskimo strain President of the United States . " " Grampa Czar says mongrels . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tough stuff , mongrels . Usually nimble in the mind and on the feet . Look at all those dark-skinned black-haired brown-eyed Englishmenof Cornwall . Even after five hundred years , when the SpanishArmada was wrecked off the English coast . " Sometimes he was wrong , sometimes he was right . But she learned . Chris was stuffed with Alaska lore like a Strasbourg goose with grain . They traveled by plane  --  single- , twin- , and four-engine planes . They traveled by dog sled . They even used trains once or twice . The rest of the world traveled hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands of miles by automobile , but Alaska had few roads other than those built by the Army . The thousands of automobiles in Alaska were a symbol , a fetish . " It does n't matter so much  --  yet , " Thor explained to Chris . " People here do n't have time to ride around and around , just to be going nowhere , as they do Outside . It takes all the scrambling we can do to crowd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know that , Christine . Work . Food . Keeping warm . Getting from place to place somehow , if you have to . The dog pack to feed if you 're travelingby dog sled . Just living is a kind of triumph from day to day . " Up north where the ice blocks were stacked mountain high in July on the shores of the Arctic Ocean . Down south where the mosquitoes tortured you in jungle heat . A sourdough 's log cabin in the wilderness with its gun and fishing rod and radio . Crab-meat salad , charcoalbroiledsteaks and an orchestra in the Bubble Room of the Baranof Hotel in Juneau ; and dinner prepared by a French cook at the Governor'sMansion . " Why did they build a white colonial with columns as a Governor 's house in Alaska ? " Chris asked . " It 's so un-native. "  | " Nobody knows . A stab at elegance , I suppose . " Juneau , the capital , and Anchorage were different . " They 're Alaska luxury towns , " Thor explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I like them . I 'm having a lovely time . Juneau must look like a little Swiss town  --  of course I 've never seen one , but I 've seen the movies . A valley , and little narrow winding streets , and kind of quainty . " For a week in Juneau they attended the sessions of the Alaska Legislature daily , all day . They pendulumed from the sessions of the Alaska Senate on this side of the Federal Building to the sessions of the Representatives on that . Men and women . They talked , they pleaded , they presented , they argued , they quarreled , like all free legislative bodies , but their voices went unheard Outside . The women members particularly fascinated Christine . They wore wellcutsuits and smart hats , and when they arose to speak they sounded clear , composed and terribly in earnest . " It must be kind of fun , being a member of the Legislature , Grampa Thor . Maybe when I 'm their age . " To Chris they seemed quite ancient  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're trying to get Bridle to run for Representative from our district . She 'd be wonderful , would n't she ! She 'd tell ' em . " " Yes , " Thor said , rather sadly . " But sometimes , in politics today , especially in Alaska politics , not telling ' em is more effective . Just doing . . . Look at these names , Christine , on the list . They make a kind of cross section of Alaska history . . . Gunderson . . . Kasilov . . Petrovich ... Krause . . . O'Shaughnessy . . McCutcheon . . . Taylor ... Ellis . . . Utukok . . . D'Orsay . . . Russia , Scandinavia , Germany , Ireland , France , England , Canada . " " That 's not so different , is it ? That 's like every other place in the United States , is n't it ? " " My darling girl ! " She could n't imagine why he seemed so happy about what she had said . The planes alone were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadways of Alaska , they bore such cargo and such humanp214freight as could scarcely be encompassed by the believing eye . Young Eskimo women in modish slacks and pale blue toppers , . their feet in loafers and neat white socks . They always carried a baby in their arms , and the baby was resplendent in pale blue or pale pink satin coverlet , a pink nylon and lace dress , lace-trimmed panties , bootees of soft pink kid . Dark slanting eyes in a startlingly pink-and-white face might regard gravely a gray-haired grandmother whose spare New England figure sat so erect beside the daughter-in-law and the grandchild that she now was seeing and visiting in a daze of unbelief . The wife and child of her son Donald , the lieutenant in the United States Army stationed in Alaska . The wife and child of her son Arthur , born in Akron , Ohio , Engineering Cornell ' 51 . The wife and child of her son John , why did n't he stay home and build houses in Bridgeport , Connecticut , even if the pay was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so crazy about him . She settled her hat more firmly on her neat gray head , the severe little American Midwest or New England elderly hat . Her daughterin-lawwas hatless , her hair done in a modish coiffure . At lunch time , " What is your formula ? " the plane stewardess would ask . The young Eskimo mother with the plump baby on her lap would say , " One half canned milk , one half water . " The bewildered grandmother was shocked into protest . " But you fed her just an hour ago . And you 've got another bottle right there in the bag . " " One half canned milk , one half water , " the mother would repeat , smiling up at the hostess . " Cold ? " doubtfully . " Cold . " The olive-skinned young mother thought this old lady , her husband'smother , must be a strange one . A bottle of food for the baby , free  --  and not take it ! She had her people 's respect for the old , but throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live she had learned that nurses and doctors and dentists and formulas and sometimes even housing and food all were providedp215by a beneficent thing called the Alaska Native Service . And she knew , too , that for centuries and centuries before this day the fathers brothers sons and husbands of her people had wrested a bitter living from the snowy wastes , from the icy seas , often at the cost of their lives . Whale . Seal . Caribou . Fish . Bear . Owl . Loon . Squirrel . Ptar migan . Walrus . Anything . Anything was food that could be eaten and digested . To refuse offered food was not only bad manners , it was madness . When her own lunch came round on the cardboard tray  --  good thick cheese-and-meat sandwiches wrapped in wax paper ; with deviled eggs and olives , carrot sticks , cake , hot coffee , a feast and free , she ate every crumb , she drank every drop , happily . She was horrified to see that her mother-in-law left more than half her food on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but good manners forbade . Finished , the young woman thumbed the pages of a women 's magazine , eying the toothsome pictured recipes as she smoked a post-lunch cigarette . Every pilot of every plane , whether single- , twin- , or four-engine , seemed to know Thor Storm . This rather surprised Chris . The plane stewardesses knew him , too  --  those pioneer girls weaving across the continent in the modern covered wagon . " Hi , Mr. Storm ! " they chirped . " You have n't traveled with us since last January . I was beginning to think you 'd gone to the dogs . " An old Arctic travel joke . Chris began to feel more stable in the air than on the ground . She had had her first flying lessons , though she never had flown solo . Not old enough , they said . Besides , Czar Kennedy had forbidden it . " I did n't know you had so many buddies in the air , " Chris said . " You never told me . You seem to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like talking to them . They know more about Alaska than the Secretary of the Interior ever will . I do n't mean they just know geographyand topography and weather . Everybody who sets foot in Alaska sets foot in the air , at one time or another . These boys see them all . " " They certainly see you , Grampa Thor . "  | " You sitting beside me is n't exactly a handicap , " he said , fondly . After the plane was up and running clear each pilot undoubtedlydid seem to follow a routine pattern . He would emerge from the cockpit and stroll casually up the aisle toward the old man and the young girl . Quite formally , abandoning momentarily the Hi ! that served for ordinary encounters , the young man in uniform would say with careful courtesy , " It 's good to see you , Mr. Storm . Glad to have you aboard . " His gaze on the girl . " Hello , Bob ! . . . Captain Tyler , Christine . . . my granddaughter , Christine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-looking . But then , all men looked handsome in a pilot 's uniform . He would look ardently down at her , unaware that he was lookingardent ; a wife at home and three kids and that was that . Quite a dish , though . Black eyes and they slant a little . . . I wonder .. . no ... golden hair . . . maybe a paint job . . . no , that 's genuine Alaska gold hair . " Would you like to come up forward and have a look around , Miss Storm ? " Thor Storm had planned carefully , carefully . South Alaska first , the accustomed comfort and even luxury of Juneau , with the Alaska Legislature in session , embattled , serious ; the reactionary and the liberal locked in combat . She had seen Anchorage , sparkling , gay , modern , a city of homes , shops , libraries , museums , hotels , parks that seemed magically to have sprung complete , overnight , from a tent town . From Juneau they had bounced over to Sitka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters , lifted itself , an audacious speck of metal over the menacing ice-sheathed mountains . They had no sooner been plumped down in the harbor than Chris began to say , " I remember ! I remember ! " as though she had been there before . " Remember ? " Thor said , mystified . " Everything you told me . What was I ? Eight ? Nine ? Ten ? Anyway , I remember it all . When it was the capital of Alaska for a wholep217century . And the Russians . And Baranof that our town was named for . That seems strange now , does n't it ? And then Seward 's Folly , and the Russian flag coming down and the American flag going up ! Like a movie or something . But it seems real to me , just the same . Maybe because I 've remembered it so long . All my life . " " All your life , " Thor repeated , smiling down at her . He was happy . It was like renewing his youth , just to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian cathedral with the vestmentsand icons and vessels of a long-gone day . In the little chapel of Our Lady of Kazan was the painting of the Madonna and Child framed in silver repousse . Chris nodded her head as if in affirmation of a familiar object . They visited the Old Pioneers ' Home where old , old men were living out their lives in physical comfort and inner rebellion . They had fought the Alaska wilderness in their youth , they had lived with danger , old age had seemed a distant thing , they had not realized that this was the one inevitable danger they never could conquer . In their faded eyes was a look of puzzlement . Thor seemed to know them all , they greeted him , croakily , with a kind of admiring affection . They crowded round him and Christine felt a moment of panic as though they might somehow , by their very numbers and their eagerness , take him with them into their now futile lives . Thor brought her into the tiny neat private room of the Oldest Pioneer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were curiously bright and blue and Christine wished they were not so merry . They made her uneasy . He was courteous to her , but distant , not interested . The crumpled face was pink and white , like a baby 's . " Well , Thor , when you coming with us ? " " Any day now , Swan . Any day . " Smiling , the eyes still glassily merry , " I never thought I 'd live to die sitting in a chair by a window in an old pioneers ' home . " It was a standing joke , a routine dialogue , Chris learned later . " How would you like to die , Swan , if you had your choice ? Eaten by a bear ? Frozen on the trail ? Starved in a cabin ? "  | " I 'd like to be shot dead by a jealous husband . " Ha-ha-ha ! said Thor . And ha-ha-ha ! said Swan . But when they left , Chris said , " I do n't want to live to be old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thor said . " I just ignore it . " " But you 're not old ! " " I 'm old , Chris , my dear child . And Czar is old and Bridle is old . You 're just used to us , that 's all . You 've had to skip a young mother and a young father and sisters and brothers , so you do n't know the difference . That 's why I want you to be ready and prepared , perhaps a little ahead of time , so that when we 're not here you can make your way , alone . " " That sounds scary . " " No . Life is n't scary . It 's the most exciting experience you 'll ever have . But it 's better if you 're prepared a little . " Then he said a curious thing . " When I 'm really old , Christine , and ill and useless , do n't let them put me there , will you ? It 's a good place , but not for rne . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thor ! What a thing to say . " " I have n't much money , you know . None , really , except from week to week . " " I 'll have money . I 'll work . And Grampa Czar has lots of money . He would n't let you . " " Just remember what I said , dear child . " Ketchikan , Wrangell . Cordova . Valdez . Nome . Even little native Indian villages . Hoonah . Yakutat . Then the bustling city of Fairbanks , exactly mid-center , neon-spangled and thriving ; The Golden Heart of Alaska , it called itself , wistfully , Baranof 's civic rival it announced , proudly . " There is n't much time , " Thor said . " Next trip we 'll head north . That 's the real Alaska . Oogruk and Kotzebue and Point Barrow . There 's nothing like them in all of North America . But first I want you to see the fishing . Then you 'll understand why I 'm fighting the Outside crowd . Overnight at the Suewok Cannery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds with me . How does that sound ? "  |p219Privately  she thought it sounded dull . " Mm-hm . That 'll be fun . " He glanced at her almost ruefully . " I want you to see it , " he said , again . And again , " There is n't much time . " " Grampa Thor , you sound as if you were running a race against something . " " I am  --  in a way . In many ways , Christine . I want you to see it all . " " Bridie says you and Grampa Czar are so mixed up you ca n't tell which is me and which is Alaska . Bridle kills me . " " My God ! " he said , stunned . " Maybe she 's right . " By now it had become almost routine . They were taking off for the Suewok Cannery and the salmon-fishing grounds . There at the airport was the usual twin-engine DC-3 , somewhat shabby but still gallant , though vintage . There , too , was the plane stewardess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Baranof girl they knew well . " Someday , " Chris said to Thor beside her , " I 'm going to have my own little plane . " " Why not ! " Thor said , companionably . " Why not ! " They were up , they were leveling off , Gerda Lindstrom was makingher announcement in a losing struggle against the noise of the engines " . . . welcome you aboard . . . Miss ... Lindstrom . . your pilot . . . Guildenstern . . . hope you . .. " Christine 's heart gave a little lurch . When later , the blueuniformedfigure came through the forward doorway , as always on these trips , he too repeated the formula . " Nice to have you aboard , Mr. Storm . Hi , Miss Storm . " Then he , too , was looking ardently down at her , unaware that he was looking ardent . " Would you like to come up forward and have a look around ? In about half an hour we 'll be due over Anaktuvuk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , of course you wo n't see much from up here . " " They do n't build those doorways high enough for me , " Thor said . " I always bump my head . You run along , Christine . " The co-pilot relinquished his seat to her , she noticed that he was the older , Ross Guildenstern the younger . " You 're a captain now , are n't you ? "  | " Yes . I do n't fly the freight crates any more . " " I should hope not ! After all , a man who flew in the war . " " Oh , that does n't pull any weight . There are a lot of us buzzing around in hedgehoppers . Do you enjoy flying ? " She was a little disappointed . Politely she said , " I love it . " " Are you comfortable now ? I think you do n't get the real feel of a plane anywhere but up here . " " Yes , " she said , demurely . " Perhaps you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean I 'm going to bore you with a lot of mechanical details . Now this "  --  his hand indicated the board  --  " is the instrument panel . In the old days they called it the dashboard , like a car . Of course the big new jobs  --  I mean , this is a dated job , but I like it . " " It sounds fascinating . " " Of course it would be great to fly one of the big Pan Am planes , but I 'd never get a captaincy there . You ever been up to Point Barrow ? " " No . " " You ought to go . It 's rugged , but it 's really Alaska . " " That 's what Grampa says . We 're planning to go . " " When ? " " I do n't know . Grampa says July is about the best time . Cold , but you can stand it . " " I get that run occasionally . Oogruk and Barrow . I was born in Oogruk . Look , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because sometimes , up there , if it 's a fair day and nobody 's in a hurry , and if there 's Brass on board , or a VIP like your Grandpa , I ask them if they want to have a look at the Diomedes . You know about the Diomedes ? " " A little bit . They 're two islands off the coast of Siberia , are n't they ? And the Big Diomede is Russia and the Little Diomede is United States . And never the twain shall meet . " " Good girl ! Scientists say they used to be part of the mainland , thousands of years ago . Now , from the air , they look so close it seemsp221as though a kid could jump across . I always explain that we can fly over the Little Diomede , barely , but just an edge over the Big Diomedeand we get shot at . That always rates a screech from the women passengers . And when I say that that black shore line just beyond is the coast of Siberia the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists never even heard of the Diomedes , or realize that Russian territory is really right up against us Americans in Alaska . " She was disappointed . He was talking too much . Then , even as she thought this , he said , " I 'm talking too much . " " Oh , no . " " Do you know why ? Because I 've hoped you 'd get on one of my planes . And today you did . And now I 'm shock-happy . Look , do you want to take the controls for a minute ? Nothing can happen , I 'm right here , you might get a kick out of it . " Momentarily embarrassed , she stared at him , and in the next momenta look of awful realization darkened the brilliance of his vivid face . He covered his eyes with his hand . " Oh , God . I just remembered . I heard . You 've logged about a billion miles and they 'll give you your license next year when you 're out of diapers . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested , really . " " You were enjoying it . " " But I have n't seen the Diomedes , and I do want to see them , and it 's fun to talk to you again . " " And you let me sit there blabbing . Oh , " he muttered , " this is the instrument panel it used to be called the dashboard do you enjoy flying Miss Storm you get the real feel of a plane up here . Pardon me while I break a window and bail out . " They began to laugh then in a whoop of exuberance . He reached over and for a moment covered her hand with his . " How long are you going to be in Suewok ? " " Just a day and a night , I think . Two days at the most . Grampa has to load up for the trip to the fishing grounds . I 'm supposed to stay at the cannery , Grampa wants me to see it , but he wo n't stayp223there , he 's feuding with the cannery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Just you relax and do as he says . He 's a great old boy . He 's the most outstanding man in Alaska . " " I think so , too . Most people think Grampa Kennedy . " " You lead a kind of double life , do n't you ? " " Do I ? Anyway , I 've loved it . " She edged her way out of the seat . " Thanks for the scenery . " " Look , when are you taking off for Oogruk ? Maybe I can wangle the flight if I know the date . " " It may not be this summer at all . Grampa might put it off until next year . " " Do you mind if I ask him ? That is , if you --  " " I do n't mind . " Primly . " Especially if you 'll throw in another travel talk . " " My Oogruk talk , " he said , earnestly , " is illustrated with lantern slides . " Seated again beside Thor Storm she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Whose eyes ? " " Pilots . I mean Ross Guildenstern 's and  --  uh  --  Gerda 's are , too . The whites of their eyes are blue-white , like a baby 's , and absolutely clear and clean and shining , like a light . " He glanced at her thoughtfully , then his eyes went to the brillianceof sky and mountain . " Flying so much , I suppose . Altitude , clean air . They 're up in the air more than they 're on the ground . Winged things always have eyes like that . Birds . And gods . And angels . " He smiled at her . " And now , even pilots . "  | " Why do they eat all the time ? " Chris asked Thor . Theplump little fishing scow was bouncing its way across the waters from the cannery to the distant fishing grounds . " They eat and eat and eat . Six meals a day . It 's frightening . They ca n't be hungry all the time . Why do they eat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Out of their accustomed element . Not secure . We 'll talk about it this evening , maybe . When we 've got things shipshape on the boat . " She had asked the same question of Bor Maunch , the cannery manager . Maunch had just grinned . " We feed our workers good and they like it . " Bor Maunch wished she 'd shut up and not ask so many questions . Why ? Why ? Why ? He was sick of it . She sure took after old Thor Storm , nosey like him . Of course she rated the Special Treatment , being Czar Kennedy 's granddaughter and all , and anyway he had had written instructions before she came . Visitors did n't come often but when they did you showed them around , gave them a good meal , a couple cans of the best grade red salmon and that was it . But not this kid . Why do n't you use Alaska workers instead of all these people from Outside ? Why do the Filipinos eat apart from the rest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taste different kinds of food . . . . Your Grandpa would n't like that . . . . But Grampa Thor would love it ! ... I mean your Grandpa Kennedy would n't like it . . . . But I 'm here with Grampa Thor.  |p224Bor  Maunch was sick of it . On her arrival they had given her an astonishing suite , there in that wilderness of water and mountains , with only the cannery loomingout of the water on piles , like a monster on stilts , to mark the hand of man . Amazed , Chris surveyed a sitting room , bedroom and bath . A white bearskin rug on the floor , chintz curtains , a radio , deepcushionedchairs , a couch , lamps . " But it 's absolutely luxuriousl " Chris had exclaimed at sight of this splendor . " I thought it would be like a camp . " Somehow , she felt disappointed , resentful . " I might as well be at the Baranof Hotel in Juneau . " " Nothing 's too good for Czar Kennedy 's granddaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fixed up like this for the Big Boys like Dave Husack and Kleet and those . General Cass Baldwin came once . They do n't get here once in a hundred years , but they like it this way when they do come . " " I think I 'll sleep on the boat where Grampa Thor is . " " No ! No , you ca n't do that , Miss Storm . " There was genuine alarm in his voice . " Czar would have me --  " His tone changed to a wheedlingjocularity . " You 're better off here , Miss Storm , that 's a fact . Anyway , Thor 's busy loading up , he ca n't be bothered with anybody on board now . They 're due out Tuesday morning . You 're staying here . " " I am not . I 'm going out on the tender with them . " " That 's too rough for a young lady like you . " She was rather surprised to hear herself saying , " I like it rough . " He wagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed mirthlessly . " Well , say ! Chip off the old block ! Now , if there 's anything you want , why , the place is yours , you as good as own the place , along with Czar and the rest . How 's that ! " " I do n't want to own the place . " Then , ashamed of her own rudeness , " I mean , it 's nice of you to be so hospitable . I 'd love to see everything . " " That 's fine , " Bor A/launch agreed . " I 'd take you around myself ,  |p225only  I 'm busy with a lot of paper work has to go in the mail boat to Suewok . I 'll get one the boys  --  " " Could I try working in the cannery ? Just anything , I mean , for a little while ? Packing or something , just to try it . " Horrified , he backed away from her . " Get a finger cut off or something ! Czar 'd kill me ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thor Storm , he knows more about canneries and fishing and Alaska than anybody in the world ! He 's the most wonderful man in Alaska ! " " Well , sure . Sure . " Placatingly . " He sure does , he sure is . I 'll have one the boys show you around  --  " He had vanished . When , that evening , she reported this to Thor , having made her way down to the tender being provisioned at the dock , he heard her out , after which he said , mildly , " Yes , Bor Maunch told me , and everybody on the boat here told me , and the cannery workers told me , and the waitresses , and Mrs. Gulick the matron . This is like a village , Christine , only it 's more remote than a village , so any news is news , and news travels fast on an empty road . I brought you here to see , not to talk . You can do your talking later , perhaps five years from now . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretend you 're a seed . Just absorb . Blooming comes later . " She was guided through the desperately concentrated labor of the cannery by a blindingly handsome and suave young man named Juan Pico . He was employed , not in the actual canning area , but as cook 's helper ; slim , elegant , incredible . Chris first saw him after breakfast on her first day at the cannery . In a corner of the vast bright dining hall he was bent over some work spread on a bared table . He was sewing . Then Chris realized that the long leisurely gesture of the man 's arm was that of embroidering . Juan Pico was engaged in the seemingly endless task of creating a gros point carpet . An imposing section of it was completed . Chris saw that its pattern was not the conventional roses and wreaths . Violets strewed the fabric , and pale pink and delicate lemon-yellow small blossoms un/familiar to her , intertwined with trailing green vines and moss like the earth pattern of a fragrant fresh woodland in the spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Juan , " Bor Maunch said by way of introduction . " I guess you know this is Czar Kennedy 's granddaughter , you take her around show her the works and I guess you know anybody is Czar Kennedy 's granddaughter they 're entitled to the run of the place . " " My name is Christine Storm , " she said , with more empressement , perhaps , than the occasion called for . " I 'm here with my Grandfather , Thor Storm . " Juan Pico bowed . " It 's a privilege to take you around , Miss Storm , " he said . He then stabbed his needle into the heart of a violet , rolled up the canvas , tucked it into a corner , and looked critically at Christine'sfeet . " Got any overshoes ? Not mukluks , but galoshes or something ? " " That 's right , " Maunch said . " You do n't want to slip , it 's pretty slimy , places . And look out when you 're up on the catwalk . " She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dock between the dining room and the cannery . " Mr. Pico  --  " " Juan . " " Juan , what was that you were making  --  sewing , I mean ? " " Oh , that 's a carpet , a copy of a seventeenth-century Aubusson in an old French chateau . Chambord , I think it is . " She could not help herself . " But why are you doing it ? I mean , here ? " " To get away from the fish . And the food . And this stuff . " He made a gesture that included the cannery , sky , water , mountains . " Then why are you here at all ? " " Money , " he said , and smiled , a flash of white teeth in the creamy face . Chris had thought him very attractive . Now she decided he was n't really handsome , after all . Something missing . She thought she would take that up later , with herself , when she had more leisure . The fishing boat . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! San Francisco . This is my third summer , and money or no money , I ca n't take it another stretch . Too depressing . Of course , in eight or ten weeks I earn enough to last me the rest of the year . There 's no way to spend money here . I get transportation and my meals and my room . Cigarettes , that 's about it . We 're not paid here at the cannery . They hand it to us in a lump when we get back Outside , see .... Up these stairs , Miss Storm . Watch it . " As he talked they had passed through a dim cavernous warehouse . Boxes . Ropes . Nets . Floats . Now the top of the stairs brought them into a world that clanked and whirred and thudded and clattered and rattled . Over and through and under everything was the smell of fish . It was more than a smell ; it seemed an actual tangible substance . Juan Pico , momentarily removed from his violet-strewn world , was factual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt disembodied , without dimensions . " This is the assembly line , see . Those girls are on piece work .. . Those others there are patchers . . . . Those guys cleaners . . . cutters . . . stuffed in a can with salt . . . the air 's extracted that way , see . . . this machine spins the top on . . . the cans go into this highpressuresteam thing . . . this pastes the label on the can , it 's a real pretty label , and you buy the can , and that 's it . All this stuff used to be done by hand  --  anyway , that 's what they tell me  --  now it 's mostly machinery . Chinese used to do a lot of it , but not now since the War , and anyway the union wo n't stand for it . Now they call this machine the Iron Chink , that 's kind of cute , do n't you think ? " " Awfully cute , " Chris said . The women were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their feet in rubber overshoes , their hands in rubber gloves , their bodies covered with rubber aprons . Their faces and heads , in contrast , were startlingly coquettish and modish . They wore earrings , their faces were carefully made up with rouge , lipstick , powder ; their hair was dressed with a painstaking permanent . They did not glance at Christine or at her handsome guide , they did not once lift their eyes from the line that moved so relent/lessly past them , they were on piece work , the line moved inexorably like the stream of life , there was no stopping it except by complete annihilation . The patchers deftly snatched the packed can as it twinkled by , their unerring eye had caught the grayish bit that was not toothsome enough for the top layer ; with an incredibly swift gesturethey substituted a more splendid bit of plump red salmon meat , they set the can back into the life stream as a mother smooths a child 's hair or twitches her skirt to rights before sending her off to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it flowed through the machinery stream , flowed as endlessly and unhurriedly through the air and metal as though this were a salmon 's natural element . Steam hissed , iron clanked , knives chopped , metal thumped , water swished , cans clashed . No one spoke , no head was lifted , the relentless process had a nightmarish pursuing quality . Now , through the clamor , Juan said , " Follow me . And watch it . " He pointed to the catwalk , crossing above complicated belts and pistons . Standing there she could view the entire pattern , the motions of the arms , the heads , the movements of the machinery , so orderly , so repetitious , so inevitable ; a ballet of labor . Someone was coming toward her , she wondered nervously how he could pass on that narrowstrip of footing . He stood beside her , a big-framed man , tiredlooking , with the eyes of a seaman , clear and farseeing . " Foreman ! " Juan mouthed , through the clamor . Now the man leaned toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled of fish oil and salmon even more distinctlythan this temple of salmon itself . It was as though his pores had absorbed the effluvium through the years , soaked it in like the spongy floor boards of the cannery , and now exuded it . Bergstrom shouted " Thor Storm ! " and nodded and smiled and pointed dockward to where the tender lay moored . His expression was unmistakably friendly and admiring . " First time in years ! " he bellowed . " Thor do n't favor fish-trap country . " Chris nodded and smiled in turn , she pointed toward the hive belowthe catwalk . As though she had pressed a button that activatedp229a machine , numbers began to rumble forth . " . . . Alaska output ... four million cases . . . only two million cases . . . six million cases ... " Chris shook her head . " People ! " she yelled . " Those people . Are they Alaskans ! Where are they from ? " But now Bergstrom had difficulty in hearing , he indicated his ears , politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a shriek left in her lungs . " You hire them , do n't you ? You 're the foreman . " Bergstrom found his voice . " No , ma'am , they 're hired Outside . Seattle . San Francisco . " " My Grandfather says --  " " You speak to him , miss . " Bergstrom had vanished down the catwalk steps . Juan Pico evidently considered the tour ended . He preceded her down the stairs , guided her across the hazards of the slimy floor into the outer air that came across mountain and water and that here smelled only faintly of fish . She stood on the dock , breathing deeply . " Anything else you 'd like to see ? " Juan Pico asked , with the impersonalpoliteness of a formula . " No . Thanks a lot . Uh , Juan , this is only one cannery . There are lots of others , are n't there ? " " That 's right . " " Hundreds and thousands of Outsiders working and getting the wages and taking the money --  " Juan Pico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , be seeing you , Miss Storm . I 've got to get back to work . " Absurdly she threatened . " I 'm going to tell my Grandfather . " " You do that , " he said . Then , with an air of the most casual curiosity , " You a Commie ? " In an overwhelming flash of anger she reverted to a childhood phrase . " Would you like to have your face slapped ? " she said , inadequately . But Juan Pico , too , vanished . All the Suewok Cannery employees , like jinns in mythology , seemed to have miraculous vanishingpowers . One moment they stood before you , smiling , polite , even deferential . You asked a question . They vanished.  |p230Thor  would not vanish . You could turn a battery of questions on him , she thought , and he would sit there considering them and answeringthem , thoughtfully , as though you were a grownup . You are , you fool ! she said to herself now , fiercely . You 've been playing itsybitsyall your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three people who made you think you were more important than anybody else in the world . Do n't make me laugh . So now , as the little boat chugged its way across the waters , she began to discern the pattern that Thor Storm had etched so tirelesslyall these years . You could say why why why endlessly . He never rebuffed you , he never vanished , he was there , solid , indestructible , towering over them all , like Mount McKinley . In its own cosy way , the boat had turned out to be as unexpectedly comfortable as the Suewok Cannery suite , and much more to her liking . Squat as a plump middle-aged matron it bumped and waddledits way to the fishing grounds . The galley , with its small adjoiningnook that passed for a mess room , was warm and snug . Her sleeping quarters were little more than a slit in the wall . A vast pot of hot coffee scented the air all day , all night . To step out on the wind-swept deck of the little tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light was , Chris thought , like stepping out of an air-borne plane into space . I must ask Ross about that . I must ask Grampa Thor when we 're going to Oogruk . I must ask Grampa Thor . I must ask Grampa Thor . " Why do they feed them so much at the cannery ? They eat all the time . Like Henry the Eighth or something . They ca n't be hungry . It sort of turned my stomach . Breakfast was huge . Meat and eggs and fish  --  though they did n't serve much fish . Is n't that strange ? " " No . No , not after you 've been all day  --  " " Oh . Yes , of course . And hot breads and fruit juice and hot and cold cereals and fried potatoes and pancakes and jam and jelly . Then at ten in the morning they ate again , they had rolling tables there at the cannery piled with cakes and sandwiches and coffee . At noon they had soup and meat and vegetables and salads and pies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at four and thenp231at six they had dinner all over again . Even lamb chops ! Imagine , all those lamb chops , in Alaska ! And at ten  --  you wo n't believe it  --  they brought out platters and platters of cold meats and cheese and pickles and cakes again and pies and everything , as though they had n't been given a bite to eat all day . It was repulsive . It must cost thousands and thousands . Why do they eat all the time ? " " It keeps them satisfied . Temporarily . " " But I mean , they ca n't be hungry ! " " Not that kind of hunger . It satisfies another kind of hunger , or they think it does . It 's lonely there at Suewok , there 's nothing to do but work . And eat . They 're cut off from the rest of the world . They 're city people , mostly , they get restless and nervous . They do n't even have their money until they 're flown back Outside . The cannery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or resentfuleat a lot , even if they 're not actually hungry . Food is a narcotic , in a way , like alcohol . And the cannery workers ca n't smuggle liquor in  --  at least , it 's pretty hard to do . They 'd have to go into Suewokitself to drink  --  that is , drink . And the cannery boats just do n't take them into Suewok . Did you ever notice the eyes of fat people ? Really huge fat people , especially with that chuckling laugh . They laugh , laugh . And they munch all the time , meals , between meals . But their eyes look frantic . They 're like babies , having the nipple stuffed into their mouths to stop crying . " She was to remember that cannery trip all her life , though it had the quality of unreality . She read in the stuffy little cabin . The books on the shelf beside her bunk turned out to be Bergson and Bernard Shaw and Tolstoi and Flaubert and Ibsen ; a handful of rebellious post-World War II novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English Verse . She knew that Thor had carefully placed them there ; she was not interested . The first day she read a little , she even marked a passage in a page here and there , to prove to Thor that she had been reading . It turned out that this practice he considered an outrage . " Remember this , Christine . Never mark a book . It 's an imperti/nence to the next reader . Books should be cherished , like children , books are for the next generation , like children , like history . " She was less impressed than once she had been by these pronouncementsand philosophies . Throughout her strange childhood she had thought Thor and Czar and Bridie infallible , they were infinitelysuperior to all other human beings . But lately she had noticed that Alaskans were referring to them as " characters . " They did this admiringly and even fondly , wagging their heads and smiling . " Yessir , Thor sure is a character . . . . Czar 's a character , all right . ... Bridie Ballantyne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the crew found her presence a handicap in the confines of the little boat they gave no indication , they behaved toward her like indulgent uncles . The cook even allowed her to turn out a batch of sourdough pancakes and was not too resentful when they actually proved to be superior to his . " Thin , " Chris explained , very graciously . " And delicate . Everybodymakes pancakes too thick . Especially men . Like big flannel poultices . " Curiously enough , she remembered that salmon-fishing trip as an exhilarating time . It did not occur to her that her manner of life differed from that of other girls except , perhaps , in the matter of enhancement . Here she was , gay and yet relaxed , she could not account for it , she did not try . She would turn on the radio and now and then something would come through  --  a squawk of news , a crooner 's whine . She was in and out , buffeted by the cold wind , soothed by the cabin 's coffee-scented warmth . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " You 're afloat , all right , " Thor said . " I hope . Maybe you 're drinkingtoo much coffee . Scandinavians and Alaskans are coffee drunkards . You inherit from both sides . " " Are we going to Oogruk this summer ? " " Depends . " " Ross Guildenstern said that if he knew the date ahead of time he might wangle things so as to pilot us. "  |p233He  looked at her , thoughtfully . " Perhaps we 'll put it off until next year . " " Oh , no ! " " We could do Oogruk and Barrow both . We might invite Bridie to come along , if it is n't too rough a trip for her . " " But why ! Why ! " " Bridie 's got common sense . Bridie knows what 's good for you better than I do . " " You promised . " " I promised we 'd go . And we will . Next summer will be your last summer before Seattle . You 'll be older . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be old to go to Oogruk . " " Why are you so crazy about Oogruk all of a sudden ? " " I 've always wanted to see it . It sounds fascinating . " Then , naively , " Ross Guildenstern was born there . He knows everybody in 0ogruk . " " That would make it more interesting , " he said , rather flatly . " Of course I know Oogruk pretty well . " He was silent . She waited . " We 'll see . Far North Alaska is a big bite to digest . Next summer might be best . " At the fishing grounds the vastness of the salmon catch stunned her . The silver horde , she thought . She knew now what it meant . The mass lay piled and glistening in the boat . Thor and the crew had worked unceasingly through the days and the white nights ; they had worked , not like men , but like machines , they had not slept , they scarcely had eaten . The sight of men working at top speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life in Alaska where everyone  --  menand women  --  worked with tenacity and dogged couragefor actual survival . But this labor at the salmon-fishing grounds was an orderly frenzy of activity . Thor and the crew ignored her . Throughout this brief period of intensity , if she spoke to Thor , he looked at her absently and did not reply . There was no time for living , there was only motion in the pursuit of this brilliant swirling mass of quicksilver . Now , loaded to capacity , the return run must be made swiftly.  |p234As  the loaded boat moved off they stood at the deck rail , the old man and the young girl , shoulder to shoulder , looking down at the gleaming cargo . " Silver , " Thor said . " Silver like that is the gold of Alaska today . " He flung his arm out in a gesture of exultation . " There it is , dear child ! The silver that will pay for your years at Baranof College . But this catch is nothing compared to what they get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " " No . No , Christine . Would you like to know why ? " " I remember you said they were bad . But I kind of forget  --  " " Fishing traps are criminal , but they 're legal in Alaska , my dear . No state in the whole United States permits them . " " Show me one . " " I do n't think I can do that . It would n't be wise for this boat of mine to go near one of the fish traps . " Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Her brilliant face eager , her mind as absorbent of this somewhat dry factual story as that of a child listening to a fairy tale . " Well , I 'll try to explain , not making too much of it , I 'm busy . They 're wooden things , the fish traps , about a hundred feet long and maybe fifty wide , fastened to piles , or sometimes floating . The bottom of the wooden structure is sealed by netting . And fastened to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feet long , the lead , and sometimes thousands of feet , out at right angles from the shore . A webbing . Can you picture that in your mind ? " " Webbing , " she repeated , dutifully . " Like a great big tennis net ? " " Something like that , yes . Do you know what happens then ? " " The net catches the fish . " " But it is n't as simple as that . They put that webbing in the waterwayswhere they know the migrating fish will pass on their way to the spawning streams . Salmon are wonderful creatures , you know . No one understands why these noble fish live and die as they do , in nature . " " Yes . Well ? " The child saying go on , go on , though she was no child now.  | " The webbing stops them , like a flexible wall , you see . They ca n't go on . So then they turn outward , they sense they 'd encounter the shore if they turned inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , and they are led by this into a V-shaped opening , a wide one . But this wide opening leads into a second inner opening , and that 's V shaped , too , and as they make their way , the V opening gets smaller and smaller , of course , until finally they 're into the tunnel and then into the big wooden trap that has a rope web floor that can be lifted up and out , and all those thousands of salmon dumped into the scow , and then they 're on their way to the cannery . " " It sounds quite efficient and smart . Is n't it all right ? You 're catchingsalmon , too . " " Not with traps . Traps do n't just catch salmon . They exterminate them . Fishing is a fine thing , it could make Alaska rich and prosperous . But pretty soon there wo n't be any fish to catch or trap . They grab too many of them every year , and every year there are less . The trap is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see to it , all they need to do is to come out and pull up the web floor when the trap is full . Who cares ? The cannery people do n't care , the owners , I mean , they live in Seattle or San Francisco or Chicago or even New York . Ten years more  --  fifteen  --  twenty  --  then it will be finished . No one stops them . " In her naivete she demanded , " Why do n't you stop them ! You can write more editorials in the Northern Light . You can stop anything you do n't like , that you think is wrong . " " Money , my darling child . Money . Millions of salmon make millionsof money for the people who catch them . " " But not you . " " No . You know better than that . For the canneries . " " But if it 's wrong ? " " Smart men in the capital at Washington are hired to make it , seem right . It 's a little complicated to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You do this for us , we 'll do that for you . Congressmen and Senators , and smart lawyers , and Big Business men . It is n't consid/ered dishonest , it 's called lobbying . I do n't want you to get a wrong idea of your country , Christine , it 's the most wonderful free country in the world . But there are certain things . Alaska , you see , has no standing , it has no vote , it has no power to defend itself , it is a big strong giant tied and bound and gagged . " " Like Gargantua . " He laughed his great rollicking laugh . " You 've been reading my Rabelais . " They chugged back to the cannery , the great silver mass of fish gleaming in the scow . Thor and the crew seemed content . " Three or four more like this catch , " Thor said , " and your schooling for this coming year will be paid for . " Miserably she said , " It is n't worth it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and two . " He stared at her in amazement . " Is n't worth what ! " " How can I go to college  --  how can I have anything , when I know you 've worked for it like a  --  like a horse ! " " You 've never seen a horse . " This was true . To her consternation , he was laughing . " Now if you said worked like a dog , an Alaskan would know what you mean . " In a fury she said , " You 're laughing at me ! At least Grampa Czar does n't laugh at me . " " Christine , my darling child , I was n't laughing at you . " " You were pulling and hauling like those slaves in the pictures that hauled the stones for the pyramids . I ca n't stand it ! Why do n't you use a lobby , then ? What 's a lobby , anyway ? " " Here , we 'll look it up in the dictionary . Now then , it says , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislators to introduce or vote for measures favorable to a special interest that he represents . " " Oh , that 's like Mr. Sid Kleet . And that Shaw Gavin . And those men in Seattle . " " Perhaps . But there are others  --  lots of them  --  that you do n't know and never heard of . " " It does n't sound honest . " " It 's so considered . It 's as well to have it legal and out in the openp237as behind closed doors . At any rate , people know it 's going on , and how it 's done . " " But you can do anything . You can tell the world . About the fish and the forests and the metals and the taxes and the  --  " " Child , the world is n't interested in fish , it only sounds comic , and the world is n't interested in Alaska , and the world is n't interested in me . It 's as simple as that . Alaska salmon is just something in a can . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost untaxed , to men who never have even seen Alaska . Alaska itself , to them , is an iceberg peopled by Eskimos and polar bears who eat each other . The forests , the metals , the great fishing industry  --  it 's all the same , it goes Outside , it 's owned Outside , the world does n't hear about it , or care , it is n't very dramatic , anyway , people do n't want to hear about fish and forests and minerals , it is n't front-page news . And they would n't believe it if they did hear it or read it . It 's part of a past era , like the old days of the grabbers and what they called the Robber Barons . It 's still going on here , full blast , with Seattle and San Francisco and the lobbyists in Washington as the power plant . But who cares ! " " You do ! And  --  and Paul and Addie and even Bridle , I suppose , and some of those people we saw in Juneau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to you . And the people Outside would , too . " " Outside does n't read the Northern Light . " " The work you 've done just now  --  is that all right ? Is it all right , I mean ? " She was very solemn . The old man 's clear steady blue eyes looked into the girl 's perplexeddark eyes . " If it were n't , Christine , I 'd rather leave you as unschooledas a savage . You know that , do n't you ? " " Then I do n't see why you do n't go to Washington as those men do . Go there and do something about it . " " You ca n't just go to Washington and stand before the Senate or Congress assembled , and yell . " " I would . I 'd go and yell at the top of my voice . " " You 'd only be thrown out , you foolish child . It takes money andp238money and money . Millions , because all the rich things in the Territoryare worth millions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm listening . I 'm in-terested . " " No they would n't . " " Why ! Why ! " The child again , asking questions . " Because I 'm what they call a do-gooder . Do-gooders are consideredtiresome . They 're not dramatic . The average person  --  if there is an average person  --  at least , the everyday human being  --  has admiration for ruthlessness and boldness . Especially in a virile countrylike the United States . What makes the front page ? Crime and war and ruthlessness . People like to read about them and hear about them and look at them in plays and moving pictures and on this new television . Robin Hood and Jesse James . And then the Railroad Kings , the Land Kings , the Wheat Kings the Oil Kings all the Money Kings of America . The marauders . The Robber Barons of the United States . People marveled and wagged their heads , and they were n't altogether wrong . These bold highhanded men settled the land , in a way , and harnessed the rivers and chopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper and silver and ore . I do n't think any other country in the world could have survived such depredation , but there was so much here . It seemed inexhaustible . But it was n't . It is n't . Not any more . It 's going . Even Alaska , the unknown place , the last frontier , is n't a frontier any more , rich as it is it will soon be done for . The new Robin Hoods and Jesse Jameses have it , clever and bold and ruthless and power-hungry , just like the old days , the bad old days . They will leave this wonderful country barren , like a woman who has had to bear too many children in her youth . The forests are dwindling , and the waterways , and the millions of creatures of the sea and the forest  --  the salmon and the seal and the bear and the moose and the deer . " He was declaiming now , she knew he was quoting from his book , the book he had been writing ever since she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Suddenly she saw him , a prophetp239without honor in his own country . " Do n't , Grampa darling . They 'll read it . They 'll know . They will . " But he went on , he seemed not to have heard her . " They have marched across a continent and now they have reached far into this great ice palace and plundered it . It 's the last treasure-trove , it 's the end . No one stops them . Perhaps someday this incredible America will be like India , like the barren over-populated countries of the East , like China , and only the few will know what it means to have a satisfied full stomach once a day or once a week or even once a month . Who says it ca n't be true if this keeps on ! " He had forgotten the girl , he had forgotten the boat , the time , the reason that had loosed the flood of words . He was shocked into awareness by a sound from her . Christine was weeping . Unchecked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stared at her . " My darling girl , what is it ! What 's wrong ! What have I said ! " His great arm about her as though she were a little child . " I hate them ! " she sobbed , hysterically . " Who ? Who ? " " Those men in the office . " " What men ? " " Those men in the office . Years go . They thought I did n't hear . They were talking about you . Grampa Czar was with them . I hate them . And the ones you just talked about  --  " She was hardly coherent , she was weeping again . " Do n't , my little one . I did n't realize . I was thinking about my book . I 'd forgotten you were here . Forgive me . " The merry pink face was stricken . The tear-drenched eyes looked at him accusingly . " Why do n't you finish it , instead of talking about it !

Oh , Christine , forgive me . " She wiped her eyes , she blew her nose , there was about her the air of finality which marks not only the close of a scene but the end of a period in a life . " You ca n't send me back now . It 's too late . " " How , too late ? " " You should have thought of that fifty years ago , when you first came to Alaska . You 're stuck with it , Grampa Thor .

" He had returned from the War in late 1945 , handsomer than ever , feminine Seattle agreed . And not a scratch on him , male Seattle added . But six years had gone by , he was thirty-one , and whatever it was that he had been supposed to take hold of had eluded him . Millions of young men had endured pain and shock and had inflicted pain and shock and death on other millions of men . They had seen wholesale horror , they had known fear that turned the blood to waterand the bones to mush . They came home from the War and changed their clothes as they might after a hard day at the office or the shop . They pretended the past four or five years had never been , they appeared to drop the memories of war with the garments of war , they functioned , it seemed , normally . ...

No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I dish up , supper 's almost ready , the Gabbetts are coming over after , I forgot to get some Coke , she do n't drink , jump in the car and go down to the corner for some Cokes , will you ? Bay 's mother said to Dave Husack , in defense of their son , " It takes time to get used to everyday life after an experience like that . " " About ten million other boys have . " " How do you know they have ? You 're not their father . Bay 's more sensitive than most . He 'll take hold in time . "  |p242Louise  Husack loved her son blindly , and believed this . Dave Husack loved his son , with reservations , and rejected this . " Time ! He 's been playing around for six years now . " " He 's at the office every day . " " Two hours for lunch . When I say I want him to go to Alaska for a few weeks , learn something about where all that dough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , No , thank you very much , as if I 'd made a joke . " " It 's so wild and uncomfortable .

It used to be you had to be old , but look at Nixon , sharp as a gimlet , and that Neuberger , and kid governors all over the country like Michigan and New Jersey , and Dewey ran for President . President ! Damn near made it , too , if it had n't been for that damned cockalorum . But no , none of that for our Bay , he 's more sensitive than most . Who 's going to take over when I 'm gone !

I 'd have given anything for a daughter . That 's why I was so happy to have Dina here , almost like a daughter to us . I 've hoped and hoped that Bay would fall in love with her . I know she likes him . " " She say so ? " " She said she thought he was a dear boy . " " Uh-huh . " Whenever Dave took these matters up with his son , Bay listened in a polite but detached way which infuriated the older man , whose boiling point was , at best , low . Dave , seated at his office desk at the end of the day , glared at his son standing there at the window staringout at a city that lay , a pink opal , encircled by the sparkle of water and mountains . Dave 's desk was the uncluttered and impos/ing barricade behind which the middle-aged successful American businessman defends himself . No papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even the ugly base of a telephone . This hung suspendedand out of sight below the desk 's surface . Here was the battlefieldof a man who carried his schemes in his head , and his accomplished plans neatly filed elsewhere behind steel . Like Mort Caswell 's desk in the office building next door , like a hundred thousanddesks presided over by the successful , this polished expanse bore a photograph in a foot-square handsome standing silver frame . And like the thousands of others , it pictured a **26;201;TOOLONG against whose knee a child leaned . Louise Husack with Bay at the age of six . When angry  --  as he now was  --  Dave had the habit of picking up this heavy frame in one great fist and slamming it down on the desk . This he now did . Dave would have been shocked if some one had told him why he did this . Again , as in the Mort Caswell office , the photograph was an office fixture like the glowing colors of the oriental rugs , the pictures of ships , the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room that resounded now to the boom of Dave 's voice . " You just do n't seem to give a damn ! " Dave roared now . " What do you want , anyway ! " " Not a thing , Dad . " " You ought to be married by now and have two three kids and be in shape to run the business  --  if necessary . Which , " he added hastily , glancing down at himself and flicking an imaginary speck off his coat sleeve , " it is n't . But if this does n't interest you , as a job , what does ? Name it . What would you like to do ? " The handsome head did not turn away from the window toward the older man . He spoke casually , a quiet and detached amusement lurked in his tone . This Dave Husack found maddening . " I just told you . Not a thing . I know I ought to say I 've been wanting to write a book , or go into politics , or take up ranching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or manufacture something , or go back to school and become a physicist . Everybody 's a physicist . This business is all right , it 's legitimate and successful , but there'sp244no gamble in it , no margin for error . It 's like a bullfight . No matter how much he paws the ground and bellows he 's a dead bull before he sets foot in the ring . There 's all that fish and timber and metal and stuff in Alaska , but no matter how much Gruening and the rest of them roar it 's all yours . Of course there 's an art in it , as there is in every sport . And if the first torero does n't kill the bull there 's always a second . I guess I 'm just not interested in being a bullfighter . I 'm more the audience type . " Dave Husack 's face was dangerously empurpled . He whipped out his handkerchief , he stood up behind his desk , he seemed to pound his face as he angrily dabbed at it with the scented fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gall talking to me like that  --  you and your bullfights . For a fellow who 's so bored with the way his father gets it you spend a hell of a lot of money . If you do n't like money --  " " I do . I have n't said I did n't . I think it 's great . I 'm just not interested in the art of getting it , I suppose . I do n't even feel guilty about it , the way a lot of rich men 's sons do , always trying to give it away to foundations and stuff . I suppose that 's taxes . But they 're always apologizing for it . Joining movements and protesting . I 'm no secondorthird-generation Rockefeller or Lamont or Marshall Field . I think money 's fine . " Dave Husack 's voice started low because he felt as if he were choking , but it rose triumphantly in volume . " Why , you skunk , you ! I 've a good notion to sock you , big as you are , and I would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something happened to your head in the war , and you did n't tell us . Or else you 're a fairy . " Bay shook his head , he rejected this equably . " No . I seem to be normal enough . But I feel and behave a good deal like those kids who are running the streets in ducktail haircuts and zoot pants and sideburns , only I wear tailored suits and ten-dollar ties . " It was now that Dave Husack 's voice rose to a bellow . " You stinkinglittle rat ! Standing there grinning and telling me you 're normal . Normal ! " This was almost a screech . " You crazy contemptible  --  " There was a sharp rap at the door . It opened.  | " Come in , " Bay called . " Stay out ! " Dave yelled . The door opened wider now , and Dina Drake entered . " They can hear you down as far as the fourth floor . There 's quite a nice little crowd in the hall on this floor standing there letting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , will you ! " Dave roared . She ignored this . " Will one of you battlers drive me home ? I mean home to your house . My car is busted and I promised Aunt Louise I 'd come in at six . " She was looking directly at Bay . " I promised to do the place cards and the flowers for the dinner party . " Dave 's face was contorted with inner conflict as he endeavored to wrench his frenzied thoughts from finance to flowers . " Dinner party . I 'm not going to any dinner party . " " Yes you are , Uncle Dave . " She placed a sheaf of papers on his desk . " And sign these . " She placed a pen beside the papers . He seated himself , heavily , he began to scrawl his signature as she picked up each sheet . " Drive me home , Bay ? " " Why not ? " Bay said . " Do n't gush , " she retorted . Dave Husack did not look up as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go along with you , call Emilio and tell him not to come for me . " " He 's probably started , " Dina said quickly . " I 'll be gone . " He was as mercurial as a child , and as emotionally shallow . This girl could almost always distract him from the irritation of his angers , his problems . She knew this . He did not . He stood up now , he fingeredhis florid tie and patted his pockets . His face was magically cleared of the rage that had twisted it a few moments ago . Ten minutes later the three were cosily seated side by side in Bay 's car . Any casual observer would have seen three extraordinarily handsomepeople , relaxed , pleasure-bound , solvent , in a sports car whose size and power and chromatic charms even the snob-magazine illustrationsdid not exaggerate . The girl sat between the two men ,
