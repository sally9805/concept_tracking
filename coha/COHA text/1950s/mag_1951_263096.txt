In Paris one night last week , President Vincent Auriol of France sat down to a banquet of boeuf bouquetire in honor of a special group of guests : 41 French schoolboys who had some tales to tell . A few months before , each boy had set out on a solitary journey of thousands of miles with about $45 for the whole trip . For these winners of France 's oddest scholarships , dinner with M. Auriol was just one in a long series of adventures . <P> Road to Riches . The idea for the scholarships was born more than 45 years ago , in the mind of Jean Walter , a struggling young architect with a passion for travel . Each summer Walter would set out alone on a trip with enough money to get him far away from home , never enough to get him back . When his cash ran out , Walter was forced to learn to live by his industry and wits . He traveled in nine countries , worked as a farmhand , dishwasher , errand boy . <P> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole life : traces of lead ore , which he recognized because he had seen the same ore around a big mine near Joplin , Mo. , U.S.A. Against the advice of experts , Walter decided to start the Zellidja mine at the site . Within a few years he was getting rich . <P> He became a multimillionaire , with interests in big plantations in Morocco , a fine mansion in Paris . But Magnate Walter never forgot how he hit his first jackpot . In 1938 , he decided to set up his special scholarships so that other boys might learn to get around and keep their eyes open . Since then , he has sent 950 boys on journeys of adventure - always with just enough money to get far away from home . <P> Riding the Rods . Last week , this year 's crop of winners had plenty to report . They had covered nine different countries , had slept in haylofts , ridden the rods , done everything but beg , borrow or steal to get along . One boy had thumbed his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread by singing in the inns along the way . <P> Some boys got as far as the U.S. One worked his way across the Atlantic as a paint boy on a ship , traveled from New Orleans to Chicago , returned with a manuscript for a full-length book . Another boy cycled from Ontario to California , making his way by giving radio interviews . He was attacked by a bull , sideswiped by a car ; he witnessed eight automobile accidents and saw a man shoot his wife in the streets of Reno . <P> Says Jean Walter , now 68 : " In my own travels , I was able to contrast the different types of architecture , and that brought me success in my building projects . I was able to study different methods of farming , and that helped me improve my colonial plantations . I was able to study mining methods , and that brought me success in Zellidja . The boys will do likewise . "                   @ @
