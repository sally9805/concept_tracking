Crucial Day When antitrust lawyers filed their suit against the New Orleans Times-Picayune last June ( TIME , June 26 ) , they had an arm-long list of charges against the T-P and its afternoon sister , the States . By running the States at a loss , they charged , the Times-Picayune was trying to freeze out Publisher David Stern 's afternoon Item ; by threatening to withhold the T-P and States from news vendors handling the Item , it had tried to keep the Item off the streets ; by requiring national advertisers to run their ads in both the T-P and the States , the T-P was exposing the Item to unfair competition . <P> By last week , as the long , involved trial ended in federal court , the only charge that seemed to have been proved was one the T-P readily admitted : it had required national advertisers to sign up for both papers , and it insisted that that was a perfectly legal practice . The court , faced by 1,700 pages of testimony and 150 exhibits , would hand down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial day for publishers , since 176 other U.S. newspaper combinations follow the same advertising practice and may be affected by the court 's ruling .
