" He took note of the presence of many " members of churches other than our own " and in . a welcome to them appealed for a search for " that unity for which our Lord prayed . " He said : " As workers together with God we profoundly regret the divisions which sorely handicap the influ // ence of Christianity and blunt the Christian appeal . Whatever are our differences , we are all brothers in Christ . " There are genuine differences of conviction within and without the church which will not be easily or quickly resolved . But the differences must not deter us from continuous prayer and study until we reach that day when the prayer of our Redeemer is fully realized , ' that they all may be one as Thou , , Father , are in .

But we know what is going on behind the Iron Curtain in Russia and all the countries controlled by communism . We know the men of the Kremlin have crushed all liberty of thought and action . We know the subtle and persistent opposition to the international instrument of world peace and order . " He added : " We know the people of Russia , most of whom probably want peace , are kept in ignorance of the true intentions of the Western World by the false , artful propaganda of their leaders . We know that communism is atheistic in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his destiny . Most of all , we know the violent hatred all Communists have for Christianity as it finds expression in all the churches . " The church , along with all who believe in human freedom , must support the measures being taken by the United Nations to resist aggression , that all who love liberty may be secure in a free world . " But it will take more than armed force , more than argument , to make society impregnable to the threats and temptations of communism . Individually and corporately we must translate into fact our ideals of brotherhood , economic justice , peace and goodwill . Let us not forget it is the Christian religion , no communism , that has been the instigator of every present institution for the amelioration of human misery .
