txt The Senate gave a 60-to-0 vote of confidence today to its subcommittee that is investigating the charges through which Senator William Benton , Democrat of Connecticut , has called for the expulsion of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican of Wisconsin . The vote was accepted also as a Senate directive for the investigation to proceed . The extent to which it would carry on , in the light of a pending $2,000,000 libel-slander-conspiracy suit filed against Mr. Benton by Mr. McCarthy , became a matter of Congressional speculation . However , Senator Guy M. Gillette , Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the inquiry panel , told the Senate : " We will proceed as assiduously as we can to some sort of a conclusion . " Even before a long afternoon of fiery debate , accusations and countercharges broke out , Senator McCarthy had proposed that Senator Benton be investigated , too . He introduced a resolution calling for full-dress inquiry into Mr. Benton 's official , business and personal activities . It was referred to the same committee that appointed the group to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debate in which accusations are immune from accountability under law , the developments included the following : 1 . Senator McCarthy , in his resolution , employed " whereas " clauses to accuse Senator Benton of these acts : ( a ) Apparently seeking , as an Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the international information and cultural program ( 1945-47 ) to discredit his country " in the eyes of the world . " ( b ) Refusing to discharge William T. Stone , an assistant , after State Department security officers had recommended that he either resign or be dismissed . ( c ) Submitting to Moscow proofsheets of a magazine designed for distribution . among nations as an answer by the United States to Russian propaganda " for approval and editing before he ordered the same printed and distributed at great cost to the taxpayers . " ( d ) Hiring or retaining in employment in the State Department persons under fire on loyalty counts and of defending them at hearings . ( e ) Giving advice to Hiss ( apparently Alger Hiss , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he added Communist espionage as to State Department employment . 2 . Mr. McCarthy also called for an accounting of certain of Mr. Benton 's 1950 Senatorial campaign funds which he alleged were unreported as demanded by law , for linquiry into " fake televisions " portrayals of Mr. Benton in that campaign , for an accounting of State Department funds spent for films produced by Mr. Benton 's British connection , and an explanation of why Mr. Benton published the Encyclopedia Britannica with " ckeap labor in England in order to avoid the printers ' union scale char , ged in America . " Mr. Benton retorted that , at his request , the State Department bought no Britannica films while he was in the Department , and that the cost of publishing the Encyclopedia in England was 50 per cent higher than it would cost to publish in the United States . Mr. McCarthy , in his resolution , also called for examination of Mr. ' Benton 's income tax returns for the years 1947 through 1950 . At large issue was a series of charges made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an inquiry of him that constituted , he asserted , " theft " of taxpayers ' money . He compared the subcommittee 's payment of investigators and others with pocket-picking .

" She urges the Senate to vote against the pending test resolution which , due to the parliamentary situation , called for a dismissal of the subcommittee from its investigative job . She voted that way . So did Senator Carl Hayden , Democrat of Arizona , chairman of the parent committee , and officially at least , sponsor of the discharge resolution . So did the rest of the Senate that voted . Senator McCarthy , who had said previously that he would vote for a continuance of the inquiry but who added that he had " absolutely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absent when the vote was taken . ?
