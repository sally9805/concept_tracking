To reach them , over rugged trails , Dr. Greenwell often had to leave the buggy and go on horseback . Sometimes he had to walk . He has also answered calls by rowboat and switch engine .

It must be pretty good fare , he says , because he rarely sees a case of diet deficiency ( though he does report an occasional deficiency due to too little food and " too much bourbon ) . " And while he gives full credit to lifesaving antibiotics , Dr. Greenwell still carries sugar pills ( see below ) in his bag .
