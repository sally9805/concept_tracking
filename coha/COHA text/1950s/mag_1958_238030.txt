AFTER LONG SILENCE ( 350 pp. ) - Robert Gutwillig-Little , Brown ( $4 ) . <P> Younger generations-lost , silent , or beat-are presumed to share one quality : youth . After Long Silence , a first novel by Manhattan 's 26-year-old Robert Gut-willig , is symptomatic of a recent fictional tendency to portray the yo.ung as prematurely aged and jaded . A scabrous episode early in Author Gutwillig 's book suggests its Sagantiquated antics : " Males and females were naked to the waist . The couples seemed to be licking each other 's shoulders , necks , and chests . . . Each couple had a little can with holes in the top-like a large salt cellar-and from time to time they would stop their licking and shake out some stuff over each other ... I started sniffing and smelled cinnamon ... I focused on one of the standing couples , and the boy stopped , and snarled at me , ' Get your own date . ' ' ' <P> Zombis in Hipster-land . This bizarre rite , called the " cinnamon caper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he and his pals indulge in such mellow old youth-novel capers as fornication , abortion , homosexuality and illicit Negro-white love affairs . These goings-on take place at or near an Ivy Leaguish college named Arden that physically resembles Cornell , but the true locale is hipsterland , and the hero 's quest for identity is as manic as if he were looking for a hypodermic needle in a haystack . Stylistically , Author Gutwillig tries to evoke Scott Fitzgerald but merely invokes him . His novel 's value is as a minority report of a post-Korean war generation that is less interested in revolting against society than seceding from it . <P> The book moves as plotlessly as a dream . Tom is an upper Bohemian who lives on " infusions " from a trust fund and beds down off-campus with a girl named Lila , who frets about being half-Jewish but whose physique is as firm as her psyche is wobbly . Lila is one of the zombi women who people modern fiction ; she exists to do Tom 's will . Tom himself plays zombi to Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tinkers with machines and people " and usually cracks up both . <P> Apres Nous the Fallout . The Tom-Lila-Chris axis turns mainly on romanticized undergraduate japes , e.g. , a ten-day blackjack game , a 100-mile drive in a stolen milk truck . The trio and their clique habitually see life through one too many cocktail glasses , but the stem of boredom keeps breaking between their fingers . Chris bleeds to death in an auto crash , and Tom and Lila individually reach respectability across the great divide that separates the hipsters from the squares . <P> After Long Silence is revealing in spite of its author , not because of him . Fitzgerald 's " flaming youth ' ' was consciously breaking social taboos even when it did no more than kiss and pet . Novelist Gutwillig 's off-beat generation takes its sinning much more casually , but jabs itself with sensations for the sake of sensations . The author 's implied excuse for their frantic frivolities is apocalyptic-apres nons the fallout . But back of it all is the eternal romantic urge of the young to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Author Gutwillig 's characters is that the only way they can make time stand still is to kill it .
