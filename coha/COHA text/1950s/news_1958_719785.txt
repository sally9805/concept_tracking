txt General De Gaulle has three great problems . He must settle the Algerian question , revise the constitution and halt the rotting of the French franc . Of these three , the last is not the least . Of course all are inter-related , for it will be extremely difficult to put French government finances in ordeI so long as the Algerian war continues to drain the French budget or so long as the constitution forbids a government of sufficient strength to manage that budget . But without sound finances France will become increasingly unable to meet her military obligations and without a sound currency political stability will remain an illusion . And the franc may prove the most difficult of General De Gaulle 's problems . Every Frenchman , whatever his views on the proper course , can see the importance of Algeria and of constitutional reform ; both are dramatic issues . Both also lend themselves to the kind of dramatic action for which General De Gaulle is famed ; his whirlwind campaign through Algeria may be followed by a like campaign through the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fiscal problems can not be remedied by any such single , dramatic act . They require consistent and resolute action by a government that understands what needs to be done and , equally important , by a people who understand the need for doing it . The difficulty here is that Frenchmen have traditionally placed small value on national solvency , and this attitude has time and again led them to political chaos . In A Tale of Two Cities , for example , Charles Dickens sets the scene for the French Revolution by noting : " France ... rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill , making paper money and spending it . " Throughout their history the French have rolled repeatedly down the same smooth hill . Today they are tumbling down it rapidly . The value of the paper franc has been falling at a rate of about 15 percent a year ; a Frenchman 's first thought when he gets a franc is to get rid of it before inflation robs him . The damage this does is not limited to the domestic economy ; foreign currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would long since have disappeared except for repeated transfusions of " loans " from abroad . Just last January France received $655 million from American , European and international loan agencies . It will be gone before the year 's end . In a single month France 's deficit in the European Payments Union jumped from $59 million to $75 million . General De . Gaulle can not halt this with a speech . The government must be determined to cut its spending ; the French people must be prepared to pay the taxes for what their government spends . This is a solution , which unlike ' one for the problem of Algeria , is easy to see . But easier seen , it is far harder to apply . History , and the French way , are here aligned against General De Gaulle . But if he can persuade the French people to reckon with the insolvency for which they themselves are primarily responsible , he may well have won his greatest victory .               @ @ @ @ @ @
