" / have heard it said that Arctic explorers are inferior men who would be lost in the civilized world . " <P> <P> So said Arctic Explorer Lorenc Peter Elfred Freuchen. who never understood what a man wanted with the steam-heated creature comforts of civilization . Yet in civilization or out . inferior was hardly the word for Freuchen. who managed to fashion successful careers as newspaperman , lecturer , travel writer and novelist ( Eskimo ) . During World War II , the vigorous Dane found time to fight in his country 's anti-Nazi underground . Last summer he became a familiar figure across the U.S. as the fifth contestant to hit the jackpot on television 's The $64,000 Question. * Later , at the start of one more Arctic expedition , peg-legged Peter Freuchen died of a heart attack at 71 . <P> Although his ashes have long since been scattered over his beloved Greenland settlement of Thule , Freuchen 's restless mind still seems alive . After four months on the counters , his encyclopedic Book of the Seven Seas ( Julian Messner ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list is Freuchen 's final work . The Arctic Year , written with Ornithologist Finn Salomonsen ( Putnam ; $5.95 ) . It deserves a place alongside Freuchen 's earlier , bulky volumes of autobiography as a classic study of life in the North . <P> The Seven Seas is the product of Freuchen 's long , dark winters in Greenland , when his mind sailed off with the big bergs " as they floated eternally to their doom . " Wrote Freuchen : " Little by little it dawned upon me that there is a logical connection between everything that happens in that immense connected body of salty water that covers 71 percent of the surface of the earth . " That logic led Explorer Freuchen to learn the lore he put into his book . He studied the science of the tides , waves and winds , learned about history 's great sea battles . He came to know the tales of the great seaborne adventurers , from Bjarni Herjulfson. reputed to be the first Viking to see America , to Boston Harry Adams , the ugly Ohio farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday Island . <P> While mastering his knowledge of the sea . Freuchen also found time to study the Arctic . The result was The Arctic Year , a month-by-month account of everything those white wastes have to offer . Nothing is missing-from January storms that sweep the landscape and uncover food for such delicate songbirds as Hornemann 's redpoll , to the May migrations of barnacle geese coming home to lay their eggs . Attuned to the frigid , lonely rhythms of northern life . Freuchen filled the book with his affection for a land he loved all the more because civilized men with all their technology have never really been able to change it . <P> Even for Freuchen the North could be hard . He lost a leg to frostbite and he grew his beard not because he was an eccentric but because long exposure had left his face too tender for a razor . But , he wrote , " those who have been to the Arctic always long to go back . The unrest never leaves them and they will sacrifice much to once again glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar arctic objects as a walrus tooth and a harpoon head , a task Freuchen found far simpler than naming his half-Eskimo children : Mequsaq Avataq **25;15819;TOOLONG and Piplauk Jette Tukuminguaq Kasaluk Palika Hager.
