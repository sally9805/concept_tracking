As President de Gaulle 's ministers sat down in the big Salon des Portraits of the Elyses Palace , the pressures for a decision on Algeria were closing in on France . Operation Binoculars , the new military campaign to crush the rebels , was going slowly . Within the week President Eisenhower would arrive to hear what , if any , new solution De Gaulle had to settle the five-year war . " A climate of expectancy and uncertainty mixed with apprehension reigns , " reported Le Monde . " The moment is coming when the game is either lost or won . " <P> For four hours the ministers talked in the 90 heat . De Gaulle seemed to have decided on a plan , but gave his colleagues no inkling of what it was . Instead , he polled their views . A small group was for a harsh , unrelenting continuation of the war until Algeria could be integrated with France . At least three " liberals " urged independence for Algeria , even if it meant negotiating with the F.L.N. terrorists . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third alternative De Gaulle had put before them : an entirely new juridical status for Algeria , to be submitted to Algerians in a referendum . The new status was not clearly defined , though some talked about a " Puerto Rico " solution patterned after Puerto Rico 's affiliation with the U.S. De Gaulle was left to decide for himself . <P> Next morning De Gaulle took off in a twin-jet Caravelle for Algeria to sample the sentiments of the army . Pointedly skipping major cities ( where he would have had to deal with intransigent French colons ) , he barnstormed army units throughout Algeria , hopping from place to place by helicopter and DC-3 . He chatted with hundreds of officers and noncoms , ate all his meals with officers of colonel 's rank or under . Often he would ask a local commander to come along for a confidential chat on a helicopter trip to the next stop . At Orleansville he had a long talk with Paratrooper General Jacques Massu . <P> At army headquarters in Kabylia , De Gaulle saw for himself the difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mountain sides for rebels . He watched helicopters swoop low over a 3,400-square-mile waste of mountains " as full of holes as a Gruyre cheese , " as one officer put it , and foot soldiers trudge up and down steep rocky inclines searching caves for the more than 10,000 terrorists hidden in the region . <P> Wherever De Gaulle went , he found the army wanting a better shake for Algeria 's Moslem population , but in no mood for Algerian independence or for giving up the fight . De Gaulle 's room for maneuver was small . Extremists in the rebel F.L.N. , in one of those unmistakable gestures meant to show that they had no intention of compromising , shot down 67-year-old Senator Cherif Benhabyles , an Algerian , in the streets of Vichy . A friend of F.L.N. Leader Ferhat Abbas , Benhabyles had offered to be a link in discussions with the French .
