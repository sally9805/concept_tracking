Rudolf Bing , general manager of New York 's Metropolitan Opera Company , is not given to discussing his dreams , but it has been whispered that he is haunted by a recurring nightmare . In the dream he is Prince Paris , lost atop a papier-mch Mount Ida on the Met 's stage . He is surrounded by three goddesses who insist that he choose the fairest of them by handing her an apple ( Golden Delicious , supplied by Sherry 's Restaurant ) . The goddesses , of course , are the three reigning sopranos who , season after season , vie for favor at the Met-Zinka Milanov , Maria Meneghini Callas and Renata Tebaldi . <P> The choice is harrowing . In the dream , Bing hems and haws , but a decision must be made . The three divas ' pet dogs advance on him . Zinka 's spitz , Nickie , growls ; Maria 's poodle , Toy , nips at his ankles ; and Renata 's poodle , New , crouches to jump . " Choose , choose , choose ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Alban Berg played backwards . <P> Bing wakes up , screaming . <P> Waking or sleeping , diplomatic Rudi Bing would rather stage the whole Ring Cycle with a company of midgets than publicize a preference among his three dazzling prima donnas . For sheer beauty of voice , the prize might go to Milanov , who at 52 still offers many a superb performance . For excitement , versatility and dramatic power , the apple would easily go to Maria Callas . But for sustained excellence of singing , it would go to Renata Tebaldi . <P> The three personalities are as different as their vocal specialties . If the award of Bing 's dream were ever to take place , Soprano Milanov , a buxom , outgoing , hearty woman , would probably take a bite out of the apple . Soprano Callas would coolly accept it as her due and have it mounted in diamonds . Soprano Tebaldi , if she followed form , would place it on her dressing table amid her collection of toy animals . On the surface , at least , Renata Tebaldi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of grand opera-a soprano without apparent temper , temperament or obtrusive ego . <P> Angel Voice . Much has happened to bolster her ego in the twelve years since Toscanini boosted her to fame by making her part of the great , emotion-charged concert that marked the postwar reopening of La Scala . The Maestro conceded that she sang with " the voice of an angel . " <P> Legions of operagoers agree . In Italy her appearances regularly touch off frenzies of acclaim the like of which the country has not seen in 30 years , since the heyday of Claudia Muzio . Since she made her U.S. debut ( in San Francisco ) eight years ago , every house she has sung to has been sold out , and her Bohme at the Metropolitan two seasons ago drew surging , partisan crowds that choked traffic around the house until 2 a.m . Some 30 cities in this country are bidding for her services at a top price of $5,000 per recital . Her American recording royalties alone from the 23 titles released by London yield her $30,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
