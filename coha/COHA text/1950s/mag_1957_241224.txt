The Rev. Geoffrey Beaumont is a learned and dedicated man of the cloth . In the gloom of his musty church in London 's Camberwell section , he conducts services for his working-class parishioners in language hallowed by generations of solemn Anglican usage . But when he sits down at his creaky upright parlor piano , he is likely to let himself go in the foot-stomping rhythms of the South Side jukeboxes . Last week he held a little party at the vicarage to display an unusual wedding of his two talents : a Mass set to popular rhythms and already known in the U.S. as the " Jazz Mass . " <P> When Anglican Beaumont . 53 , took over St. George 's in Camberwell early this year , he found that he was failing to draw the Teddy Boys and other loiterers off the street corners . So he decided to use a score he had been working on for several years to lure them with the kind of music they normally listened to and could sing . The last real folk Mass , he believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marbeck , a convicted heretic " I took the liturgy of the Prayer Book , Beaumont explains , " and tried to regard it simply as a lyric that somebody wanted me to write the music for . " <P> Over an eye-glazing bowl of punch based on a Spanish drink called " Blood " * Beaumont beat out his 20th Century Folk Mass last week for the benefit of his church servers , who clustered around the vicarage piano . Designed for use by a small orchestra , or combo , the Mass sometimes sounds romantic echoes of Sigmund Romberg ( the Credo ) , sometimes switches to a " beguine tempo " ( Kyrie , Agnus Dei ) , sometimes soars in the harmonies of the Negro spiritual ( " 0 praise God in his ho-li-ness " ) or thumps with a syncopated bass ( " We praise Thee , we bless Thee we praise Thee , we bless Thee " ) . At several points in the score , instruments are invited to swing into their own improvisations , e.g. , the trumpet after the passage , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Beaumont regards his Mass purely as an occasional piece which can be used to " zip up " a congregation . Although it has not yet been performed at St. George 's , it got a free-swinging reading in the U.S. last week by a six-man Brown University combo known as the Brown Brunotes , led by visiting Anglican Priest Michael Fisher . When Father Beaumont performs it in his own church , he knows just the kind of combo he wants : a small , zippy dance band , perhaps with some of the gutty quality of a Louis Armstrong . Guy Lombardo , he feels , would be entirely too smooth .
