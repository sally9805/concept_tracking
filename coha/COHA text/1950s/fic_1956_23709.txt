Golida bent close to the manager and spoke softly so that what he said could not be heard by the other men at the table . They were having breakfast , fresh fruit  --  mostly breadfruit  --  and fruit juice , as usual . And powdered eggs and powdered coffee with powdered milk . As usual . The morning routine had so far been so well preserved that nothing had happened to make Frank rouse himself from that still-half-asleep feeling . In a while he and the rest of the administrative staff of the lumber camp would be out in the fields or in the sawmill , sweating alongside the native laborers . But for now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat of his coffee and the humidity he imagined he could see being raised off the yellow-brown river  --  the Magdalena  --  by the seven-in-the-morning South American sun . McAnder , partly turning from Golida , said , " You 'd better tell everyone so we 'll all start out even . " " Some of illy men were out on the west road this morning and found new paths cut across it in several places . They were cut last night . " Frank said nothing . He was newer and younger than the others . But he could feel the sudden tension , as if a wire had been drawn taut around them all . Collins , the mill foreman , said , " What about the other roads ? " his incredibly thick arms hanging easy at his sides as he tipped back on his chair . " The mill road , " Golida said , " the south and north river roads also . All the roads , " he said . " Did your men see anyone ? " McAnder said . " No one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins said . " We have n't looked , " Golida said . " I just got back from the other roads . We thought at first they might have been only going through to get upstream . " " We can check across the river later , " McAnder said . He turned back to Golida . " Has anyone checked on Montoy ? " " He was in the shack all night , " Golida said . " He said he could not sleep . He got some others to play cards with him . They were still playing when I went by . " " Did the others bear out his story ? " McAnder said . " Yes . They were very tired . He said he could n't sleep . They stayed up with him . " " Did you believe them ? " Collins said . " Yes . " " Who were they ? " McAnder said , a look of abstraction on his face , as if he were already writing the necessary report of the incident for the home office . Golida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be telling the truth . " Frank 's right hand , of itself , rested on his holster . He withdrew it self-consciously . " What do you think they 're here for ? " " Probably after Montoy , " Collins said . He said it looking directly at McAnder , his own body still rocking slowly and evenly on the tilted chair . " All right , " McAnder said . " I know . You told me . The responsibility 's mine . " He looked around the table . " However , I do n't think anything will happen unless we start it . After all , we 've been living next to each other for three years now and nothing 's happened . " He looked at Collins . " What do you think , John ? " " You 're right , I suppose . " He let the chair replace its two front legs noiselessly on the floor . " The main thing , " McAnder said , " is just to go through a normal working day . I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . Close together . I do n't want anyone going off alone . And I do n't want anyone to be able to go off alone . If you see them coming in I want you to move back into camp . " He paused . " John , put someone up on top of the mill with glasses . If you get word that they 're corning , shut the saws down and move back here . All of you together . " " Do n't you think someone ought to stay with the machinery ? " Collins said . " No . The most important thing is to guard the generator back here . " Turning to the pilot , who was on one of his biweekly supply trips , McAnder said , " I think it would he wise if you got your plane out right away . We certainly wo n't be able to guard it . Golida , get some men and get him out to the field . You 'd better stay until he 's cleared the mountain . " Tyler got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He followed Golida out . Frank watched him leave . Tyler had been his first two lessons . First by lecture and then by example . The example had been Tyler getting drunk one night and wandering out to the field . He 'd seen someone fooling around the plane , thought it was a bandit , and shot him . It had been one of the workers . Frank had expected trouble . A massacre even . But some sort of reprisal , anyway . There had been none . Not even a brooding silence . Nothing . These people cared about life almost nobly , Frank had learned . But they accepted categorically all of its tragedies as if they were meaningless blunders . These were natives , however . These were not the bandits . .. So , " McAnder said , " keep the men close together , get your regular jobs done , and by all means do n't shoot unless you 're directly attacked . " " We probably wo n't see them until sundown , anyway , " Collins said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right about that , " McAnder said . " We wo n't see them till sundown . " The men started getting up . " John , I 've got a job for Frank . I 'll send him along later . " Everyone had left . " More coffee ? " " No thanks . I 'm still not used to it . I can just about manage a cup to have something to smoke on . " MeAntler poured himself a cup of coffee . " Too bad they do n't give you a course in handling bandits in forestry school . " " Dad used to tell me about diem . Except when he was down here they were called the People 's Rural Movement . " " Still are . Only they 've been so completely beaten for so many years they 're just plain or-dinary bandits now . " Frank drummed on the table in the silence after the remark . " Listen , Joe . ? uh . . well , I just hope you are n't planning to keep me under lock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what I mean . . " " Well , as a matter of fact , I thought I 'd send you across the river to scout the cemetery just to make sure no one got that idea . You wo n't run into anything . They 're not interested in us . I just want to find out whether they 're over there too . " " Fine , " Frank said . " Take Xavier with you . " " Okay , " he said , getting up . " And remember , no fireworks . . " " Do n't worry , " Frank said , the door whacking shut behind him . XAVIER was known on the books as the horseboy , although there were no horses in the camp  --  only four mules  --  and Xavier 's main job was keeping the jeeps running . Still , he prided himself on being , at least for official purposes , a keeper of horses . Secondly , he prided himself on his mechanical skill . He hoped eventually to become either a chauffeur for one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his grandest dream , a chief groom for one of the country gentlemen near the capital . In the meantime he kept the work mules immaculately groomed , and the motors of the jeeps so spotless that they could have been installed in a racing car for the Mexican Cross-Country and exhibited before the world . That the motors were also always in perfect working condition was unquestioned , even by himself , though he might have had to work all night when one , or two , or even three of the motors failed simultaneously . The sun was hot off the brown water already , although it was only nine o'clock . As he and Xavier paddled across to the cemetery , Frank was very careful to keep his hands high on the neck of the paddle all the way through the stroke . The mouthfish could strip all the flesh off your hand fasten- than your brain could realize that your hand was in the water . Frank was careful to crook his elbow outward instead of down . The two of them looked like stiff-jointed automatons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the longest in the world if you counted the tributaries that joined it to the Amazon . It was affected by the tide all the way to these tributaries . Which made it the prime prey of the bandits . The river was navigated by several almost-Hatbottomed rear-wheelers , looking like smaller-scale models of their Mississippi ancestors . Citizens of the country who could n't afford the air , and people in general who did n't know any better or just did n't care , traveled on the riverboats . Every so often a riverboat would get caught between towns when the tide went out and the river became a creek . The boat would have to sit on the river bottom until the tide came in again . But before the tide ever came in and the boat could move , the bandits were there , as immediately as the nionthfish were there when any flesh touched the surface of their river . The passengers and crew were usually killed , the boat stripped of everything valuable . But the boat itself was left intact  --  perfectly intact  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bandits their supplies and money . This state of affairs was also accepted . Even by the government No guards were provided . The government only acted when the bandits raided outside their jungle area . Then the government would send troops to the town that had already been raided and the bandits would return to the jungle . At first , years ago , the government troops refused to go into the jungle after them . Now the government officials no longer thought it even worth while . They preferred just to absorb the insult of having outlying towns occasionally raided . It was accepted by everyone . FROM time to time Frank caught a glimpse of Xavier 's face . Xavier looked completely unconcerned , as if the bandits were n't even there , as if the bandits moved in an entirely different reality . His face looked like the face of one who is being patient with children . Hell , Frank thought , maybe he does n't care . Anyway , it was a very effective act to put on for an American . They beached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush so that if anyone tried to take it while they were in the cemetery they 'd have to make a lot of noise . Frank unsnapped his holster flap and bent the flap backwards so that it slid into his belt and was held there , leaving the .45 open to his hand . Xavier had no sidearm . Frank unsheathed his machete and carried it in his left hand . Again he noticed that Xavier left his machete in its sheath . " We 'll stay together , " Frank said , and then , maybe as compensation for his discretion or for his .45 or for having taken out the machete , he took the lead on the path into the graveyard . It was a matted floor , sheltered by thicktrunked trees that were seventy or eighty feet tall . Sunlight filtered through to the earth without ever striking it directly . Posts that reached Frank 's waist angled up haphazardly all around the floor . Each post was centered in a mound , and the time of its presence there could ' be measured by how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kept shiny new , and a few colored ribbons hung from each mailbox . The ribbons were always changed before they became weather-worn . Looking at them , Frank thought of the native who had been shot by the pilot , and of their death  --  the natives ' death  --  which was much more beautiful than the white men 's death , somehow much more appealing , somehow maybe even of a different world entirely . . . He did n't finish the thought because he was walking straight for an opening that had been hacked very recently . He stopped frigidly , his hand again on his automatic . The jungle was thick and the path had been cut through it as if by a machine . " Xavier , " he said , not looking around , his eyes trying to see deeper into the path than was possible . He turned . Xavier was gone . He thought automatically , Xavier is half-Spanish , half-white , and did not search the thought at all . Without turning lie backed slowly away from the path until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic and nothing happened . He turned . It was only one of those absurd mailboxes . Simultaneously his thoughts went backwards and he was surprised that he had the .45 out and then surprised that it had n't gone off . Then he realized that the safety was on and ALL THE GUTS replaced the weapon in his holster , and then became ashamed that he would have just automatically , for no reason at all , pulled the trigger , and if the safety had n't been on , and McAnder telling them not to shoot , .. . Xavier said , " The same over there . " He pointed . There was another opening on the other side of the graveyard . The bandits must now parallel the river , were perhaps watching them . . . . Frank was furious at Xavier . He almost insulted the horseboy , but rcad his own motives , and then became more infuriated . Had it not been for Xavier and keeping face in front of him , Frank would have backed all the way to the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path that led back to the boat , happy that he had Xavier behind him , between him and the bandits , and happy that he was furious enough not to question his own courage about it , and happy that he could get away with it without Xavier knowing why he went first . When they recrossed the river Frank had to sit in the stern as he had coming over . At any instant he expected to feel his head exploding . He kept his head bent so that it offered a small target from behind . Also , he tried to move from side to side so that he would n't he quite a sitting target . He wondered whether Xavier was aware of all this . But Xavier did not turn until they were ready to beach the boat . Frank left him like a personal servant to complete the task . T H E routine was broken only at lunch when everyone came back to the camp to eat instead of staying in the field . McAnder had posted double lookouts . After the door had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAnder said , " Well , Frank tells me they 're across the river too . " " We do n't have to worry about them coming from over there , " Collins said , not even looking up from his food . " No , I do n't think so . At any rate , Golida is certain we do n't have anything to worry about anyway till sundown . " " What about Montoy ? " one of the field foremen said . " I 'd certainly like to get him out of here , but I was n't even thinking in those terms when I sent the plane out . " " I guess none of us were , " Collins said . " As far as I know , there 's no way of getting him out now . Even if we could I 'm not so sure it 'd be a good idea . Right now I think they 're just interested in him . if we got him out they might take everything out on us . " " You 're right about that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bunkhouse , " McAnder said . " But I wo n't try to stop him if he tries to leave . " " It 'd be suicide it he tried . " Collins said . " And he must know that . " The field foreman said , " As long as he 's here I feel a whole lot better . I do n't want those jokers to walk in and not find him . " " What 'll they do to him ? " Frank said . " Well , they 'll be reclaiming their own , so to speak , " McAnder said . " He 's broken their code . . . . " " Yeah . But what 'll they do to him ? " " I ca n't say , " McAnder said , all too quickly . " You 've radioed out ? " Collins said . McAnder nodded yes . " Fat chance we 've got of the government sending help , even by foot , " one of the men said . " They 'd be afraid of arriving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company sending any sort of help ? " " They ca n't muster anything that 'd do any good , " Collins said . " Well , " McAnder said , " at least we made the experiment . " Frank was thinking about Montoy . He 'd come into the camp two nights before dressed in knee-length shorts , army boots , and an old army shirt . He had an army pack on his back , carried a rifle , wore a machete , a sidearm , and two cartridge belts . He 'd wanted to go to work for the Americans . McAnder put him on as a regular laborer . Montoy had seemed perfectly satisfied . . The only trouble was , he was a deserter from the bandits . " The political situation here is this , " McAnder had said when Frank first arrived at the camp . " The Conservatives are always in power . They control the army . The Liberals do n't even bother to try to get to the polls . They just keep up their self-respect by talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the bandits  --  and by talking in terms of ' next year . ' " Frank had asked about the bandits . " Well , as far as we 're concerned , they 're a pretty harmless lot . They want to keep us as friends in case they ever get into power . Very simply because we 're one of the few economic mainstays of the country . If they ever do get into power they 'll try to throw us out , but not until they 're damned sure they can do as well . So they 've never bothered us . " Then Collins had said , " What it conies to is this . All the guys who never get to be anything more than sergeants in the army or clerks in the government because they 're Liberals take off for the hills and join one of the bandit gangs . There 're about three or four groups . Maybe a thousand all together including the women and the children . They just live in the jungle and the men kick up a row every so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a kind of interlocking joint-chief-staff . " " What 'll they do to Montoy ? " Frank asked again . ? " They 'll come in and get him , " Collins said . Frank decided not to push the question any further . He was beginning to be afraid of getting an answer . He was to be a lookout that afternoon . Walking out to the mill with Collins , both of them carrying rifles , he said , " You mean we 're just going to let them take him ? " Not much choice , " Collins said . " There 'll be a helluva lot more of them than us . " " But , my Cod , we ca n't just let them take him ! " " They 'd rip us to shreds . And it would n't do any good anyway . " But Jesus ! " " Listen , " Collins said , suddenly sharp , " do n't you but Jesus me ! There 's not a damn thing we can do , and you might as well make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof of the mill the.sun was sickeningly hot . Frank did n't feel well anyway , as if his lunch were just molding heavy in his stomach . He felt like vomiting , but he did n't dare . Not that they 'd hear him through the mill racket , but his relief would find the mess . Thinking about Montoy made the feeling worse , so he switched to the pleasantest thing he could think of ; Which was Judy . And how he 'd be marrying her . when he got back to the States at the end of the year . He got her last letter out of his back pocket . It was clammy and looked as if it had been left outside somewhere and rained on and dried in the sun . But it had n't been left outside , it was just his sweating through the pocket . The letter had taken on the curve of his rump . On second thought he put the letter back . He was supposed to be keeping a lookout . He forgot his stomach for a moment while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the rifle and the .45 and the glasses , and the sweat-stained shirt and the hat , and bandits expected and him on guard . He could almost hear himself telling her the story in bed some night . ? . . But then Montoy and the vomit feeling were back and he even gagged , though without getting rid of anything . He felt better after gagging and he wished he could smoke , but it was too hot to smoke and the thought of the taste of the cigarette dry and harsh in the sun made him immediately not want the cigarette . Besides , he 'd catch hell for smoking around the mill anyway . But you could n't just let them take Montoy . He was thinking in terms of movies and he knew it . But it did n't make any difference . He was thinking about how he 'd always wanted to go back to the old West and carry a six-gun , and how he 'd always figured that even though he was MAGAZINE chicken in a lot of things , what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) would back him up no natter what situation he got into . Well , goddammit , this is like the movies ! They always outnumber you . He kept thinking , so what if I am thinking in terms of movies , someone , sometime , must have pulled off a movie stunt in reality . It would be just fighting it out in a bar ( all right , the movies ! ) , or even better , like the British holed up in a stockade in India . You have to do something . You ca n't just let them come in and get him and take him off . Ile felt amazingly better . The idea of what might happen to him scared him so that the scared feeling was like ice-cold courage . it completely dissolved the nauseous feeling . Hell , it must be right . . . . The blue haze on the mountains and hills looked awfully quiet and peaceful . He felt as if what he was going to do would stand up to their judgment , while the other thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ANDER got everyone back to the camp early . It was about four thirty when they all gathered , natives and staff , around the staff living quarters in the center of the camp . McAnder was busy . He 'd stocked some of the houses with rifles and put half the workers and half the staff members in different buildings , with orders to the staff not to issue rifles unless the bandits started shooting or attacking . The rest of them stood outside the bunkhouses . Frank noticed that Xavier had removed himself from the main groups and was standing about twenty feet away leaning against a tree . He was no longer wearing his machete . But then , he had no reason to , normally , unless he were going into the field . Frank said to Collins , " Where 's Montoy ? " " He 's in his bunkhouse . Playing cards , I think . If he 's smart and he 's planning a break he wo n't try it until the very last second . " Collins looked out toward the mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " Frank saw them coming . They were already past the mill , walking with their arms linked together . He followed the line with his eyes . It swept all around them in a tremendous arm-linked LT from river bank to river bank . They had just stepped out of the jungle and they were walking in , the center of the U aimed at Montoy 's bunkhouse . They were dressed the same as Montoy had been when he 'd first come in , except that they wore no packs and their rifles were slung in back . Some of them , Frank saw , wore sneakers . He wanted to raise his hand from his side and at least place it on the .45 . But he could n't . ALL THE GUTS He physically could n't . His whole body was that way . He saw Xavier step out from the tree and stand there facing the bandits . Frank 's stomach tightened up . He thought he might scream . They were walking directly toward Xavier . Xavier did n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Frank had no control over himself . His eyes snapped shut . The most he wanted was not to see it , not to hear it . . It was only an instant . When he opened his eyes the bandits had silently parted and gone by Xavier and then stopped in front of him . He could n't look at them . He looked at their shoes . They were , perhaps , six feet away . In the silence he heard Xavier spit again . He tried to raise his eyes , but he could n't . He was afraid his hand or his arm from being held so still might jerk and they 'd shoot him thinking he was going to try to get his gun . He moved his whole body sideways to them . Then he saw the group , their weapons still holstered , going toward Montoy 's bunkhouse . Before they got to the door there was the sound of a shot from inside . They did n't even go in . They turned , and the whole line moved back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle , but still moving back into it . They were gone and they might never have been there , Suddenly , everyone was running toward Montoy 's bunkhouse . Collins had already blocked the door . The talking was very loud . It was all around him . He turned and ran down to the dock . Bent double over one of the posts and holding on to it he threw up into the river . FROM beyond the screening and the netting there were the usual night noises . Frank was lying face down on his bed . His .45 and its belt and holster lay on his desk . McAnder had come in and had sat down on his desk chair . He 'd been talking for a long time . Frank could n't listen . He 'd tried . Even McAnder must have known , must have known that he 'd believed he should have done something ... . Frank could smell the pipe smoke . " You know , " McAnder was saying , " the worst possible thing you could have done would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all . " He stopped . Then he said , " You know . that was n't even a test . If you 're looking for real tests you 'll find enough of them as you grow older . Only a fool would have thought that was a test . " Frank heard him sucking on his pipe . " You know , son , it 's not necessary to have all the guts in the world . Because that would mean you 'd just have sheer guts . Nothing you ever did would have any meaning . You 'd just be a damned fool . Look , " he said , " you like John . Do n't you think enough of him to know that if something could have been done he 'd have done it ? " He stopped . " Tell me , " he said . " I guess . " " Come on . " " Yes . He would have . " " Listen , Frank , we 're all out in the main room . We 've got some Scotch and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you a lot of good . And you 'll see what I mean . You 'll see why we did n't do anything . " But it was me , Frank thought , who did n't do anything . " Why do n't you tome out and join us ? " " I will , " Frank said . " In a few minutes . " " And do n't forget to put this back on tomorrow , " McAnder said , tapping the .45 . " I 'll wait for you inside . " Still , it was me who did n't do anything . They knew not to do anything . He was worried the drink might make him sick , But he could n't stay off like this , he could n't keep staying off alone like a little boy feeling had . He wondered how he 'd be able to walk into that room after not going to dinner and staying off like this . He could see them turning to look at him with them knowing that he 'd thought he should have done something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gutless , he said to himself . But he had to go back inside . He had to do that . He had to force himself . No matter what . He stood up , conscious of the smell of his own clothes , his own sweat . One of the first things he 'd noticed when he got here was the same smell on everyone else . He 'd gotten used to it and had n't noticed it again till now , He had to stop thinking , make his mind a blank before he could do it . But then he went out to the main room .
