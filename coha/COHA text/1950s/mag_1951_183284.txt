At the end of the fiscal year last week , the 82nd Congress had not passed a single regular appropriation . There had been fundless days before , when one or another department failed to get its moneys voted . This time Congress had failed to provide a single dime for any part of the U.S. Government after July 1 . In a last-minute spasm-after jamming through the controls extension ( see above ) - with characteristic confusion , wild errors and panicky haste , Congress jammed through a 31-day authorization to continue spending . It will be three weeks before the $8.5 billion foreign military aid bill even gets out of the House committee , a month before the Armed Services bill gets to the floor . <P> On its record so far , the 82nd qualified as one of the worst in history . No other Congress , not even the Republican 80th , which Harry Truman called the worst , was ever so far behind in its work . <P> " That Man . " Congress would have to pay for its sins of omission by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " legislation through , it will probably have to keep on going at least until Oct. 1 . Naturally , no single man or faction would take the blame . Everyone wore a " Who , me ? " expression . Each protested that he had only been trying to do what was best for the U.S. Then who was to blame ? <P> " That man in the White House , " said many . And in fact , most of the time Harry Truman appeared to be riding his program no-hands , only putting his head down and beginning to pump when he saw some political advantage . He had given his supporters in Congress almost no help . More than once he had left them in the lurch . But to lay it all on Harry Truman was to overlook the 82nd 's own wobblings , digressions and busyness with grubby politics . <P> The 82nd was politically atomized-only nominally Democratic . The House breaks down like this : 115 Southern Democrats , 120 Fair Deal Democrats , 165 regular Republicans , 35 lonely liberal Republicans . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could unite and did on one negative course : bilking Harry Truman . Republican motives were obvious . Southern Democrats were still going around with old Truman spears sticking out of their hides . Some of the bitterest denunciations of the President came in Dixie accents . Almost every day a new dirty Truman story guffawed out of Democratic cloakrooms . <P> " Where Are We At ? " In the face of such opposition , Truman Democrats had neither the leadership nor the internal strength to do anything . The most astute Administration leader in Congress was 69-year-old Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas , who , besides having nothing to lead , was himself a political hybrid : half Fair Dealer , half Southern Democrat . Majority Leader McFarland in the Senate was no leader at all , nor was he undeviatingly loyal to the White House ( see above ) . The regular Democrats had little control over committees , where legislation is corked up , or any real control over bills when they reached the floor .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
