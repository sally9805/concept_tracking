txt Governor Herter , eager to trim needless or questionable authorized expenditures , has ordered work halted on a $750,000 tideless lagoon in South Boston which was given the go-ahead signal by the 1952 Legislature . This " cease work " order to Edgar F. Cepell , chairman of the Metropolitan District Commission , is typical of the Herter ap- proach to the problem of mounting expenditures on Beacon Hill . Coupled with his inaugural message statement that he planned to " make a complete review of - all current plans for ( highway ) construction to make certain that the projects needed most will begin promptly , " the latest Herter action shows he is moving with caution but with postiveness . The Governor wants to know the value of the Pleasure Bay project , its eventual total cost and the like , before agreeing to its construction . The Pleasure Bay tideless swimming pool was one of the most controversial issues during the 1952 legislative session . It is a pet project of Senator John E. Powers ( D ) of South Boston , Senate Minority Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that the project had been beaten . But later , after tremendous pressure exerted by the South Boston legislator and with the aid of Governor Dever , the $750,000 expenditure was approved . A chief objection to the proposal is that the cost will be assessed on the communities in the Metropolitan district , although the project 's funds are contained within the state 's capital-outlay program . Legislators in several communities outside Boston are not too keen over the fact that their communities will have to pay for ' mart of the Pleasure Bay costs . $100,000 Interest Under provisions of the authorization , Metropolitan District communities are to be assessed a total of 585,000 annually for 10 years , if the project is constructed . That means the state 's general fund will be reimbursed by a total of $850,000 over the 10-year period , the extra $100,000 being for interest charges . The act authorizing the project permits the MDC to - improve Pleasure Bay in the South Boston district of the city of Boston by such dredging or filling as may be necessary and by constructing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Head House , so called , at City Point , so that said Pleasure Bay shall be landlocked , provided , however , that said causeway shall be constructed with gates or locks to permit the rise and fall of the tide , and the control of the water level in GOP in Control Unlike in the 1952 Legislature , the GOP is now in numerical control of both legislative branches . Last year , the House , was Democratic while the Senate was 22-to-18 Republican . The Senate GOP margin was sufficiently narrow , however , so that on legislation which Governor Dever considered must for one reason or another he usually could persuade a few Republican senators to vote for his projects or stay away during the voting . This year the Senate Republican margin is 25 to 15 , the House is Republican 123 to 117 , and the governorship is in the hands of Republican Governor Herter . Thus , if Governor Herter should favor abandonment of the Pleasure Bay as too costly for the value to be received , the chances are he could win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give up without a fight . He worked too long and hard to jam the authorization through the Senate in 1952 to give up now . He can be counted on to use every possible means to protect the project . A public hearing before the Legislative Committee on Metropolitan Affairs is scheduled Feb. 4 , according to Mr. Bayley . Meanwhile , the only work done on the project has been the partial preparation of engineering plans by the State Division of Waterways in the Department of Public Works , the MDC reports .
