The Chinese Communists called for their old touchdown play . Hoping again to split the U.S. Eighth Army by smashing through its center , they pushed 100,000 men against a 20-mile front in mountainous central Korea . <P> This time the play did not click . U.N . troops gave up unimportant sectors , but held where they had to , as at Chipyong . Then General Ridgway shifted his strength eastward from Seoul . The U.N . line snapped back . Armored counterattacks relieved Chipyong , smashed north from Wonju . North of Ichon , U.N . troops bashed in the west flank of the Red drive . <P> By Friday the Chinese attack was spent and broken . Switching objectives eastward , the enemy sent two North Korean corps against the minor communications center of Chechon . Here , too , U.S. counterattacks , backed by artillery and air concentrations , held the Red advance to a walk . <P> By week 's end , the Communists had taken casualties estimated at 33,000 . South of Seoul , Puerto Rican G.I.s literally annihilated a Communist regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillerymen reported 1,100 Chinese Reds dead in their foxholes . At Wonju and Chechon the hills were littered with enemy dead and abandoned weapons . U.N . planes dropped leaflets over the Communist lines ; on them was printed a terse " Count your men . " <P> <P> This week the Reds broke contact over most of a 70-mile front , fell back to lick their wounds . Matthew Ridgway , who is not given to boasting , claimed a clear-cut victory : " We have defeated the Communist counteroffensive in the central sector . The Communists have taken a fearful beating , and have disengaged . "
