Last week the Administration announced a new policy for increasing stockpiles . It was a turnabout from the policy laid down only five months ago . Then , the Office of Defense Mobilization had ordered a slowdown in stockpile purchases on the ground that the piles were about big enough . What had happened since November to cause the switch ? <P> The announced reason for increasing stockpiles , which now contain $4.3 billion worth of materials , was that war might cut off the flow of strategic materials . Actually , the Administration was making a strategic virtue of economic necessity . Prices for many metals have softened so much since the shooting stopped in Korea that cries for help have sounded on the ears of Senators and Representatives from mining states . Increased stockpiling of 35 to 40 minerals and metals will tend to firm up prices , help keep U.S. mines and smelters in operation and tone down producers ' demands for more tariff protection , since stockpile additions are " to be purchased , wherever possible , from domestic producers .

" <P> Another reason for boosting stockpiles is that the Administration is being forced to buy up more stocks of copper , lead , zinc , tin , magnesium , tungsten and other metals than it had planned . While the fighting was on in Korea , the Truman Administration encouraged expansion of domestic mineral and metal products beyond normal needs by guaranteeing a market for much of the extra output . The guarantees served their purpose . But when demand slacked off and prices fell , the Administration had to buy up the surplus . It either had to raise stockpile limits or dump excess metals on a shaky market . <P> The post-Korean sag in metals also severely jolted some metal-exporting foreign countries , and the higher goals may allow some stockpile " purchasing abroad . The Randall Report , the Milton Eisenhower Report on Latin America and the Capehart Report on defense production all recommended increased stockpiling as a sound way of bolstering wobbly foreign economies .
