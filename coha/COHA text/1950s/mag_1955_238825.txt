RUSSIA The Visitor <P> Only 14 years before , Nazi troops were probing to within 20 miles of Moscow , and behind them half a million square miles of Russia lay charred . Only ten years before , a sullen shuffle of a defeated , captured Nazi army marched on dismal parade through Moscow 's streets . And now , with a rattle of drums , a blare of horns and the clatter of a goose-stepping honor guard , the leader of the new Germany was received in Moscow . <P> There was no suggestion of the intimidated , the vanquished or the bidden about Konrad Adenauer 's visit . The Germans traveled east with a showy , if not disdainful , display of self-reliance . A gleaming , 13-car train , a " chancellery on wheels , " pulled in the day before carrying a huge entourage , with the Germans ' own communications , their own police , Mercedes sedans , and huge stocks of their own food ( sauerkraut , sausages , choice wines ) . Even the motorized gangway that pulled up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . <P> The Duelists . The first German Chancellor ever to visit Russia relieved this aura of bristly independence with a friendly smile as he stepped lightly down the gangway and grasped the warmly extended hand of Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin . <P> " May this be the beginning of ... normal good relations between Germany and the Soviet Union , " said Adenauer to the beaming reception committee of high Soviet officials . But even before the spoken formalities and the strains of West Germany 's Deutschland Lied were carried off by the brisk autumn wind , tough old <P> Konrad Adenauer got down to the business that had taken him into the camp of his antagonists . " This , " he said with a point to his words , " is the first contact between representatives of the Soviet Union and the German people . " <P> Thus the duel began , with Adenauer 's calculated and contemptuous dismissal of the Communist regime of East Germany . <P> In the " chancellery on wheels , " before the first session began , Adenauer counseled with his aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kremlin 's invitation to Adenauer-the formal recognition of a man they had so long reviled as an enemy , of a regime they had refused to recognize-was in itself bigger than anything that the visit itself was likely to produce . The Russians wanted to talk about formal diplomatic and economic relations between Moscow and Bonn , and to consider Germany 's reunification only at the price of West Germany 's withdrawal from the Western alliance . Adenauer had already agreed with the U.S. , Britain and France to refrain at Moscow from any dickering on such terms . Adenauer had a slight hope that the Russians , to encourage diplomatic relations , might be persuaded to return some of the Germans still imprisoned in Russia since World War II . Beyond that , what took place at Moscow hinged on the wary testing game that was about to be played , and on the unpredictable behavior of the Russians . <P> Fast &; Frank . In the marbled , white-and-gold music room of Spiridonovka palace ( once a Czarist millionaire 's mansion ) , the antagonists faced off . Bulganin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning sun at his back . Chancellor Adenauer , with Foreign Minister Brentano at his elbow , sat facing them . <P>
