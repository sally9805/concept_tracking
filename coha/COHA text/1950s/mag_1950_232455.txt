If you are a college graduate , have a son or daughter in ( or headed for ) college , or a special interest in higher education , I hope that you will read Crisis in the Colleges in this issue . This story calls attention to the severe monetary troubles that are threatening to change the nature of U.S. privately endowed colleges . <P> The subject of next week 's cover story in TIME is Picasso and modern art . It is eleven years since Pablo Picasso has been on TIME 'S cover , and he might well have reposed there 30 years before that , if we had been publishing then . Picasso and a handful of other old men living in France have dominated 20th Century art from its beginning . <P> TIME 'S Art writer , Alexander Eliot , spent a long working holiday in Europe last year talking with artists and looking at their work . He found a number of young painters and sculptors that TIME readers should know about , and reported on them in subsequent TIME stories , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still far outstrip their followers . <P> " In France , " Eliot said , " artists seem to age magnificently , perhaps because when they are young they worry less than U.S. artists about getting ahead . At 40 , a French painter is still classified as ' young ' and if he 's not yet ' arrived ' at 50 it 's not too serious ; he may still be admired in a cafe if not in a museum and his hopes for the future are treated with respect . France 's best painters-Picasso , Matisse , Rouault , Chagall , Braque , Utrillo , Derain , Dufy , Vlaminck and Lger-are all in their 60s and 70s . These young-old men are still the Alps of the modern art world . " <P> Next week 's issue not only discusses the art of these ten moderns , but also carries a four-page , four-color insert of their work . Except for the familiar Picassos , almost all of these paintings have never been reproduced in color in a magazine , and some have had no previous color reproduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way last February ; most of them had to be photographed in Paris . <P> The reproduction of these paintings in TIME involved the use of a new machine that TIME readers in the printing trade , in advertising , etc. may have heard about . The machine is an electronic color scanner , one of a whole group of experimental developments now under way . The scanner is designed to produce faster and more accurate color separation negatives . It may foreshadow a new era in the quality of color printing . It was originally conceived by Eastman Kodak engineers and cooperatively developed by TIME Inc. ' s research laboratories , which are exploring a wide range of new printing developments in cooperation with other research units in the industry and major suppliers . <P> The scanner is in its experimental stage , but it has already produced some interesting results - especially in bringing out the depths in dark colors . You can judge its work for yourself by examining closely the large center spread of paintings in next week 's color insert . <P> Cordially yours ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
