 | Salt Lake City Tabernacle Sings EERY SUNDAY morning Mrs. Mary Lou Bult of Salt Lake City rises at 5:30 and begins a familiar routine . After getting the family 's breakfast , she leaves her 12-year-old in charge of four younger children and drives to the Mormon Tabernacle , auditorium of the Church of the Latter-Day Saints , picking up her mother and sister en route . At 8:30 the three women take their places in the Salt Lake City Tabernacle Choir and begin the arduous rehearsal that precedes the regular Sunday-morning broadcast of this world-famous and beloved choral group . For 17 years Mrs. Bult has attended the choir 's two rehearsals a week , its weekly broadcast and innumerable concerts , missing only a few meetings . Asked why she does it , @# she said , " I guess it 's because it gives me deep satisfaction to be part of a group trying through music to tell about the love and power of God . " It is probable that all 375 members of the choir feel the same way . In everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers , students and housewives . In some cases entire families belong . The majority have been with the choir for several years ? one member for 50 years . Another has n't missed a meeting in ii years . They receive no pay for singing , but last year spent more than $i6,000 for .  | baby-sitters and transportation in order to attend rehearsals and performances . The Tabernacle Choir is 107 years old ? probably the largest permanent choir in the world , and the oldest ( 27 years ) coast-to-coast , noncommercial program on the air . At least 50 million people have heard it on Sunday mornings over the CBS network . Prospective sponsors have offered substantial sums to tap the enormous amount of good will the program engenders . But the Mormon Church keeps it as a free-will offering to the people of America . In Salt Lake City the choir attracts thousands of tourists every year . Radio fans want to see and hear it in the famed Tabernacle , which seats 7000 people . Letters come from men and women in the armed forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faiths and of no faith . They invariably tell how the program has lifted them from doubt , discouragement , despair . " Your wonderful choir saved my life from tragedy , " wrote a California woman . " I had n't slept all night brooding about my husband , who I had reason to believe was unfaithful . When I got up Sunday morning I just could n't go on . Getting the car , I made for the jumping-off place , a high cliff . From habit , I switched on the radio . Choir music filled the air and the words shocked me into listening : Our God will never us forsake ; And soon we 'll have this tale to tell ? All is well ? All is well . " I pulled up by the side of the road . After the hymn someone gave a talk on forgiveness . I do n't know how long I sat there . But I finally decided to go back home . That Sunday-morning broadcast saved me from making a dreadful mistake . For I won back the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " Although the Tabernacle Choir is made up of Mormons , the radio program features hymns from all of Christendom 's sacred music . It is an adventure in understanding , seeking not so much to turn people to any particular faith , but to turn them to the higher things of life and to God . Catholic priests , Jewish rabbis and Protestant ministers have praised the broadcasts . " If there is to be a meeting of minds on religion , your program is the beginning , " writes one . Others speak of the religious approach as being " universal , " " non-authoritarian , " as " proclaiming eternal truths . " The choir 's many voices give it unusual power and majesty , but it also sings with a precision which has won it top musical rating . Eugene Ormandy , conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra , calls it " the most beautiful , most coherent and wellbalanced choir I have heard anywhere . " The Mormons , whose religion teaches joy and happiness , have always been a singing people . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by singing and with the music of a  | brass band . The trip was hard , however . At one stage of the exhausting journey word reached William Clayton , an English convert , that his wife had given birth to a son . The letter bearing the news stated : " All is well , " and inspired Clayton to write a hymn by that name , which was later changed to " Come , Come Ye Saints . " It not only lifted the spirits of the Saints then , but through the ensuing years has sustained and inspired countless thousands of listeners . On July 24 , 1847 , Brigham Young came upon the treeless , desolate desert of the great Salt Lake Valley . " This is the place , " he said . Within a week the migrants had erected a community house made of boughs with space for a large choir which was already being organized . They called the house " The Bowery . " As the log-cabin community grew , the Tabernacle was begun . Completed in 1867 , this enormous building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high , is a miracle of construction even today . To attempt its dome without structural steel would seem impossible , but nothing was impossible to the Mormon pioneers . They wet and bent huge timbers , fastened them with wooden pegs and rawhide . Today the Tabernacle is as sturdy and strong as when it was built . Next , Brigham Young commissioned Joseph Ridges , an Australian convert , to build an organ . The pipes were shaped from wood found in southern Utah and hauled 300 miles by oxen to Salt Lake City . Glue was secured by boiling strips of buffalo hides in huge pots over open fires . Twelve years later the great organ was finished . It is still considered one of the outstanding examples of organ building . The Tabernacle Choir grew with the organ , and in 1893 Director Evan Stephens conducted the choir 's initial tour . He took his singing Mormons all over the country and led them when they sang for President Taft in the White House . Since then the choir has sung in the Hollywood Bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia symphony orchestra and in the first production of Cinerama . And now it is being heard round the world , transcribed , on the Voice of America . The present conductor is J. Spencer Cornwall , a former supervisor of music in Salt Lake City schools . Brother Cornwall , looking far younger than his 68 years , is a mixture of superhuman patience , diplomacy and good humor . He knows every member by name . The singers are as sensitive to his beat as players in the New York Philharmonic Symphony . Briefly Brother Cornwall explains the mood or difficulties of each number . " This piece exults , " he says . " So must you . " In addition to conducting , Cornwall auditions candidates for the choir ( there are over Too on the waiting list ) , and selects its programs from a repertoire of 850 pieces . His office is inundated with  | music from publishers who fervently hope it will be sung by the choir . When President David O. McKay announced that the Church would send the entire choir to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City pitched in to help raise the necessary $800,000 . Finally , in August 1955 , 600 ? including families and friends , who paid their own expenses ? left Salt Lake City on two trains . This army from Utah almost filled the S.S. Saxonia , on which it sailed from Montreal , landing first at Greenock , Scotland , where they sang " Loch Lomond " on the pier . The choir sang to sold-out houses all over Britain , Wales , Holland , Denmark , Switzerland , Germany and France . Everywhere they got a royal welcome , and everywhere European critics raved over their fervor , precision and power . More important was the choir 's impact everywhere in creating good will , understanding and friendship for the United States . Mormons are dedicated to " doing good to all men , " and something of their sincerity and warmth seems to have got over to everyone who heard them in Europe . Perhaps the most rewarding experience was the free concert the choir gave for 2000 refugees in West Berlin . " The hopeless expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said one singer . Six encores were sung after the last number . Still the audience clamored for more . Over and over , they wanted to hear " Come , Come Ye Saints ? All Is Well . " After three repetitions the choir could sing no more . They were all in tears . " This was not only music , " reported the Berlin Telegraf , " but the building of a human bridge . " Not long ago I heard the choir sing in the Tabernacle . It seemed as though I were standing atop a hill with a strong wind blowing , blowing me and the world clean . From the powerful voice of the choir , I caught the undaunted spirit of " Come , Come Ye Saints ? All Is Well , " the spirit that keeps hoping when there seems no reason to hope . This is the message that all people must get when they hear these lifted voices ? the feeling that All is Well .               @ @ @ @ @ @
