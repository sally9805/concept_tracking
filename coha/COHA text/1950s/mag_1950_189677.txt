Washington 's " I Am an American Day " comes a day later this week than the same celebration in the rest of the U.S. The celebration committee made sure of getting such guests of honor as President Truman , scheduled to speak from the Capitol steps . Happily , the new date also fitted the schedule of another highly valued guest not connected with government . The committee was overjoyed that television 's Hopalong Cassidy would also dignify the day . <P> As a crowd-puller , Hopalong would have to concede nothing to the President of the U.S. Last January a crowd of New Yorkers estimated by the police at 350,000 queued up for 25 blocks to shake his hand . This month he drew the largest circus attendance ( 18,700 ) ever to pack the Chicago Stadium . For the past year , devoted millions of children and grownups have sat entranced before televised Hopalong Cassidy films . <P> The Last $300,000 . The center of this adulation and applause is 52-year-old , white-haired William Boyd ( born in Cambridge , Ohio ) , who switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to western films . He made 54 Hopalong Cassidy pictures before he was fired in 1943 . Because " no one in Hollywood thought of me as anything but Hopalong Cassidy , " Boyd found that he could not get another movie job . In no danger of starving , he retired to his California ranch with his fifth wife , exActress Grace Bradley , was down to his last $300,000 when he got his big idea . <P> Selling the ranch , Boyd put everything he owned into buying up all possible rights to Hopalong Cassidy . After repeated round trips to Fryeburg , Me. , he drew up a contract with Author Clarence Mulford , whose original pulp-fiction Hoppy-unlike the softspoken , clean-living movie version-was a cussing , ungrammatical , hard-drinking ranch hand with a game leg . <P> Released to TV , the old Hoppy films created something of a mass frenzy . Los Angeles ' Station KTTV rented one for $250 . Twelve months later KTTV showed the same film for the fifth time and paid a rental of $1,000 . " People are astonished at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyd . " They 're not new fans-they 're merely my young fans of 15 years ago grown up a little bit . " <P> Wood on the Fire . But it was the children who put the golden fence posts in Hoppy 's old corral . Last year small fry bought 15 million Hopalong comic books . They clamor incessantly for such items as Hoppy roller skates ( complete with spurs and jewel-studded ankle straps ) and Hopalong bicycles ( leather-fringed saddles , handlebars shaped like steer 's horns , built-in gun holsters ) . Because of the craze for Hopalong hats , shirts , chaps , boots , six-shooters and gun belts , Boyd claims that U.S. manufacturers of 56% of all the Western-type merchandise are paying him royalties for Hopalong Cassidy endorsements . <P> The fever has spread to non-Western fields : there are Hopalong Cassidy cookies , candy bars , wallpaper , soaps and watches . A Hopalong Cassidy comic strip runs in 75 daily and 42 Sunday newspapers ; every week a network of 500 Mutual radio stations broadcasts the General Foods-sponsored Hopalong Cassidy show ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nacio Herb Brown ( You Are My Lucky Star , Singin ' in the Rain ) has signed up for the exclusive privilege of writing songs about Hoppy.
