Electronic devices for seeing in very dim light have become commonplace , but all of them are blind in total darkness . Last week Baird Associates . Inc. of Cambridge , Mass , showed a recently declassified " camera " that needs no light at all , only infra-red ( heat ) radiation from faintly warm objects . <P> Baird 's Evaporograph ( Eva for short ) is based on a prewar German idea which until recently was not followed up diligently . It has a concave mirror which concentrates heat rays as the mirror of an astronomical telescope concentrates light . <P> <P> Just before they come to a focus , the rays enter a vacuum chamber through a sheet of salt ( transparent to infrared ) and form their image on the blackened surface of a thin sheet of plastic . The other side of the plastic is covered with a film of silicone oil . <P> <P> When the heat-ray image forms on the plastic , the " bright " parts of it are warmer than the dim parts . Their heat passes through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it locally thinner . When light is turned on the oil film , it glows in the bright " interference " colors of an oil slick floating on water . The colors have nothing to do with the real colors in visible light of the object that Eva is viewing . They show thin or thick parts of the oil film-and therefore outline the object by its temperature . Hot parts show in one color , cool parts in another . Eva can distinguish 1 differences in temperature . <P> When Eva looks at an airplane in total darkness , the hot engine parts may show up yellow while the cold wings look blue . A heated house is visible against its cooler background , and factory chimneys stand out conspicuously with trails of hot gas . The heat-pictures on the film are bright enough to be photographed in black and white or color with an ordinary camera . A picture can be erased by heating the film momentarily and evaporating all the oil . In about two seconds the oil film forms again , ready for another picture . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant islands in Boston harbor on pitch-black nights and taking darkroom pictures of the office staff . One of the girls , photographed by the heat-rays flowing out of her skin , proved to have a cold nose . <P> But Eva ( cost : $9,500 ) was not built for such frivolity . The military uses are obvious . Blacked-out cities , whose warmth can not be eliminated , will stand out conspicuously on Eva 's screen . An underground factory will be betrayed by heat rising from it . <P> Many nonmilitary uses are also showing up . Since Eva was declassified , Baird Associates has been getting inquiries from industries that want to chart hot spots in electronic apparatus , find flaws in hot metal parts . Another obvious use is to check the insulation of a building by taking a snapshot of the heat escaping through its walls .
