THE OBSESSION OF EMMET BOOTH , by Martha Albrand ( 240 pp. ; Random House : $3.50 ) , is a psychological suspense story , and the suspense derives from the question whether Beauty will succumb to the Beast . The Beauty of the story , widow of a paragonish professor , is Miranda Page , who looks like something out of Harper 's Bazaar but talks like something out of Harper 's Magazine . The Beast is not really beastly , merely unpleasant : Emmet Booth is nearly 50 , short , balding , a self-made millionaire of lowly origins whose monster of an inferiority feeling must be appeased by constant sacrifices . Unsatiated by business triumphs and carloads of Watteaus , it now demands Miranda . <P> No two people could be more different - Emmet Booth living in the kind of nouveau riche luxury that always seems rented , Miranda in the shabby comfort of a Greenwich Village house that is acrawl with Siamese cats and intellectual gentility . What Miranda Page would call a " relationship " seems impossible between two people so alien to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The Mask of Alexander ) , Author Albrand keeps the plot from collapsing . Booth inexorably moves in on Miranda with hammer locks of misunderstanding . In her politeness he manages to see incipient love , and in his calculated humility she is foolish enough to see kindness . <P> He pursues her from New York to London with flowers and favors , and , above all , by masterfully playing on her sense of pity-for his pride is so constituted that he can grovel to attain his ends . It is possibly the first time in fiction that a thoroughly unprepossessing man gets a woman to bed by crying a few well-timed tears . Like many suspense stories of a more robust kind , the book does not bear much thinking about once it is put down , but while the story lasts , the reader is firmly held by the question of whether Emmet Booth will finally win . His pursuit of Miranda has the tried and true fascination of that famous cliche from East-of-Suez movies : the beautiful planter 's wife playing Chopin while , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to strike that lovely neck . <P> THE LOVING EYE , by . William Sansom ( 253 pp. ; Reynal ; $3.50 ) has a hero who , like Emmet Booth , is obsessed by a woman . Matthew Ligne is about to turn the dread corner of 40 into middle age , accompanied by his faithful ulcer , which bites so vigorously at the wrong moments that it almost assumes the lifelikeness of a pet . Like careful Prufrock ( " Do I dare to eat a peach ? " ) , he has heard the mermaids singing each to each . The particular blonde mermaid who obsesses him is a girl only glimpsed behind a window . For Matthew Ligne spends most of his time observing the creatures-married couples , tree surgeons , enterprising alley cats-in the little closed-in world of his backyard . As he watches her from behind a curtain , she becomes a half-real apparition every man has known : " She was the girl seen for a moment on the street , or in a bus , in the park or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her one important quality is her passing .
