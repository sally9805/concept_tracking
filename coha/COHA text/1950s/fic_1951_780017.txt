Lets look at my old photograph alabum instead , and I show you a picture of that Jewgirl I was tellin about . " " Okay by me , " Prew said .

The first third of it , that he always showed them first , devoted to a younger Angelo from Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and who had a family , believe it or not its true , look and see for yourself , one soldier who really had a family , there they are , the whole fifteen of them ; the fat , round faced , obviously too lenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard not to grin but to look dignified , and not succeeding ; and the even fatter , stern long faced , very hard bargain driving , policy dictating , family dominating , not grinning Mrs Maggio , trying hard to grin and to not look dignified , and not succeeding ; both trying very hard to deceive the camera , as everybody tried to deceive the camera , into showing only what they wanted it to show ; together with all thirteen of their slicked up grinning offspring , all grinning at the camera with that temporarily donned , fake , **30;717;TOOLONG , happiness that all camera subjects but the most caught-unawares camera subjects ( and us artists , he thought grimly remembering how he had to put into a Taps his secrets he could not talk about , us artists who are under a  | compulsion to be ashamed in public ) always grinned at the camera with ; each dressed in his own full length snapshot little Angelo could always carry with him ; ( and the sounds and smells of a grocery store in Atlantic Avenue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been there or seen it and probably never would , but that I knew now just as well as if I had always known them ) . And then the last two-thirds of it devoted to Hawaii , the Army , and the tourists photographs of Hawaii and the Army , two entirely different things , tourist photographs of Honolulu , the Mormon Temple , Waikiki Beach , the big Hotels ( Halekulani , Royal Hawaiian , Moana ; that none of us had ever seen the insides of ) , Diamond Head , a tourist picture of Schofield that looked lovely enough to make you want to enlist for this happy land , pictures of quaint Wahiawa without the smells , all the places the tourists saw from the outside and thought were lovely and whose attitude these photographs reflected , but that we always saw from the inside ( excepting of course : Halekulani , Royal Hawaiian , Moana ; Lau Yee Chai 's , Ala Wai Inn ) with an entirely different perspective , a perspective not recorded in any photographs since our photographs of the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his helmet on grinning in the Company Street , or a guy in full field grinning at the bayonet on the rifle he was holding in the Long Guard Position , or even two or three guys holding beer bottles and their arms around each other 's necks and elaborately crossed legs and grinning in front of a palm tree or the Chapel or the Bowling Bowl ; or dirty jokes : like the series of the FrenchHawaiian beauty from Big Sue 's in Wahiawa , first in her dress , then in her undies , then in her pants , then in nothing , then in an embarrassing position , a strip tease five in all , one buck for the series or two bits apiece ; or perhaps the biggest , grandest joke of all : the Company photograph , with the fond smiling Captain and all his grinning men ; but always , always jokes , because all of us always grinned reflexively , instinctively , a joke , if a camera ( or even a reporter ) popped up anywhere within shouting distance , Prewitt thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been there but always see us as Our Simple Boys , and that even if they have they tend to forget because there is nothing anywhere to remind them ; and which is why I 'm goddamned if I 'll collect recorded jokes about things I do not feel like laughing at . But if I had a bugle and could make recordings I 'd remind them , he thought . And , but God , how I 'd like to be the one .  | " You and your goddam tourist photographs , " he said to Angelo , bitterly , for perhaps the hundredth time . " Aw do nt start that , " Angelo said . " You know thems ony for showing to my folks when I get back home . You know they 'll want to see what Wahoo 's like . " " But Wahoo ai nt like that . " " Sure it ai nt . But they wont know it . This is what they want to see , not what its like . Here , look at this one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful Chinese girl in a flowered dress and a beret looking lovingly back over her shoulder , obviously at her lover , and with that blankness , absolutely nothingness , of a beautiful Chinese girl simulating lovingness ; a picture every soldier on the Post had at least two prints of because they were two-for-a-nickel in every PX on the Island . " It kills me , " Prew said . " It knocks me out . " " But I like it , " Readall Treadwell said . " Its the one , " Maggio grinned , " that I 'm going to tell them back home is the one I almost married , but shacked up with for a year instead , and left behind me . " " The Girl I Left Behind Me , ' Prew said and began to whistle it sarcastically . But he did not get up and walk away , like he could have . They were still looking , a little later , when Bloom came in freshly showered from the latrine and leaned down uninvited to look too , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , silently looking , made a momentary still picture that was nowhere apparently dangerous . But Bloom , Prew thought later , was never one to take a backseat for very long , even to a photograph album , if he could help it . Probably he only did it to make known the fact that The Great Bloom had arrived on the scene , since no one had acknowledged it . But in doing what he did he made at least two , and maybe three , enemies that would never again be anything else but enemies . It was a thing Bloom was always doing . It all happened quite swiftly . One moment there was this apparently peaceful still picture of four men looking at an album . Then the picture shuddered , quaked , broke up in the same way dreams shift , and began to move into a series of apparently disjointed actions , one , two , three , right down the line , like a jerky oldfashioned movie , too blurredly swift to be understood , as these things always were , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man has an absolutely bellyfull . Bloom thrust his hand down between their two heads and pointed  | out a picture of a petite , olive-skinned , sloe-eyed girl of fifteen who was Angelo 's youngest sister and who was sitting very Hollywoodishly in a bathing suit in the summer Brooklyn sun upon a tile roof ledge still dusted with last winter 's soot , trying to display womanishly the girlish , but very full , young body that she was so proud of because men looked at it , but that obviously was not womanish since obviously she had never tested it out yet and had only the vaguest romantic idea of the womanish uses of it . It was a picture that did not come off very well , but Bloom said delightedly , half teasingly : " Man , I bet that one 's a hotshot piece of ass to lay , " and laughed complacently at his own great wit . Prew , who had not known he was there and who knew the girl was Maggio 's sister , and what 's more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the album many times , felt a chill of momentarily time-stopping shock run down through him . Then a red running fire of hatred , half shame for Bloom , half rage for Bloom , who had done this deliberately , whether kiddingly or not certainly stupidly , but probably kiddingly in his bull-like , patronizing , dominating way , but even kiddingly with a deliberate degrading maliciousness , trampling callously over one of the few respected tabus , the things nobody ever said to anybody else , even in the Army , the fire of hatred making him want to beat the living piss out of such stupidity . But before he could even raise his head he found he was holding the full weight of the album and Maggio was gone , silently to his wall locker , opening it , then turning around silently and calmly and stepping up to Bloom and bringing down the sawed off pool cue on Bloom 's head with all his strength . Prew shut the book carefully , thinking that this was it all right , and tossed it two beds down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Readall Treadwell had seen Angelo coming and considerately faded out into the aisle to give him room , to give them both room . " Why , Jesus Christ ! " Bloom said above the reverberating crack of the pool cue on his head . " You hit me , you little Wop ! " " You bet your ass , " Maggio said . " With a pool cue . And about to do it again . " " What ? " Bloom said , blinking his eyes now , the stun of the blow that should have felled an ox but did not even dent his massive skull enough to knock him down or even make him dizzy enough to sit down just reaching him now , him not understanding it yet , but be-  | ginning to , and his indignation mounting as the understanding grew . " With a pool cue ? " " Thats right , " Maggio said distinctly , " and I 'll do it again , right now , or any other time . Or place , if you come over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything at all . " " But what for ? Thats no way to fight . If you want to fight , ask a man out , " Bloom said , putting his hand up to his head and bringing away blood . When he saw the blood he understood it , finally and fully , and he went berserker into rage at the sight of his own shed blood . " I 'd stand a big chance with you on the green , wouldnt I ? " Maggio said . " Why , goddam you , " Bloom screamed , not hearing him . " You dirty , yellow , sneaking , twofaced , lying , rotten , " having to stop because he could find no word to span this breach of sportsmanship , " Wop , you , " he said , " yellow little Wop . If thats the way you want to fight , " he said . " If thats the way you want to play . " He charged across the squadroom to his own bunk through all the now standing watching men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of screaming cursing , tugging at his pack to pull his bayonet and fumbling with the catch , using every obscenity he could think of , using them again when he ran out of new ones . He charged back with the naked bayonet glinting oilily and evilly in his hand , still screaming cursing , clear across the room where no man tried to stop him , but Maggio moving with his club out into the aisle for clearance and going to meet him , and death suddenly slid into the big room dartingly like a boxer on silent resined feet moving pantherishly in to punch . But before they could meet in the center stage and put on this show their still-stunned audience did not want to see First Sergeant Warden , with his apparently weird uncanniness of occult knowledge , was suddenly between them brandishing an iron lock bar from the rifle racks and cursing indignantly and vilely for them to come on , he would just as soon kill them both as not anyway . He had come out of his room to stop the racket that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , stepped in . But to the dumbstruck audience he seemed like the avenging genii of all Discipline and all Authority risen mystically from the floor , and his mere presence was enough to stop both of them in their tracks . " If theres any killing in my Compny , I 'll do it , " The Warden ridi-  | culed , " not a couple unweened punks who the sight of a dead man would make to crap their pants . Well ? Come on . Why do nt you come on ? " he sneered , his mammoth contempt making them look so foolish in their own eyes that it was no longer a hurt to the pride to quit , but was instead the only means of saving it . " Ai nt you coming ? " The Warden scoffed , " then throw that bayonet down on the bed there if you aim going to use it , Bloom . Like a good little boy now . Thats it . " Bloom did what he was told obediently , silent with the blood running down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under it . " Almost scared there wasnt anybody going to stop you for a minute , werent you ? " The Warden snorted . " Killers , " he said . " Tough guys . Out for blood . Real killers . Give that club to Prewitt , Maggio . " Maggio gave it to him , looking handdog , and the spell was broken . " If you guys want to fight , " somebody yelled , " fight with fists , and take it outside on the green . " " Shut up , " The Warden roared . " There 'll be no fight . And there 'll be no more goddamned suggestions from any stupid bastards who would stand around and let these two damfools kill each other . " He looked around belligerently but no one would meet his eyes . " And you two men , " The Warden said , " neither one of you 's grown up enough to be allowed to fight . You have to be a man to fight . If you act like children , you can expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll get plenty of fighting , " The Warden said . " More fighting than any of you got the stomach for . And it wont be too goddamned long . Wait 'll you hear bullets from a sniper you cant even see hitting the tree right above your head , then come around and tell me how you 're killers . Then I 'll believe you 're killers . Killers , " he snorted , " real killers . Jee sus Christ ! " Nobody said anything . " Corporal Miller , " The Warden said , " take this baby 's bayonet and put it away , he ai nt old enough to play with it yet . Then take Bloom over and sit him down on his bunk and see he stays there . Have him sit with his face to the wall , thats the way to punish children . The only thing he 's allowed to move for is to go to the latrine , and when he does you go with him , and see that he comes back , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt forget to button his pants for him .  | " Prewitt , 1 want you to do the same thing with baby Maggio . They 're both to stay there till time to report to the kitchen . And they talk to nobody . Looks like we have to fix up a couple dunces ' stools in this Compny . " If either one of them gives you any back talk I want to know about it . They court-martial men for things like this , although it would be a shame to court-martial babies . Thats the only reason I do nt have you both locked up , see ? " Now , " he said . " Is there any other little things for me to take care of ? If not , maybe you punks 'll be quiet enough so I can get my goddam beauty sleep , ' ey ? " He turned and walked off disgustedly , back to his room , not even waiting to see if his orders were carried out . The men moved around stealthily to do as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in one corner and Bloom in the other , and nobody knew that The Warden lay down on his bunk dry mouthed , wiping the sweat of a near thing off his forehead , and made himself lay there for ten minutes before he would pass through the squadroom to get the drink of water that he needed very badly . " He 's right , " Maggio whispered to Prewitt . " The Warden . He 's a damned good man , you know it ? " " I know it , " Prew whispered back . " He could just as easy have had you both in the Stockade . They do nt come like him very often . " " I 've never even seen a dead man , " Maggio whispered . " Except my grandfather in his casket when I was a kid , and that made me sick . " " Well I 've seen them , no matter what The Warden says . I 've seen a lot of them . They no different than dead dogs , once you get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Maggio whispered . " I made a mistake someplace , I guess , but I do nt know where . I do nt see how I could of done anything else , after that big stoop said a thing like that . " " I 'll tell you where you made your mistake . Your mistake was you did nt hit him hard enough to put him out . He wouldnt of gone off his nut if he 'd been unconscious . He might of laid for you after he come to , but I doubt even that . " " My God ! " Maggio protested , whispering . " I hit him hard as I could . His head must be solid ivory . " " Personally , " Prew whispered , " I think it is . But if he ever messes with me any more it wont be in the head I 'll hit him . " " Just the same , I 'm sure glad The Warden stopped us . " " So am I , " Prew said .  | CHAPTER 15 THEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the screens , calling them back to work . Then they went down , singly and silently , no one of them talking to any of the others . There was not much conversation and absolutely no horseplay on KP that night . For once even Bloom did not feel like talking . Probably he was still trying to figure out if whether , with the surprise ending the afternoon had taken , his honor had been smirched or not . Even Stark noticed the gloominess of no talking and he came around to Prew to ask what had happened upstairs to cause such a profound dismalness . Prew told him , although it was obvious he had already heard about it , probably from someone who had run downstairs with the news right after it had happened , as someone always does , and he was only checking stories now and trying to get an inside account , instinctively , as good cops and good noncoms always do . But Prew was glad Stark had picked him to ask and , remembering what Stark had done this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll teach the big kike a lesson , " Stark said . " Nothing will ever teach that guy a lesson . " " I reckon yore right , " Stark said . " Jews never learn . They still think they God 's Chosen People . I do nt like Jews , you know it ? But this one 's goin to be a big man around here someday . I heah The Man 's sending him to the next NCO School , in April . Wont be long till he makes corprl . He 'll make it plenty tough on you and Angelo though , when he gets them stripes . " " Not too tough . " " It never gets too tough , " Stark mocked . " For a good man . " " Okay , " Prew said . " But theres lots better men than future corporal Bloom ridin my tail in this outfit , tryin to scare me into going out for fighting . And they ai nt done it . " " Thats right , " Stark said . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Prew said . " Okay . But a man cant let himself be pushed around by a bunch of pricks like that . " " No , " Stark said , " a man cant do that . " Prew shrugged . " Okay , " he said . " But thats still the way 3 feel . Why not say it ? I ai nt bragging . " " I know yore not . But I never seen any sense in a man goin out of his way to ask them for it . " " I do nt go out of my way to ask them for it . " " You do nt think so , " Stark said . " They ; think so . "  | " All I want is to be left alone . " " In this world , " Stark said , " today , nobody is left alone . " He sat down on the table beside the sink and got his sack of Golden Grain out , slipped a paper free , opened the sack with his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curl . " Take a break a while , " he said offhand . " Theres no hurry tonight . Listen , " he said , " how would you like to come to work for me in the kitchen . " " You mean cooking ? " Prew said , laying down the spatula . " Cook for you ? " " What else ? " Stark said , without looking up . He offered Prew the sack . " Thanks , " Prew said , taking it . " Well I do nt know . I never thought about it . " " I like you , " Stark said , absorbedly smoothing the tobacco away from the middle so it would be thick on the ends and not hump in the middle when he rolled it . " I reckon you know you can expect a rough time of it , when the Compny moves back into field training after the rainy season 's all done , along with Ike Galovitch , and Wilson and his boyfriend Henderson , together with Baldy Dhom , Dynamite , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoker season drawin nearer all the time . Unless , of course , you change yore mind and decide to go out for Compny Smokers . " " I suppose you want me to tell you all about why I do nt go out ? " " Not me . I heard it all already . Plenty times . Old Ike do nt talk about nothing else . If you was in the kitchen , Prewitt , they couldnt none of them get at you . " " I do nt need anybody to protect me , " Prew said . " I ai nt asking you because of charity , buddy , " Stark said , suddenly clearly distinctly , no longer hesitantly . " A kitchen do nt run on charity . If you couldnt do the work you wouldnt stay . If I dint think you could I wouldnt of ast you . " " I never much liked to work inside , " Prew said slowly , seeing he meant it seriously now , and carefully thinking over how good it really would be to work under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but in this outfit the corporals did nt run their squads , the platoon guides who couldnt speak English ran them . But Stark really ran the kitchen . " I been wantin to get rid of Willard quite a while , " Stark said . " I could kill two birds . Sims would make First Cook and I 'd start you off as Apprentice , so nobody could kick , then move you up to Second  | Cook and First and Sixth as soons you been there long enough to keep anybody from accusing me of favoritism . " " You think I could do the work ? " " I know damn well , " Stark said , " or I wouldnt of ast you . " " Would Dynamite okay a deal like that ? When it was me ? " " He would if I promoted it . I 'm the fair haired boy right now . " " I like to be outside , " Prew said , saying it very , very slowly . " And its messy in a kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too sloppy for me in the pan . I lose my appetite . " " Quit stalling me , " Stark said . " I ai nt going to coax you . Either you want it or you do nt want it . " " I 'd sure like to , " Prew said slowly . " But I cant , " he said , finally getting it out finally . " Okay , " Stark said . " Its your funeral . " " Wait a minute , " Prew said . " Heres the way I look at it , Stark . I want you to understand it . " " I understand it . " " No you do nt . Every man 's supposed to have certain rights . " " Certain inalienable rights , " Stark said , " to liberty , equality , and the pursuit of happiness . I learnt it in school , as a kid . " " Not that , " Prew said . " Thats The Constitution . Nobody believes that any more . " " Sure they do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They just do nt do it . But they believe it . " " Sure , " Prew said . " Thats what I mean . " " But at least in this country they believe it , " Stark said , " even if they do nt do it . Other countries they do nt even believe it . Look at Spain . Or Germany . Look at Germany . " " Sure , " Prew said . " I believe it myself . Thems my ideals , too . But I 'm not talking about ideals . I 'm talkin about life . " Every man has certain rights , " he said ; " in life I mean , not in ideals . And if he do nt stand up for his own rights nobody else is going to stand up for them for him . " Theres nothing in the Law , or in the ARs , that says I have to go out for fighting in this outfit , see ? So its my right not to go out , if I do nt want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a good reason , and if I want to do some thing and I do do it , ' then I can still go along and live my life , as long as I do nt harm nobody , without bein kicked around . Thats my right , as a man . To not be kicked around . " " Persecuted , " Stark said . " Thats it . Well , if I go in the kitchen then I 'm giving up one of  | my rights , see ? I 'm admitting I 'm wrong and do nt have that right , and letting them think they 're right , and that they 've forced me . Whether into fighting or not isnt the point . They still forced me . You see ? " " All right , " Stark said . " Yes , I see . But you let me say something now . " Now in the first place , " he said , " you 're looking at it all bassackwards , you 're going on the idea of the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . In this world , no man really has any rights at all . Except what rights he can grab holt of and hang on to . And usually the only way he can get them is by taking them away from somebody else . " Now do nt ask me why . All I know is its so . And if a man 's going to holt onto anything , or gain anything , he 's got to take account of that . He got to see how other people get and keep what they got , and then he got to learn to do it that way too . " The best way , the one most people use the most , is politics . They get friendly with somebody who 's got influence they need and then they use that influence . Thats what I did . At Fort Kam I was as bad off as you are here . But I dint walk out on it until I knew where I was goin . It was bad , sam , bad . But I stayed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tradin it in on something better , see ? I found out old Holmes was up here and come up and used him to get out . " " I do nt blame you , " Prew said . " Then compare that to you when you quit the Bugle Corps , " Stark said . " If you 'd really been smart , sam , you 'd stayed there till you found a sure thing to get out into . Instead of runnin off half cocked and blowin your top and transferrin out , like you did , and look where you are now . " " I dint have any good angles , " Prew said . " I dint have any angles . " " Thats what I say : You should of stayed till you did . And now , when I 'm offering a good angle , one that will get you back onto safe ground , you 're turnin it down . It just ai nt smart , it ai nt even sensible , because thats the only way anybody can get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai nt sensible , " Prew said . " But I hate to believe that thats the ony way a man can get along . Because if it is , then what a man is do nt mean anything at all . A man himself is nothing . " " Well in a way , " Stark said , " thats true . Because its who he knows and not the man himself that counts . But in another way its not true either , not true at all . Because listen : What a man is , sam , is always  | just the same . And nothing in God 's world , no kind of philosophy , no Christian Morals , none of that stuff , can change it . What a man is just comes out in a different channel , thats all . Its like a river that finds the old channel dammed up and moves into a new channel where the current 's just as strong , only it moves in a different direction . " " Only people lie about it , " Prew said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up the hard way , by good hard honest labor , but really they married the boss 's daughter and inherited it . And what you mean to say is : it takes just as much on the ball for a man to marry the boss 's daughter out from under the rest of the competition as it does to beat the competition out the hard way . Which is impossible anyway , any more . " " Always was , " Stark corrected . " Okay , always was . And you mean he 's really just as good a man ? " Stark frowned . " Well in a way yes , but you put it wrong . " " But if thats true , " Prew said , " what becomes of love ? I mean , instead of hard work to succeed , its hard work to marry the boss 's daughter and succeed . And love is cut out altogether . What happens to love ? " " Did you , personally , ever see any of this love ? " " I do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes I think it was imagination . " " It seems to me , " Stark said , " that people only love the things they can get something they want out of . And that they do nt love anything they cant get what they want out of . " " No , " Prew said , remembering Violet , " you 're wrong . You cant say that love do nt exist except in romance or imagination . " " Hell I do nt know , " Stark said irritably . " You 're gettin in too deep for me now . All I know is what I said . " Look : We livin in a world thats blowin itself to hell , as fast as five hundred million people can arrange it . In a world like that , theres ony one thing a man can do ; and thats to find something thats his , sam , really his and will never let him down , and then work hard at it and for it and it will pay him back . With me its my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and thats all I can take care of . As long as I do that right I do nt have to be ashamed . And if the rest of them dehorn each other , kill each other , blow the whole damned world to hell , its none of my business . " " But they 'll blow you up with it , " Prew said . " Fine . Then I wont have to worry . "  | " But your kitchen will be gone . " " So fine . Because I 'll be gone too and it wont make no difference . And thats all I know . " " I 'm sorry , Stark , " Prew said , slowly because he did not want to say it , harshly because he was having trouble getting it said , wishing there was some way , some argument Stark had said , that would allow him not to say it ; really almost angry at Stark because Stark had not convinced him when he wanted so badly to be convinced , " I cant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I do nt appreciate it either . " " I do nt , " Stark said . " But if I did , why then everything in my life I 've ever done up to now would be no good , thrown away . " " Sometimes its better to throw it away and start from scratch than to hang on to it . " " Not if you got nothing else left , and nothing in sight ahead to take its place . You got your kitchen . " " Okay , " Stark said , flipping away his cigaret butt and getting up . " Do nt rub it in . I know I 'm lucky , but at the same time I took plenty and did a lot of work , to get it . " " I 'm not rubbin it in . And I would like to work for you , Stark , really I would like to . " " I see you later , " Stark said , " sometime . Almost time for them to be coming in and I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " Prew watched him leave , his face still the face of all good cops or all good noncoms , impassive , consciously a mask of iron legality beyond which now , with Stark , there was no more appeal , and with the human curiosity squeezed out of it altogether except for the blankly interested eyes . They lose a lot , he thought , but then like everybody else they probly gain a lot , things that the rest do nt know . At least they get to do the work they like . Then he dropped the whole thing utterly anO went back to work , speeding up his pace to meet the supper stuff that began to come in shortly . It grows dark quickly on islands , or anywhere near the sea . Sunset is a matter of minutes . One minute it is clear up and still full daylight , the next its down and it is night .

" I 'm tied up at the Guardhouse till nine , " he said . " The Corprl wants to go to the show and I got to take his place . But after I blow Tattoo I 'm off till Taps . Thats when we figured . " " Okay with me , " Prew said , wanting to get done now more than ever . " Me and Angelo fixin to play some pool after we get off here anyway . " " I 'll sweat the pool game out ? " Friday said . " If you let me , Prew ? I cant go over to the Guardhouse since the OD run me off this afternoon . " " You can play if you want . " " Naw , I had rather watch . I ai nt good enough for you guys . " " Okay , then you can sweat them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me get done up . " " Come on , " Andy said disgustedly . " Cant you see he 's in a hurry ? You always fiddlefuck around . " " Lay off of me , " Friday said , as they left . " You neednt ack like such a big shot . If you wasnt on guard tonight you 'd be downtown with Bloom anyway , chasin queers , and your git-tar locked up in your wall locker . " It was the greatest condemnation Friday knew . With supper over things began to move now all over the Company , the few guys with money calling for a taxi to town , the many guys without money walking out to go to the gate on the highway and hitchhike down , or getting ready to go to the show or to the gym to watch the 35th basketball champs play an exhibition game with the Fort Shafter squad . Prew could hear the groups of voices on the  | darkened porch discussing all the things to do , and he worked harder listening to them talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around again . " I 'm going to town tonight , Prew , " he said . " You want to go along ? " " I 'm broke , " Prew said . " Flat . " " I dint ast you you had money . I got the money . I awys save out enough for a big one at the end of the month . I awys make my best one then , when theres nobody much in town , instead of tryin to go flown Payday when you cant even get in a bar , let alone a whorehouse . " " Its your money , " Prew said . " If you want to spend it on me I should worry . What time ? " He was seeing sudden pictures of white , hair shadowed flesh swelling out loud flashy gowns in dim rooms and reflecting jukebox colored lights , the old womanhunger held in check so long rising in him , making his voice thick . " After Taps is the best time , " Stark said . " Its more fun if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you look like you been hard up for some for quite a spell , " he grinned lopsidedly . " You did nt miss it , brother , " Prew said , and that was all either of them would allow himself to say about the unexpected invitation . " We get down there around midnight , " Stark said , " and have time to hit a bar for a while and get prepared . Then around one we go up and hang around till two and take one for all night , maybe take a quickie in the meantime . Thats how I usely work it . " " All night ! " Prew said , thinking avidly of the three hours , from two till five , that constituted all night in a Honolulu whorehouse . " Thats fifteen bucks ! " " Sure , " Stark said , " but its worth it . When you ony have one big one a month , and save up for it , its more than worth it . " " Buddy , " Prew said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session with the git-tars from Tattoo till Taps , so even that will even all work out all right . " " Sure , " Stark said . " We wont go till after Taps . Maybe I 'll come out and sit in with you myself , " he half asked , abruptly . " Come ahead . You play one ? " " Not enough to count . But I like to listen though . I 'll see you then , " he growled harshly , almost dislikeably , plainly not wanting any more about it , and walked away , obviously afraid he would be thanked . Prew grinned after him and went back to scrubbing down , feeling good now , feeling really fine , feeling wonderful , with the ferriswheel sickishness coming in his belly and the heavy , pendulous , full belly-  | ing swinging maleness rising , and with Maggio waiting on him in the Dayroom to play pool . They played straight rotation , no slop and call your shot , the same difference between this game and plain rotation slop as between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game for amateurs who could not make them any other way , and tonight Prew , feeling very happily the brother of the whole wide world , was hot . It was a pretty even match between them , the Atlantic Avenue champ versus the boy who made his spending money on the bum by taking on the local stars in strange smalltown poolrooms , but Prew had the edge , a very slight one . Friday leaned on his elbow in one of the windows between the alcove and the Dayroom that had once been a porch and watched , interested but plainly only putting in the time until they got the guitars out . After a while , men even came in from the Dayroom to watch . Maggio , holding his cue , perched between shots in the other window like an egotistic robin , his stiff blocked hat proudly on his head , pushed back to show curls damp with concentration , happily pointing out the peaks requiring esoteric appreciation , in case the audience had missed them . " This character is a poolshooter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . I can judge . Brooklyn is the home of the original poolshooters , as well as the sharpie pingpong players . Man , what I would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my hometown is not worth picking up and put in your pocket . I 'd dress him up in overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth , and I would make a whole mint of ghelt off him . " " Nine ball off the end rail and side rail in the cross corner pocket , " Prew said , and made it . " See what I mean ? " Maggio chortled to the audience . " Maybe I 'll come home with you some day , Angelo , " Prew said , chalking up . " For a visit . " " Oh no , " Maggio protested . " Not me , friend . My old lady would kick us both out on our can . She is prejudiced against dogfaces . Every since one of them from the Army Base laid my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms . " At nine Andy came in from the Guardhouse , his bugle still down his back , and they broke it up . " Soons I blow Tattoo now I 'm off till Taps , " he said , going through and out the other door . " Somebody bring the git-tars out . "  | " I 'll get em , " Friday said , " I 'll get em , " coming to life now and starting for the stairs at a run . " Can I come along and listen ? " Angelo said , knowing this was a private session . " I wont say a word . Not a single request . " " I thought you did nt like hillbilly , " Prew grinned . " I do nt , " Angelo said fervently . " But you guys do nt play hillbilly . With Gene Autry its hillbilly , with you guys its music . " " Okay , come on . I wonder what happened to our friend Bloom tonight , " Prew said , walking out to the quad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai nt seen him around , " Angelo said . " He probly went to town . To see his queer . I see him all a time down to the Waikiki Tavern when I go down to see mine . He 's got himself a steady now , ony his ai nt got the money mine has got . " " Maybe he do nt want the money . " " Maybe not . Maybe he 's after a shoulder to cry on . The son of a bitch . " They met the others in the darkness of the quad , Friday eagerly dragging the two guitars , and after Andy finished Lights Out they sat on the back steps of the kitchen , playing the blues , but softly in the darkness so a crowd would not gather now when they did not want a crowd but only the privacy of their own communion . Around the quadrangle the CQs one by one flipped the lights off in the squadrooms . Stark came out from the messhall and sat on the curbing smoking and leaning back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solitary word , and staring off across Headquarters building as if he were trying to see Texas . Maggio hunched up on the bottom step like some organ grinder 's hairless monkey with his round shoulders , listening as intently as Stark to this music that was foreign to his hometown Brooklyn . " You know what , " he said after a while , " them blues songs sounds like jazz instead of hillbilly , way you play them . Slow jazz , real nigger jazz , like they play in the joints on 52nd Street . " Prew stopped playing and Friday 's guitar gradually stopped too . " They are in a way , " Prew said . " Theres nobody can tell where hillbilly leaves off and jazz begins . They shade into each other . Me and Andy 's got an idea for writing our own blues that will be our private special blues . We been talkin about it , goin to do it someday . " " Sure we are , " Friday said . " Gon na call them The Re-enlistment Blues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Army blues , see ? " Stark sat silent , listening to the rising , falling conversation as they  | went on playing , listening to it all but taking part in none of it , only smoking silently and communing with some bitter silence in himself . " That was no way to play Tattoo , " Prew said to Andy , with the indisputable air of an expert . " Tattoo wants to be staccato . Short , and snappy . You do nt waste a second on the long notes . Tattoo is urgent . You 're telling them to get them goddam lights out and you do nt want argument . So it has to be precise and fast , without slurring the notes . And yet a little sad underneath , because you hate to have to do it . " " We cant all be good , " Andy said . " I 'm a git-tar player . You stick to the bugle and I 'll stick to the git-tar . " " Okay , " Prew said . " Here . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more but was still Andy 's private guitar . Andy took it and picked up the melody from Friday , still watching Prew 's face in the darkness . " You wanta take my Taps ? " he offered . " You can take them tonight if you want . " Prew thought it over . " You sure you do nt care ? " " Naw . I ai nt no bugler , I 'm a guitarman , like I said . Go ahead and take them . I never could play them anyway . " " Okay . Gim me the horn . Heres your mouthpiece . I got mine with me . Just happened to have it . " He took the tarnished guard bugle and rubbed at it a little , held it in his lap then , as they sat on in the cool darkness , playing softly and talking a little , but mostly listening , Stark not talking any but only listening , gladly but sullenly . Once a couple of men wandering by stopped to listen for a minute , caught by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set blues rhythm . But the silent Stark was alert . He flipped his cigaret viciously out into the street , at them , the falling coal shattering at their feet and showering sparks . It was as if an unseen hand had pushed them away and they went on , but they were strangely lifted . At five of eleven they stopped and all got up , the four of them walking out to the megaphone in the corner , leaving Stark leaning against the wall still smoking sullenly , tacitly accepting his aloofness , him rolling them and smoking and silently taking it all in , not missing anything . Prew took his quartz mouthpiece from his pocket and inserted it . He stood before the big tin megaphone , fiddling nervously , testing his lips . He blew two soft tentative tones , then wiped the mouthpiece out angrily and rubbed his lips vigorously .  | " My lip 's off , " he said nervously . " I ai nt touched a horn in months . I wont be able to play them for nothing . Lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonlight , shifting nervously from one foot to the other , fiddling with the bugle , shaking it angrily , testing it against his lips . " Christ , " he said . " I cant play them like they ought to be played . Taps is special . " " Oh , go ahead , for God sake , " Andy said . " You know you can play them . " " All right , " he said angrily . " All right . I dint say I wasnt gon na play them , did I ? You never get nervous , do you ? " " Never , " Andy said . " Then you ai nt got no goddam sensitivity , " Prew said angrily . " Nor sympathy , nor understanding . " " Not for you , " Andy said . " Well for Christ 's sake shut up then , " he said angrily nervously . He looked at his watch and as the second hand touched the top stepped up and raised the bugle to the megaphone , and the nervousness dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly alone , gone away from the rest of them . The first note was clear and absolutely certain . There was no question or stumbling in this bugle . It swept across the quadrangle positively , held just a fraction longer than most buglers hold it . Held long like the length of time , stretching away from weary day to weary day . Held long like thirty years . The second note was short , almost too short , abrupt . Cut short and too soon gone , like the minutes with a whore . Short like a ten minute break is short . And then the last note of the first phrase rose triumphantly from the slightly broken rhythm , triumphantly high on an untouchable level of pride above the humiliations , the degradations . He played it all that way , with a paused then hurried rhythm that no metronome could follow . There was no placid regimented tempo to this Taps . The notes rose high in the air and hung above the quadrangle . They vibrated there , caressingly , filled with an infinite sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiem and epitaph of the common soldier , who smelled like a common soldier , as a woman once had told him . They hovered like halos over the heads of the sleeping men in the darkened barracks , turning all grossness to the beauty that is the beauty of sympathy and understanding . Here we are , they said , you made us , now see us , do nt close your eyes and shudder at it ; this beauty , and this sorrow , of things as they are . This  | is the true song , the song of the ruck , not of battle heroes ; the song of the Stockade prisoners itchily stinking sweating under coats of grey rock dust ; the song of the mucky KPs , of the men without women who collect the bloody menstrual rags of the officers ' wives , who come to scour the Officers ' Club  --  after the parties are over . This is the song of the scum , the Aqua-Velva drinkers , the shameless ones who greedily drain the half filled glasses , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the song of the men who have no place , played by a man who has never had a place , and can therefore play it . Listen to it . You know this song , remember ? This is the song you close your ears to every night , so you can sleep . This is the song you drink five martinis every evening not to hear . This is the song of the Great Loneliness , that creeps in like the desert wind and dehydrates the soul . This is the song you 'll listen to on the day you die . When you lay there in the bed and sweat it out , and know that all the doctors and nurses and weeping friends do nt mean a thing and cant help you any , cant save you one small bitter taste of it , because you are the one thats dying and not them ; when you wait for it to come and know that sleep will not evade it and martinis will not put it off and conversation will not circumvent it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you will hear this song and , remembering , recognize it . This song is Reality . Remember ? Surely you remember ? " Day is done .. . Gone the sun .. . From-the-lake From-the-hill From-the-sky Rest in peace Sol jer brave God is nigh ... And as the last note quivered to prideful silence , and the bugler swung the megaphone for the traditional repeat , figures appeared in the lighted sallyport from inside of Choy 's . " I told you it was Prewitt , " a voice carried faintly across the quadrangle in the tone of a man who has won a bet . And then the repeat rose to join her quivering tearful sister . The clear proud notes reverberating back and forth across the silent quad . Men had come from the Dayrooms to the porches to listen in the darkness , feeling the sudden choking kinship  | bred of fear that supersedes all personal tastes . They stood in the darkness of the porches , listening , feeling suddenly very near the man beside them , who also was a soldier , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , they filed back inside with lowered eyes , suddenly ashamed of their own emotion , and of seeing a man 's naked soul . Maylon Stark , leaning silent against his kitchen wall , looked at his cigaret with a set twisted mouth that looked about to cry , about to laugh , about to sneer . Ashamed . Ashamed of his own good luck that had given him back his purpose and his meaning . Ashamed that this other man had lost his own . He pinched the inoffensive coal between his fingers , relishing the sting , and threw it on the ground with all his strength , throwing with it all the overpowering injustice of the world that he could not stomach nor understand nor explain nor change . Prewitt lowered the bugle slowly and let the megaphone rest in its swivel . Reluctantly he withdrew his mouthpiece and gave the bugle back to Andy . His lips were pinched and red from the playing . " Christ , " he said huskily . " Jesus Christ . I need a drink a water . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheres Stark ? " and fingering his mouthpiece he went vaguely toward the barracks in the darkness , not proud but innocently unaware as yet of what he had created . " Boy , " Maggio said as they watched him go . " That guy kin really play a bugle . Whynt he never play ? He should ought to be in the Bugle Corps . " " He was , you jerk , " Andy said scornfully . " He quit . He wouldnt play in this old Corps . He played a Taps at Arlington . " " Yeah ? " Maggio said . He peered after the retreating figure . " Well , " he said . " Well what do you know . " The three of them stood silent , unable to voice it , watching him go , until Stark who had been listening came over to them . " Wheres he goin ? " " Lookin for you , " Andy said , " to go to town . Went up toward the porch . " " Well thanks , " Stark mocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to find him . " Come on , kid , " he said . " Lets go to town . Lets fling a real one . "  | CHAPTER 16 THEY came up the lightless stairs of the New Congress Hotel , very dark now after the brightly lighted , almost deserted Hotel Street outside , feeling their way half-drunkenly carefully . They had just left the small bar in the downstairs part of Wu Fat 's brightly tropically decorated restaurant next door , and now they carried with them , suddenly , all the unmentionable , unspeakable , pride destroying heart shakiness and throat thickness and breath chokiness of men about to mount women , the same attributes displayed so shamelessly by all the male dogs on the Post as they chased down alleys after reluctant bitches , and that they laughed at in the hapless dogs , but that they did not feel like laughing at now , as the disembodied breasts and bellies and long thighs , all of a completely unearthly loveliness , swam through their minds . All evening ( with the foreknowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine time , a viciously , pugnaciously , wildly bottle swingingly , fine time ; with no fights at all yet , with hardly even any arguments except for the ex-dogface , squawmen taxi drivers who envied them their freedom and so always argued anyway and did not count . Getting out of the Schofield taxi at the big , rambling , palm camouflaged Army-Navy YMCA ( with this prospect before them ) , they had gone immediately at once across the street for the first long drink , the best drink of them all , to the long open-fronted Black Cat Cafe . The Black Cat was a very successful place , being situated as it was directly across from the Y and the cabstand for all the Pearl Harbor and Schofield cabs . Everybody made for the Black Cat for that first best drink when they got in and stopped there for that last worst drink before going back , so that the Black Cat was always very crowded . And because the Black Cat was very successful and always very crowded both of them disliked it very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hunger , and later on just before they went to Wu Fat 's they came back to the Black Cat and ordered two toasted limburger cheese sandwiches to go from the stupid Chinese sandwich-man , saying they would be back and pick them up , then  | walked around the block once and by the time they got back the Black Cat was no longer very crowded , it was not even successful for the moment , it was empty and closed for the night with the iron latticework grill locked across the open front and there was not a soul to be seen in it , or for that matter to be seen in that block on that side of the street , and they shook hands happily ( with this prospect still before them ) and went for a drink to the nearest bar to celebrate the victory . Before that , after the first drink there , they had worked their way down angling Hotel Street , stopping for a drink at the bars that appealed to them and watching the cherubfaced Oriental waitresses ( able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Chinese girls with their thin breastless side view and the startlingly curved front view , the Japanese girls with their stockiness of heavier breasts , shorter legs , and more voluptuous hips , but best of all the hapa-Portagee girls with their hot smoking , cat clawing sexiness , everywhere women , women , women , and them cockily feeling their load ( that this prospect would take care of ) and the liquor raising the thermometer of the blood higher and higher in the ears . They had not stopped at Wu Fat 's then on the first time around but passing it had gone in short bar hops clear down to the river where Hotel angles into King with Aala Park darkly mysterious across the bridge , and from there looking happily up King at the movie houses just letting out the second shows they had cut over to Beretania along the muckiness of River Street and worked their way back up toward the Y , hatching the plot against the smug Black Cat happily while threading their way happily through the groups of sailors rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ femininely in twos and threes but never one alone in their padded zoot suits . And ( happily , whole-earth-lovingly , now , because this prospect was before them ) the one and two storey frame buildings crowding against the sidewalk anxiously offering their charms , the bars , and liquor stores , and restaurants , and shooting galleries , and photo shops ; and inbetween each two or three storefronts ( this prospect emphasizing their retiringness ) the dark stairways leading upstairs to the women and always and eternally everywhere , pervading everything like Fate , the smells of rotting meat and dead wilted vegetables from the open fronted grocery stores with their folding lattice ( like an old fashioned wall phone you pulled out to use ) drawn across and locked , keeping you out and not keeping in the smells that exquisitely sadly reminded us of the hangover tomorrow and then the next one after that and so on to the last  | final hangover the biggest most perpetual hangover of rotting meat stashed away on shelves and hairy wilted carrots dissected on the tables , smells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we will never smell again without remembering Hawaii , the Hawaii of our unrepentant unrepented youth , for the rest of our whole lives . . , And after the Black Cat 's glorious fiasco then down Hotel once more , this time to Wu Fat 's to eat won ton soup upstairs and then come back down to the bar downstairs where a thin fine-drawn queer with an English accent had wanted to know with subtle flattery if they were civilian sailors adventuring from home and offered to buy a drink that Stark told him to save for someone who had no money for the whores and would be more appreciative , the queer making a sly womanish crack at him , Stark hitting him happily , the bartender es- 1111 corting the dazed queer to the door because Stark was spending the 1 more money and then coming back and shaking hands and saying , he did not like them either but bartenders have got to live too , and ? then finally settling down to the serious drinking to get primed , Stark getting really drunk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cool , slow talking , levelheadedness , but Stark con-11 fiding to him now with the unreserved intimacy of drunkenness that l he was not worth a damn in any whorehouse unless he was properly 11 liquored up and he did not know why , but anyway this was the only way to do it , the only way he could do it , but that he sincerely loved it this way , really he did ( with the prospect coloring everything with unattainable brilliance , heightening everything with that unattainable ardor that in the end was one pure love of everything that lived , but ii'I ! could be attained no other way ) , and that by god no matter what anybody said any thing that could make you love the earth as much as this could not be wrong , no matter what they said , or evil , god-dam them , or ashamed , screw them , and he would not believe it wrong , the sons of bitches . dk , Until now , standing at the top of the stairs on the landing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of them making a deadend tunnel of the stairway , the great earth love that needed an outlet , the great hunger for love that must be fed , were so great it almost creamed them both . Stark ( very drunk but still able to roll a cigaret deftly in the darkness ) struck a match and lit it  --  the match flare lighting up like echoes of their minds all the pencil drawn naked bodies ( male and female ) on the walls , the unattached bodyless organs ( male and female ) , the realistic looking vaginas made by holding a burning kitchen match-  | head against the wall and then drawing the legs in afterwards , and all the accompanying verses of several generations of artistic soldiers , sailors , marines , and kanaka shoeshine boys  --  and beat with his fist against the door . The peephole slid back immediately and a huge , black Hawaiian woman 's face peered out at them suspiciously . " Let us in , " Stark said . " We freezin in the cold , cold night , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You drunk , " the great hulk heaved , " go way . We do nt want trouble with MP . This a respectable place . Close up . You go home . " " Now do nt get tough with me , Minerva , " Stark grinned . " Or I have you busted back to the ranks . Go tell Mrs Kipfer her number one boy is here and why ai nt she on the door where she belongs . " " I see , " she said , still suspiciously . " You wait , " and slammed the peephole irritably shut . Prew felt the completely unearthly lovely breasts and bellies and long thighs begin subtlely to fade and grow dim on him . He looked at Stark . " There , " Stark said bitterly . " You see ? Woman thinks we drunk . " " Imagine that , " Prew said . " Suspicious old bat . " " Anv time women see a soljer , think he 's drunk . Why ? You know why " Because he is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do nt like to come to these places . No faith in humanity . For two cents I 'd go over to the goddam Service Rooms , or Pacific Rooms , or Ritz Rooms , or White Hotel . She thinks this is the ony whorehouse in this town ? Theres even a Japanee Electric Massage four doors down the street . " " Lets go there . I never been to one of them . " Stark giggled . " Cant . Close up . Closes at eleven . " Then realization dawning , he turned and stared . " You mean you never been to a Japanee Lectric Massage ? " he said disbelievingly . " Never . " " Ones with the little white sign and red letters on it and red streak of lightning under them ? " " Not once . " Tsk , tsk , " Stark said . " Where have you been ? " " 1 'm a hick , " Prew said bitterly . " Plumb green . " " Tsk , tsk . I bet Wahoo 's the ony place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lectric Massage . And you refuse to take ad-  | vantage of your opportunity . You have missed a great experience , Prewitt , you have neglected your education . They lay you on your side , " he said , " then one of these hot lookin Japanee girls works you over , all over , with this lectric vibrator . But you cant touch her . They come out naked , and work you over . But they wont let you touch them , not even with a finger . They explain it all beforehand . And just in case someone do nt understand instructions they keep a bouncer , a great big judo man . They let you see him when you first go in . " " But I 'd want to touch em , " Prew said . " I like to touch em . " " So do I. Thats the point , see ? You want to but you cant . Very funny feeling . There she is , all of her , but you cant touch it . Practically the same thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Very peculiar feeling . Really nothing like it . Takes a Japanee to think of a valuble experience like that . " " Takes a Japanee to enjoy it , too , I bet . " " Oh , no , " Stark said . " I enjoy it . Makes you hot , so hot you 'd almost eat the goddam thing . With me , it invigorates the blood . After a Japanee Lectric Massage I could run any whorehouse out of business , even if I was sober . Makes you realize what a woman 's worth , even a whore . Gives you a great understanding of the human race . All of it . " " I still wouldnt like it , " Prew said stubbornly . " You 're just stubborn , " Stark said stubbornly . " How do you know you wouldnt like it ? I liked it . Why wouldnt you like it ? " " Because I like to touch em . I like to more than touch em . " " By Christ , " Stark said suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " He turned and began to beat his fist against the door again . " An awful long time . Hey ! Open up ! " The peephole opened up immediately , almost as if the tall , narrow faced , prettily smiling , white woman who smiled out at them had been standing there all the time listening . " Why , hello , Maylon , " the woman smiled delightedly . " Minerva did nt tell me it was you . How are you ? " " About to bust , " Stark said . " Let us in . " " Why , Maylon , ' ' she chided , gently but firmly . " Is that any way to talk to me ? " Prew , looking at this ladyhood , this almost maidenhood , felt everything suddenly run down out of him hollowly , like snow suddenly slides off a roof under a February sun exposing the orderly shingles of a former business venture . And , like all the other times , at other  | places , he was ready to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , right now , at this minute ? " Jesus Christ ! " Stark was storming . " You ai nt scared we wreck your joint ? " " Not at all , " the woman smiled . " I have no fear at all upon that score . And please do nt swear at me , Maylon . " " Mrs Kipfer , " Stark said , with a sudden subdued sobriety at the seriousness of the situation , " I 'm surprised at you , Mrs Kipfer . Did you ever know me to come up here when I was drinking heavily ? I ask you honestly , do I look like that kind of a man ? " " Well I had certainly never thought so , Maylon , " Mrs Kipfer lied pleasedly . " You have always been a perfect gentleman , around me . " " Thank you , Mam , " Stark said . " And now , if there is no further misunderstanding , will you please let us in ? " " Heavy drinking , " Mrs Kipfer countered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every respectable decent place must consider its future . " " Mrs. Kipfer , Mam , " Stark said , " I give you my solemn word your future will be safe with us . " Mrs Kipfer was appeased . " Well , " she smiled . " Since you give me your word . I 'm sure you will , Maylon . " There was a sound of steel rubbing steel and the door swung inward . Prew saw a sophisticated looking woman with upswept hair and voluptuous figure daintily encased in a lovely doeskin colored evening gown with a corsage of redly purple orchids at her shoulder , looking as if she were the aristocratic lady just stepped out of an International Sterling Silver ad to call her guests to dinner . She smiled at him with forgiving motherly solicitude , and he understood now why everybody who went to whorehouses always talked about Mrs Kipfer and admired her so . It was because Mrs Kipfer was such a lady , and because she was willing to forgive them . Behind him , Minerva heaved the great door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maylon , " Mrs Kipfer said , " I do nt think I 've met your friend ? " " You never pulled that door routine on me before , Mrs Kipfer , " Stark said accusingly . " Almost think this place was illegal , instead of the best whorehquse in Honolulu . " " Lets not be crude , " Mrs Kipfer said icily , " just because there was a misunderstanding . You know how I feel about that word . I 'd hate to have to ask you to leave , Maylon , but I could , much as I would hate to , if you insist on being nasty . "  | Stark said nothing stubbornly . " I think you owe me an apology for that last remark , " Mrs Kipfer said . " Do nt you ? " " I guess so , " Stark said irritably . " I apologize . " " I still havent met your friend , " she said . Stark introduced them politely , and mock-bowed deeply as he did it , looking more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charmed , I 'm sure , " Mrs Kipfer smiled at Prew , ignoring the bow as being beneath comment . " I 'm always pleased to meet a new member of the Company . " " Please to meet you , " Prew said uneasily , wondering where the hell the women were . He felt awkward before such exquisite manners , and he remembered suddenly bitterly what Uncle John Turner , who had never married , had once told him bitterly . Women run the world , boy . God dealt them all the cards between their legs , he said . They do nt have to gamble , like us men , and we mights well admit er . So bitterly the boy , being a boy , could not understand it then . " I think , " Mrs Kipfer smiled , " that I shall call you Prew . May I ? " as she led them from the big wide entryway to the right , on across the narrow hall , and through the doorway to the waiting room . " Sure , " Prew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women he had seen in his mind outside , but still at least women . " Nobody calls me by my first name . " There were seven of them in the waiting room , one standing with a soldier at the Wurlitzer , two sitting talking to two sailors . The other four were sitting by themselves , three of them the fat gum-cudchewing cows wearing the one piece short suits and all looking alike , three that would always sit by themselves , not caring , except when they were thrown into action , still not caring , as reserves during the big Payday attack . But the fourth sitting one was not like them ; she was a slight brunette wearing the full length gown of the better grade , and sitting very poised and quiet with her hands clasped serenely in her lap , and he found that he was watching her . He had already seen , with the experienced eye , that the four slim ones , the better grade of which the slight serene brunette was one , all wore full length gowns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three fat gumchewing ones . He had already deduced , by this , that it was like all the others , this place , no different , pay your three bucks at the window , take your piece and leave , in spite of all he had heard about this one that was the Company hangout being the best . He had seen all that at once ,  | but still he found that he was watching her , who was so obviously different even from the other three of the better grade . " This is Maureen , " Mrs Kipfer said , as one of the two of the better grade sitting with the two sailors got up and came over to them at the door , a thin , sharp nosed blonde with the dark triangle of hair showing through the thin material of the long blue gown . " Prew is new here , " Mrs Kipfer told her , " you will introduce him around , wont you , dear ? " " Sure , clear , " the blonde said , huskily sarcastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cmon , Babyface . Hello there , old Stark , old kid , " she cried and grabbed for him . " You got a present for me ? " " Watch it , " Stark grinned , ducking back . " Or I wont have . " Mrs Kipfer smiled sweetly . " Maureen 's our little hustler , are nt you , Maureen dear ? " " Thats how I make my livin , dear , " Maureen said sweetly . " I hustle . And I admit it . " Mrs Kipfer , still smiling sweetly , turned back to Prew . " You mustnt think we 're rushing you , Prew . We want you to look around as long as you like . We want you to be satisfied with your friend . We are nt crowded at all tonight , and there is plenty of time , isnt there , Maureen dear ? " " Sure , dear , " Maureen said . " All the time in the world . I cant give you rcmance , " she said directly to Prew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got it , Babyface . Ask Stark , Stark 's laid me . Am I a good lay , Stark ? " she said , " or not ? " Mrs Kipfer turned on her heel and went back out into the hall . " Good , " Stark said . " But mechanical . " " Why goddam you , " Maureen laughed , triumphantly . She grabbed Stark happily by the arm and pulled him to the Wurlitzer . " Just for that , you can play me some music . " Mrs Kipfer came back , then , to Prew still standing in the doorway . " We have so much trouble getting good help anymore , " she said apologetically . " This peacetime draft back home has hurt us terribly over here . You cant know how much . I 'm completely helpless , at the mercy of whatever , the agency condescends to send me . " " Sure , " Prew said . " I can see that . " " Did nt she even introduce you to anyone ? " Mrs Kipfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with anyone ? " " No , " Prew said . " Not to a soul . " " Oh , dear , " Mrs Kipfer said . " Dear , dear . Well , never you mind . I 'll see you are taken care of . You mustnt feel badly ? '  | " All right , " Prew said . " I wont . " " Lorene , " Mrs Kipfer called . " Are you busy , dear ? Would you mind coming here a moment ? " It was really Lorene , " she said to him , " that I meant for you to meet . She is really a very nice girl , really . That was really what I had planned , " she said apologetically . " Oh , " Prew said . " Sure . " He wasnt listening to the rest of it , he was watching the slight brunette , she who had been sitting very poised and quiet by herself , get up and come serenely toward them . He caught something about " almost like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , " but he was not really listening . He had found himself watching her before and now he found himself watching her more , while being careful not to stare . Watching her walking he could see the flat triangle of hair under the thinness of the dress , but with her it was not like it had been with Maureen who had been unaware of it completely . This girl was aware of it , aware of him , but she was utterly above it . She was aware of it and she ignored it . Must be twenty-three or - four , he thought , noticing that she walked very straight and that her hair was done in a circular roll low on her neck and that she had very wide eyes that looked at him serenely openly . She stopped by them and smiled at him and he noticed her mouth was very wide across the thin childishness of her face , he noticed the long lips were very full especially at the corners . She has a beautiful face , he thought . Mrs Kipfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after him because he was new here ? if she wouldnt show him around ? " Surely , " she said , and he noticed how pleasingly low pitched , how poised her voice was . It was the voice that belonged with the rest of her . " Lets sit down , shall we ? " she smiled . She really has a truly beautiful face , he thought again as they sat down , a tragic face , a face thats suffered , a face you 'd never expect to find in this place . Suffering does nt make whores beautiful , it makes them ugly . But thats because they do not understand the suffering . But she understands it . Such poised serenity as this , the poised serenity I 've always hunted after for myself and never found , comes only from great wisdom , the wisdom of the understanding of suffering , the wisdom I 've never been able to acquire , the wisdom that I need . that maybe all men need , he thought profoundly , and that you never guessed would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , he thought , just that I am surprised to see a tragically beautiful face  | in a whorehouse . That is obviously all it is , he told himself , that and the fact that I am drunk . " Mrs Kipfer says you are new in Maylon 's Company , " she said , in that low poised voice , that voice of the profoundest wisdom . " Did you just arrive in the Islands ? Or did you transfer in from another outfit ? " " Another outfit , " he said , trying to clear the thickness from his throat , sifting his brains to find one thought that was not too stupid to offer up before this wisdom , and failing . Lorene waited , studying him wide-eyed serenely . " I been in Wahoo almost two years now , " he said . " And yet , " she said , " you 've never been up here before . Thats strange . Isnt it ? " " Yeah , " he said ; it was strange , when you thought of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin places where you already been , " he said , trying to explain , feeling foolish at trying to explain . " I seen the sign plenty times . But I dint know anybody who came here . Till I got in G Company , that is . " " I 've been here a year , " she said . " You have ? " he said . " You do nt much like it , do you ? " " Oh , " she said , " I do nt like it , but I do nt mind it . I do nt expect to stay here , though . I wont be here all my life . " " No . Sure not . I mean , why should you ? Theres no reason why you should be here at all . " " Oh , theres a reason . A good reason . I 'm not boring you , am I ? " she said . " I suppose every whore tells you the same story , do nt they ? " " I guess they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Now that you mention it . But with them you never pay any attention . With them you always know it isnt serious . " " I have it all figured out . I 've been here one year now , by the end of two years I 'll be ready to leave . I figured it all out before I ever came here . " " Figured what out ? " Prew said , seeing Stark and Maureen coming back toward them from the jukebox . " How long I meant to stay , " Lorene said , and stopped . " Oh , " Prew said . " Oh , I see . " He was hoping Stark and Maureen would go right on by , but they did nt . " Well I be dam , " Stark said , " look who 's heah . Hello , Princess . I thought you had retired already . " " Hello , Maylon , " Lorene said serenely . It was , Prew thought , as if  | she was looking wide-eyedly clear through Stark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top , do nt you kid ? " Stark said to him . " How 'd you manage to meet the Princess ? just like that ? " " Mrs Kipfer , " Prew told him , feeling suddenly belligerent . " Why ? " " No kiddin ? " Stark said , " Mrs Kipfer ? She introduced you ? Al-ready ? " " Sure , " Prew said . " Why not ? " " Hell , kid , you really rate . It took me three trips down here before I even was allowed to meet her . And two more after that before she 'd lay me . And even then she was reluctant . Ai nt that right , Princess ? " he grinned . " I lay anyone who wants what I 've got , " Lorene said serenely . Stark stared at her reflectively . " Damn , " he said , " ai nt she a Princess , though ? Every inch a Princess , ' ey Princess ? every inch . " Maureen laughed raucously and Stark grinned at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did look like a princess , he thought , a serene poised princess , incapable of being ruffled , remote from life and men . Especially men , he thought , the thickness coming back in his throat again . " She does , do nt she ? " Stark said . " I ask you . Do nt she ? Princess Lorene , the Virgin of Waikiki . I think I 'll go shake hands with the Mayor , " he said suddenly . " Is the latrine still where it use to be ? " " We never change nothing here , " Maureen said huskily . She grabbed Prew 's arm and pulled him to his feet . " Cmon , Babyface . I 'll ' introduce ' you around . " Lorene serenely offered no resistance , as Maureen pulled him across the room and sat him in a chair and perched herself heavily on his lap . " This heres Billy , " she said , nodding at the small , dark , Jewish nosed , feverish eyed girl who had been at the jukebox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on his lap . She turned back to Prew . " Stark says you dears goin to stay all night . You got a bottle , Babyface ? " " Nope , " Prew said , still looking back across the room at Lorene . " No bottle . I thought they dint allow it anyway . " " They do nt , " Maureen said . " Anyplace . But most places they let an all night job sneak one in . Here the old bitch even enforces it on them . We could still sneak one while she 's out in the hall , though . If we had one , that is . " " You do nt much like Mrs Kipfer , do you ? "  | " Like her , " Maureen said . " I love her . She kills me . If it wasnt for her I do nt know what I 'd do for laughs . Her and her stinking highclass ways , acting like she 's Mrs Stinking Astor . " " How 'd she ever get in this business anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Started at the bottom and worked up to being foreman . " " She 's got a damn good figure for it . " " And thats all the good it 'll do you , " Maureen laughed . " You might as well try to make the Queen of England . Listen , Babyface , " she said . " You look artistic , Stark says you a bugler . Imagine something for me . Imagine having your own mother run the whorehouse you work in , can you ? " " No , " Prew said . " I cant . " " Then you can see what I mean , " Maureen said . " About laughs . " She yawned , almost in his face , and stretched her thin arms . " Lets see , " she said . " Hows our introductions comin ? Thats Sandra , " she said , pointing to the other girl who had been sitting with the two sailors when he came in and who was still with them now , a tall brunette who wrinkled her pert nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistening cascade of long hair whenever she laughed , which was often . " She 's proud of her long hair , " Maureen razzed , almost indifferently now , from force of habit . " She also says she 's a college grad , some coed school in the Middle West . She 's writin a novel now , about her life as a prostitute , suthin like this Call House Mistress book . " " Yeah ? " Prew grinned . " Yeah , " Maureen said . " And them other three , " she said , pointing at the three fat , gum chewing ones , " are Moe , Larry , and Curly . " Prew laughed out loud . " You 're a character yourself . " Maureen stared at him quizzically . " I 'm goin to buy them a checkerboard after Payday , if they promise to quit chewing gum . Theres four or five more back in the second waiting room , if you want to meet them too . But I wouldnt be surprised they all asleep . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Dear , " Maureen said . " Thats sweet of you . " " Do nt mention it . " " Well , " she said , " do you see anything you like ? or not ? I ai nt got all night . " " I like them all . Especially Moe , Larry , and Curly , " he said , looking hack across the room now at Lorene . " The Princess is purty , ai nt she ? " Maureen said .  | " Oh , " he said . " So-so . " " You mean you think she 'll do , " Maureen said . " You mean she 'd be all right . In a pinch . A good hard pinch . " " Thats it , " Prew said . Maureen stood up suddenly and smoothed her dress . " I 'm afraid you 'll have to excuse me , Dear , " she minced . " I can plainly see I will be of no use to you much . I seem to lack that virginal quality so profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her around here , " Prew said . " Why is that ? " " Call it professional jealousy , " Maureen said . " For lack of a better name . " Well , " she said , " much as I hate to dash off I am afraid you must allow me to tear myself away . Much as I adore your company , there is still business to attend to . Minerva is opening the door to let someone in , . and as Mother Kipfer says , business must come before pleasure . " " Then do nt let me detain you , " Prew said , " from your duty . " He grinned , flatly because all this had stopped being funny , but broadly because he liked this one and did not want to hurt her any more than he had to to get free of her . She flashed him hack a grin that understood his own completely , and he watched her teeter on her meatless hips across the room , walking on her spike heels like a small boy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; him feeling as he watched her a big , great sadness of inevitability like a bugle 's Taps . But underneath this , more urgent and more understandable , the thick chokiness in his throat again as he looked over at Lorene who still sat alone serenely waiting , his blood beating in his eyes because he was free to go back there now . Then as he got up , from beyond Maureen 's head and shoulders in the doorway , he heard the great door thud shut and the bar drop back into its brackets and then , suddenly , the powerful Brooklynese voice of Pvt Angelo Maggio in all its triumphant glory . " Well what do you know ? " it said , booming in a high thin treble that was a very peculiar sound . " Look who 's here . If it ai nt my old friend , compatriot , comrade in arms , and Mess Sergeant , Sgt Stark . Fancy meeting you here , of all places in the world . I bet you never thought you 'd see old Angelo here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly . " Wheres my boy Prewitt ? " " How the hell did you manage to make it into town with money ? " Stark 's voice wanted to know .  | " Ah , " Maggio 's voice smirked . " It was nothing . It was simple . Anything for a friend , anything for a friend . " The two of them came through the doorway , an arm around each other 's neck half drunkenly , past Maureen . Maggio pinched her on the bottom deliciously and said , " Hello , my love ! " and Maureen laughed and pinched his ear and said " Angelo my Romeo ! " Maggio loosed his arm and bowed and Prew saw Mrs Kipfer beaming in at Angelo from the entryway . Stark pulled him back erect and they came on , Angelo waving happily at everybody he could see , the conquering hero come home . " My god , " Angelo said drunkenly happily and put his other arm around Prew 's neck . " What is this , old home week ? Looks like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wops and Polacks . " He pulled their heads together in front of him and whispered . " I 'm drunk , friends . Been drinkin champagne cocktails since eleventhirty and am drunk . And happy . But do nt tell Mother Kipfer or she 'll throw me out . Also , do not tell her of this fifth of whiskey I got in my belt under this loose flowing gook shirt . " He straightened up and booked around and waved at Sandra sitting with the sailors . " Wonderful things , gook shirts , ai nt they , Baby Doll ? So loose and cool . Plenty of room to move . I love gook shirts . Do you love gook shirts ? " Sandra wrinkled her pert nose at him and laughed . " I love gook shirts , Angelo . " The two sailors stared at Angelo sourly . Maggio pulled the two heads together in front of him again . " Thats for me , " he whispered . " For all-1-1 night . Unless you men picked her first , you got first choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midget who married the fat lady in the circus . Acres and acres , " he whispered . " Acres and acres . " " What I want to knc ov , " Stark said , " is where the hell all this money come from . " " Simple , " Angelo said . " Really nothing . Nothing at all . But its a long story . Shall I tell it ? " " Sure , " Prew said . " Lets hear it . " " Shall I really tell it ? Well all right then , if you insist . But its a long story . You sure you really want to hear it ? Okay then , if you 're positive . I will tell it . But lets go back to the latrine first . " " I just been , " Stark said . Maggio slapped himself on the belly . " Yeah , but you dint find there what I 'll find there . "  | " Null said , " Stark said , and the three of them went arm in arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied bladders of a thousand men , and while Stark broke the seal on the bottle and they had a drink Maggio told them the triumphant story . " After you guys left for town I got to wonderin why the hell I should stay home . So I called up my queer , Hal ( the one I met that night we went broke in the poker game , remember ? ) , and made him drive up to Wahiawa and pick me up , the bastard . " He was reluctant , but 1 blackmailed him with this , " he said , holding up a stiffened middle finger . " Ony I was polite about it . He 's a intellecshual and very sensitive . I tole him this was a crisis and if he couldnt stand by his friends in a crisis he did nt deserve to have any friends . He seen the light all right . " He took me back downtown and bought me a big feed of steak and frenchfries at Lau Yee Chai 's , get that , Lau Yee Chai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits the best . After the feed we went and drunk champagne cocktails at the good old Waikiki Tavern where all the boys hang out . " I explained to old Hal how I 'd borrowed twenty bucks off a twenty percent man in the Company and I had to have it back right away to pay him off because he was threatenin to turn me in and if he did I 'd go to the Stockade sure and old Hal wouldnt see his little boy for about six months . " He pulled a sheaf of ones out of his pocket and shook it at them happily . " Thats all there was to it , men . Old Hal came through with a loan of twenty . He wanted to give it to me , but I 'm too smart for that . I wouldnt take it unless he made it a loan . I know how to handle him . If he could ever prove to himself I 'm tryin to take him for a ride I 'd never get another dime out of him . So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I had rather owe it to him all my life than beat him out of it . " Stark giggled and handed him the bottle . " So you told him you 'd go to the Stockade unless you paid off this twenty percent man . What a story , sam . Do nt this Hal know loanin money for interest is against the ARs ? and that any man who does it cant collect it legal ? " " He do nt know nothin about the Army , " Maggio grinned . " He tries to ack like he does , but he do nt . But he knows the navy though . Just ask him for it how he knows the navy , thats all , friend , " he grinned . He corked the bottle and put it back in his belt , under the hanging shirt . " Say , " he said . " Its gettin close on to two o'clock , men . We  | better be picking our stuff or them sailors out there going to beat our time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly sullenly , not looking at them . " Yeah ? " Maggio said . " Well that Great , Big , Tall , Long Sandra 's the one for me . Unless you picked her already . Who 'd you pick ? " he asked Stark anxiously . " Billy , " Stark said sullenly , still not looking at them . " The little Jewish one . I already ask her and its okay . " " Oh-oh , " Maggio grinned . " The little hot eyed job ? " " Sure , " Stark said angrily . " Thats right . Whats wrong with that ? " " Not a thing , " Maggio grinned . " I been meanin to try that sometime myself . " " All right then , " Stark said sullenly . " You pick yours and I 'll pick mine . Whats it to you what I pick ? " " Not a dam thing , " Maggio said . " Long as I get Big Sandra . I do nt care what they are , long as they big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thats your business . If I like Billy thats my business , ai nt it ? You like Sandra . Well , I just happen to like Billy . So what ? " " So nothing , " Maggio said . " All I ask was ... " " Well quit asking , " Stark said . " Its none of your goddam business . I just like Billy , thats all . " " Maureen is free , " Prew said . " To hell with Maureen , " Stark said . " I know what the hell I want . Billy 's what I want . You want to argue ? " " Okayokay , " Maggio said . " Quit bitching . You got her , ai nt you ? But man , " he said , " I love that Sandra . When they that big and tall , man ! Man oh man oh man ! You got yours picked ? " he said to Prew . " Yeah , " Prew said . " I got mine picked . " Stark snorted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke ? " Maggio said . " No kidding ? " " No joke , " Stark said sourly . " No kidding . Princess Lorene , the Virgin of Waikiki , " he taunted . " She 's a snob , " Maggio protested . " All right , so what ? " Prew said . " I ai nt telling you guys what to pick . Do nt tell me what to pick . " " I ai nt telling you what to pick , " Stark said . " You can pick Minerva , if you want , for all I give a good goddam . Its nothing to me what you pick . " " We want to be sure now , " Maggio said , " that we have them get  | three rooms right together in a row so we can all use this whiskey . Do nt forget that now , " he said . " You asked yours yet ? ' he said to Prew . " No , " Prew said reluctantly . " Not yet . " " Well you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you want her . Them sailors look to me like they mean to stay all night too . " " You ai nt ask Sandra yet either , have you ? " Prew said . " God damn no ! " Maggio said . " I clean forgot ! Lets us get back out there , man . Right now . " CHAPTER 17 THEY came back from the latrine down the long hallway past the many doors of tiny bedrooms , past the several short side halls that held only doors of bedrooms , making the right angle turn to the left and past still more doors of bedrooms , before they reached the waitingrooms . " Big place , " Maggio said . " Got a big business to take care of , " Stark said . Prew said nothing . He found Lorene still sitting in the same place , looking just as serenely confident , and he felt relieved a little . But now there was a new soldier he had not seen before sitting beside her talking to her , a constant stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but attentively , and he stopped undecided in the doorway , letting the other two go on in ahead because he felt again the thickness in his throat that all but choked him and now also a new feeling of weak laxness in the backs of his thighs . He knew he should ask her right away at once before it was too late . But he was very worried suddenly for fear he had already waited too long to ask . And it was suddenly of the greatest importance that he get her instead of another one . It was so important he was afraid to ask and he was very awkward and he could not begin . Jesus Christ , he raged ' at himself . Whats wrong with you . She 's nothing but a common whore , or at best an uncommon whore , so why should you be awkward . Who cares if this one does nt like you . Ask Maureen , she likes you . Whats wrong with you , he thought , is you have not had one for so long you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatch that comes along . Thats whats wrong with you , so for god sake quit being awkward . Go and ask Maureen .  | " You engaged , Lorene ? " he asked her awkwardly . His voice made the talkative soldier stop talking and look up and grin . At least something can make him stop talking , Prew thought . " No , Prew , " Lorene smiled serenely . " Just talking . " She got up . She smiled down at the talkative soldier and Prew thought he had never seen such a smugly talkative soldier . " I mean for all night , " he said thickly . " Engaged for all night . " " You want to stay all night ? " Lorene said . " I thought you meant engaged for right now . " " I meant engaged for all night , " he said flatly . " Are you ? " " Not yet , Prew . " " Well you are now , " he said , looking at the talkative soldier , " Its a date , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theres no need for you to hurry . Sit down and relax a while . " She patted the seat on the other side of her like a serenely reassuring mother , smiling at him with her long-lipped mouth set into the thin child 's face . " We were talking about surfboarding , " she explained , as he dropped into the chair . " Bill is stationed at DeRussey and is quite an expert at it . He describes it thrillingly . " The talkative soldier stopped grinning . He smiled briefly . " You know anything about surfing ? " he asked Prew , leaning forward around Lorene . " No , " Prew said , leaning forward around Lorene . " Not a goddam thing . " " Well , " the talkative soldier said , smiling at Lorene . " You guys from Schofield , being stationed inland like you are , do nt get much chance at it I guess . " " No , " Prew said . " But we got mountains . You know anything about mountain climbing ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling at Lorene again . " Are you a mountain climber ? " " No , " Prew said . " I do nt know anything about mountain climbing . Do you know anything about flying an airplane ? " The talkative soldier smiled briefly . " I 've had a few lessons , " he said . " Out at John Rodgers . " " Well I cant fly either , " Prew said . " What do you know about deep sea diving ? " Lorene , who was sitting facing the talkative soldier , turned clear around to serenely frown at him severely .  | The talkative soldier frowned at him too , this time , before he smiled briefly . " No , " the talkative soldier said . " I 've never done that . Is it fun ? " He leaned back in his chair and returned to his private conversation with Lorene who listened to it with the same serene attentiveness . Prew leaned back in his own chair , letting him have the floor undisputed , and bit off a hangnail on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not run down , he took the floor and kept it , with a constant stream of talking that showed no prospects of running down . " Hey , " Prew said finally , leaning forward again around Lorene . " Why do nt you take her to bed , Bill ? Ai nt that what you come up here for ? Or did you come up here to present her with a charter membership of the Outrigger Club ? " The talkative soldier stopped talking and smiled at Lorene sadly . " Well , " he said to her . " An Infantryman who is also a wit . " " At least I 'm not a goddamned Coast Artilleryman who is also a surfboarder , " Prew said . " Are you going to screw her or ai nt you ? " Stiffly Lorene turned clear around to stare at him again , this time not severely but horrifiedly , as if he had just crawled up out of a hole in the mud . Prew grinned at her . " Well ? Are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the room , Bill ? " Lorene said , " with me ? There is plenty of time if you do , honey . " " Well , " Bill said . " Sure . I guess . I think that would be better perhaps , do nt you ? The air in here seems to have gotten very smelly , has nt it ? " " Yeah , " Prew said deliberately . " I noticed that too . You son of a bitch . " " Listen , fellow . . . " Bill started . " Shall we go then ? " Lorene interrupted him . " I see no point in remaining here , do you ? Come on , Bill , " she said , taking his hand with virginal shyness . " The sooner we go , the more time we 'll have together , Bill . " " All right , " Bill said . He let her lead him out . At the door she stopped just long enough to give Prew a very disapproving look and to let him see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do nt forget to show her the snapshots of your new surfboard , Bill , " he called after them . Then , when they had gone , he let the grin drop off . I lc leaned hack in the chair . He slid down in it until he was sitting on the back  | of his waist with his chin on his chest . Big Time Operator Prewitt . Who reads off all the other poor unfortunate bastards like himself who are so hungry to talk to a woman they willing to come to a whorehouse and pay three bucks to do it . Really showed him up , dint you ? how he would take everything off of you and still not fight . Wanted to fight him bad , did nt you ? you who make your brags about never checking a cinch into the next man , you who are so high and mightily humanitarian you can not allow yourself to fight for Dynamite 's bloody boxing squad . Killer Prewitt , horny fisted veteran of a thousand battles . Blood makes you sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Killer . You were truly championship material , werent you , Caveman ? She ought to admire you a lot now . You really made a great impression on her , with your virility and fifteen bucks I bet she 'd even go all night with you . And that was all you wanted , wasnt it , Killer ? All you wanted was what she puts out for a living , wasnt it , Caveman ? You did nt want her admiration , or friendship , or closeness , or interest , or intimacy , or whatever the hell they call it , the part they keep and do nt put out for a living , did you ? No , of course you did nt . Who ever wants the interest or admiration of a whore ? Across the room Maggio and the tall long legged Sandra were bidding a fond farewell to two sullen sailors . Did they want the interest of a whore ? Sure not , that why they 're sullen , with plenty others in the next room . Little Billy was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking feverishly . Did Stark want the admiration of a little hot-eyed whore ? Of course not , thats why he 's grinning so complacently . Man , you kill me , you really knock me out . Killer Prewitt , the Boy Wonder . " How you doing , buddy ? " Stark grinned at him swimmily . " You got it all fixed up ? " " Yeah , " he said . " All fixed up . Fixed up swell . " Maybe you better take up surfboard riding , Killer , he thought . " Did you tell her about gettin the three rooms together ? " Stark asked him . " No , " he said . " I forgot to ask her that . " " We got it fixed up anyway , " Stark said . " Its okay . But do nt forget to tell her when she comes back , or you 'll miss out on the dew . " Then little Billy bit him on the ear and he jerked his head and cursed , then laughed , then brought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wont forget it , " Prew said , to nobody . " I wouldnt want to miss  | out on anything . Anything but that , but missing out on something . " Maggio and Sandra were shaking hands with the , sailors in great friendship , like the host and hostess regretfully speeding the departing guests . As soon as the sailors had gone through the connecting doors into the second waitingroom Maggio sat down with a great sigh and pulled Sandra down on his lap , whereupon Maggio completely disappeared from view . " Hey , " Maggio said muffledly . " I do nt think this is going to work out so good . How about me sitting on your lap ? For a change ? " " Well , " Sandra said . " It would be an experience . " She got up , laughing and wrinkling her pert nose and shaking her black cascade of gleaming hair , and they changed places , Maggio looking like a mahout perched on his favorite she elephant , or a circus monkey riding high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , " he said , " hey , look at me . Do You Want One  --  Of Them Big Fat Mamas  --  Too , " he sang . It was a perfect mime of Wingy Manone 's chortling , whiskey-rusty vocal . " What do you mean , fat ? " Sandra , who except for her breasts was very slender , said indignantly . " I 'm not fat , sonny . " " I know it , baby , " Maggio said . " Do nt call me sonny . I was oily speaking figurtively . Theres no call to get mad on me and insulting . " Hey , Prew , " he said , changing the subject . " Them sailors remind me of what I forgot to tell you . I see our chum Bloom down to the Tavern tonight . " " Yeah ? " Prew said listlessly . " Who with ? " " With a great big bastard of a queen he 's got on the string named Tommy who 's even bigger than Bloom is , if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , well . " " I cant picture it neither , " Maggio said . " Except he 's got a lot of shoulder for our boy to cry on . When Bloom seen me and I seen how he looked at me I begun to lookin around for a good big heavy chair . " " You meant he wasnt glad to see you ? " Prew said . Maggio laughed . " He got a patch of tape as big as my mouth on that flat head . My boy Hal knows this Tommy well , " he said . " Thats what he said , first time he seen him with Bloom , he said : Alas , poor Tommy , I knew him well . ' " " Thats from Shakespeare , " Sandra said . " A corruption . From Shakespeare 's Hamlet : Alas , poor Yorick , I knew him well . " " Yeah ? " Angelo said . " Well what do you know . My boy Hal is plenty educated , baby . Very poetic , Hal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " I bet he 's very poetic . They 're all  | poetic . I got a couple odd ones that come up to see me every now and then . " " Well , " Maggio mimed . " Whatever for ? " " You guess , " Sandra grinned . " I do nt have to guess , " Maggio said . " Old Hal , " he said to Prew , " says this Tommy borrows his car to take Bloom out with , ever time old Hal will let him have it . He says Tommy hardly makes enough to live on , says he works someplace downtown and writes stories for magazines on the side . Old Hal says he do nt make near enough to spend money on our chum Bloom , says he cant hardly buy our chum Bloom drinks even . Frankly , I am getting so I am wondering who is laying whom . " " Sure , " Prew said , trying to think of something to say . " I wouldnt doubt it , " he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chai 's tonight , " Maggio bragged to Sandra . " Feature that . " " Lau Yee Chai 's ? " Sandra said indifferently . " Thats my favorite hangout . Its a highclass place . I eat there all the time . " " Will they let you in ? " " Sure , " Sandra said . " Why not ? " " I ' thought The Law said you gals had to live out of town . " " It does , " Sandra said . " But at Lau Yee Chai 's they think I 'm a rich tourist lady . " " You ever eat any of this pa-pa-ya ? " Maggio asked her . " Papaya , " Sandra said . " Eat it all the time . I love it . " " Tonight was a first time I ever had some , " Angelo said . " Looks like mushmelon , kind of , but it tastes like nothin . They got to put lemon juice on it to make it taste at all . " " Its like olives , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . " " Same thing as avocado , " Stark said , with authority , " or snails . You got to learn to like it . " " To me , " Angelo said , " with lemon on it , it smells just like vomit . I am not acquiring any tastes for vomit . " He laughed uproariously half-drunkenly , so hard he almost fell off Sandra 's lap . Sandra looked at him inquiringly . " God damn , " Stark said , " if you two do nt look like Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy . " " We had gook waiter tonight , " Angelo explained , laughing . " This gook waiter stood around behint me all a time like he was scared I 'd pick up the wrong fork and shock the customers . So when he brought this pa-pa-ya with a slice of lemon I whispered to him what  | this was ? and he says , Why , thats papaya , Sir . ' So I whispered to him , Angelo Maggio tries anything once , ' and ast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lemon on it . " Oh , yes , Sir , ' he whispers back . " Odd , ' I whispered to him back , but when you put lemon juice on this pa-pa-ya it smells just like vomit , do nt it ? ' He just stares at me without a word and I whispers , Its a good thing I 'm crazy about vomit , ai nt it ? ' " All of them , excepting Prew , laughed , even Billy laughed , and Angelo seated on his perch grinned as smugly as the parrot who has just four-letter-worded the old maid out of the room in the cartoon . " I thought old Hal would bust his gut from laughin , " Angelo grinned . " This old waiter dint hover at this elbow no more , after that . " Little Billy got up from Stark 's lap suddenly , as if the laughter had released her from a hypnotism . She stretched her small voluptuous body feverishly , the firm small uptilted breasts that many a virtuous woman would have envied and considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their nipples darkly visible under the thin material , almost in Stark 's face . " Well , how about it , Maylon ? " she whispered huskily . " There wont be no more stragglers now , and if there was its too near two o'clock for an all night job like me to take them on . " She arched her back toward him thirstily , proudly . " How about a trip around the world , honey ? " she said silkily , " to start off with ? " " I thought that was ony for the pay as you go customers ? " Stark said thickly . " It is , " Billy said . " Its five bucks , ai nt it ? " " Thats right . Five extra . But its worth it , Maylon , it is truly worth it. , , Stark sighed deeply . " Okay , " he said , " you made a sale . " His eyes were blooded and very deep . " You people comin ? " Billy said to Maggio and Sandra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maggio said . " Nuts , " Billy spat . " To hell with the old bitch . " " We 're coming , " Sandra grinned at her . " We 're coming , kid . " Billy laughed feverishly . " I do n't see how she does it , " Sandra said to Maggio . " It would kill me , or any other normal woman . "  | As she passed Prew , Sandra leaned down and spoke . " When Lorene comes back , tell her we 're going across the entryway and back around to the rooms on the hallway above the outside stairs . She 'll know where . " " Okay , " Prew said indifferently , and watched them all go on across the entryway and disappear around a corner laughing . What the hell , he told himself , it isnt two o'clock yet ; Stark is having to pay five bucks extra for that Trip ; Angelo ai nt getting a price reduction for his bottle but them two whores will drink most of it ; so what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told it to himself repeatedly . But he was alone in the silent waitingroom with the darkened Wurlitzer , and there is nothing in the world so lonesome as a silent , darkened Wurlitzer , when the people and the nickels have all gone , and he kept losing count of how many times he said it and having to start over . When he finally heard Lorene 's low , poised Yoke out in the hallway he got up quickly . Too quickly , he thought angrily , you better sit hack down , you want her to think you 're anxious ? But he did not sit back down . Lorene said goodby to the Fort De  - -  Russey surfboard rider friendlily out in the hall . It seemed to him that it took her a very long time , more time than necessary , and that she was very friendly , much more friendly than seemed natural , and he wondered if this was to put him in his place again . But even then he did nt care and he was still standing , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Lorene came in smiling . He was very relieved that she was smiling . " That was a terrible way to have acted , " she rebuked him , smiling . " What you did . " " I know it was , " he said . " I did nt mean to do it . " " You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " " I am , " he said . " At least you have the money . Poor Bill wanted to stay all night and did nt have the money . I think that this was even his last three dollars , from the way he acted , and now he 'll have to walk clear out to Waikiki . " " Poor son of a bitch , " he said . " I feel for him , and I 'm sorry I was bastardly . " He was thinking of himself , broke and on KP , only this afternoon . This afternoon seemed a long way back now , he thought . at least thirty pages back , a thing that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before you came over , " Lorene smiled sadly , " poor Bill was so desperate he even asked me to loan him the fifteen dollars until Payday . And then you sit there and try to needle him like that . " " I was jealous , " he said .  | " Jealous ? " She smiled serenely . " Over me ? A common whore ? Do nt try to flatter me . You still ought to be ashamed . " " I am , " he said . " I said I was . But I 'm still jealous . " " You have no right to be . " " I know it . But I am . " " Poor Bill even wanted to give me five dollars interest , and offered to teach me to ride a surfboard , free . I wouldnt even have to rent one , I could use his . " " That takes a lot of guts , " Prew said . " Brass guts . " Lorene smiled sadly . " Just the same , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started picking on him . " " Why dint you loan it to him then ? " " Well , it wasnt because of you , " she said . " How could I loan it to him ? I 'm in business just like a grocer . I 'm here to make money , not because I love the work . You do nt run this business on charge accounts . Where would I be ? if I let every fellow I liked or felt sorry for open up a charge account with me ? I felt like a heel . And you did nt make me feel any better . " " I know it , " he said . " But he had to have a brass gut to even ask you a thing like that . These people who have always done everything  --  surfing , mountain climbing , flying , deep sea diving , anything you mention they 've done some of it  --  that kind always got a pure brass gut . And they 've never done anything . I 've seen them before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen him on his board at Waikiki , and he 's good . He spends all his money on surfing and spear fishing , and to stay in the Outrigger Club . He 's always in debt three months ahead . Thats another reason I couldnt loan it to him . " He was getting tired of Bill the surfboard rider . " Sandra said to tell you they were goin around back , over the outside stairs . She said you 'd know . Angelo sneaked in a bottle and we all want to use it . " Lorene looked at him steadily , her eyes very cool , and very serene . " Oh , all right , " she said . " I know where . Come on . " " Wait , " Prew said . " Are you still mad at me about this other ? " " No , " she said . " I 'm not mad . " " I think you are . And I had to ask you . Because if you 're still mad I 'd just rather we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him again , steadily , then she smiled . " You 're a funny one . No , I 'm not mad . I was , but I got over it . " " I dint want you to be mad at me . I had to ask you . " It was hard to say these things , without feeling foolish , hard to make them seem believable . So many fellows probably said them without meaning them . " Flatterer , " Lorene said coquettishly . It was the first time he had seen her be coquettish and it startled him . She took his hand and swung their arms together gayly , coquettishly , as they walked across the entryway and around the double corner to the hallway that went back over the stairs , and that had still more doors of tiny bedrooms . She led him gayly , him embarrassed by her sudden gaiety , along the worn carpeting down the narrow dimness that was lighted by a single bare bulb in the ceiling halfway down , to the third door from the end on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except on Payday , " she told him gayly , " when the big rush is on . The rest of the time we keep it for the all night  --  friends , " she said , " those of them who are very special . Nobody walks by here at night and it is quiet and the street is outside where you can hear the buses sometimes through the window . The rooms back there do nt have any of that , " she said , " and theres no fear of someone barging in on us , like sometimes happens back there . " " Am I one of your specials ? " he asked her thickly . She stopped at the door and laughed back at him over her shoulder . " Well , " she said , coquettishly , " you 're here , are nt you ? " " Sure I 'm here . But that could be because of Angelo and Maylon , and the bottle , that they wanted me cut in on , " he said , noticing how very feminine she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them here , not me . " " Is it so important ? " Lorene teased . " Yes , its important , " he said urgently . " Important because there are so many of us ; thats just faces , to you . So many of you that ai nt even faces , only just bodies , to us . Do you want to be just a unremembered body ? When we come here and then go away we need to know at least that we 're remembered . Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike . Men are killed by being always all alike , always unremembered . They die inside . Wives earn their money that way just as much as whores do , with this crappy imitation that ai nt no good but has to work because usually its all there is . But it dries up the well and leaves it nothing but a mudhole , makes it just rich blood  | poured down a strawy rathole that stinks afterwards , unless you are remembered . We do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered . Just to be remembered is . . . " In the dim half light he could see her looking at him , very surprised , and he shut it off , the little opening that was his mouth from which this torrent he did not know was there had leaped out at her . Flash and fadeout of boy with tongue in dike , he thought . Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates . HERO HOLDS BACK FLOOD THAT THREATENS TO DROWN EARTH ! ! In the silence Lorene laughed self-consciously . " If it is so important to you as all that , " she smiled , " then you are one of my specials . " Prew shook his head . " Thats no answer , " he said doggedly , and closed it up again with his tongue , the little hole , the little leak , the small Achilles heel . " Well , what other answer do you want ? " " I do nt know , " he said , listlessly . " Forget it . Is this our room ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fine-boned , woman 's hand on his arm and said , " Listen ! " half-jokingly , and he could hear the springs squeaking rhythmically in the next room . " At work already , " she joked , trying to erase the page and write it her way , but the uncertainty in her made it fail , fall flat . " Work , all right , " Prew said stonily , listening to the hard , unvarying rhythm . " Hard work . " The fine-boned , woman 's hand was on his arm , so delicate to hold such power , and he wanted to grab the thinness of her and constrict the breath out of her kissing her , bring her alive to what he knew , make her feel it . But the tabu said you never kissed a whore . They did nt like it . Their kiss was private , like most women 's bodies . It was a rooted Law , and she would not feel it , she would only see the broken Law and be angry at the liberty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned on the light then , suddenly showing all of it , baring it to the sight : the thin tnattressed bed , the stand in the corner that is just as important here as the broom is in the factory because the assembly line must above all always be kept clean or there might be a breakdown in production . He stood looking at it , time honored by tradition like the memorials to dead veterans that are always the same the cannon on the courthouse lawn whether its the Civil War or the World War or this coming war or any future war and you always knew why they were there By their Cannon Ye shall know  | Them on the courthouse lawn , and he almost felt like he was coming home . " I have to ask you for the money , " Lorene said awkwardly . " Oh . Sure , " he said . " I forgotten it . " He got his wallet out and gave her Stark 's fifteen dollars . Not even your fifteen dollars , he thought , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by getting a couple of cheap quilts out of the high cupboard and tossing them on the bed . " There . Minerva 's Corps only fixes the beds for the transient trade . But we 'll need covers , " she said gayly , but it was a false attempt that could not be distilled off of her awkwardness and Prew 's granite face that could not smile just now , the Great Stone Face , somebody wrote a story about the Great Stone Face . " All right , " she said . " Oh , " he said . " Okay . Sure . " " I wasnt hurrying you . I thought you did nt hear , " she said , noticing curiously how he was not awkward at all getting out of his clothes , which was the time when even the hardest of them were always awkward . But he was not awkward . He was not hard . He just did not even seem to be there , and she felt her bowels stir suddenly . It was , he thought , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pressure of power that will pour out flooding , from any little channel it can find , from any little opening , flooding forth roaring with a long dammed slowly risen energy of pressure that obliterates the earths and moons and stars and suns , subsiding finally into a ridiculous little trickle that will not even roll a pebble , and you wonder foolishly how this thin trickle ever could have generated power and maybe it was all in your own imagination and your eyelids did not really crumble away the firmament into the one single Sun , the one undying Principle . That , he thought , was what its like . They lay side by side , not touching , in the bed under the two separate quilts and the window was wide open on the night outside and they heard footsteps sound heavily far off like a cop and a streetcar screeked into action against time and somewhere a bus hissed its air brakes menacingly at them . They did not talk because knowing she did not care one way or the other , to talk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not even want to think , of anything but this that had just gone away and he looked out under the crack below the lowered blind at the roofs across the street and wondered dimly if Angelo was in the middle room and if he had the bottle or Stark had it and  | whether he should get up and put his pants on and see if he could find it because , very badly , he wanted a drink now . He did not know exactly how long , it seemed a very short time , it also seemed a very long time , before there was a light knock on the door and without waiting the door opened a little and Angelo Maggio 's grinning head ( preceded by a naked disembodied arm whose hand had a deathgrip around the neck of a long brown bottle ) appeared , and Prew noticed , somewhat absurdly , that Lorene jerked the covers up over her breasts and clutched them daintily about her shoulders . " I dint hear no sounds of combat , " Angelo 's head grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Restin , " Prew said . " I brung you a drink . Or otherwise old Longlegged Sandra would of drank it all by herself clear up . She 's a good girl , " he said , " a fine girl . But she drinks like a fish . Is it all right I can come in ? " " Sure , come ahead , " Prew said . " I been needin a drink . " " Are you sure you decent ? You wont embarrass me ? " " Quit clowning and bring the bottle . " Angelo was barefooted , his narrow pigeon breasted shoulders fully exposed , wearing nothing but the civilian slacks that he had bought secondhand from somebody in the Company and that were so much too big for him that his other hand had to clutch them around the scrawny waist to keep them up . He sat down on the bed beside them grinning happily like an amateur conspirator and handed Prew the bottle . " Thanks , " Prew said dryly , finding himself grinning , as he always found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want a drink ? " he asked Lorene . " No thanks . " " Whats a matter ? " Angelo said . " Do nt you drink ? " " Not much . And never straight whiskey . " " You do nt ? " Prew said . " No , " Lorene said . " Oh , I drink a cocktail , or a bottle of beer . But I do nt drink . Why ? Is there any Law that says every whore must be a drunkard ? " " No , " Angelo said . " But most of them are , I guess . " " Well , I 'm not . I think it is a weakness . " " I grant you that , " Angelo said . " And I do nt like weakness . Do you ? " she asked Prew . " No , " Prew said . " I do nt like weakness . But I like to drink . "  | " With you its not a weakness , " Lorene said . " With you its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt get that , " Angelo said . " That beats me . " " I do nt get it either , " Lorene said . " Still , I feel it somehow. - Still holding the quilt tight up around her shoulders she turned her head and smiled at Prew . Then she wiggled her body , it hidden by the quilt , over toward the center of the bed , over toward Prew , to give Angelo more room at the edge , and smiled up at him again , snugly . " There are some people , " she said , smiling at him , " whose weaknesses seem to be strength , instead of weakness . " " That is a very profound remark , " Angelo said . " Maybe thats why I still do nt get it . " " Well its so , " Lorene smiled contentedly . " Hey ! " Angelo protested . " What are you gon na do , marry this guy ? Way you grinnin at him you look like his wife . " " Do I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , momentarily , it came into both their faces looking at each other that this was just as if she were his wife , his private possession , and as if this bed were their home that an outsider , a much beloved friend but still outsider , had invaded friendlily , the Third Person , another man who did not know her , all of her , as he knew her and whom she did not want to know her as he knew her , and who because of this enhanced this privacy of intimacy . Prew put his hand out on the shapeless mound of quilt underneath which was the solid , curved , deep-flesh quiveriness of her hip , that he felt suddenly and momentarily truly belonged to him and she seemed to purr silently under his fingers and for the first time he considered with shock the possibility that sleeping with her had not made arise at all , the startling possibility that he was in love with her . What a possibility , he thought ; man , man , what a possibility . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock , who else is it possible for a soldier to fall in love with , except a whore ? This Rock , where the white girls , even the middle class white girls , were all little snobs and where there were no white girls below the middle class . This Rock , where even with the gook girls that were the lowest class it was a disgrace to be seen talking to a soldier . So then why not a whore ? It was not only possible , it was perfectly logical . Maybe it was even sensible . And it was a possibility he was to remember all his life and wonder about often , after that . Whether this was just a sudden fleeting appre-  | ciation that just happened to hit them both because Angelo came in the room just when he did . Whether it would have happened some other way than this if Angelo had not come in , or maybe not happened at all . Whether it was just that he had not had a woman for so long that this momentary thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was off guard and snared him with an imaginative wishful-thinking of his own creation . Whether maybe , strangest possibility of all , it was that love between a man and a woman happened to them all this way , was born full-grown from the copulation of a chance situation with a meaningless coincidence . It seemed the original possibility opened up a lot of other possibilities , and if during the rest of his life before he died he could have ever resolved that original possibility he felt he could have understood many things . " You people look happy , " Angelo said , sensing it himself . " Are you people happy ? I 'm happy . Do I look happy ? " " Happy as can be expected , " Lorene smiled , answering both at once , and Prew felt her hand under the quilt creep to him and then the fine-boned , woman 's fingers resting on the inside of his thigh . " Watch that ! " Angelo grinned . " I seen you . Well for Christ 's sake , look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blushing , turned to Prew and winked and he found her fingers with his own hand secretly and pressed them into him hard . " If you want any more of this whiskey , buddy , " Angelo said , " you better get it now . Because it wont be there long , once old Sandra gets aholt of it again . " " Stark had his share yet ? " " Stark ai nt getting any share , " Angelo said . " I went down to his room before I come here . I listened at the door and couldnt hear a sound , and knocked and couldnt raise a soul , and looked through the keyhole and couldnt see a thing . ( I think there was a shirt hung on the knob , by God . ) I even climbed up on the doorknob to look through the transom to see if he had died and the son of a bitch had hung a towel over it . I call that plain goddam bad manners . " " What you mean is , " Prew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah , " Angelo said . " As if anybody would look through his goddam old transom . " He frowned at them so indignantly so long that Lorene giggled and finally had to laugh out loud . " Well , " he said , getting up , " I 'm a kind of guy can tell when he 's  | overstayed his welcome . I can tell when I ai nt wanted . I leave you people to your lovin . " " Aw , stick around , " Prew grinned . " Please do nt rush off . " " Yas , " Angelo said , " I like you too , you bastard . I will just leave you some of this whiskey and then I wont feel so guilty . I put it in a glass and you can drink it at your leisure . " He wandered around , finally finding a tumbler on the stand , one that was full of water that he threw in a solid stream out the window where it hit the screen and sprayed , him saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and filled the glass full of whiskey from the bottle . Prew watched him grinning , and feeling ridiculously warm inside , almost fatherly , noticing how the whiskey ad slowed Angelo 's normally high agitation down until he seemed to be moving vaguely slowly like a slow motion film , and how this was the first time he had ever seen the tiny , curly headed Wop relaxed . " That be enough ? " Angelo said . " Hell , yes . I drink all that I 'll be about as much use as a melted candle . " " Okay . I see you then . See you in the morning . We go somewhere , " he said , " the three of us , and eat a good expensive breakfast before we go hack . Maybe we go to the Alexander Young Hotel , ' ey ? They open up early and they serve good breakfasts . Breakfast is important , " he said , " after a good night on the town . Okay ? " " Okay , " Prew grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lorene said , after Angelo had closed the door , " do nt you ? You like him a lot . " " Yes , " he said , " I do . He 's such a comical little bastard , and yet somehow he makes me always want to cry while I 'm laughin at him ; and thats why I really like him . I do nt know , maybe I 'm nuts . Did you ever feel that way about people ? " " Yes , " Lorene said . " Often . " " Well , thats something , " he said . " I feel it about Angelo , " she said , " every time I see him . And I think maybe I feel it about you . " " Me ! " " Yes . You know , " she said faintly , " you 're a funny one , a very funny one . " " One fonny fellow , " Prew said . " Am I ? " " Yes you are . " " Are nt other fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you are . "  | " Well thats good . Maybe you 'll remember me then . " " I 'll remember you . " " Will you ? Will you remember me tomorrow ? " " Yes . Next week , too . " " Will you remember me a month from now ? " " Yes . " " I do nt believe it . " " But I will though . Truly I will . " " All right . I believe you . I know I 'll remember you . " " Why ? " " Because . " " But why ? Why will you remember me ? " " Because , " he said , " because of this . " And smiling , he took a corner of her quilt and flipped it off her and looked at her lying there . She did not move and turned her head to smile at him . " Is that the only reason ? " " No . Also because you touched me when Angelo was here . " " Is that all ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But not because of talking to me ? " " Yes , that too . Definitely that too . But this also , " he said looking at her . " But the talking too ? " " Yes . The talking too . Talking is important . " " To me it is . " She smiled contentedly at him and took a corner of his quilt that he was still lying under propped up on one elbow looking down at her and flipped it off of him , like he had done to her . " Why , look at you , " she said . " I know . Ai nt it shameful ? " " I wonder what caused that . " " Cant help it . Does it every time . " " We really ought to change that . " He laughed and suddenly they were talking , bed talking , as they had not been at all before . And this time it was different . Afterwards , grateful , he bent his head down for her lips . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt . " " But why ? Why not ? " " Because I 'd rather you wouldnt . Because it would spoil it , and I do nt want to spoil it . " " All right , " he said . " I 'm sorry . "  | " Do nt be sorry . Its all right . But you must remember where we are . You must remember who I am . " " To hell with that . I do nt care about that . " " But I care about it . It would make it like all the others , all the drunks , all the brutal ones . All of them , they all try to kiss you , as if in that way they could get something that all the rest do nt get . " " Yes , " Prew said . " Yes , I guess thats right . I guess thats what they want , isnt it ? I 'm sorry . " " Theres nothing to be sorry for , " Lorene said . " Its just I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better move now , " she said . " Move . " She stood up , finished , and smiled across at him . " Prew , " she said , " little Prew boy , who is such a funny one . I 'm sorry about when you wanted to kiss me , little Prew boy . " " Its all right . " " No , its not . But I cant help it . Its not you , its because of  --  this place . And of the others . You do nt understand . " " I understand it . " " How could you ? never having been a woman ? " She washed her hands , thoroughly and carefully , and came back then and got in the bed and turned off the light . " Sleep a little ? " she said . " Yes , " he said in the darkness . " Do you go to the beach often ? " " Beach ? What beach ? " " Waikiki Beach . Where Bill The Surfboard Rider struts his stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Every day if I can make it . I love it . Why ? " " I 've never seen you out there . " " You wouldnt know me if you saw me . " " Maybe I would . " " No . You wouldnt . " " I think I would now . " " No , you wouldnt . I have to wear a banana leaf hat , and a beach jacket , and wrap my legs with a towel or else wear slacks . To keep from getting tanned . You 'd think I was an old , old tourist woman , if you saw me . " " I was wondering how to go about lookin for you , away from here . I 'll know what to look for now , when I go out . " " No . Please do nt do that . Really . " " Why not ? " " Because . Because its just bad policy , thats all , very bad . Thats why . "  | " But I do nt see why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , sitting up . " Because if you ever do that , I 'll never have another thing to do with you , ever . " " You wouldnt ? " he said , hearing the seriousness in her voice now , and not feeling serious nor wanting to argue , turning it aside by making what he had said seriously into a teasing of her . " You really wouldnt ? " " No I would not . " " But why ? " he teased . " I could find you easy now , with that description . You 'd stick out like a sore thumb , now . " " Well , " Lorene said , mollified to see he was only teasing , " you had better never . " " But why not get tanned ? " he said . " You would look good tanned . " In his mind he could see her on the beach . He wondered where she lived . Sandra 's avocation was Lau Yee Chai 's , instead of the beach . He wondered where Sandra lived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd love you tanned . " " Would you want me to get fired ? " Her voice was a smile now , in the darkness . " How many times have you been to a Honolulu whorehouse ? That you do nt know the girls are never tanned . " " I guess I never noticed it . " Where in the city , where on the island , in what unsuspected blank face houses , did they live , the army of them , these women that were the only women on the Rock , for all that we might know ? " If any of them had been tanned , " she laughed , " you would have noticed it . They stick out more than sore thumbs , women with tanned arms and legs and stomachs and the rest of them still white . There is a standing house rule against tan , even the face . " She paused . " It seems , " she said , " that soldiers and sailors seem to like their whores to be pure and virginly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You win that round . Just the same , I would like it though . On you . " The only women for us anywhere , he thought , and here the only place to find them . If you saw them in the bars , or on the beach , or in the shops , you never recognized them , and if they recognized you they were wonderful at hiding it . Maybe I 've even seen her before , in Waikiki , and did not know it . After they left the office , he thought , the business office , and went out to mingle with the city , then they just disappeared . Mingle is a good word , he thought sleepily . Mingle . Mingle . I think I need a drink . The tumbler was still where Angelo had left it , untouched , and he made himself get up in the dark and hunt around till he found it .  | Old Doctor Maggio 's magic sleeping potion , he thought and drank half of it and carried it back to the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It did not last him long , but neither did it warm or fill the hollowness that he poured it into . " I would like to look at the stark white skin , " he said to her , " against the deep brown tan . Then I would think about how on the beach the white was all covered up and hidden , so no one could see it , and of how I was going to look at what no one else got to look It . " You are a funny one , little Prew boy . " " You said that before . " " And I say it again . You are a funny one , a very funny one , that I can not figure out . " " I guess I 'm easy to figure out , if you got the key . " " Not to me . I guess I do nt have the key . " " No , " he said , sleepily . " You ai nt got it . And that seems to impress you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant figure out make me curious . I like to have things all figured out . One , two , three . In the same way that I had this all figured out before I ever came here . " " Yes , " he said , and he noticed that her voice was beginning to come loud , then faint , from across the curtain of the sleepiness . Maybe I 'm asleep already , he thought , Maybe I 'm dreaming . " You said that same thing earlier tonight , " he said , " and it struck me . But you ai nt explained it to me yet . Tell me , how did you ever come to get into this racket ? " " I am a volunteer , " Lorene said , and he noticed there was no trace of sleepiness in her voice . " Maybe you think , " she said , " that all whores are virgins who were kidnapped by Lucky Luciano , and raped , and then farmed out . Maybe you think , " the voice said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lots of them enlist . Some because they just like the life , and do nt mind doing what they have to do to get the rest of it . Others because they are bitter against some man who took their cherry and maybe knocked them up and then left them , and now they are getting even in some funny way , or else just do nt give a damn , any more . " Oh , " said the voice , " there are lots of us who have enlisted . " " And lots who re-enlist , " Prew said . " Lots who end up thirty year men . " " Not necessarily . There are some , but not nearly as many as you  | chink . Lots of them , like me , figure it all out beforehand . Get in for one hitch and clean up and then get out . Lots of them do that . " " Is that what you aim to do ? " " You do nt think I mean to do this all my life ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer . And then I will be all set , for life . " " But what about home ? " he asked the voice , sleepily , wonderingly , not sure yet that this was a dream he dreamed and had not really heard at all . " What will the people back home say ? " " They will say nothing . Because they will know nothing . In my home town , where my mother still lives  --  on the money that I send her  --  I am a private secretary to a big , big shot in the Hawaii sugar trade . I am a hometown waitress who went to night school and developed herself and became a private secretary who is saving her money to come home and take care of her poor invalided mother . " " But what if you get caught ? " he asked this dream . " How can I get caught ? In the little town in Oregon where I come from nobody but the very rich even venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing all my demure conservative private secretary 's clothes and retire , on the modest nestegg ' I will have , who is to doubt I am and was just what I say I am ? " " Nobody , I guess . But why ? How did you ever get hold of the idea ? " " I had a boyfriend , " the apparition said . " I was a waitress , working in the local chain drugstore . He was from one of the richest families in town . Old story , with no new twists . I did nt get knocked up , nothing like that . He just married the girl his parents thought was suitable for his position , after two years of sleeping with me . " " Too bad , " he murmured to it . Was that the whiskey that was loosening him up so , all through his arms and legs ? " Too bad . Rotten . " " It does make a pretty story , does nt it ? " the voice smiled . " Maybe they could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Ten thousand of them . " " But not with the ending this one has . This one does not end with the heroine still devoted , with the heroine going to work for them as maid in their new home , taking care of their children for them , just to be near her beloved , like was in this lovely movie , The Hollow of Intention . " " No , " he said . " Life ai nt like that , not very often . Not at all in the sections of life I 've seen . " " Nor in any other sections of it . No it certainly is not . I left town  | after the marriage and went to Seattle , as a waitress . There was a bigtime pimp use to come in the store , all the girls pointed him out to me . It wasnt very hard to interest him into making a pass , the hard part was in letting him lay me and making him think I liked it . So that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into doing what he meant to do all along . Only , I fixed it so I got sent here , instead of Panama or Mexico ; because he loved me , you see , and I loved him . He did nt know that every night after he left my place I 'd get up and go and puke my guts out . " " Lorene , " he said , " Lorene , " and he was not sure if he was dreaming this , or saying it out loud . " You 've got a lot of guts , Lorene . I 'm proud of you , Lorene . I understand you now , Lorene , and I am proud of you , no matter what any other bastard says . " " Guts , " the voice said . " Guts are nothing . Guts are only good for what you can make them bring you . " " You sound hard , Lorene . " " If prestige , position , money are what the good men need from their wives , why I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With money . " And after I go home with a stocking full of bills , after I build the new home for my mother and myself , after I join the Country Club and take up golf , get in the most acceptable bridge club , read them a book report on The Hollow of Intention for the Tuesday Literary Club  --  then the proper man with the proper position will find me as a proper wife who can keep a proper home and raise the proper children , and I will marry him . And I will be happy . " " Lorene , " he dreamed , " I hope you pull it off . By god , I hope you do . " " Theres nothing to pull off . Its all there . One , two , three . In black and white . In my town there are many who have done this , except that they were amateur whores , mistresses , ' instead of professionals . " And then , " the voice said softly , " with it all arranged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade out and die and be only the memory of one of those dreams you dream , and are always afraid will happen to you in real life , but that never do . Because when you are proper , you are safe . " " Lorene , " he dreamed , " Lorene . Lorene , I think that I love you , Lorene . You 've got guts and beauty and , Lorene , I think thats why I love you , Lorene . " " You 're drunk , " said the voice . " How could a man love a whore ?  | that he met for the first time in a whorehouse ? You 're drunk and you had better go to sleep . " " Thats what I thought you 'd say , " he grinned slyly at the apparition , at the dream . " I knew you 'd say that . " " How did you know ? " the voice said . " I just knew , " he said . " I know you , Lorene . But will he love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you like I think I do ? " " You do nt love me , " the sleepiness around him said . " You 're drunk . And he wont be rich . " " But he 'll have prestige , position , money , all the things you said , all the things us fucking joes wont never have . But I do nt think he 'll love you much , Lorene . I just do nt think he will , somehow . " " He will never know that I was a whore . There is no way in God 's world he could ever find it out . " " It wasnt that I mean , Lorene . " " And for the rest  --  I 'll make him love me . Because by then , I really should know how . " " No . No one ever has it all , Lorene . Some that are lucky are allowed to choose , but even then its not a choice . But no one ever has it all , somehow . Theres not even any use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do nt ever expect it either , Lorene . He will never love you , Lorene , this rich guy . Your mind , Lorene , being what it is , ai nt goin to let him love you . Thats the part you 'll never have , thats the part you 'll have to pay . No one ever has it all , and what you get from life at all you pay him dearly for , by giving up what you really wanted more , but never knew it , never realized , until after he high pressured you to sign . " " Its time you went to sleep , " the voice said soothingly . " I know : Because I 'm drunk . But its when I 'm drunk , Lorene , that I can see the things I cant remember and cant see , when I 'm sober . I 'm drunk and dreaming , but oh , Lorene , I can see the Truth so plain . I can almost reach out and touch it . " Then , it seemed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not cover up the nipples or the swelling black triangle that he loved to look at reached down to him the plate with the golden bugle on it and the other plate in the other hand with the two cans of C Ration Meat &; Beans , and bent over him and kissed him on the lips because he had chosen the wrong one and the cloudy heavens fell . " Now go to sleep . "  | " Why did you kiss me ? You think I 'm drunk , and that I wont remember . But I 'll remember . And I 'll come back . " " Shush . Shush . Of course you 'll come back . " " You think I wont . But I will . I 'll be back . I 'll always be back . " " Of course you will , I know you will . " " I 'll be back Payday Night . " " And I 'll be looking for you . " " And I 'll ! remember everything I yaw tonight and explain it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , I know that I 'll remember . Do nt you think I will remember ? " " Of course you will remember . " " I must remember . Its important . Do nt go away , Lorene . Stay here . " " I 'll stay right here . You go to sleep now . " " All right , " he said , " all right , Lorene . " CHAPTER 18 HE did remember . He had been very drunk and very dreamy , but he remembered . All during the time the three heavily hung-over soldiers , looking very chastened but with their faces newly clean of pressure , meekly ate their breakfast in the rich man 's mirror encrusted diningroom of the Alexander Young Hotel in downtown Honolulu and then after the waffles and fried eggs and ham and bacon and much coffee , all of a fortifying excellence , walked across town through the deserted dew-fresh city streets of early morning to the Army-Navy Y to catch a cab back and be late for Reveille  --  all during this he was remembering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering . His head felt very big and very soft to the touch and it was hard to separate the dream of last night from the reality . But he could remember distinctly that she kissed him , on the mouth . Whores do not kiss soldiers on the mouth , neither do they tell them their life story . But he could remember all the details of her story , and how when she was caught up in the telling of it the carefully educated accent and the meticulous serenity , both probably very painfully acquired , had dropped off of her revealing the real Lorene . A hard Lorene , a cold and brilliant , like a diamond ; but real , very real , and alive . This was what clinched it for him . He had gotten under her shell , as men very seldom get under women 's shells , as soldiers never get under whores ' shells , and he was  | going back payday night , if he had to steal the money , because , he thought , in this world , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all hard things was to know the real from the illusion , to meet one other human being breath to breath without the prefabricated soundproofed walls of modern sanitation always in between and know in meeting that this was this human and not this human 's momentary role ; in this world that was the hardest , because in this world , he thought , each bee out of his own thorax makes the wax for his own cell , to protect his own private stock of honey , but I have broken through , just once , this one time only . Or , at least , he thought , I think I have . In fact , thinking back about it , the only thing about it all that he could not remember was the old familiar drunken revelation , the moment when he had reached out and grasped the whole of all truth and compressed it into a single sentence that was one single cure-all capsule , easy to swallow , painless to take . Of that all he could remember was that he had done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , surely you do not expect to remember that , all your life you have been not remembering that , you should be used to that . They pulled in home ( after taking the precaution to walk the last two blocks , just in case Holmes or The Warden might be watching for them ) just as the Company was going upstairs after breakfast . He was a little worried and Angelo was very worried , once they were back inside the half-forgotten confines of the Post , but Stark who did not have to stand Reveille formation was not worried at all , and not above razzing them a little . But worrying at all was needless , this time they were lucky . Chief Choate , still their Corporal , was waiting for them on the porch . Neither Holmes nor The Warden nor S/Sgt Dhom had taken Reveille this morning , the Chief said , and Lt Culpepper had taken it , and the Chief was able to report his squad all present and get by with it , since Sergeant Platoon Guide Galovitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , where had they been . Feeling very lucky , they both rushed upstairs , like runners who are safe on a steal at second and then get ready to steal third , and changed from their civilians straight into fatigues . Chief Choate , his deadpan Indian stolidity showing plainly by its walnut blankness that he had not said all there was to say , patiently followed them upstairs , bloodshot-eyed but placid after his customary hard night at Choy 's . " The uniform 's been changed , " he told them ponderously . " Sidearms and leggins. "  | " Jesus whynt you tell us ? " Maggio , who had thought he was all dressed , said angrily . " Ai nt had a chance , " the Chief said . " Up to now . " " We better hurry , " Maggio said , and sprinted for his wall locker . Prew was looking at the Chief 's moon face which revealed nothing of the startling implications of the order . " Why , that means we drill outside . " " You guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornin . Looks like the rainy season 's over . You better get your leggins on . Prew nodded and went to his wall locker and Chief Choate lit a cigaret and stared at the knotting string of rising smoke and waited patiently for them to come back . " Old Ike , " he said , " is been snoopin all over hell , since before breakfast , lookin for you . I tole him you run over to the PX for a pack of butts . " " Thanks , Chief , " Prew said . " Thanks nothing , " the Chief said . " Thanks hell . " Angelo was feverishly finishing up his first leggin , half hitching the string end . " I always know this guy was chickenshit , " he grinned . The Chief looked at him stolidly . " This is no twobit ass eating , kid . This here is serious . Or maybe you dint hear me ? When I said Drill moves outside ? " " No , I dint , " Angelo said . The Chief ignored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to Prew . " From now on its no holts barred . They goin to have practicly a free hand with you , in the field . " Prew slipped his toe in through the leggin strap and worked it back , not saying anything . There was nothing to say . He had known for a long time it was coming , but he had not expected it to come . It was like with dying . " Another stunt like missin Reveille , " the Chief said , " and you gone . I went out on a limb for you this morning . I wont do it again . " " I wouldnt expect you to , " Prew said . " Not now . " " I cant afford to , " the Chief said , placidly , factually , no guilt in his face or voice . " Maybe you think I let you down , because you and me been friends . " " No . " " I 'm lettin you know now where I stand , so you wont think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay . I got it . "  | " I got pull with the Colonel , " the Chief explained factually , " but I ai nt got that much pull . I help you out along , what little bit I can , but no more goin out on limbs . I lucky to keep what I got and I ai nt goin to jeopardize it . I like this outfit . " " So do I , " Prew said . " Thats funny ai nt it ? " " Yes , " the Chief said . " Very funny . Ha , ha . Ho , ho . " " Big joke , " Prew said . " On me . " " You buckin a big organization , when you buck the fighters in this outfit . They run this outfit . They maybe damn near run the Regmint . And they mean to see you go out for fightin , if they got to wear you down to a flyweight to do it . " " Tell me somethin I do nt know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you tough . You a hard man . They cant touch you . " He made as if to get up . " Wait , " Prew said . " Not as long as I keep within the ARs , within the Law , I do nt see how they can . As long as I do nt break no Laws . " " Maybe not . But they want that Division Championship next winter bad , Dynamite wants it bad . " " I do nt see what he can do , long as I break no Laws . " " Do nt kid me , " the Chief said , " do nt snow me . You no ree-croot . You been in quite a while . I guess you ai nt never seen a bunch get together and give a man The Treatment . " " I 've heard about it . " " Whats The Treatment ? " Maggio wanted to know . The Chief ignored him . " Maybe they ai nt got it developed to a science , like the boys have at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culver , " he said to Prew , " but its effective . Theres nothin in this world will bring a man into line quicker . Or else kill him . I seen it just once , in PI . The guy deserted , went back in the hills and married a Moro . When they caught him he got twelve years . He ended up a federal lifer . " " I 'm too smart for that , " Prew grinned . " And I do nt kill easy , Chief , " he added , grinning stiffly , feeling the stiffness spreading clear up to his forehead like slow setting plaster , drawing these lips back tight on these teeth and cutting gashes in under these cheekbones , not him doing it , the stiffness doing it , as it always did this stiffness that came over him , over his face , in the ring when a man was trying to hit him , in a drunken brawl when a man drew a knife on him , any time there was fight , any time there was threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , which was the rottenest , foulest stinking word there was , but which some men used so freely and so proudly . Chief Choate just looked at him stolidly , untouched , but Maggio who  | was watching him too was touched . Something like Humphrey Bogart , Maggio thought , something like a skull , more like a skull , a lipless cheekless deathshead skull . " I can take everything they hand out , " Prew grinned , " and ask for more . " " Yas , " Maggio said , " and me too . " " Do you want a busted head , kid ? " Chief Choate asked him seriously . " No , " Maggio said . " Then keep your big yap shut . This is serious . And if you smart , you keep your big nose out altogether . This is his fight . You ony make it worse on him by gettin in . " " Thats right , Angelo , " Prew grinned , feeling the stiffness soften as he looked at the furious narrowshouldered little Wop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maggio said . " Then you might as well get use to it , " the Chief said . " You probly be seein it often before you die . " I do nt see why you want to do it , " he said to Prew . " You ony makin it hard on yourself . But thats your business , its none of my affair . I hate to see you fuck up , is all . " " You refused to fight for Dynamite yourself , once . " " Yas , but with me I knew what was the story . I had enough pull in Regmint I could make it stick . You cant . " " Maybe not . We 'll see . I ai nt never refused a order yet , when its official duty . But I do nt think they got the right to order me what to do outside of duty hours . " " It ai nt a question of right or wrong , its a question of fack . But there is awys been a question if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soljer has the right to be a man . " " And its gettin more and more that way lately , in this world all over . " " And not ony in the Army , " Maggio put in , and Prew could see that Angelo was remembering Gimbel 's Basement . " Thats right , " Chief Choate said . " And so what ? " " So this duty stuff is okay , maybe , " Maggio said , " for wartime . In wartime a soljer 's awys under orders . But not in peacetime . " " Been wartime , " Chief Choate said , " ever since I enlisted . And thats thirteen years ago . For an army , its awys wartime . " " Thats right , " Prew said . " There ai nt no peacetime army . But what I do nt believe , is that the Regimental Boxing Squad , or fighting for the Regimental Boxing Squad , is essential to the perpetual war effort . "  | " You ast Dynamite what he thinks , " the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hell , " Angelo Maggio said . " Thats no problem , Mr. Anthony . Dynamite 's so full of West Point propaganda it runs out of his ears an leaves a yellow stream behind him . " " Maybe , " the Chief said , " but he 's the Compny Commander . " From out in the quad the guard bugle sounded Drill Call imperatively and Chief Choate got up from the bunk , looking at Prew blankly searchingly . " Well , " he said . " Well , I see you . " " In the Stockade , " Prew grinned , and watched the big man dogtrotting lumberingly graceful down the aisle to his end bunk , to get his equipment on . Then he picked up the bayonet scabbard he had forgotten and worked a hook into the wide length of cartridge belt under the old third pocket . " Nice homecoming gift , " he said . " To hell with them , " Angelo Maggio said . " All of them . They cant do nothing . What can they do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hook and shook them down into the belt , watching the Chief buckling into field training harness , the bayonet that became a toothpick when it hung on him , the light pack that looked like a matchbox on his back , the big hefty Springfield ' 03 like a Woolworth imitation of itself for small boys when the big fist picked it up . " Him too , " Angelo said . " A fine pal . " " No , he 's all right . " When times changed , you accepted it . The days of Jeb Stuart and the plumed hats and the highwayman came riding riding up to the old inn door ; that was the Civil War , that wasnt now . The days when the Emperor was nourished through hardship and the long walk home from Moscow by the full hearted devotion of the Old Guard and the Young Guard who still loved him in defeat , that wasnt now either but even earlier , they did nt have gas warfare then , why , they did nt even kill the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Times change is all , or maybe those were only stories , maybe only dreamed up afterwards , because they would have liked it to have happened that way . " Just because he use to eat breakfast with me in Choy 's , does that make him owe me something ? The Chief 's a damned good man . " " Sure , " Angelo said . " So was Pilate . " " Oh , halls . Can it , will you ? You do nt understand it . Stick to things you understand . "  | " Okay , " Angelo said and stuffed his cigaret pack and book of matches into a cartridge pocket . " We 'll need these . Jesus , my head . And that goddam Stark layin out down in the cooks ' room sleepin up a fog . We better be gettin outside ? " The guard bugle in the quad sounding the repeat answered him and from downstairs S/Sgt Dhom 's big voice boomed up through the screens , sounding very like a soldier . " All right , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . Lets jerk that lead . Outside . Drill Call . " " Lets go , my squad , " Chief Choate bellowed . " Grab your hats and grab your bats , this war is on . " He lumbered gracefully light footed down the stairs singing Drill Call in a natural basso that carried far , " Fall out for drill , like hell I will , I ai nt had no chow . I said Fall out for drill , you bet I will , the compny commander 's here now . " " But he can sing , " Angelo said grudgingly . All over the big squadroorn men were moving , picking up their rifles and heading for the stairs . " Well . Lets cut this cake , " Prew said , picking up the long wood , clean steel , solidness of his own . From the third floor porch he could look down out over all of it , the whole ritual of drill call , the first drill call after the rainy season . He stopped to watch it . Angelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . It was a good picture though , a soldiering picture , like the Pall Mall ad ( they pronounce that Pell Mell , do nt they , like the bloody English peerage , I like Pall Mall better though , its American , even if it ai nt highclass ) that he still had scotch-taped to the inside of his footlocker top , a fine picture , if you were a thirty year man . The quadrangle was alive with men in blue fatigues and the khaki almost faded white of belts and leggins and the sharp-brimmed olive drab campaign hats , pouring out the walks and lining up in their companies , very soldierly , the kind of soldierly that wins a war , he thought proudly , any war , but all those other companies were remote , even the bugle corps was remote he noticed , all faceless figures and remote , a background for our Company , where every face was a face he knew so that the sameness of uniform did not matter , even enhanced the individuality of the faces , each face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Captain Holmes ( dead star , he thought , but then maybe The Warden is our sun ) , asteroid faces , not big enough for a private orbit , too small to be classed as planets ( like Dhom , or Champ Wilson , or Pop Karelsen , or Turp Thornhill , Jim O'Hayer , Isaac Bloom , Nicolo Leva  --  good names ,  | he thought , good old American names  --  or like the new man Mallaux who was a coming featherweight , or Old Ike Galovitch  --  was Ike a planet ? Ike was more like a third rate moon ) . Looking down through the screens he could see the asteroid face of Readall Treadwell , that was one of them , Readall Treadwell ( christened " Fatstuff " but who was no more fat than Man Mountain Dean was fat ) who could hardly read any , let alone read all , but whose solid endurance at carting around the BAR he never got to fire was almost legend . He could see Crandell " Dusty " Rhodes ( christened " The Scholar " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genuine diamond ring or a real honest-to-God antique Roman coin he was willing to let go to you because you were a friend . He could see " Bull " Nair ( alias " The Stud " ) . These were all part of it , he felt , looking down ; important parts , as small memories are important parts of the life of a man , parts of your chosen heritage , even of your destiny maybe , small functioning parts of this tiny solar system that is the company that is lost among the galaxies of regiments that make up this universe that is the Army , the parts that give meaning to the only universe you know , he thought , the only universe you want , because it is the only one you ever found a place in yet . And now you are rapidly losing that . " Come on , Angelo , " he said , watching the knot of noncoms clustered around the bald headed , sandhog shouldered Dhom who towered over Chief Choate even , " we better get our asses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Angelo said as they fell in with the 1st Platoon . " Not sick , " Prew said , looking at him sideways under the hat brim low over his eyes . " Just hung over . " But it was not the head , he thought , be honest , you 've fallen out for drill with bigger heads than this before and always laughed them off . Four hours drill under a hot sun with a head on was as much a part of soldiering as was musketry with a half pint hidden in your belt to help you shoot , or as were forced practice marches with a Listerine mouthwash bottle full of saki on your hip . Soldiering and drinking have always been blood brothers . But what , he thought , is soldiering ? The very , very odd thing was that all this that was costing him , in the Army , had not a thing to do with soldiering . There should be something important , there , he told himself . Reality , he thought . To know the real from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're off your nut , but he could not shake off this new sense of separateness . The knot of noncoms on the green broke up , the giant Dhom going front and center and the others doubletiming back to their platoons.  | Standing out in front alone and looking very soldierly Dhom gave them right shoulder sounding very soldierly and the rifles moved and were smartly slapped in unison very satisfyingly soldierly , but even this did not free him from this agonizing separateness that was worse than any loneliness , this feeling that he knew a thing the others did not know . They marched at attention out the northwest truck entrance and across the intersection where the well-bucked MP was directing the heavy early morning traffic and where they were given route step and somebody in the back began the ancient hallowed dialogue of the Infantry . " Who won the War ? " " The MPs won it , " came the answer . " How 'd they win it ? " " Why , their mothers and sisters laying for Liberty Bonds . " The tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed Post Theater #r ' someone broke into the Regimental Song and the rest took it up , singing the words the regimental yearbook never printed . " Oh , we wont come back to Wahoo any more . No , we wont come hack to Wahoo any more . We will fuck your black kanaky , We will drink your goddamned saki , BUT we wont come back to Wahoo any more . " And Chief Choate in his deep rich basso took his favorite line of the break alone . " Kiss me , Charlie , there. , some barley , Runnin down my leg . " And the voice of authority spoke through the brassy soldierly throat of S/Sgt Dhom . " Can that , you men , or you can march at attention . Theys liable to be ladies present around here . " And this was soldiering , the column of marching men that was George Company moving on out Kolekole Pass Road toward drill between the rows of tall old elms that lined the road on either side exuding an abiding permanence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiver was not in his spine , because the soldiering that once was the only real was now obviously the illusion , since the real lay somewhere hidden below its realistic camouflage .  | CHAPTER 19 No officers appeared at drill all morning , even for the usual look-see . It developed into a sort of general Tell-Off-Prewitt field day with first one noncom then another carrying the ball . They gave him a good going over . He had not up to then believed that anything could hurt a man so much , without actually resorting to physical pain . He was , he realized . learning a considerable bit about pain lately . In the first period Dhom , the calisthenics master ( by virtue of being trainer to the boxing squad ) , read him off over a silent 36-count side straddle hop exercise and had him to do it again alone ( as was customary with the awkward squad ) while the Company rested . Prew , who had not miscounted a side straddle hop since getting out of recruit drill , did it , perfectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time try to get it right and then warned ( as was customary with the awkward squad ) to look alive or find himself on extra duty . Prew knew Dhom , and had never much cared for him . It was Dhom who had once , during a Retreat formation , bulled his way into ranks like a bowling ball making a strike and punched a young recruit in the jaw for talking ; he came near getting busted over that one , though never , of course , near enough to worry over . But on the other hand , it was also Dhom who last fall during the annual 3o-mile hike had carried four extra rifles and a BAR the last in miles to bring G Company in one hundred percent present , the only company in the Regiment to make it . And also , it was Dhom whose perpetual henpecking by his greasy Filipino wife had become a company institution . Back at the barracks , talking to The Chief , Prew had dismissed being hurt . Being hurt had not entered into it then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical pain , if they live at all , and he was proud of his tested capacity , confident in the belief that they could doubletime him forever and work him till he dropped but they could never break that endurance that was the only thing his father had bequeathed him . He saw it as a simple battle of wills on a physical plane ? which in a way it was . But it was also more than that , and this he had not seen . He had not seen that these men meant anything to him . Long ago , at Myer , when he first quit fighting to get in the Bugle Corps and saw how they all construed this to be lack of guts , he had had to reluctantly put aside his hope of ever being understood . This caused a certain loneliness but he accepted that because , he told himself , it was probably that in the first place that made him want to bugle . Then later , when they dropped him from the Bugle Corps because he got  | the clap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bat for him and try to get him reinstated , this had increased his loneliness , but it also hardened his invulnerability . And now , being invulnerable since there was nothing left for them to hurt , he had been quite sure that these men meant nothing to him . What he had forgotten , of course , was that these men were men and , being men , could not help but mean something to him , who was also a man . What he had forgotten momentarily was that he was a man , and that these men were , in effect , the same men who had come silently out on the porches last night ( only last night , it was ) to listen to his Taps . These men were , in effect , the disembodied voice that had come across the quad from Choy 's , the abstract spokesman for them all , saying proudly , " 1 told you it was Prewitt . " How this could be , he did not know . He could see this was going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely was that though he had matched them for his faith in comradeship and understanding and had lost , he still had his faith in men kicking around somewhere , and that this was where they could still reach him . It did not take the hurt long in getting started . During the second period which was Old Ike 's close order he was called down twice , first for missing a pivot on a column movement ( during which at least the two men in front of him were also out of step ) , then second for fouling up on a triple rear march-right flanking movement ( during which the entire company except for the first two ranks of four became a shambling mob eating its own dust and cursing ) . Both times Ike called him out of ranks indignantly and read him off , spraying Prew 's shirt with a fine mist of old man 's Slavic spit , and after the second reading off sent him with a noncom across the road to the chemical warfare 's quarter-mile track to doubletime seven laps with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward squad ) . When he came back sweating heavily but silent , all the men of the jockstrap faction glared at him indignantly ( as was customary with the awkward squad ) while the men of the non-jockstrap faction did not look at him at all hut intently studied the modernistic outlines of the new chem warfare barracks . Only Maggio threw him a grin . It was really very interesting . In a close order drill the caliber of this one ( for which Ike Galovitch was famous ) being told off for such niceties of execution in the midst of so much fumbling was really laughable . So Prew laughed . The whole thing was quite a triumph of imagination over matter . The men slouched through Ike 's close order without snap or smartness , the  | commands in Ike 's perverted English seldom understandable and often given on the wrong foot , at least a third of them always out of step with Ike 's uneven cadence . Ike , in commanding , seemed to fluctuate between a chaste uncertain modesty and a grotesque and Mussoliniish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snappy drill , and to any man who had ever soldiered it was not only agony , it was unbelievable , it was the ultimate prostitution of soldiering , the greatest sin ever perpetrated by a boiler-orderly . For the third period they marched up toward the Packtrain to the big sloping field where the bridle path began , just above the golf course where they could watch several religious foursomes of officers ( and a couple giggling atheistic threesomes of officers ' wives ) all playing their morning devotional round . This field was the customary scene of a traditional lecture on cover and concealment given by Sgt Thornhill , during which lying on their bellies in the shade of the big oaks that lined the field the Company gave themselves over to the enchantments of mumblety-peg and the study of the bottoms of the officers ' wives and daughters as they bounced around the field on saddles , and during which this morning Turp Thornhill , a long stringy ferret-headed jawless man from Mississippi with 17 yrs serv , who was not a jockstrap man , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inattention . And sent him down with a noncom to the nearest track for seven more laps of the best , at high port . It was at this time that Maggio 's flare for sympathy cost him seven laps himself , when Ike Galovitch saw him make the holy mystic sign to Prew ( the one where you close the fist , extend the middle finger , and jab the air ) as Prew was leaving , and being incensed at this disrespect for discipline and justice , sent Maggio along this time too . It went on . And still on . And then further on . First one noncom then another trying his skill , as if they were all bucking to become recruit instructors to the gook draftees that were beginning to come in now from the peacetime draft . Even Champ Wilson , the lordly ring killer , the cold eyed , the always silent , the perpetually indifferent , condescended to give him a mechanical reading off during a dry-run trigger-squeeze firepower exercise , because , The Champ said , he was not distributing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to this one as he had listened to the other ones , the only thing you can do with a telling off , but now he was only half hearing what The Champ was saying . Because he was not there now . He was standing with The Champ but  | his mind was thinking of the problem . He could see it all in his mind , unfolding like a film run off the reel between the hands , each picture following the other logically and with a beginning at the one end and an ending at the other , one two three , right down the line . The only trouble was you could not see the beginning now as it was lost in all the tangled swirls of celluloid on the floor , and you could not see the ending because it was still on the turning reel . He remembered though that out of all of them the only noncoms who would not take their turn at booting this brand new ball around were Chief Choate and Old Pop Karelsen , both known openly as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances . But like the nonjockstrap Pvts they preferred to stare uncomfortably off into the middle distance . Or watch the dazzling purity of the slow moving glaciers that were the fair weather cumulus cloud formations , white mountains high above dark mountains . Well , what did you expect them to do , he thought , rise in mutiny and deliver you ? You must surely realize you are not being forced into anything , do nt you ? You are doing all of this of your own free will , you know , he told himself . Yes sir , you are that , he thought , that you are . Free will , he thought . There is free will . And then there is free love , do nt forget free love . And then also there is free  --  let me see , free what ? Free politics ! Nope , not free politics . Well , free what then ? Why , free beer , of course . Of course , free beer . Free will , free love , free beer . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thats doing this . Not them thats doing this . They are merely offering your free will a free choice . Kindly but logically , seriously but without malice , a free choice for your free will . 1 ) You can go out for boxing . 2 ) You can not go out for boxing and you can blow up and fight back ; in that case you go to the Stockade. 3 ) You can neither go out for boxing nor blow up and fight back ; in which case you can continue to suffer indefinitely this unpleasantness that hurts you because you are sensitive and an artistic bugler , instead of an artistic fighter which would have made it very simple . And , if you continue in this unpleasantness which you are free to choose and which is without malice , but which shows no promise of letting up , the logical sequence will be company punishment for inefficiency plus extra duty plus restrictions plus , eventually inevitably , the Stockade . Now if we reduce these fractions we have on the one hand , go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have go out for the Stockade.  | Since you are an artistic bugler ( instead of an artistic fighter , like The Champ here ) we can cancel out the first . So , reducing still further , we have I ) go out for the Stockade ; or , 2 ) go out for the Stockade . The choice is up to you , a rather restricted choice but nevertheless a choice , presented to your free will unemotionally logically without partisanship , and without personal malice or meanness of spirit . He would , he thought , much have preferred that they hate him , that they band together in the sacred name of Home &; Country and oppress him with the mace of Law &; Order . As , say , the Nazis do the Jews , for instance . Or as the English do the Indians . Or as the Americans do the Negroes . Then he would have been a hated human , instead of an unhated number ( # ASN 6915544 , all present and accounted for ) . But then a man cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do it to you , did you ? No , you did nt . Because you know damn well you could never have done it to one of them , having suffered as you have from an overdeveloped sense of justice all your life , not to mention being a hotly fervent espouser of the cause of all underdogs all your life ( probably because you have always been one , I imagine ) . But he had always believed in fighting for the underdog , against the top dog . He had learned it , not from The Home , or The School , or The Church , but from that fourth and other great moulder of social conscience , The Movies . From all those movies that had begun to come out when Roosevelt went in . He had been a kid back then , a kid who had not been on the bum yet , but he was raised up on all those movies that they made then , the ones that were between ' 32 and ' 37 and had not yet degenerated into commercial imitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have now . He had grown up with them , those movies like the very first Dead End , like Winterset , like Grapes of Wrath , like Dust Be My Destiny , and those other movies starring John Garfield and the Lane girls , and the on-the-bum and prison pictures starring James Cagney and George Raft and Henry Fonda . He had only been a green kid but he had learned from all those pictures to believe in fighting for the underdog , against the top dog . He had even made himself a philosophy of life out of it . So that he had gone right on , unable to stop believing that if the Communists were the under dog in Spain then he believed in fighting for the Communists in Spain ; but that if the Communists were the top dog back home in Russia and the ( what would you call them in Russia ? the traitors , I guess ) traitors were the bottom dog , then he believed in fight-  | ing for the traitors and against the Communists . He believed in fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wall Street and Hollywood . And if the Capitalists were top dog in America and the proletariat the under dog , then he believed in fighting for the proletariat against the Capitalists . This **29;785;TOOLONG philosophy of life of his had led him , a Southerner , to believe in fighting for the Negroes against the Whites everywhere , because the Negroes were nowhere the top dog , at least as yet . It must be a great temptation though , he thought , being top dog . Of course you do nt know . You have never been one . But you can imagine how it would be . All you have to do is imagine you are an officer . You can imagine that . It was , he realized , a very flighty philosophy , a chameleon philosophy always changing its color . You were a Communist one day and the next day you were an anti-Communist . But then this was a very flighty age , a chameleon age in which the chameleon lived perpetually upon a bright Scotch plaid . So that so what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And maybe this minute cry over downtrodden Jews and the next minute cry against sadistic Jews ? So what ? It is a very irrational and emotional philosophy . Well , this is a very irrational and emotional age . I think that your philosophy puts you right in step with life in these United States and life in this disunited world . But where , you ask , does it put you politically ? What are your pol-itics ? I think we can dispense with that question , he told himself . It is a wrong question , one that implies you have to have some kind of politics , and is therefore an unfair question because it restricts your answer to what kind of politics . It is the kind of question a Republican or a Democrat or a Communist would ask you . And anyway , you cant vote , you are in the Army , they wouldnt be interested in you . Yes , I think we can reject that question . But if we had to answer it , truthfully , under oath ( let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called you up because you refused to go out for boxing ) , then I would say that politically you are a sort of super arch-revolutionary , the kind that made the Revolution in Russia and that the Communists are killing now , a sort of perfect criminal type , very dangerous , a mad dog that loves under dogs . Thats what I would say you were . But you better not tell that to anybody unless you have to , Prewitt They 'll put you in the nut ward . Because here in America , he thought ,  | everybody fights to become top dog , and then to stay top dog . And maybe , just maybe , that is why the under dogs that get to be top dogs and there is nothing left for them to fight for , wither up and die or else get fat and wheeze and die . Because they no longer got anything to fight for but to stay top dog , to keep what they already got . All of which , Prewitt , does not do you a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel a little better  --  since the way things look now it is very unlikely that you will ever get to be top dog and have to worry about getting fat and wheezing . If you were worrying about getting fat and wheezing , all this doubletiming that is sweating you like a nigger at election would ease your mind of that . Maybe they are doing you a favor and do not know it . Well , do nt tell them , thats all . Do nt ever let them know it . What a business . You go along trying to mind your business and be yourself and bother nobody and look what happens to you . Yes , look what happens . You get mired in up to your ass in something . Grown men , seriously pushing each other around , over the burning question of whether or not a certain man should or should not go out for a boxing squad . It seemed so silly , suddenly , that it was hard to believe that absolutely serious results for you could ever come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would come out of it for him . You cant disagree with the adopted values of a bunch of people without they get pissed off at you . When people tie their lives to some screwy idea or other and you attempt to point out to them that for you ( not for them , mind you , just for you personally ) that this idea is screwy , then serious results can always and will always come out of it for you . Because as far as they care you are the same as saying their lives are nothing and this always bothers people , because people prefer anything to being nothing , look at the Nazis , and that is why they tie their lives to things . Why do nt you , he thought , tie your life to something , Prewitt ? To a tree , perhaps . It would save us all a lot of trouble and discomfort . A sort of sullen stubbornness of dull rebellion began to rise up in him . He had plans for Payday , and this very serious foolishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it for him on Payday . All right . If they want to play , well we will play . Hate they like , hate they will get . We can hate as well as the next one . We were pretty good at it once , in our youth . We can bruise and burn and maim and kill and torture , and call it kindliness and thoughtful discipline , just as subtly and intangibly as the next one . We can play the game of hates  | and call it free enterprise of competition between individual initiatives too . That was the only way to handle this . We will hate , and we will be the perfect soldier . We will hate , and we will obey every order perfectly and to the letter . We will hate , and we will not talk back . We will not break a single rule . We will not make a single mistake . We will only hate . Then let them take it and carry it from there . They will have to search hard to find any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullen hatefully to that role the rest of the morning . And it worked . They were puzzled . They were perplexed . They were obviously deeply hurt because he hated them , and because he was so perfect as a soldier . Some of them even got angry at him ; he had no right to react like that . He was like a damnfool bulldog that has got his teeth into a man simply because the man has beat him , and can not be swung loose or kicked loose or pulled loose or beaten loose but only made to let go by the cutting of his jaw muscles , which in this case happened to be illegal . He grinned to himself , tautly and ecstatically , because he knew he had them where it hurt , and because he knew now for sure they could not do him in by Payday , and because for a moment he had wild visions that maybe this might even cure them , next time , and continued to hang on , his only dim hope of any relief at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as it turned out he got no relief then either . As it turned out , at fatigue , he not only lost the lead he had gained at drill , he went in the hole . It was his own fault . He was on Ike Galovitch 's home labor detail . He had had for a long time now the habit of hanging around in the barracks until the last minute before falling out for fatigue . This was so that he would be on the very end of the line , in order to circumvent The Warden 's little game of Break It Oft In Prewitt . The last half , or last third , of the Company  --  depending on the daily demands for fatigue labor that came down from Regiment  --  was always put to some job of policing in the Company Area and Ike Galovitch , by a standing order to The Warden from Capt Holmes , always had charge of this home use labor section . If Prew was on the end of the line , it was as if he were off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with this . He would never get the cushy details , like the Officer 's Club detail or the golf course detail , but neither would he get the trash truck or the butcher shop . The Warden could easily have simply reversed the order of the Company and started with the other end , or if he wanted , just have held the worse detail back until the very last , after  | partitioning off Ike 's labor for home use . But he had learned that Warden would not do that , that that old private line of equity , drawn with such sharpness and with such close secrecy that it was wholely invisible to everyone but Warden , would not let the big man take advantage of the situation in that way . Every time Prew would forget and fall in with the first half The Warden would be right there waiting savagely joyously with the worst detail the day 's crop offered , but as long as Prew was at the other end he was safe . It was , Prew often thought , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which applied to all other games of sport  --  that laying down of certain arbitrary rules to make success that much harder for the player to attain , like clipping in football or traveling in basketball , or in the same way , as he had read someplace , that sporting fishermen would use the light six-nine tackle in fishing for sailfish instead of the heavy tackle that makes it easy for the novice , thereby imposing upon themselves voluntarily the harder conditions that made the reward worth more to them . But where the fishermen only did it on their days off or on vacation , to gain some obscure satisfaction that the cut-throat business ethics of their lives no longer gave them , The Warden applied it to his whole life , and stuck by it . Prew knew he stuck by it because , after figuring it out , he had at times , when he felt in the mood , accepted the gambit and played the game by falling in at the head and trying to outwit Warden into giving him an easy detail , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made it a point of giving him the Officers ' Club detail for the whole next week , as if penalizing himself , with as great a relish as when he penalized Prewitt . It was fun , and it broke up the monotony of living , and there was a closeness between him and The Warden , an understanding , tacit , never spoken of , but closer and stronger than even what he felt for Maggio . And whenever he did not feel like playing he would fall in at the end and Warden would not touch him . It was like King 's X in tag as a kid , except here it was not abused , it was honored . ( Maybe that was what it was about The Warden : honor ; yet Maggio had honor too , and was with him more often and had done more for him , than Warden , yet there was not as warm a closeness , not as great a love . ) He did not understand it , but on this day he did not feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Old Ike lined his detail up and called them to attention as the other details scattered , marching off across the quad , the feet scuffing reluctantly and the shoulders sagging wearily as they dragged the heavy , food-full , nap-hungry bellies off to work .  | " Now tooday , " Ike told his boys , his long lippy ape 's jaw thrust out commandingly at them , " we are going da inside of dis barricks to clean up . Hupstairs and donstairs all the windows wash and polishing . An of da dayroom an poolroom and CQ 's corridor da walls to scrub . Da Gomny Gmandr will inspect tomorrow all of it so you want to do it right and none of the goldbricking I want to see . Hokay . Hany queshuns ? " All of them had done this same job at least five times before . There were no questions . " Dan coun hog ! " Ike bawled , raising his chest proudly like a bellows to make room for his close order voice . " Da ones hupstairs and donstairs da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They counted off . Prewitt and Maggio , who had deliberately fallen in one man apart , were both twos . The ones started for the supply room to get their rags and bars of sandsoap in the yellow wrappers labelled Bon Ami under the picture of the cuddly little fluffy chick that always outraged all of them with an unspeakable affront because as soldiers their lives had become such a close alliance with the grit of sandsoap . Sgt Lindsay , a fair-to-middling bantamweight , had charge of the ones . The twos started for the kitchen for the GI soap and brushes . Corp Miller , a worse-than-mediocre lightweight and Champ Wilson 's running mate , had charge of the twos . " Hey you , " Ike bawled . " You Prewitt Maggio . To me here come , wise guys . How you men both twos are ? " " You counted us off , Ike , " Angelo said . " You think a fast one can over Old Ike pull ? " Ike said , glaring at them suspiciously out of the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the wool you can not stretch . I ham separating you two men together . You Maggio go hupstairs the ones wit . Tell Sargint Lindsay to Treadwell send back down the twos wit . Dis a fatigue , not no hold ladies sewing circle or vacation . In charge am I of dis detail and I work want not loafing . See ? " " I 'll see you later , " Angelo said disgustedly . " Okay , " Prew said , with the unruffled equanimity of the perfect soldier . " Hokay , " Ike bawled . " Move . Not all day . You Prewitt go back the twos wit and do nt sometime figur on getting by with from me , see ? I be around all time keep eye on you , see ? You ai nt so tough smart guy as maybe think . " Ike was as good as his word . He made his headquarters in the corridor hallway where the twos had set up the one-by-eight on the two  | stepladders they used for scaffolding , and where Prew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , then kneeling on the floor , washing down swath after swath of the pebbly plaster wall from floor to ceiling . " Dis a fatigue , not vacation , Prewitt , " Ike informed him , grinning wolfishly with the long sallow ape 's jaw , from time to time . " I got my eye on you . " And he had . When Prew climbed down to rinse his rag , when he went outside to change the water in his bucket , when he turned around to resoap his GI brush  --  Old Ike would be there in front of him , watching suspiciously hopefully with the little sharp eyes in the sanguine bullethead like red buttons reflecting firelight on a lumberjack 's plaid shirt . ? " Dis a fatigue , not vacation , Prewitt . " But Ike 's hopes were groundless . Prew had been having a lot worse than that all morning , and had weathered it by playing perfect soldier . Ike 's efforts were almost pathetic , compared to the imaginative variety that , say , Dhom could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get under his skin , not the sharp smell of the dirty soapy water , nor his own white water-wrinkled fingers , nor the stale cracker smell of the wet wall plaster . It was not , strangely , until Capt Dynamite Holmes came bouncing in from across the quad , freshly showered , shaved , shampooed , and shined , his big boots gleaming  --  it was not till then that all these things suddenly got under Prewitt 's skin . " Hello there , Sergeant Galovitch , " Holmes grinned , stopping in the doorway . " Atten HUT , " Ike bawled , making two distinct words of it , and bracing his bigfooted longarmed missinglink 's body into an arch-backed travesty of it proudly . The men went on working . " Everything under control , Sergeant ? " Holmes said fondly . " Are you getting this place slicked up for me tomorrow ? " " Yes , Serr , " Ike grunted , uncomfortably because still bracing solidly , his thumbs along the seams of his trousers , somewhere down around his knees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomny Gmandr saying . " " Good , " Holmes grinned fondly . " Fine . " Still grinning fondly , he stepped over to inspect the wall , and nodded . " Looks fine , Sergeant Galovitch , A-i . Keep up the good work . " " Yes , Serr , " Ike grunted worshipfully , still bracing . The narrow shouldered barrel ape 's chest expanded out until it looked about to burst and  | Ike saluted , stiffly , grotesquely , looking as if the hand would knock his eye clear out . " Well , " Holmes grinned fondly . " Carry on then , Sergeant . " He went on into the orderly room grinning and Old Ike bawled " Atten HUT " again , making it two words again , and the men still went on working . Prew went on rubbing his rag over the pebbly plaster he had just washed and that suddenly sickened him now , feeling his jaws tighten reasonlessly . He felt as if he had just witnessed the sodomitic seduction of a virgin brunser who had liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike hollered proudly , moving slabfooted up and down behind them . " You men I want on the ball to get , see ? Just begause da Gomny Gmandr comes around is to stop working no escuse . Dis a fatigue , not vacation . " The men still went on working , wearily ignoring this new outburst because they had been expecting it , as they wearily ignored the other outbursts , and Prew went with them , suddenly suffocating in the wet plaster smell and enveloped him . He wished he had a pair of bright and shining boots . " You Prewitt , " Ike hollered angrily , not finding anything else to criticize . " Lets looking a life . Dis a fatigue , not vacation for a seminaries of lady . I got to tell you all ready times too many . Now looking a life . " If Ike had not mentioned him by name , with Holmes in there listening taking it all in , he could still have stomached it . But quite suddenly the words were beating against his ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake his head to clear it . " What the hell do you want , me to grow a couple more arms for Chrisake ? " he said violently suddenly , hearing his own voice outhollering Ike 's astoundedly , yet seeing in his mind the Great God Holmes sitting grinning at his desk listening relishingly to his favorite sergeant . For once maybe The Man might like to hear what his men thought of his favorite sergeant , for a change . " How ? " Ike said flabbergastedly . " What ? " " Yas , what , " Prew sneered . " You want this job done so perfect and so fast why do nt you grab a bush yourself ? Instead of standing around giving orders nobody listens to . " The men stopped mechanically washing and all stared at him , just as mechanically , and he looked at them , the rage filling him , now knowing why . He knew it was senseless , absolutely senseless , even dangerous , but for a moment he was wildly proud . " Now listen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you giv-  | ing me do I not want . To work get back on the lip shut button . " " Oh blow it out your ass , " he said savagely , still mechanically scrubbing with his rag , " I 'm working . What do you think , I 'm floggin my doggin ? " " What , " Ike gasped . " What . " " AT EASE ! " roared Capt Holmes , appearing in the door . " What the hell is all this racket , Prewitt ? " " Yes , Serr , " Ike grunted , popping to attention . " Dis man bolshevik da back talk is giving to a noncom . " " Whats the matter with you , Prewitt ? " Capt Holmes said sternly , ignoring the momentarily shattered illusion of his favorite sergeant . " You know better than to talk back to a noncommissioned officer , and in that tone of voice . " " To a noncom , yes , Sir , " Prew grinned savagely , aware now of the watching eight wide pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pissed on , Sir . Even by a noncommissioned officer , " he said , twisting the phrase . The Warden appeared in the door behind Holmes and stood looking at all of them , his eyes narrowed thoughtfully , himself aloof from it . Holmes looked as if someone had dashed a glass of ice water in his face absolutely without reason . His brows were up with disbelief and his eyes were wide with hurt and his mouth was open with surprise . When he spoke his voice quivered openly with both rage and start . " Private Prewitt , I think you owe both Sergeant Galovitch and myself an apology . " He paused and waited . Prew did not answer . He felt a shrinking in his belly at the thought of what this stupidity would do to his chances Payday , wondering what in hell had possessed him to do a thing like that . " Well ? " Holmes said authoritatively . He was as surprised by it as any of them , as surprised as Prewitt even , and had said the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He had to back ii up . " Apologize , Prewitt . " " I do nt think I owe anybody any apology , " Prew said savagely doggedly . " In fact , if apologies are in order , I think they 're owed to me , " he went on recklessly , wanting suddenly to laugh at the comedy of it , like a mother chastening a child to bring it back in line . But then thats the way they always treat us , isnt it ? " What ! " Holmes said . It had not occurred to him that an EM could refuse . He was as much at a loss now as Old Ike had been before and his eyes that had become almost normal size now got wider even than before . He looked at Galovitch , as if for help , then he turned and  | looked at Warden behind him , then he turned and looked vaguely out the corridor doorway . Corporal Paluso , a second-string Regimental tackle with a big flat murderous face that he tried to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who had not missed a chance to work on Prew at drill all morning , was sitting on one of the backless chairs out on the porch and had turned and looked inside , his hard eyes in the murderous face as wide now as any of the others , as wide as Holmes 's . " Corporal Paluso , " Holmes roared , in his battalion close order voice , which was the best in the Regiment . " Yes , Sir , " Paluso said , and jumped up as if stabbed . " Take this man upstairs and have him roll a full field pack , a complete full field , extra shoes helmet and all , and then take a bicycle and hike him up to Kolekole Pass and back . And see that he hikes all the way . And when he gets back , bring him to me . " It was a pretty long speech for his battalion close order voice that had been developed more for short commands . " Yes , Sir , " Paluso said . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoard without a word . The Warden turned around and disgustedly went back inside . Paluso led him to the stairs and a still-shocked silence reached out after them from the corridor like a cloud . Prew bit his lips . He got his envelope roll out of the wall locker and the- combat pack off the bed foot . He laid them on the floor and opened the light pack . Everyone in the squadroom sat up and watched him silently and speculatively , as they might watch a sick horse upon whose time to die they had gotten up a pool . " Do nt forget the shoes , " Paluso said apologetically , in the voice one uses in the presence of a corpse . He got them off the rack under the footlocker and had to unroll the roll to put them in and then build the whole thing up from scratch in the deadness of the silence . " Do nt forget the helmet , " Paluso said apologetically . He hung it under the snap of the meat can carrier , and picked the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and went to get his rifle from the racks , wanting only to get out of this sad , shocked silence . " Wait 'll I get a bike , " Paluso said apologetically , as they came down the stairs . He stood in the grass and waited . The sixty-five or seventy pounds of pack dragged at his back , already starting to cut in on the circula-  | tion of his arms . It was just about five miles to the top of the pass . In the corridor the great silence still reigned . " Okay , " Paluso said , using his clipped official voice because they were downstairs now . " Lets shove . " He slung his rifle and they went out the truck entrance , still followed by the silence . Outside of the quad the rest of the Post moved busily , just as if there had not been a cataclysm . They passed Theater #1 , on past the Post gym , past the Regimental drill field , and went on up the road , into the sun , Paluso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the slowness of the pace . " You want a cigaret ? " Paluso offered apologetically . Prew shook his head . " Go ahead and have one . Hell , " Paluso said , " theres no reason to be mad at me . I do nt like this any better than you do . " " I ai nt mad at you . " " Then have a cigaret . " " Okay . " He took a cigaret . Paluso , looking relieved , started off ahead on the bike . He cut capers on it and looked back grinning with the big murderous face , trying to make him laugh . Prew grinned weakly for him . Paluso gave it up and settled down to the monotony , wobbling along beside him . Then he had another idea . He rode off a hundred yards ahead and then circled back , riding fast , a hundred yards behind , waving as he went by , and then circled back up , pumping as hard as his legs would go , to skid the brakes and slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked a while . They passed the golf course , went on past the officers ' bridle path , past the Packtrain , past the gas chamber , last outpost of the Reservation , and Prew plodded on concentrating on the old hiking rhythm , swing up and drop , swing up and drop , using only the thigh muscles on the upswing , not using the calf or ankle or foot muscles at all but letting the feet hit willy-nilly , the body 's momentum carrying it forward as the thigh muscles tensed for the next swing up , that he had learned from the old timers at Myer a long time ago . Hell , he could do ten miles standing on his head carrying two packs , he cursed , as the sweat began to run in bigger rivulets down his spine and legs and drip from under his arms and down in his eyes off his face . When they reached the last steep rise that curved left up to the top of the pass , Paluso stopped and got off his bike . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go up to the rest . He 'll never know it anyway . "  | " To hell with him , " Prew said grimly , plodding on . " He said the pass . The pass it is . " He looked over at the Stockade rock quarry cut back into the side of the hill on the right of the curve . Thats where you 'll be tomorrow this time . All right . So fine . Fuck em all but six and save them for the pallbearers . " Whats the matter with you ? " Paluso said angrily dumbfoundly . " You 're crazy . " " Sure , " he called back . " I ai nt going to walk this bike up there , " Paluso said . " I 'll wait on you here . " The prisoners , working in the heavy dust with the big white capital P on the backs of their blue jackets standing out like targets , whooped at the two of them , razzing about the extra duty and the hard life of the Army . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and put them back to work . Paluso waited , smoking disgustedly , at the bottom of the rise and he climbed it doggedly by himself , sweating heavier now on the steeper rise , until at the top the big never-flagging breeze hit him and chilled him and he could look down the steep-dropping snake of road , dropping way down , at least a thousand feet , among the great sharp lava crags , down to Waianae where they had gone last September , where they went every September , for the machinegun training that he liked , fitting the heavy link-curling web belts of identical clinking cartridges every fifth one painted red into the block and touching the trigger lightly between thumb and forefinger and feeling the pistol grip buck against your hand as the belts bobbed through , firing off across the empty western water at the towed targets , the tracers making flat meteor flights of light in the night firing . He breathed some of the stiffness of the breeze . Then he turned around and went hack down , the wind dying suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the barracks his jacket and his pants down to his knees were soaked clear through . Paluso said , " Wait here , " and went in to report and Capt Holmes came back out with him , and he unslung his rifle and came to attention and rendered a smart rifle salute . " Well , " Holmes said deeply , humorously . Sharp lines of lenient humor cut indulgent planes and angles in the handsome aquiline face . " Do you still feel you need to offer advice to the noncoms about how to manage details , Prewitt ? " Prew did not answer . In the first place , he had not expected humor , even indulgent humor , and inside in the corridor they were still scrub-  | bing down the walls , exactly as they had two hours ago , and they looked very safe and secure in their weary bored monotony . " Then I take it , " Holmes said humorously , " that you are ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch and myself now , are nt you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he have to say that ? why couldnt he just have left it ? why did he have to demand it all ? couldnt he see what he was doing , how impossible that was . Paluso made a startled noise behind him that was followed by a very guilty silence . Holmes 's eyes only widened imperceptibly , he had better control this time , he knew more what to expect . The indulgent planes and angles of his face shifted , subtly and were neither humorous nor indulgent any more . Holmes jerked his head at the pass . " Take him back up there again , Paluso . He has nt had enough yet . " " Yes , Sir , " Paluso said , letting go of the handlebars with one hand to salute . " We 'll see how he answers next time , " Holmes said narrowly . The red was beginning to mount in his face again . " I do nt have a thing planned for all night tonight , " he added . " Yes , Sir , " Paluso said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed him again , feeling bottomlessly sick inside , and feeling tired , feeling very tired . " Goddam , " Paluso protested , as soon as they were out of sight , " you 're nuts . Plain crazy . Do nt you know you 're ony cuttin your own throat ? If you do nt give a damn about yourself , at least think about me . My legs is gettin tard , " he grinned apologetically . Prew did not even manage a weak grin this time . He knew that , if there had been any chance within the indulgent humor , it was gone now , that this was it , this was how you went to the Stockade . He hiked the ten miles carrying the sixty-five or seventy pounds of pack with that knowledge making an added weight inside of him . What he did not know was what had happened in the orderly room to put Holmes in the indulgent mood , nor what happened this time , the second time . The Man 's face was congested a brick red when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceal in front of Prewitt backing up now like a flood behind a bridge . " You and your bright ideas of leadership , " he raged at Warden . " You and your brilliant ideas of how to handle bolsheviks . " Warden was still standing by the window . He had watched all of it . Now he turned around , wishing The Mouth , or would you say The  | Sword , The Flaming Sword , would step outside to talk to Ike , so The Warden could open up the file cabinet and get a drink . " Sergeant Warden , " The Man said thickly , " I want you to prepare court martial papers for Prewitt . Insubordination and refusing a direct order of an officer . 1 want them now . " " Yes , Sir , " The Warden said . " I want them to go in to Regiment this afternoon , " The Man said . " Yes , Sir , " The Warden said . He went to the blank forms file , where the useless bottle was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forms and shut the drawer on the bottle and took the papers to the typewriter . " You cant he decent to a man like that , " The Man said thickly . " He has been a troublemaker ever since he hit this outfit . Its time he had a lesson . They tame the lions in the Army , not appease them . " " You want it recommended for a Summary ? or a Special , " The Warden said indifferently . " Special , " The Man said . His face got redder . " I 'd like to make it a goddamned General . I would , if I could . You and your bright ideas . " " Its nothing to me , " The Warden shrugged , beginning to type . " All I said was , we 've had three court martials in the last six weeks and it might not look so good on the records . " " Then to hell with the records , " The Man almost , but not quite , shouted . It was the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned back and stared broodingly at the door into the corridor that he had carefully closed . " Thais all right with me , " The Warden said , still typing . The Man did not appear to hear , but The Warden , typing , still watched him , gauging carefully , making sure it was the peak . You could not handle this time like the last time . This was stronger . This was the last time squared , and you would have to square the strength of your approach , and then if you waited till the other 's peak was past , then logically you would have it made , but was it worth it ? Hell no , it wasnt worth it , not when you might crimp your own concatenation , what was it to you if some damned son of a bitching stupid fool of an antediluvian got himself beheaded by a progressive world by going around in a dream world and trying to live up to a romantic , backward ideal of individual integrity ? You could go doing things for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was never worth it , but it would really be a feather in your cap if you could pull it off again now , this time . That would be worth a try , just for the hell of it . If he was doing this , it was not because it was his responsibility to knock himself  | out taking care of headless chickens who refuse to become modern and grow a head , it was just for the fun of seeing if he could pull it off , not for no stupid ass who still believed in probity . " Too bad you got to lose a welterweight like that , " The Warden said indifferently , after The Man had brooded on the door a while in silence . He took the sheets out of the machine and began to rearrange the carbons for the second page . " What ? " The Man said , looking up . " What do you mean ? " " Well , he 'll still be in hock when Compny Smokers comes up , wont he ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smokers , " The Man said . " All right , " he said . " Make it a Summary then . " " But I already got this typed up , " The Warden said . " Then change it , Sergeant , " The Man said . " Would you let your laziness make a difference of five months in the Stockade to a man ? " " Jesus Christ , " The Warden said . He tore the papers up and went to get some blank ones . " These Kentucky mountain hardheads cause a man more trouble than a regiment of niggers . Might as well leave it as a Special for all the good a break will do a man like that . " " He needs to be taught a lesson , " said The Man . " He sure as hell does , " The Warden said fervently . " The only trouble with them guys , they never learn . I 've seen too many of them go into the hockshop , and all they make is work . They ai nt out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had rather let you kill them , than admit they 're wrong . No more sense than a goddam GI mule . About the time you get him groomed up for Regimental next December , he 'll pull some hair brained deal and get himself right back in hock , just to get even with you . I seen too many of them mountain boys . They 're a threat to the freedom of this whole country . " " I do nt give a goddam what he does , " The Man yelled , sitting up . " Fuck the Regimentals , and fuck the fucking championship . I do nt have to stand for insolence like that . I do nt have to take it . I 'm an officer in this Army , not a boiler orderly . " The red outrage of affront was back in his face . He glared at The Warden . The Warden waited , timing it exactly to the color in the face , before he empathetically told The Man what The Man was thinking . " You do nt mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in horror . " You 're just mad . You wouldnt say a thing like that , if you werent mad . You do nt want to take a chance on losing your championship next winter , just for being mad . " " Mad ! " The Man said . " Mad ? Mad , he says . Jesus H Christ , Ser-  | geant ! " He rubbed his hands over his face , tentatively feeling of the congestion . " All right , " he said . " I guess you 're right . Theres no sense in losing your head and going off half cocked and cutting off your nose to spite your face . Maybe he did nt even mean any disrespect at all . " The Man sighed . " Have you started on those new forms yet ? " " Not vet , Sir , " The Warden said . " Then put them back , " said The Man . " I guess . " " Well at least give him a good stiff company punishment , " The Warden said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wasnt the boxing coach of this outfit , I 'd give him something , " he said . " He 's getting off damned easy . Okay , you enter it in the Company Punishment Book , will you ? Three weeks restriction to quarters . I 'm going home now . Home , " he said , as if to himself . " Call him in tomorrow and I 'll talk to him and initial the book . " " All right , Sir , " The Warden said . " If you think thats the way to handle it . " He got the stiff leather-bound Company Punishment Book out of his desk and opened it up and got his pen . The Man smiled at him wearily and left , and he closed the book and put it away again and stepped to the window to watch the Captain cross the quad through the lengthening evening shadows , going home . In a way he almost felt sorry for him , any more . But then he asked for everything he got . The next day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it . Then he discovered the page was still blank . Shamefacedly he explained how he had had to do some other things . He had forgotten it . The Man was on his way to the Club , he was in a hurry . He told The Warden to have it ready for him tomorrow . " Yes , Sir , " The Warden told him . " I 'll do it right away . " He got his pen out . The Man left . He put his pen away . The next day even Holmes had forgotten all about it , under the stress of more recent things . It was not , The Warden considered carefully , that he gave a good goddam whether the punk got three weeks ' restrictions or not . The fact was , three weeks ' restriction would probably do Prewitt some good . Especially since , as Stark had told him , the kid had gone dippy over this snooty whore at Mrs Kipfer 's . Three weeks at home for Prewitt would be just about long enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had posed this condition on himself that he get Prewitt off scot free or it did not count . He did not feel sorry for him . Prewitt asked for everything he got . Falling for a hard nosed whore at Mrs Kipfer 's . That was just about that punk 's goddam speed . Prewitt  | not only asked for everything he got , he begged for it on bended knee . The Warden snorted disagreeably . Prewitt was relieved to find Holmes was not around when they got back the second time . Paluso was relieved too . He released Prewitt quickly and took off for the PX , to be out of sight . Neither one of them understood that it was over . Prew limped upstairs and unmade the pack and put the stuff away and showered and changed to clean clothes and stretched out on his bunk , and waited for the OD or the Sergeant of the Guard . When they had not come for him by chowtime , he knew then they were not coming . He had been waiting for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew something had interposed itself between himself and fate . The only possible answer was The Warden , who had seen fit to take a hand for one of those obscure screwy reasons of his own . I do nt know what the hell business it is of his , he thought angrily , as he limped downstairs for chow . Why cant he keep his big nose out of things ? After chow , he stretched out on his bunk again , laying the tiredness of his legs out heavily on the blankets . That was when Maggio came over and congratulated him . " Man , I 'm proud of you , " said Angelo . " I ony wish I had of been there to see it . Thats all . If it wasnt for that son of a English-butchering bitch Galovitch , I would of been there too . But I 'm still proud of you , man . just the same . " " Yeah , " Prew said wearily . He was still trying to grasp where he had got off . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty Payday , which he still might get , he had also given the best opportunity they could have asked for to send him to the Stockade , express . In spite of all the great resolutions about being the perfect soldier and the high plans to make them do all the work . And this , mind you , he told himself , not after a month , not after a week , not even after two days of The Treatment  --  but on the afternoon of the very first day . It was not , he realized , going to be as easy as it looked . There were apparently hidden subleties to The Treatment . Apparently it had been devised to gear itself to human nature more cunningly than he had suspected . And he had either woefully underestimated their ability to apply it , or else which was worse , grossly overestimated his own strength of will to fight it . The Treatment , apparently , concentrated all its power on a man 's strongest point  --  his pride in himself as a man . Could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , a kind of terror at his own utter inadequacy over-  | whelmed him , overwhelmed even the fe , r he had of the Stockade when he was not keeping himself pumped full of outrage . He fell out for drill next day a sadder but a wiser man . He had given up entirely the idea of curing them or teaching them a lesson . He no longer hoped for or expected instantaneous victory . When The Treatment started right where it had left off yesterday , and he went right back into the role of perfect soldier , he was only fighting a holding action , and under the slow smouldering silence of the self-generated hate that was his one defense was only the thought of Lorene and Payday , warming through him like a good stiff drink , a fire at which he could warm himself against this heat of hatred that was slowly freezing him . CHAPTER 20 You knock off drill at ten o'clock on Payday . You shower , shave , brush your teeth again , dress carefully in your best inspection uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , dressed , you work hard on your fingernails before you finally go outside to stand around in the sun in the company yard and wait for them to begin the paying off , being very careful all the time of the knot in the tie and of the fingernails , since all company paying officers have their little idiosyncrasies of personal inspection even if Payday is not a regular inspection day . With some it was the shoes , with others the crease of the pants , with others the haircut . With Capt Holmes it was the knot in the tie and the fingernails and while if these did not satisfy him he did not redline you or anything like that , still you got a rigorous telling off and had to fall out to the end of the line . You stand around in little groups on Payday and talk about it excitedly and about the half holiday it is , groups that cant stay still and break up and reform with parts of other groups into new groups , continually shifting , not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are already waiting like vultures at the kitchen door where you must emerge . Until then finally you see the guard bugler go up to the megaphone in the quad in the brilliant morning sunshine ( more brilliant , oddly , than on any other morning ) and sound Pay Call . " Pay day , " the bugle says to you , " pay day . What you go na do with a drunk en sol jer ? Pay day ? " " Pay day , " the bugle answers you , " pay day . Put him in the guard house till he 's so ber . Pay day . P-a-y . . d-a-y. "  | Then the shifting excitement grows much stronger ( oh , the bugler plays a responsible part , a traditional , emotional , important part , a part heavy with the past , with all the past centuries of soldiering ) and you see The Warden carrying a GI blanket from the orderly room to the messhall and Mazzioli following him with the Payroll like a lord chamberlain carrying the Great Seal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficently . It takes them quite a while to get set up , move the tables , spread the blanket , count the silver out and lay the greenbacks out in sheaves , get the jawbone list of PX checks and show checks ready for The Warden to collect , but already you begin to form the line , by rank , noncoms first , then Pfcs and Pvts in one group together , the men within each group lining up for once without argument or pushing , alphabetically . Then , finally , they begin to pay and you can see the line moving very slowly up ahead of you , until you stand in the doorway of the dim rnesshall yourself while the man in front of you gets paid , until they call your last name and you answer with your first name , middle initial and serial number and step up to Dynamite and salute , standing stiffly while he looks you over and you show your fingernails and he , satisfied , pays you off , tossing you one of his pat jokes like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do nt drink all this up in one place . " Oh , he is a soldier , Dynamite , a soldier of the old school , Dynamite . And then holding this money ( less laundry , less insurance , less allotment if any , less the $r to the Company Fund ) that it took you all month to earn and that they are giving you the rest of this day off to spend , you move down the long blanket covered table to The Warden who collects for PX checks and show checks you have drawn during the month and that you really did not mean to draw at all ( promised yourself , last Payday , you would not draw , this month ) but drew somehow anyway when they came out on the loth and the 20th . Then out through the kitchen to the porch where the heavy capital of the financial wizards of twenty per cent men like Jim O'Hayer and Turp Thornhill and , to a lesser extent that is really only a hobby , Champ Wilson , takes its toll also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasion , even the feud between you and the jockstraps is in eclipse when its Payday . In the long , low ceilinged shadiness of the squadroom with the sun very bright outside men are stripping off the suntans feverishly and pulling on the civilians and you know there will not be very many for chow this noon , practically none tonight except for losing gamblers . Out of his $30.00 , after the debts were paid , Prew had exactly $12.00  | and two dimes . This , which would not even buy Lorene for one all night session , he blessed and genuflected over and took over to O'Hayer 's . The sheds , across the street from the dayroom and jerrybuilt on the strip of worn near-bald earth between the street and the narrow gauge Post railroad , were already going full blast . The quarter-ton maintenance trucks had been moved to the regimental motor park , the big spools of phone wire were neatly stacked outside , the . Vmm anti-tank guns ( some the old short-barrelled steel-wheeled that were familiar , some the new long-barreled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German arms in Life Magazine ) had been rolled out and covered up with tarps , and the spielers hired for a buck an hour called unceasingly like circus barkers from before each shed to " Come inside , boys . Poker , blackjack , craps , chuckaluck , all insidc . Test that luck , boys . " In O'Hayer 's all five lima-bean-shaped blackjack tables were working full capacity . Under the green shaded lights green visored dealers called the cards in monotonous low voices against the hum . Both dice tables were crowded three deep with players , and the three poker tables that were dealing only stud today to take care of more players had no seats open . Standing in the door he thought how by the middle of the month all this money would have sifted down into the hands of a few heavy winners who would be at this table where O'Hayer sat playing now , one of his hired help dealing . They would be winners from all over , from as far away as Hickam and Fort Kam and Shafter and Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Inland Post , if not on the whole Rock . The thought made his belly flutter , how he might with luck be one of them . He had done it once before , but only once , at Myer . And the resolution to win just enough for town and quit grew dim and wavered and , but for his stiff determination bolstered by the picture of Lorene , would have fled entirely . He worked methodically with small bets for two hours at a blackjack table ( deliberately monotonously , deliberately uninspired ) to run his twelve bucks up to the twenty which was the take-out at the poker tables . Then he moved over to the one where O'Hayer was to wait for an open seat , which would never be long on Payday when most of the players were just small fry like himself with a table stake wanting to bite into the big boys ' capital . They were constantly going broke and dropping out . He waited without excitement , promising himself faithfully that if he won two hands he 'd quit , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tonight with enough left over for a good weekend ( today was Thursday ) or Saturday night and Sunday night ( and maybe Sunday day , if she said okay , maybe at the beach with her ) with Lorene . Just two wins . He had it all figured out . The round green felt with a bite cut out for the dealer 's seat was strewn with piles of halfdollars and cartwheels and the red plastic two-bit chips for ante-ing . They caught and threw back sardonically the greenglass-shaded light , vividly red and silver against the soft lightabsorbing felt . He could see The Warden and Stark among the players . Jim O'Hayer sat relaxed with a rakish , expensive green visor cocked over the coldly rigidly mathematical eyes , constantly rolling two cartwheels one over the other with a click that ate into the nerves . It was Stark , his hat tipped low over his eyes , who finally pushed back his four legged mess stool and gave himself the coup de grace : " Seat open . " " You ai nt quittin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stark said , looking at him reflectively . " Just till I borry some money . " " See you then , " O'Hayer grinned . " Good luck with it . " " Well now thank you , Jim , " Stark said . Stark , some kibitzer whispered , had in the last hour dropped the whole $600 he had managed to build up since ten o'clock . Stark stared at him and he subsided , and Stark elbowed slowly out through the press , still looking reflective . Prew slid onto the empty $600 seat wondering darkly if this was an omen and pushed his little ten and two fives over to the dealer as unobtrusively as possible . The money boys kept the takeout low on Payday , so you could get in , but they stared at your twenty bucks contemptuously , when you did . He got back a stack of 15 cartwheels , 6 halves , and 8 of the plastic chips and fingering them did not any longer mind the contempt because the old familiar alchemy , the best drug of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipped a red chip in there with the others . His heart was beating faster with louder , more emphatic thumps , echoing in his ears . The gambler 's flush was spreading across his face , making it feverish . The bottom of his belly dropped away from under him leaving him standing on the edge of which the world stopped moving . Here , he thought , just here , and only here , held in these pieces of pasteboard being tossed facedown around the table , governed by whatever Laws or fickle Goddess moved them , here lay infinity and the secret of all life and death , what the scientists were seeking , here under  | your hand if you could only grasp it , penetrate the unreadability . You may shortly win $i000 . You may more shortly be completely broke . And any man who could just only learn to understand the reason why would be shaking hands with God . They were playing table stakes and in front of the winners lay thick piles of greenbacks weighted down with silver . The sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this life swept him with a greediness to take these crinkly good smelling pieces of paper to himself , not for what they would buy but for their lovely selves . All this was contained in the slow , measured , inexorable dropping of the cards , like time beating slowly but irresistibly in the ears of an old old man . Around the table twice , twice ten cards , once down , once up . Somebody 's watch beat loudly . And the known familiar faces took on new characteristics and became strange . The bright light cast strange shadows down from the impassive brows and noses , making of each man an eyeless hairlip . He did not know these men . That was not Warden there or O'Hayer there , only a pair of bodyless hands moving the top card under the holecard for a secret look , only an armless hand clicking a stack of halves down one on top the other , then lifting all and clicking them down again , and again , perpetually , with measured thoughtfulness . An unreasoning thrill passed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become in the last two months fell away from him , dead , forgotten . The first hand was a big one . He had hoped for a small one , his $20 would not go far in this game . But the cards were high , and the betting heavy . He had jacks backed up and by the third round he was all in , for the side pot his twenty shared , unable because this was table stakes to go into his pocket for more money if he had it which he did not . The pot he could win was shoved to one side and the betting went on in the center , and all he could do was sit and sweat it out . On the fourth card O'Hayer caught the ace to match his holecard that all of them knew he had because Jim O'Hayer never stayed for fun . He raised fifteen . Prew 's belly sagged and he looked at his jacks ruefully and was very glad he was all in for the pot . But on the last card he caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart skip a beat and cursed silently because he was all in for the pot . There was nearly a hundred and fifty in his pot . O'Hayer won the other , the smaller pot . Warden looked at O'Hayer and then at him and snorted his disgust . Prew grinned , dragging in his pot , and reminded himself that if he won the next one he would quit and check out and Warden could really snort then .  | He did nt need to win the next one . What he had from the first was plenty . But he had promised himself two hands , not one , so he stayed in . But he did not win the second hand , Warden won it , and he had dropped $40 which left him only about a hundred and now he felt he needed the second win before he dropped out so he stayed in . But he did not win the third hand either , or the fourth , nor did he win the fifth . He dropped clear down to less than $50 , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sighed off the tenseness that had grown in him in ratio to the shrinking of his capital ; he had begun to believe he would never win another one . But now though he had a real backlog to work from . The second win put him up to over two hundred . Two hundred was plenty capital . And he began to play careful , weighing each bet . He played shirtfront poker , enjoying it immensely , completely lost in loving it , in matching his brain against the disembodied brains against him . It was true poker , hard monotonous unthrilling , and he truly loved it , and played steadily , losing only a little , dropping out often , winning a small one now and then , playing now against the time when he would win that really big one and check out . He knew of course all the time that it could not go on indefinitely this way , $200 was no reserve to put up against the capital in this game , but then all he wanted was just one more big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger because now he had more money , one he could quit on and check out for good . If he had won the first two like he promised he would have quit then but he had nt won them he had only won one and now he wanted this last one the one to quit on , before he finally got caught . But before the big win he was just waiting for to quit on came they caught him , they caught him good . He had tens backed up , a good hand . On the fourth card he drew another . On the same card Warden paired kings showing . Warden checked to the tens . Prew was cautious , they were not trying to play dirty poker in this game but with this much on the table anything went . Warden might have trips and he was not being sucked in , he was not that green . When the bet had checked clear around to him he raised lightly , very lightly , just a touch , a feeler , a protection bet he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away . Only O'Hayer and Warden called , finally . O'Hayer obviously had an ace paired to his holecard and was willing to pay for the chance to catch the third . O'Hayer was a percentage man , twenty percentage man , O'Hayer . And Warden who thought quite a while before he  | called looked at his holecard twice and then he almost did nt call , so he had no trips . On the last card O'Hayer missed his ace and dropped out , indifferently . O'Hayer could always afford to drop out indifferently . Warden with his kings still high checked it to Prew , and Prew felt a salve of relief grease over him for sure now Warden had no trips . Warden had two pair and hoped the kings would nose him out since O'Hayer had two bullets . Well , if he wanted to see them he could by god pay for seeing them , like everybody else , and Prew bet twenty-five , figuring to milk the last drop out of him , figuring he had this one cinched , figuring The Warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a legitimate bet ; Warden had checked his kings twice when they were high . Warden raised him sixty dollars . Looking at Warden 's malignant grin he knew then he was caught , really hooked , right through the bag . By three big kings . Outsmarted . Sucked in like a green kid . The first time somebody checked a cinch into him . His belly flopped over sickeningly with disbelief and he made as if to drop out , but he knew he had to call . There was too much of his money in this pot , which was a big one , to chance a bluff . And The Warden knew just how high to raise without raising too high to get a call . The hand cost him two hundred even , he had about forty dollars left . He pushed the stool back , way back , and got up then . " Seat open . " Warden 's eyebrows quivered , then hooked up pixishly . " I hated to do that to you , kid . I really did . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by god give it back . " The table laughed all around . " Ah , you keep it , " Prew said . " You won it , Top , its yours . Check me out , " he said to the dealer , thinking why dint you drop out you son of a bitch after that second win like you promised , thinking this is not an original lament . " Whats wrong , kid ? " Warden said . " You look positively unwell . " " Just hungry . Missed noon chow . " Warden winked at Stark who had only just come back . " Too late to catch chow now . You better stick around ? Win some of this back ? Forty , fifty bucks ai nt much take home pay . " " Enough , " Prew said . " For what I need . " Why did nt he let it go ? why did he have to rub it in ? The son of a bitching bastard whoring bastard .  | " Yeah , but you want a bottle too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just a friendly game for pastime . Ai nt that right , Jim ? " Prew could see his eyes clenching into rays of wrinkles as he looked at the gambler . " Sure , " O'Hayer said indifferently . " Long as you got the money to be friendly . Deal the cards . " Warden laughed softly , as if to himself . " You see ? " he said to Prew . " No cutthroat . No hardtack . The take out 's only twenty . " " Beats me , " Prew said . He started to add , " I 've got a widowed mother , " but nobody would have heard it . The cards were already riffling off the deck . As he moved back Stark goosed him warmly in the ribs and winked , and slipped into the seat . " Heres fifty , " Stark said to the dealer . Outside the air free of smoke and the moisture of exhaled breath smote Prew like cold water and he inhaled deeply , suddenly awake again , then let it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was urging him to go back . He could not escape the belief that he had just lost $200 of his own hard-earned money to that bastard Warden . Come on , cut it out , he told himself , you did nt lose a cent , you 're twenty to the good , you got enough for tonight , lets me and you walk from this place . The air had wakened him and he saw clearly that this was no personal feud , this was a poker game , and you cant break them all , eventually they 'll break you . He walked around the sheds and down to the sidewalk . Then he walked across the street . He even got so far his hand was on the doorknob of the dayroom door and the door half open . Before he finally decided to quit kidding himself and slammed the door angrily and turned around and went irritably back to O'Hayer 's . " Well look who 's here , " Warden grinned . " I thought we 'd be seeing you . Is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambler a seat . " " Aw can it , " Prew said savagely and slipped into the seat of another loser who was checking out and grinning unhappily at The Warden with the look of a man who wants to do the right thing and be a good sport but finds it hard . " Come on , come on , " Prew said . " Whats holding things up ? Lets get this show on the road . " " Man ! " The Warden said . " You sound like you 're itchin for a great big lick . " " I am . Look out for yourself . I 'm hot . First jack bets . " p 300 But he was not hot and knew it , he was only savagely irritated , and there is a difference and it took him just fifteen minutes and three hands to lose the forty dollars , as he had known he would . Where before he had played happily , lost in loving it , savoring every second , now he played with dogged irritation , not giving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . You do nt win at poker playing that way , and he stood up feeling a welcome sense of release that came with being broke and able to quit now . " Now I can go home and go to bed . And sleep . " " What ! " The Warden said . " At three o'clock in the afternoon ? " " Sure , " Prew said . Was it only three o'clock ? He had thought they 'd played Tattoo already . " Why not ? " he said . The Warden snorted his disgust . " Punks wont never listen to me . I told you you should of quit when you was ahead . But would you listen ? A lot you listen . " " Forgot , " Prew said . " Forgot all about it . Hows for loanin me a hundred , and I 'll remember . " It got a laugh around the table . " Sorry , kid . You know I 'm behind myself . " " Hell . And I thought you was winnin . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered it did not put money back in his pocket . He elbowed his way out . " What you want to awys be pickin on the kid for , First ? " he heard Stark say behind him . " Pick on him ? " Warden said indignantly . " Whatever give you that idea ? " " He do nt need you to pick on him , " the K Co topkick , a bald fat man with drinker 's hollowed eyes , said . " From what I hear . " " Thats right , " Stark said . " He doiri all right by himself . " Warden snorted then . " He can take it . He 's a punchy . He 's use to bein hit . Some of them even like it . " " If I was him , " the K Co topkick said , " I 'd transfer the hell out of there . " " Thats all you know , " Warden said . " He cant . Dynamite wont let him . " " Come on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sewing circle or a card game ? King is high , king bets . " " Bet five , " Warden said . " You know , thats what I like about you , Jim . Your overwhelming sense of human compassion , " he said quizzically . In his mind Prew could see the eyes clenching themselves into those somehow ominous rays of wrinkles .  | He let the shaky door swing shut behind him , cutting off the talk , wishing he could find it in him to hate that bitchery Warden but he couldnt , and remembering suddenly he had not even in his passion thought to get a sandwich and coffee from O'Hayer 's free lunch for the players . But he would not go back in there now . He could also remember , suddenly , a lot of other things he had meant to do with part of that money before he risked it . He needed shaving cream and a new bore brush and a new Blizt rag and he had wanted to stock up some tailormades . It was lucky he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are through , Prewitt , he told himself , your wad is shot , your roll is gone , you 're through till next month now , and there will be no Lorene for you this month . By next month she may have retired and gone back to the States already . He jammed his hands in his pockets savagely and found some change , a small pile of dimes and nickels , and brought it out and looked at it , wondering what it was good for . It was enough to get into a small change game in the latrine , but the hopelessness of ever running that little bit back up to two hundred and sixty bucks hit him and he threw it down into the railroad bed viciously and with satisfaction watched it spread like shot but glinting silver , then heard with satisfaction the clink of it hitting the rails . He turned back to the barracks . Lorene , or no Lorene , poker or no poker , you are not borrowing any money at no twenty percent thats for sure . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this rock and you ai nt starting now , school keeps or not . He found Turp Thornhill in his own shed next to O'Hayer 's . Because there was nothing in O'Hayer , even at twenty percent , when he was playing . Turp was neither playing nor dealing . He was moving from dice table to blackjack table to poker table back to dice table , perpetually and nervously , checking up as usual on his dealers to see they were not cheating him . The tall chinless hawknosed Mississippi peckerwood possessed all the disgusting traits of a backward people with few of the compensating good . But he did loan money , even though he lived an eternal gimleteyed suspicion , a grasping pinch-mouthed servile pride in being " just what he was , by god , and no hifalutin airs , take it or leave it . " He had earned the management of his gambling shed by being in the same company 17 years and ass-kissing his superiors every minute of that  | time , and now he was in position to compensate for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominate . " Haw , " Turp hawked , when Prew called him over to one side and hit him up for twenty . He doubled up his long thin frame and prodded the other slyly . " Haw , " he hollered , loud enough for everybody in the humming shed to hear , " so Prewitt the Hard 's a finally givin in , ' ey ? Got his guts all riled over wantin a little , ' ey ? So he decide to come around and see ole daddy Turp that ai nt good enuf for him to talk to ' cept on Payday to borry some money , ' ey ? Well , it comes to all on us , boy , it comes to all on us . " He got his wallet out , but did not open it yet , he was not through yet . " Where you aim to go ? The Service ? The Ritz ? The Pacific ? The New Senator ? The New Congress Mrs Kipfer runs ? I know em all , boy , hell I support em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a little tip . Ers a new job over to the Ritz . Not so hot on looks but boys ! will she work you over . Hunh ? What you say ? Kind of gits ye , do nt it ? Like to have a little bit a that stuff ? wunt ye ? ' ey ? Hows about er , ' ey ? " A number of the players were looking at them now and laughing . Turp grinned back at them smugly , relishing his audience , not wanting to lose it , not just yet . Prew was still silent but his face was reddening in spite of himself . He cursed silently at his face for reddening . Turp laughed again , winking at his audience , get this now , this going to be a good one now , just get this . His long bony nose poked into Prewitt 's face with each bob of nervous laughter . The grin pulled up the long corners of his chinless mouth making his face into a series of sharp prying Vs . The subdued murky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with obscene curiosity and insulting laughter . Turp was at his best before an audience , get this now . " Haw , " Turp hawked , winking at his audience . " Why hell , boy , if you 'd do it with her her way , you wunt have to borry no money . She 'd give it to ye for nuthin , and probly be willin to take you to raise in the bargain . Hows about that , ' ey ? " The audience roared . Old Turp was in form . Even the dice stopped rattling . " I hear thats what she likes , ' Turp hawed . " Hows about it , ' ey ? Man never knows till he tried it . Maybe he been missin somethin all his life . I hear them boys out in Hollywood make a lot of money that a way . Man awys use a leetle money , taint e ? Might even get to like it , who knows ? " Haw , look at im . He blushin . Look at im , boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to borry some money now , Prewitt ? Or you jist pullin my leg now ? Maybe you wont need it now . " Prew stayed silent but he was having trouble with it . He had to keep shut , if he aimed to get the money . And Turp had money . Turp made money . He had been running a shed from G Company when O'Hayer was just an upstart . But O'Hayer 's rise had been meteoric and he had topped them all . For this Turp hated and feared the gambler with a sly long-nosed implacability . Yet strangely , he took the small sums he made from his loans and the large sums he made from his shed and lost them all across O'Hayer 's poker table along in the middle of the month . After the Payday gambling rush was over and his own shed was closed down , he would sit in on the winners ' game , betting wildly , cursing with nervous excitability , losing steadily . It was as if the sterile contamination of his own spavined Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even himself an object of his own ingrown suspicious hatred , so that he frantically threw away every cent he could pick up , in order to keep Turp from cheating Thornhill . And in the end the hated O'Hayer , cool and mathematical and impersonal , always collected the profits of Turp 's shed in addition to his own . Turp let him have the twenty , finally , after a pause in his Southern Ku Klux Klan brand of humor , a pause in which white lines of suspicion pinched in upon his mouth and cut down through his laughter while he attempted to divine all the thousand ways this seemingly open man might be trying to crook him , oh , he looked honest enough , but you never can tell , and Turp Thornhill knew a thing or two , Turp Thornhill knew better than to trust a man 's looks , Turp Thornhill was like Diogenes , he had never seen an honest man , and he never would . After insulting him , ridiculing him , suspicioning him , torturing him by letting on he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him have the whole twenty dollars he had asked for , at twenty per cent , and warned him narrowly not to try to pull some wise shenanigan when it come time to pay it back . Prew , as he dressed for town with the twenty in his pocket , felt the degradation of Turp 's foul breath still on him that a shower would not wash off and wondered which was worse , to be poked by Turp 's foul breathing Mississippi nose or to be sprayed with Ike Galovitch 's foul smelling Slavic spit . This was sure turning out to be some outfit . A fine home , this outfit . He was also wondering , as he dressed , at the humiliations men will suffer for a woman that they will not suffer for any other thing , even for their politics .  | CHAPTER 21 MILT WARDEN , as he debated checking out of this game himself , was thinking somewhat the same thing , just as wonderingly , but about a different woman . Perhaps it was because he was meeting Karen Holmes downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he looked up from his cards his eyes focused themselves on the battered husky face of Maylon Stark with a kind of shocked disbelief like a man looking at his own arm blown off and lying in his slit trench . It was outrageous , this face , and what was worse it was ruining his game . Because he could not stop looking at it . Two out of the last three hands he 'd lost he should have won except that his eyes were staring themselves at this face whose eyes and lips had also caressed the nude self-induced-trance that was like death and that was Karen Holmes when being loved , and that he , Milt Warden , remembered clearly . That undoubtedly Stark remembers clearly too , he thought . Because there was no doubt he had , goddam it . No doubt at all . Any way you turn it . It was not wishful thinking because Stark had not mentioned it again since that first time ; Stark was not the artistic type who can imagine things into reality , worse luck . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have got around , clear around , by now ; but then Stark was not a bragger either , who needed ego building . No , he thought scrotumsickeningly , no doubt at all , you cant explain it away , and the worst of that is that it points the finger at the up to now preposterous stories of her and Champ Wilson , and that goddamned perverted Henderson , and even possibly O'Hayer . He looked at O'Hayer . But she said , " I never knew it could be like this " ; he remembered distinctly she had said , " I never knew it could be like this . " " Check me out , " he said to the dealer , " so 's I can get in a goddam game where theres some action . And theres ninety-seven dollars in silver there . I counted it already . " The dealer grinned . " You do nt mind if I count it too , do you , Milt ? " " Hell no . I just wanted you to know I counted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this too , " Jim O'Hayer yawned . " I 'm going to knock off for a little break myself and see how things are going . Just shove this in the drawer with the rest and I 'll take it back out later . " " Okay , boss , " the dealer , who was a buck sergeant , said . He shoved Warden 's hills over to him to keep the piles separate and then shoved  | O'Hayer 's into the drawer that was already full of the red chips and silver he had cut the game for , for O'Hayer . " It 'll be here when you get back , Jim , " the dealer promised faithfully proudly , and Warden watched him bland-eyedly neatly palm a tenspot off the pile as he continued the deal with his left hand , sliding the cards off with his thumb , then bring his right hand back to the deal still palming the folded ten , and then after the round was completed reach his right hand into his shirt pocket for a cigaret . Warden looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a nail behind him and lit a cigaret himself and grinning , held the match for the buck sergeant dealer who did not grin back now but looked through him flat-eyedly across the match flame as he lit up . Warden laughed and flipped the match away and then followed O'Hayer outside and the two of them stood breathing in the fresh air and smoking , O'Hayer silent and somehow sealed mathematically within himself as he stared indifferently at the thinly rusted over railroad rails . Warden , who had meant to go on to the barracks , stood watching him and smoking , thinking this was as good a time as any to try and get the usual needle in through this thick skin , but wanting to just see if he couldnt make the automatic calculator speak first for once . " Kitchen must be getting along pretty well now with Preem gone , " O'Hayer said finally ; it was an indifferent offering to the abstract status of First Sergeant ; you got the impression if it was anybody else he would not have even bothered speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Warden said , silently congratulating Warden . " I wish the rest of my compny administration was getting along so good . " " Oh ? " O'Hayer said coolly . " Mazzioli been giving you some trouble lately ? " Warden grinned . " Who else ? And how are you coming ? How you making out with the new bayonet issue ? " " Oh , that . " O'Hayer lifted his head and the cold eyes left their contemplation of the rails to study Warden . " Coming along fine , Top . I 've given Leva instructions how to do it . If I remember , he 's got about half the chrome bayonets exchanged for the black ones now and the excess chrome ones turned in to ordnance . Its only a question of time , " he said . " How much time ? " " Time , " O'Hayer said easily . " Just time . Leva 's got a lot of stuff to do , you know . You trying to tell me I 'm taking too much time ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the battalion only got their  | exchange completed and their chrome turned in about two weeks ago . You 're about on schedule . " " You know , Top , " O'Hayer said , " you get too excited over little things , Top . " " You do nt get excited enough , Jim , " Warden said . He was feeling again , as he always felt with O'Hayer , that dispassionate itching to step in suddenly and knock him down , not from dislike , just to see if there wasnt some emotion in among the tumblers . Someday I 'll do it , he told himself . Someday I 'll quit thinking about it and do it , and then they can bust me , and I will go happily back to being a rear rank Rudy with no troubles and nothing to do but get drunk and lug around a rifle and be happy . Someday I will . " It never pays to get excited , " O'Hayer explained . " You 're liable to forget little things , Top . Important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the connections between Regiment and the sheds ? Or like the small opinions of Captain Holmes that are always , though , important ? " " Well , I did nt mean that , " O'Hayer said . He grinned . It was a tightening of the cheeks that pulled the mouth corners up and showed the teeth . " But since you mention it , I guess that would be a good example . " " If you 're tryin to scare me it not only wont work its ridiculous , " Warden said . " I pray every night that by next Payday I 'll be drawin thirty dollars . " " Sure . All us noncoms got heavy responsibilities , " O'Hayer said sympathetically . " Look at me , " he waved his hand behind him at the shed . What was the use ? Warden asked himself . You cant talk with him . Only way you can ever talk with him is blow your top and get mad like you did over the clothing issue , and even that do nt do you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , Jim , " he said . " Theres going to be a lot more stuff coming up soon like this change of chrome bayonets for black . We 'll be getting the new Mt rifles pretty soon , and they are experimenting with a new style helmet at Benning now . We 're getting ready to get into this war and from now on there will be all kinds of changes , not only in equipment but in administration . I 'm going to have my hands full with the orderly room and the records , from now on . I wont be able to handle the supply . " " Me and Leva are handling it , " O'Hayer said , still untouched . " I ai nt had any complaints from anybody about how we 're handling it .  | Except from you . I think me and Leva are doing a pretty good job of handling it . Do nt you , Top ? " Ah , Warden thought . He held the hypo up to the light then and squirted the needle , just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " What would you do , " he asked , " if Leva transferred out of this company ? " O'Hayer laughed . It was like with his smile . " Now you 're trying to scare me , Top . You know Dynamite would never okay Leva 's transfer . I 'm ashamed of you , stooping to such tricks . " " But what if the transfer came down from Regiment , from Colonel Delbert ? " Warden grinned . " Why , Dynamite would just take it back to him and explain the facts of life to him , thats all . You know that , Top . " " No I do nt , " Warden grinned . " And apparently you do nt know Dynamite , not if you think he 's going to jeopardize his chance of getting that majority he 's bucking for by arguing with The Great White Father . " O'Hayer looked at him coolly , Warden could almost see the tumblers moving . " Leva , " Warden grinned complacently , " has been talking it up with M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All he has to do is transfer and the rating 's his . And M Co 's CC wants him so bad he taken it up with the 3rd Battalion Commander , who is not a Captain but a Lieutenant Colonel , a Lieutenant Colonel who has taken it up with Delbert , Jim . " " Thanks for the tip , " O'Hayer said . " I 'll work on it . " " Its no tip , " Warden grinned . You 're enjoying this , ai nt you , he thought . What a prick . " If it had nt already gone too far for you and Dynamite to stop it , I never would of told you , Jim . Leva 's a good man . I 'm a prick , but I ai nt that big a one . " Its only a question of time , Jim , " he grinned , O'Hayer did not say anything . " So this is no tip . This is a favor I 'm asking you . A personal favor . Will you ask Dynamite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're bored with it and get him to carry you surplus for straight duty , and let me give Leva that rating ? As a personal favor to me . You lose nothing ; I get to keep Leva . " O'Hayer was looking at him thoughtfully , the tumblers making little clickings as they moved , still unemotionally , calculating . " I like it where I am , " O'Hayer said , finally . " I see no reason to  | change my status , not from what you 've told me . He might even end up by wanting me to pull drill with the Company , if he carried me surplus for straight duty . I like being the supply . " " You wont when Leva transfers , Jim . " " Maybe he wont transfer . " " He will . " " Maybe not , " O'Hayer said again , making a veiled threat of it , as if he knew more than he was telling . " Okay , " Warden said . Well , he thought , it did nt work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed below and watched the feeble glow , that was like a lightbulb in the daytime , splash in the gathering dusk . He turned and walked away , grinning to himself happily . He spoke back over his shoulder just before he rounded the corner of the shed to O'Hayer who was still watching unemotionally . " You know , Jim , " he said , " I really use to believe this stuff that you were one of those rare things , a human being truly without feeling . One of those that things come to naturally because they never mind risking coldbloodedly , or even losing coldbloodedly , what they have . Romantic , hey ? " As he rounded the corner O'Hayer was still looking at him , still unemotionally , all the tumblers still apparently still working . Well , so what if it did nt work . Maybe Dynamite really would have done it for him , Big Jim meant a lot to Dynamite and not just as a punchie , maybe Dynamite really would have carried him as surplus , who knows ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Dynamite might also have transferred him . To HQ Company maybe where he would have to work . Or maybe Dynamite would only have clamped down on him in supply and made him work some here , although Christ knows what he could do without going to a supply school first . Well , maybe Dynamite might have sent him to supply school . Dynamite could have done any of these , if O'Hayer asked him to be relieved , like you hoped he would . So maybe old tumblers-in-the-head really did figure it out right . Maybe he wasnt scared . But it was entirely possible Dynamite would have carried him as surplus though , he reminded himself . Entirely possible . And he preferred to believe Dynamite would have , and that old tumblers had nt figured it out but was only scared to take a chance on losing his soft deal , just like us common mortals . Maybe Dynamite wouldnt have  | carried him as surplus , but Warden preferred to believe it the other way It made him happy to believe it the other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing it , to shower and change his clothes and go to town and have some drinks someplace of maybe just wander around happily downtown , not out at Waikiki but downtown , among the bars and shooting galleries and whorehouses. while he waited for time to meet Karen Holmes at the Moana in Waikiki . His T shirt and shirt both were sweated clear through from the gambling and he stopped on the stairs and raised his arm and put his nose to his armpit happily and inhaled the mineral-salts male smell of himself , feeling his chest expanding infinitely with maleness , feeling from inside himself the hard columnar beauty of his thighs and the slim thickly muscled beauty of his waist and loins ; he was Milt Warden and he was meeting Karen Holmes in town tonight . But then sud denly , the eyes inside his mind that were not his eyes focused them selves , as his eyes had done , on the husky battered face of Maylon Stark and he straightened up with his nostrils sickened and smashed his fist against the wall , punching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where Maylon Stark 's husky battered face way amorphously hanging and let the numbed hand fall contemptuously at his side and went on upstairs , to shower and change his clothes and ge to town to meet Karen Holmes at the Moana . Pete Karelsen was in their room , sitting on his bunk staring crumple mouthed at the full set of grinning teeth in his open palm . He laid them down on the table quickly . " What the hell happen to your hand ? " he wanted to know eagerly " You been in a fight again ? " " What the hell happen to your goddam teeth ? " Warden said contemptuously . " You been in a goddam messhall again ? " " Okay , " Pete said offcndedly . " Be wise . I was only intrested in your hand . " " Okay , " Warden said . " Be hurt . I was only intrested in your goddam teeth , " and went on looking at his own hated face in the mirror , unbuttoning the thick chenille of his shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the time making cracks , " Pete said . " All the time needling somebody . I merely ask you a simple friendly question . You do nt have to go casting aspersions . You do nt have to go being snotty . " Warden went on looking in the mirror without answering and finished unbuttoning his shirt and took it off and dropped it on the bed He unbuckled his belt in silence .  | " What are you doing ? " Pete said conversationally . " Getting ready to go to town ? " " No . I 'm getting ready to go over to Choy 's , thats why I 'm changing into civilians . " " Okay . Go to hell . " " I 'm going over to Choy 's and get drunker'n hell . " " I been thinkin of doing that myself , " Pete said . " Somehow or other I do nt feel much like going to town today . You know , " he said , looking stealthily at the teeth on the table , " its really the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . And what does it get you in the end , going to town ? A hangover , is all . I 'm getting bored with it , " he said . He stole another look at the teeth . " I 'm getting any more so I do nt much care I go to town or not . Ever . I 'd even ruther go to Choy 's . " " All right , " Warden said , turning away from the mirror . He picked his shirt back up and put it on again and started buttoning it . " Lets go . What the hellar you waitin on ? " " You mean to Choy 's ? Really ? " " Sure . Why not ? Like you say , why go to town ? " " I thought you were snowing me , " Pete said . He got up grinning toothlessly and picked the teeth up from the table and leered at them . " Hunh , " he said and put them back . " To hell with you . Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Warden unbuttoning his pants and stuffing the shirt tail down into them and buttoning them back up again and tying the tie , Pete walking and talking newly animatedly . " We 'll get a case of cans , " he said . " Maybe we 'll sit out in the kitchen this time . I do nt like to sit out front on Payday , with all them young punks yelling around . Or maybe we 'll get four or five pitchers instead , take them outside on the green . Maybe that would be better ? " After we get teed up , " Pete said as they reached the stairs . " After we 're properly soused , maybe we 'll go over to Big Sue 's in Wahiawa and take one , hey ? And come right back . For the hell of it . Wait a minute , " he said . " I better go back and get my teeth . " Warden stopped silently . He lit a cigaret and leaned back against the porch banister and crossed his feet and folded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual granite immobility , the top half of him a cut black paper silhouette fixed against the deepening dusk outside the screens . He stood so in suspended animation , divorced from life .  | When Pete came back he spoke , without moving , the cigaret a bobbling red point that was the only breathing live thing about him . " The trouble with you , Pete , " the voice that did not seem to come from him but from the cigaret said savagely , " is you cant see any further than that douchebag nose of yours . You concern yourself with the petty details of life in order not to think , like whether or not to wear them goddam teeth of yours if you think a pussy 's gunna see you  --  just like the goddam housewives in my brother 's parish with their makeup when they 're going to confession . While the whole damn world is rocketing to hell you got to go back and get your fucking teeth . Whynt you go get in the goddam church and hold hands with the padre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age now , and you 're suffering from the same disease that afflicts the rest of the human race . " Pete stood stricken motionless in the act of putting in his teeth , transfixed by the sudden sanguinariness of the attack , his mouth open and his thumbs still inside with the teeth , staring at this two dimensional statue cut from tin . " Its because of you theres Nazis in Germany , " the voice that was not Warden sermonized him . " Its because of you there 'll be Fascism in this country someday . After we have got in and pulled the chestnuts out again for the rest of the world and won this war for England . And you sit around with Mazzioli and the rest of the commendable clerks and discuss . Any subject , just discuss . Whynt you get up a regular Tuesday Literary Club like the Irish ladies in me brother 's parish . Intellectuals ! " The statue moved out of frozen mobility into a dead run for the stairs , his feet flickering down them like a boxer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boob , " Warden bawled . " What the hellar you waitin for ? " Pete finished the interrupted teeth insertion and champed his jaws to settle them in and followed silently , shaking his head confoundedly . " And what the hell do you do ? " Pete said indignantly , half running to keep up with the long loping strides as they moved across the quad . His voice was so choked with hurt , after the warm comradely time he had envisioned , that he seemed almost to be crying . " I suppose you do nt concern yourself with the petty details of life ? " " Sure , " Warden said . " Why not ? Do nt bawl , for Christ sake . " " Then why read me off ? I 'm not bawling . And what do you mean we got to get in and win this war ? We 're all ready in , except for sending troops . " " Sure , " Warden agreed . " Thats it . " " And maybe the Ruskies and the Jerries will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and save us the trouble . Anyway , it looks like they will . In spite of this treaty . " " Fine , " Warden said . " Fine . The more thats dead the less to feed the more beer for me . What are you arguing about ? " " Why do nt you talk sense ? I 'm not arguing . You 're arguing . You started this argument . " " Did I ? Well then I 'm ending it . As of right now . " He opened the screendoor between the garbage racks and stacks of empty cases on the porch and went into the kitchen of Choy 's restaurant irritably , with Pete following cursing chokingly and impotently angrily . They were among the scant dozen noncoms in the Regiment who had the privilege of sitting and drinking in Choy 's kitchen and now they sat down and prepared themselves , unbuttoning their shirts under their loosened ties and rolling up their sleeves two turns and propping their feet up on Choy 's freshly scrubbed meatblock , and then called for Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner to bring them beer . They were going to make a party . " Hey , Old Choy , you heathen Chinee , " Warden bellowed . " You blingee beer , eh ? Blingee two four six beer . Chop-chop ! " He held up ten fingers and the eighty-year-old statue in the corner came to life and shuffled perilously across the kitchen to the ice chest grinning hugely under the thin straggly white beard . Old Choy always grinned at Warden , because since Young Choy , his eldest son , had taken over the business from him the ancient one was not allowed to go out front where the customers were and where Young Choy was now in the shouting Payday hubbub , and the old man , who sat in the kitchen all day every day in his black silk skull cap and long embroidered robe that Young Choy who had given up ancestor worship for American business ethics called bad for blisness , worshipped Warden because Warden liked to come sit in the kitchen and drink beer and kid the old man , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowed after him with a wink at Pete , " wiki-wiki , chop-chop . You feet , stickee floor , old goat . Me in bully , old man , you bletta snappem shit . " Old Choy tottered to the meatblock with an armload of cans . " You goat , Old Choy , " Warden grinned . " Goat , see ? You mother goat . Mama-San she goat , see ? She blingee you goat . Goat , see ? Goat . Baa-a-a . " He put his fingers under his chin and waggled them at the Chinese . Old Choy set the beer on the block , his almond eyes closed to bright slits , and chuckled with great glee at being called an old goat .  | " No goat , " he chuckled . " You goat , Walden . " Warden grabbed an empty can off the block , his bright eyes dancing in the broad big face , the energy pouring out of him in dazzling radiations , the lets-make-this-a-party energy . " See , old goat , " he bellowed ferociously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbs for fulcrum on the seam . " You do that ? You makee can double ? You call me goat , I make you double . Like this , see ? " He took another can and bent it . Then he worked his way with a sudden savagery through all the empties standing on the block , bending them viciously easily and tossing them over his shoulder into the trash box . " See ? like this . See ? like this . You bletta no mess with me , old man goat . " The Chinese stood before him , grinning all over his eroded face , his shoulders shaking with his chuckling , his head doddering with age . " Blingee beer , " Old Choy said . He held out his hand with a delighted grin . " Me blingee beer . Now you play . " " Ha-ha , " Warden laughed , " ho-ho . Me no can play . No got cash . " He held up his hand in the old , Army gesture , middle finger extended , other fingers closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " You blingee woman , me play . " He made the old , Army sign for woman again , under Old Choy 's nose . " You woman , old man goat , me show you how play . My play you then . " " You play , " Old Choy said , giggling . " You play , Walden . " Warden got his wallet out and gave him a bill . " You smart like fox , old man goat . You catchee much money , much cash . You son him makee million dollar . " The old Chinese laughed delighted , patting Warden on his big thick shoulder with the thin fine-boned almost transparent hand , and shuffled with the bill to the door out front and called softly in Chinese to his son to come take the money . Then he came back with the change , still grinning , and perched up on his stool to watch the show , his bright old eyes constantly moving . " Ah , " Pete sighed . He wiped the foam from his lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the speck of foam the small hole in the can had left on the end of his nose with his thumb and forefinger and flung it on the cement floor . " Ah , " he said . " Ah , man . "  | Pete had watched the party-ritual sadly , gazing down from the summit of his 22 years service . Now he began his party-ritual . " You remember the old Bijou Theater in Coconut Grove , Milt ? " he said sadly . " I wonder if its still there these many years . " " Sure , " Warden grinned , teetering in his chair . " The Red Dog Theater on Balboa Street . They probly closed it up by now since the Zone is gone respectable . If they ai nt they will , soon as these young virgin draftees start comin in and the Future Gold Star Mothers of America make the whole Army go respectable for the duration . Remember what they done to Storyville in the last war . " " Ah , yes , " Pete said sadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have tore down the old market and built a new one thats sanitary . Did you know that , Milt ? " " Sure , " Warden said indifferently , the party energy beginning to wear thin before this old rehashing . He got himself another can to bolster it . " Yes , sir , " Pete said . He looked off at the ceiling corner with great emotion . " Colon . Balboa . Panama City . Walking post along the locks . Coconut Grove . The old Bijou Theater with nothing but shunt pictures . Newsreel , cartoon , and a feature . I got some of the best and most artistic pictures in my collection down in The Grove . Things ai nt like they was , Milt . Remember ? the MPs had no authority above the ground floor ? and if a whore ever got you up on the second floor you might as well kiss the boys goodby ? It was a fifty-fifty chance they find you in the river . They were men in those days . " " If you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunted , " you can kiss the boys goodby . Possessing pornography is five years and a DD , Pete . " This that he had heard so often was killing the partiness and the other , the jaw-tightening , the scrotum-sickening , was coming back . " Wouldnt that be a shame , " he nagged , " you with only seven years to go for rocking chair money ? " " Once I took a girl down there to the Bijou , " Pete reminisced emotionally . " Can you imagine that ? But I was a young buck then . I was a fireball . " " How many beers you had , Pete ? " " Only four . As yet . Why ? This girl was a planter 's daughter , see ? Her old man worked about five hundred gooks and she had led a very sheltered life . A very moral young lady , Milt . I took her out to a high class dinner and then to the Bijou . It was a great shock to her to learn about life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much , after that . " He took up another can , a fresh one . " Well , " Warden said , " go on . Tell the rest of it . " " Thats all there is , " Pete said . " The last time I heard it you told it different . "  | " Well , " Pete said , his great emotion still secure . " What do you expect ? I was in a different mood then . " " Oh , " Warden said . " Is that it ? Hey , Old Choy . Pappa-San blingee more beer to soljer boys , or Pappa-San gettem beard pulled offem face , eh ? " Old Choy got up and tottered grinning obediently to the ice chest . " What do you want to make over the old duffer so much for ? " Pete asked , still speaking with great emotion . " Whynt you let him die in peace ? since he 's old and useless ? " " I do nt make over him . Him and me got an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You play now , " Old Choy grinned , setting down the cans . " You play , Walden . " " See ? " Warden said . " Nobody has any use for him any more , " Warden said , getting out another bill . " He owns the business but his eldest son runs it and collects the money and gives him his allowance and tells him what to do . Well , I 'm the First Sergeant and everybody tells me how they want my compny run . I wear the stripes and draw the money and they tell me who to make and who to bust and how they want it run . Me and Old Choy undertands each other . " " Yas , " Pete said , " you sure take a beating , do nt you ? " " Sure . Even Mazzioli tells me how to run my orderly room . Come on , lets get out of this . What time is it ? " " Eight o'clock . But what for ? I 'm just beginning to enjoy myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here any more you 'll be crying in your goddam beer . " " But you do nt understand , " Pete said , his great emotion coming back . " The things I 've seen , the things I 've done . All of them gone . All of them not any more . " " Sure , " Warden said , " sure , I know . Come on , for Christ sake . Come on . I cant stand it . You 're killing me . " " But you do nt understand , " Pete said . " Where 'll we go ? " " Go out front , " Warden said . He led the way out of the kitchen and around to the front of the restaurant so no one would see them coming out because it was against regulations .  | It was not the same now any more , you could do it all , the same as you use to do it , but it was not the same . Chief Choate was at his corner table and they sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined by the K Company topkick who had just quit a little bit ahead of O'Hayer 's game , making the four of them a tight little group of old timers in the smoky room that was crowded with the yelling singing horseplay of the youngsters , amongst whom they sat quietly upon their dignity and talked about the Old Army . Chief retold his story of the time he was on guard duty in PI and caught a black gook with the colonel 's wife in a calash parked along the road on his post , in a **27;816;TOOLONG position . " Did you see it ? " Warden said . " Did you see it ? or did you just suspect it ? " " I seen it , " the Chief insisted with his ponderous calm . " You think I 'd make it up ? A thing like that ? " " Hell , I do nt know , " Warden said , twisting the big shoulders irritably , looking around the room . " How the hell do I know ? What do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This goddam place gives me the willies . " All of them looked at The Chief for agreement , since this was his table and he rarely left it . " Its okay by me , " The Chief said . " I do nt like it much in here myself on Payday . " " I do nt believe it , " Warden said , as they went out in the sallyport . " You probably heard that story someplace , from some bastard 's perverted imagination and just picked it up , thats all . " " I do nt give a damn what you believe , " The Chief said . " I know what I seen . Whats eating you ? " " Nothings eating me . What makes you think somethings eating me ? " The Chief shrugged . " This is better out here , " he said . " A lot nicer . " And it was nicer , as they sat down cross legged on the sparse grass around the pitchers they had brought out . The air was very clear to breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco smoke of Choy 's . The quad was dotted with parties of beer drinkers but their conversation made a pleasant insect-like hum out here that was no longer deafening . Now and then a laugh would ring up sharp and clear out of the hum and the stars seemed to be winking at all of them over each other 's shoulder . The fights that kept breaking out out here on the green were removed from them and remote , instead of being in their laps . The large warm semi-tropic moon was just  | coming up , dimming the stars around it , making the clear air golden with a tangible pulsating life , painting new stark shadows on the ground in the perspectiveless planes and angles of a cubist . Pete and The Chief launched into an argument over the respective merits of PI and the Panama Department , enumerating advantages and disadvantages and weighing them against each other . " And I served in both of them , " The Chief summed up stolidly . " So I ought to know . " Pete was definitely hampered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the K Co top said . " China 's the place thats got them all beat . Ai nt that right , Milt ? Your money 's worth ten , twelve times as much . In their rate of exchange . A private lives like a general , in China . I 'm gunna ship over for China as soon as my time 's up in this rotten Pineapple Army . Ai nt that right , Milt ? You served in China , you tell them . " Warden was lying leaning on his elbow watching the moon ascend and looking at the lighted screens along the faces of the barracks ; there were few shadows moving along the porches this night . He stirred . " Ah , whats the difference ? They all the ferkin same . Five cents of one , a nickel of the other . " He sat up and locked his elbows around his knees . " You bums make me sick . Always wishin you was someplace else then where you are . Always re-enlisting for a new place you ai nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the first year . " Anyway , " he said , " there wont be no China next year when your time is up . You 'll have to re-enlist for Japan . " He lay back down and crossed his arms behind his head . " I knew a White Russian girl in Shanghai , though . Thats the only thing about China . Theres lots of them there . She was some kind of a duchess or princess . A countess , I think she was . Had blonde hair down to her crotch . Boy , she was beautiful . By god . The most beautiful woman I ever seen . And hot . The hottest woman I ever seen too . I should of married the bitch , I guess . " " Oh-oh , " Pete winked at the others . " Here we go again . " Warden sat up . " All right , goddam you . I do nt give a damn whether you believe it or not . Her old man was a Rusky , got killed with the stinking 27th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infantry Russian Wolfhounds . Ever hear of them , you smug bastard ? Your nextdoor neighbors , is all they are . You do nt believe me , I 'll take you over there and prove it by Master Sergeant Fisel . He knew her old man . " " I know , " Pete grinned . " I know . Have another drink and tell us all about it . Again . " " Go to hell , you son of a bitch . "
