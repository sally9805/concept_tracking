At the University of Illinois last week , Dr. Grant Fairbanks was having a fine time with a fiendish apparatus specially designed to turn sane human beings into temporary gibbering idiots . It does the dirty work by the cybernetic trick of tinkering with the " feedback " system that monitors human speech . <P> One of the methods of cybernetics ( the science of control mechanism ) is to look for similarities between the human nervous system and the brighter man-made machines . One of these is the feedback : some means by which either the brain or a machine keeps track of what it has accomplished . Without proper feed-back apparatus a ship-steering mechanism , for instance , does not know how much it has succeeded in turning the ship . Therefore it can not decide accurately when to stop turning . It is likely to send the ship into wild zigzags . <P> The brain works in much the same way . It needs to know continuously what an " effector , " e.g. , an arm or a leg , is doing . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then such a simple action as picking up a pencil becomes almost impossible . The patient 's hand oscillates wildly like the rudder of a zigzagging ship . <P> Reports on Speech . Most human feedback systems are built into the nerves or into the brain itself , where they can not easily be tinkered with . The feed-back of speech is more accessible . The brain normally keeps track of speech by means of reports , which it gets through the ears and by bone conduction , upon the pronunciation of each syllable . As each report arrives , the brain tells the vocal apparatus to go ahead and speak the next syllable . The whole thing happens so rapidly and smoothly that the speaker is rarely conscious of it . <P> <P> Dr. Fairbanks ' gadget , which consists chiefly of a microphone , a tape-recorder and a playback amplifier , delays the reports on their way to the brain . Normally a speaker hears each syllable about a thousandth of a second after he has spoken it . By adjusting his apparatus to introduce delay , Dr. Fairbanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can also make the sounds from the amplifier so loud that they drown out the sounds that reach the brain through the normal channels . <P> Agonized Frustration . When his " victim " first starts talking into the microphone , Dr. Fairbanks sets the time interval just like the normal one . The speaker is rather surprised to hear his own words so loudly and clearly . Then Dr. Fairbanks gradually lengthens the time interval until the speaker hears each syllable one-twenty-fifth of a second later than is normal . The result : the speaker is slowly driven toward the gibbering stage . His words wo n't come ; he stammers , repeats , screams in agonized frustration . His face turns red ; he sweats and trembles , showing many of the symptoms of emotional disorder . After the test is over , the victim quickly recovers . <P> The upset is caused by interruption of the normally smooth speaking process . The subject 's brain expects to hear each syllable just after it is pronounced . When it hears the preceding syllable instead , it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zigzagging ship ) , and the shock echoes through the entire nervous system .
