txt An extract made from groundup sheep and lamb brains by University of Chicago scientists may prove useful In treating hardening of the arteries and coronary thrombosis . Tests on chickens show that the extract decreases the amount of cholesterol , the substance suspected of causing hardening of the arteries , in the blood stream . Furthermore , the effect of the extract can be sustained over a fiveweek period . Cholesterol Is a fatty substance found in eggs , milk and animal fats and also produced in the body itself as a result of chemical reactions in the liver . Scientists think that accumulation of this material in the blood vessels forms deposits which eventually restrict the flow of blood . The University of Chicago researchers believe a chemical in their new extract converts cholesterol into a stable compound . which is given off by body wastes . Reduction of the substance , they say is roughly proportional to the dosage of the extract . The University warns that tests of the extract on human patients have been inconclusive , party because of the large amounts needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further research is aimed at pinpointing the active chemicals in the extract and determining how they work to reduce cholesterol .
