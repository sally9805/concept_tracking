Letters to The Times Solving Transit Problem Dropping of Huck Finn Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read that " The Board of Education has quietly dropped Mark Twain 's ' The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ' from the approved textbook lists for the city 's elementary and junior high schools . " One reason for this action , though perhaps not the sole reason , is said to be that the book " has been criticized by some Negroes as ' racially offensive ' . " Now , Huckleberry Finn , besides being a masterpiece of American and indeed of world literature , is a great document in the progress of human tolerance and understanding . Huck begins by regarding Jim , the fugitive slave , very much as the juvenile delinquents of Little Rock regard the Negro today . Gradually , however , he discovers that Jim , despite the efforts of society to brutalize him , is a noble human being who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growing love is made clear throughout the book , positively in the events of the story and negatively in wonderful strokes of satire against the spirit of oppression . I am not an expert on the precollege curriculum . It may well be that the book is too advanced for use as an elementary school text . I should think , however , that under proper teaching students in the junior high school could benefit greatly , both esthetically and morally , from studying it . At all events one thing it certain : whatever his skin pigmentation , any adult who objects to this enlightened work because Huck calls Jim a " nigger " rather than a " Negro " simply does not know how to read a great book . It is the duty of the Board of Education to resist , not to encourage , pressures exerted upon it by such persons . HOXIE N. FAIRCHILD , Professor of English , Hunter College . New York , Sept. 12 , 1957 . To Aid Fight on Delinquency To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , city officials ? all categories of our citizenry have expressed opinions on the most efficacious methods of handling the problems of juvenile delinquency . With a massing of resources to combat this evil there is every reason to believe that techniques will be developed that will reduce substantially the volume of criminal acts and the severity of the offenses perpetrated by wayward youngsters . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Would it be ungrateful for me to suggest in comment on your editorial of Sept. 11 about my resignation from The Daily Worker and Cornmunist party , that there are others in greater need than I am of " an amnesty from public opinion " and who are in a far more " difficult personal and material situation " than I am ? It was a striving for justice that impelled me and others to join the Communist party . It was a revulsion against the injustices of Stalinist communism which impelled so many of us to leave . Nothing appalled me more about the Soviet Union than the suppression of " dangerous " books and ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials of Trotzky , Zinoviev , Bukharin and other Bolshevik leaders were dastardly frame-ups , as were the Rajk , Kostov and Siansky trials . But in our own country there are men in jail whose " crime " is political association and connection with " dangerous " books and thoughts , I have in mind , especially , two old personal friends , Gilbert Green and Henry Winston , ( I do not wish to infer that they are sympathetic to my present views . ) Both are serving five-year sentences under the Smith Act and , additionally , threeyear sentences for contempt of court . Acts of Violence Denied Both Green and Winston were convicted for teaching and advocating the need for violent overthrow of the Government . But the record of their trial , and of all other Smith Act trials , will show no connection with any deeds of violence or of any appeals for violent overthrow . " Dangerous " books by Marx , Lenin and others were brought in evidence against Winston and Green . Their three-year contempt sentences were imposed for failing to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Supreme Court is now considering this issue . But rarely have actual criminals sentenced for contempt received such harsh terms ; usually there is a oneyear maximum . Recent court rulings give ground ' for confidence that Justice Hugo Black was right when he said in his dissent in the case involving Green land Winston that the time will come when passions subside and the whole of the Smith Act will be repudiated because it violates the First Amendment . Meanwhile it could only help our country if Winston and Green received amnesty not only from public opinion  --  I do n't think the public has been given the facts in their case  --  but amnesty from those who can open prison doors and allow them to rejoin their families . JOSEPH CLARK . New York , Sept. 11 , 1957 . America 's " First Children " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : To those boys and girls who are the first of their race to apply for admission to integrated public high schools we all are indebted . They ' seem to me the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock , Ark. , and faced by National Guard riflemen , or in Greensboro , N. C. , and spat upon , or whether they were more lucky and encountered no overt humiliation , they are all old enough to have had a lively comprehension of what they were or might have been in for . But they were hardly equipped by age with the poise , self-confidence or just plain callousness to avoid the most dreadful apprehensions of this heartless form of applied intolerance . Anyone who has seen with what forebodings any normal child approaches commencing a new and different school , even when he should reasonably anticipate only the most cordial and understanding reception from his fellows and from the school administration , can imagine the bravery of these other kids . What a testimonial they offer to the value of acquiring the very best education possible at whatever sacrifice ! I do n't know the specifications used by the Carnegie Committee in making their annual hepoism awards , but I would like to nominate for consideration these First Children of the Land . ROBERT E. LAWTFER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : . On Aug. 25 The New York Times published an important news item which accurately described recent actions by the Guatemalan Congress , and the rebirth of the Left-Wing political groups . The steps taken by the Congress for advancing the date of the Presidential election Were maneuvers designed to hamper the organization of independent and opposition parties . These semi-unconstitutional tricks may provoke disorders which would blacken the record of the Provisional Government . When the Government of Colonel Arbenz collapsed in 1954 the Left Wingers remaining in Guatemala were deeply divided into two groups. : the Communists and the nonConse munists . The Communists were able to infiltrate the Government of Colonel Castillo Armas , taking advantage of his policy of reunifying the Guatemalan people . This caused the separation from his Government of many of his companions in the Movement of National Liberation . The " Movimiento Democratic ? Nacional " party is entirely supported by official funds . It controls Congress through Congressmen who were " nominated " instead of elected by the voters . Although this party includes distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Communists who remained in Guatemala , and who are , indeed , responsible for the murder of President Carlos Castillo Armas . Strong Bloc The non-Communist Left-Wingers kept a wait-and-see policy , and it is not surprising that now they should present a strong political bloc that will make its strength felt in the forthcoming Congressional and Presidential elections . Their non-Communist political principles bring them close to the majority of the Guatemalan population , which is democratic , anti-Communist and Christian . These people , properly led , may well come to govern Guatemala , setting aside extremists and class struggles , and seeking the betterment of the urban and rural worker ; at the same time supporting capital for the production of national wealth . I feel privileged to have many of these groups joining me in the movement of " redencion nacional " ( Redemption of Our National Heritage ) for the coming Presidential election . The Guatemalan people do not ask for extreme reforms ; they desire law and order in the form of education , food , health and interAmerican friendship . MIGUEL YnIGORAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aug. 27 , 1957 . Public Library Activities Praised To THE EDITOR OF Tits NEW YORK TIMES : Do the people of New York realize the opportunities offered them by the New York Public Library ? On Sept. 10 I attended there a lecture on water-color by James Ernst , intended for beginners . In every way it was an interesting experience . The audience itself was fascinating . Many apparently came directly from work . There were young and old , some teachers , some experienced water-colorists , many just wishing , one man who had been a watercolorist in Russia for ten years , now a waiter . White and colored , side by , side , listened and watched , absorbed . An enriching experience altogether , for which there was no charge , no requirement of any kind . Any New York resident who does not explore the opportunities offered by the New York Public Library is cheating himself . ADELAIDE RICHARDSON , New York , Sept. 11 , 1957. must challenge every responsible citizen of our community . And it is with this thought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in to contribute their time and effort in the intense campaign that will have , to be waged on all fronts if the issue is to be fought aggressively . Retired city workers from the police , the legal department , the social agencies  --  and the courts can help . And chiefly the retired school teachers can be of assistance . These teachers know something of the consequences of the broken home . They have had daily contact with youngsters in the 14-to-18-age group and know what makes them behave as they do . Certainly advantage should be taken now of their experience and know-how . The retirement law may have to be amended to permit the city to use the services of its older workers . Is n't it worth a try ? ALEXANDER KAYLIN , New York , Sept. 8 , 1957 . To Free Jailed Communists Amnesty Asked for Winston and Green , Convicted Under Smith Act New System Said to Be Worked Out , to Be Operated Without Deficit To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of Sept. 12 entitled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of the transit problem in the New York metropolitan area . You note with dismay " a negative , fault-finding attitude " among critics of the plan submitted by Arthur W. Page , Project Director of the Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission . Not all of the criticism is negative . Some is directed to the " negative " attitude of the Page plan itself . This plan is couched in the phrases of transit progress . But the application of the ideas behind those phrases is so minimal that it amounts to negation of the whole concept of transit progress . A great advance has been made in the thinking in this field in the last ten years , especially by a group of transportation executives , manufacturing engineers and transit specialists . This group , spurred by the deadlock arising from the assumption that rapid transit must be a deficit operation , worked out a new system of transit which can be operated without a deficit . Transportation Provided Furthermore , it would provide mile-a-minute transportation in airconditioned rubber-tired trains to all parts of the metropolitan area within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . It could be underground in the city and on structure or at ground-level outside , It should substantially reduce the use of private motor cars by commuters , thus materially relieving traffic congestion on the streets and highways . It would not compete with the city 's own transit system because it is designed primarily , to handle the commuter traffic . A similar plan has been approved by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission , and California has passed legislation under which a Transit District to implement the plan in the Bay area is now being organized . The Page plan ignores all of this progress and recommends the extension into New Jersey ( it also ignores the rest of the metropolitan area ) of facilities designed in the last century  --  facilities which have amply proved their inability to meet the traffic problems of this century . The issues are set forth in my statement made to the commission at its hearing in Newark on Sept. 10 . Like so many of the other critics of the Page plan , we are aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wholly inadequate solution is necessary if we are to have an adequate solution . HENRY K. NORTON , Retired Chairman of the Board , New York , Susquehanna and Western Railroad Company . New York , Sept. 13 , 1957 . Politics in Guatemala Presidential Candidate Declares Baia People Reject Extremism For Curb on . Littering To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : * In the states of Washington and Oregon  --  and also in the national parks  --  a bag is given to the motorist for trash disposal . Then every ten miles there is a receptacle at the side of the road and an appropriate sign . Fines for throwing anything out the window are from $10 to $150 in the various states . It would he a splendid thing for New York and other Eastern states to establish the bag-and-receptacle routine . That would make it habitual for motorists to practice what the officials preach .
