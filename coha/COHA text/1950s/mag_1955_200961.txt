All week long , the diplomats and states men came and went . Not only in Washington and New York , but across the nation , citizens got unaccustomed glimpses of the traveling salesmen of East and West who had come to the U.S. to consult on plans for a changing world and to at tend the tenth birthday party of the United Nations ( see UNITED NATIONS ) . <P> India 's Krishna Menon was the first to arrive . Fresh from Peking , he carried a proposition from the Red Chinese . Its gist : Chou Enlai , fearing U.S retaliation , has given up the notion of forcibly taking Formosa . The Red Chinese had shown their peaceful intentions by releasing four U.S. flyers ( TIME , June 13 ) ; soon , Menon cooed , he thought the eleven other flyers still held prisoner in China would be released , too . In return , Menon hinted , it might be helpful if the Chinese Nationalists quietly abandoned Quemoy and Matsu . <P> Goo-Goo Eyes . Hard on Menon 's heels was Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Germany , too , and Adenauer wanted to consult his American friends on coordinated action . In informal talks Adenauer , Secretary Dulles and the President reached complete agreement on the steps to be taken . Adenauer would " probably " accept his invitation to the Kremlin , but not until after the Geneva summit conference in July and not until the Russians had answered three pointed questions : 1 ) What does Russia propose to do about the German prisoners of war still behind the Iron Curtain ? 2 ) What plans does Russia have for revising Germany 's eastern frontier ? and 3 ) What do the Russians intend to do about reunifying Germany ? <P> The tough old Chancellor firmly rejected any notion that he might buy unification by neutralizing the German state . Said he : " Such a bargain is absolutely impossible , both for us , the Germans , and for Europe . " <P> Fellow Travelers . By all odds the most interesting VIP to arrive in the U.S. last week was Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov . It was difficult indeed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant little dinner parties for democratic diplomats in Bandung , or Khrushchev reeling with conviviality in Belgrade - but Molotov 's change of pace was almost unbelievable . Twenty years of treachery and invective toward the West had made Molotov a symbol of the fanatic , devious , hate-filled Old Bolshevik . Now , like good Communists everywhere , he was suddenly trying to win friends and influence people by sweetness and light . <P> " We are fellow travelers on a calmer sea , " he told New York Times Editor Charles Merz during a chance encounter on " A " deck of the Queen Elizabeth . Arriving in the U.S. for the first time in 8 years , he had serene " greetings " for " the people of the world-famous city of New York , and with them all those in the United States who are in favor of lasting peace , international cooperation and consolidation of friendship . " Molotov went sightseeing , had some pleasant comments to make about American paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art ( see ART ) .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
