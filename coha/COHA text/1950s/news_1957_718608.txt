txt New efforts are being made to close legal loopholes by which highly paid stale officials are retiring on sizable pensions based partly on years of service in low - paying , part - time local prici Spur for the drive is supplied by the application of Leo M. Harlow , Deputy Secretary of State , for retirement on a pension of 65 per cent of his $10,895 post . His more than 30 years service record includes 22 years as town moderator of Easton. the Harlow application follows quickly on the heels of the retirement of 47-year-old Henry P. as director of the Korean Bonus Division on a $6,261-a-year pension after Attorney General George Fingold 's ruling that his nine years a Westwood call fireman were " creditable service " years under the pension law . Rede fin ing Sought Highly concerned that the retirement Nvil I lead to heavy retirement requests from others with call fireman or similar part-time service and a serious drain on the pension system , Representative Charles H. Anthony ( R ) of Haverhill is stepping up his campaign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirements in the future . He has the backing of Senator Philip A. Graham ( R ) of Hamilton and Representative Charles F. Holman ( R ) of Norwood . who , like Mr. Anthony , are considered legislative experts on the pension system . All three were members of the Special Commission on Retirement Systems and Pensions which in 1955 recomMended a drastic revision of the pension laws to make them more understandable and to eliminate loopholes considered injurious to the system 's future . New Ratio Proposed Mr. Anthony is pushing for a new definition under which to be credited for pension put -- poses earnings totaling at least $2,000 a year would have to be built up . Thus , if a call fireman had 10 years of call fireman ; : ervice at $200 a year as part of his total service record , he would actually be credited with only one year of " creditable service " for those 10 years for pension purposes . Likewise , if a retiring employee worked for several years in a town position paying only $500 a year , it would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditable service . Mr. Holman today asserted that , while the pension was perfectly legal , " it empha sizes that the present law is wrong . " Mr. Anthony said that unless a new definition of creditable service is adopted the pension system will be seriously undermined in the future to the detriment of others in the system . However , all three advocates of a new definition pointed out that the special commission of which they were members included a similar redefinition in their voluminous 1955 report but that the House killed the entire pension revision plan without ' any real consideration . The commission recommended no creditable service be allowed in the future for any calendar year in which annual compensation is less than $1,000 . Explaining the proposal , the commission said : " Although benefits are provided in respect to years of service in which compensation is less than $1,000 , they are related only to actual earnings during such period instead of to final salary , which is the basis for benefits due to creditable service . . . . Basic Aim Underlined " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide benefits for full-time permanent employees for whom employment with the state or political subdivision is their principal source of earnings . However , it is recognized that there are certain part-time employees who may contribute a long period of service and receive only nominal compensation , for whom some amount of retirement benefit should equitably be provided . " For full-time permanent employees the commission is recommending benefits based upon final salary in order to secure benefits which are realistic in relation to retirement needs . However , it was felt that it would be unreasonable to allow benefits based upon final salary and all years of service , including periods of part-time service , where a person had a combination of such employment . The problem therefore resolVed around the level of compensation below which earnings obviously could not constitute the main source of a person 's support . " The sum of $1,000 was decided upon as the amount of compensation that would be required in order that service should be counted on a full basis toward regular benefits . It was further decided that benefits would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to each year 's earnings . "
