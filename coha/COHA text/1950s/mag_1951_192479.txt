THE LIMIT ( 256 pp. ) - Ada Leverson-Norton ( $3 ) . <P> <P> " The wittiest woman in the world , " said Oscar Wilde of Ada Leverson . Others who admired Ada 's sparkle were Max Beerbohm , Aubrey Beardsley , Henry James and George Bernard Shaw ( whom she succeeded as drama critic of the Saturday Review ) . Venomous with bores , she flattened them joyfully . When a vacation acquaintance buttonholed her with " I do n't know whether you realize it ... but my aunt was a Thunderby , " Ada cried , " Oh , how terrible ! Ought n't we to inform the management ? " Accused of using peroxide on her hair , she flashed that she " only darkened it a little at the roots . " <P> Ada Leverson died in 1936 , deaf , but witty to the last . In addition to her dramatic criticism , she left six novels and at least one unfinished work-to be entitled ( she said ) The Collected Telegrams of Oscar Wilde . Her third novel , The Limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . It is a fine example of the Leverson specialty : Edwardian laughter with an edge to it . <P> Like most novels of its period , The Limit deals with fashionable ladies &; gentlemen-mostly too well off to worry about having nothing to do . Among them : # &182; Miss Luscombe , a woolly-headed , stage-struck creature who nonetheless has an eye for hard cash . " She lives in the clouds , but she insists on their having a silver lining . " <P> # &182; Mrs. Wyburn and Miss Westbury , two elderly pussies whose skill in exchanging tattle and insults is so practiced that it is sometimes hard to know which is speaking . When one has clawed the other a particularly deep swipe , she always follows up with the stinging antiseptic , e.g. " I do assure you , Millie , I never dreamt of hurting your feelings . " <P> # &182; Mynheer von Stoendyck , a Belgian inventor whose perfect command of the English language is simply not credited by his British hostess . She helpfully translates everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters whirl around the edges of The Limit like the fringe on a parasol . But at the center , holding the story up , stands Romer Wyburn , one of those proverbial Britons who scarcely ever open their mouths . " I thought he was a strong silent man , a man with an orange up his sleeve , " complains his flighty wife ( whom he adores ) , " but I 've never seen the orange . " Romer silently ignores her affair with a playboy until , reaching " the limit , " he suddenly fetches out of his sleeve not an orange but a sledge hammer . One blow from Romer and the dancing characters around him disintegrate like glass toys . <P> Like its characters , The Limit has a wholly unprofessional air . Chapters are skittishly allotted first to one set of people , then to another . The stern " line " and " unity " of a Flaubert ( or of a professional instructor in how-to-write-a-novel ) is replaced by the skilled amateur 's best tool-a skewer of personal touch and bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obsessed by character analysis and an urge to get to the bottom of everything , The Limit should bring two salutary reminders : 1 ) actions speak louder than words ; 2 ) the agony of creation belongs to the author , not the reader .
