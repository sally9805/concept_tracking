The 16 White House newsmen who normally dog the President 's footsteps decided they could take a breather one afternoon last week . Knowing that Harry Truman was taking a nap and that his next scheduled move was a trip to Arlington National Cemetery , most of them went to lunch off the White House beat . Only a handful were in the White House pressroom when the biggest spot news story of the week broke at Blair-Lee House ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . <P> Their first notice of trouble came when a hatless Secret Serviceman dashed down the hall past the pressroom . The newsmen chased after him down the long block to <P> Blair House , and saw the wounded lying in the street . <P> " No Other Details . . . " International News Service 's Robert G. Nixon was the first to flag his office . But I.N.S. , working on a telephone tip , had already put out a bulletin at 2:24 p.m. and scored the kind of beat over its wire-service rivals that press-association men love to boast about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their officers has been shot in front of the Blair House , official residence of President Truman . No other details were immediately available . " <P> United Press 's Merriman ( " Thank you Mr. President " ) Smith , on his way back from lunch when the shooting began , was also beaten-by U.P . Police Reporter Bryce Burke , who picked up the news at police headquarters . U.P . ' s bulletin went out at 2:26 . Associated Press 's Sterling Green got to the scene with I.N.S. 's Nixon , but waited a few minutes to get a few more details before he called in from a drugstore . A.P . ' s bulletin time : 2:32 . Its text : " Three men-possibly four-were shot today in a gun battle in front of the President 's home , the Blair House . " Not till about 3 o'clock did reporters pull enough facts together to put out the news that an assassination had been attempted . <P> " It Was Kaleidoscopic . " In all the excitement , the 200 newsmen who swarmed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the facts . I.N.S. collared General Electric Co. ' s President Charles E. Wilson , who happened to be driving by , got a somewhat incoherent eyewitness account . Said Wilson : " It was kaleidoscopic . . . " Another eyewitness wildly reported : " The President kept poking his head out the window and then they 'd take another shot at him . " Some of the photographers , who had arrived too late for good shots , had to resort to such hoary stunts as posing reporters pointing to a picket in the fence that had been sheared by a bullet ( see cut ) . Three hours later , the Secret Service finally straightened out the facts at a conference with White House reporters . Next day , at the President 's regular conference , New York Daily News Reporter Jack Doherty tossed up a question . Would the President , like Franklin Roosevelt , * give his own account of what happened ? Snapped Harry Truman : You can read all about it in your own papers . <P>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
