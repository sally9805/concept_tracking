Mamma never had any favorites , but if she had , I guess Elizabeth would have been the one . &nbsp; JIMMIE ( sotto voce ) She was n't her favorite . &nbsp; ROBBIEShhhh ! The Stephens react to Robbie 's cover-up . Mr. and Mrs. Stephens stare at Elizabeth , then turn to each other . &nbsp; MR . STEPHENS ( quietly ) You would n't care to shoulder this responsibility , would you , Grace ? &nbsp; MRS . STEPHENSWould n't I just ! She jumps down out of the cutter , holds out her arms to Elizabeth . Both boys are afraid of Elizabeth 's reaction .

THE EUNSON CABIN - LATE AFTERNOON As the boys come out of the house with Jane . They close the door carefully behind them . Two sleds stand at the foot of the steps and , nearby , the snowman with the tam set rakishly on one side of its head . Robbie lifts Jane onto one sled , tucks her beneath a blanket . Then he takes down his skates which hang beside the door . Their runners turn up to support tinkling bells . Robbie puts skates on the sled . Jimmie stands looking down at him . &nbsp; ROBBIEBetter skedaddle , or first thing you know ole Runyon 'll get you . Jimmie does not move . &nbsp; ROBBIE ( cont 'd ) ( looking up at him ) You like ' em all right , do n't you ? &nbsp; JIMMIELike who ? &nbsp; ROBBIEThe Raidens.  --  168  --  &nbsp; JIMMIEI like ' em all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JIMMIEAll those girls !

Lemme go ! &nbsp; ROBBIENot till you say you 're cute . &nbsp; JIMMIE ( with disgust ) All right . I 'm cute . Both boys rise , brush off the snow , straighten their clothes . This is the moment they have dreaded , and they do not know what to do with it . &nbsp; JIMMIE ( looking down at Jane ) Sorry I popped you , Robbie . &nbsp; ROBBIE ( also staring at Jane ) I had it comin ' to me . But you ought a watch your temper .  --  169  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and stare at the house .

( begins to grin ) An ' do n't start wearin ' dresses with all those girls around . &nbsp; JIMMIEYou shut up ! Jimmie picks up the rope to the red sled and starts off . CAMERA HOLDS on him as he rounds the corner of the house . Just before he disappears from sight he turns to wave , then exits . Now CAMERA PANS TO spot where Robbie and Jane have been . They are gone . We see Robbie 's foot-prints in the snow . CAMERA DOLLIES INTO CLOSE SHOT of the snowman with its jaunty tam . DISSOLVE TO 123 INT . THE TYLER DINING ROOM - DAY . As seen through window . Annabelle and Mrs. Tyler are clearing the table of the Christmas dinner . Both are smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes . Directly we see two mittened hands reach for the window sill and then the back of Robbie 's head as he pulls himself up and looks in the window . Neither Annabelle nor Mrs. Tyler sees him and in a moment , his head disappears . WIPE TO  --  170  --  124 EXT . THE RAIDEN FRONT DOOR - DAY Jimmie reluctantly approaches . He raises his hand to knock and then pauses . A bachelor 's freedom is something he relinquishes reluctantly . But what must be must be . He knocks . Almost instantly the door flies open and the twins stand there looking their astonishment and delight . Each one grabs an arm , pulls him into the house as the other three girls swarm around him and the door closes . DISSOLVE TO 125 EXT . FOX RIVER - LATER AFTERNOON In a SERIES OF SHOTS we see the poignant Christmas journey . It is a magic experience , poetic , almost picture book , legendary , with nothing eerie about it . Through a SERIES of DISSOLVES AND CUTS - IN LONG SHOTS AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . As darkness closes in , it begins to snow . Pulling the sled behind him , Jane begins to whimper and Robbie stops to wipe her nose and comfort her . As he trudges on , finally she sleeps . DISSOLVE TO 126 EXT . THE FOX RIVER - NIGHT - LONG SHOT Out of the darkness appears dimly the plodding figure of Robbie pulling the sled . He walks into a CLOSE SHOT , stops , looks off . 127 EXT . A MODEST HOME ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER - NIGHT - LONG SHOT Snow falls over scene , making it almost a Grandma Moses picture postcard . One window of the little salt box house is brightened by a Christmas tree . 128 CLOSE - ROBBIE AND JANE As he decides this is the house to try . He pulls the sled gently out of scene . 129 MED SHOT - THE HOUSE ON THE RIVER As Robbie pulls the sled toward it . Now we hear the SOUND of a family singing a Christmas carol . Robbie drops the wooden tongue of the sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 171  --  130 CLOSE SHOT - ROBBIE BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE CAMERA FOLLOWS him BACK to sled . He lifts the sleeping Jane , carries her to the door . It opens . He and the baby are bathed in light from the interior . In the doorway stands MRS . CLARY , a pleasant , jolly , motherly woman . She looks down , sees the incongruous pair . &nbsp; MRS . CLARYWell , for the mercy 's sake ! &nbsp; ROBBIE ( tired ) Please ma'am , I wonder if you 'd care to have a baby . She opens the door wide , beckons for them to enter , then closes the door gently behind them . CAMERA HOLDS ON the door , as the theme of the Christmas carol , orchestrated and with a chorus , swells . As it does so , night turns to day , the snow stops falling , the sun 's rays brighten the door . Then the MUSIC proceeds diminuendo . The door opens . Robbie , in his mackinaw , steps out , followed by Mrs. Clary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be all right ? &nbsp; ROBBIE ( smiling - really happy ) Oh yes , ma'am . I like working for Mr. Cullen . I 'll be fine . &nbsp; MRS . CLARYWell , do n't worry about your baby sister . We 'll treat her like she was our own . &nbsp; ROBBIEThanks , Mrs. Clary . He starts off .  --  172  --  &nbsp; MRS . CLARYYou come see her sometime ... &nbsp; ROBBIE ( without turning ) Yes , ma'am . And I 've got four others to see , too ! Robbie runs off . 131 ANOTHER ANGLE - FROM MRS . CLARY 'S P.O.V. The boy runs down to the river , crosses it , and begins to climb - slower now - the opposite bank . And now as THE END is slowly superimposed over scene , Robbie finds winding path into the trees and climbs steadily , disappearing , reappearing . And as he climbs , the Christmas carol segues into the theme and incidental sounds of our Tone Poem of the Woods , growing louder and louder , as the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forest .
