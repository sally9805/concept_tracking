As they begged alms last week in the Japanese city of Kobe , Zen Buddhist monks from the great temple of Shofukuji ( Good Omen ) met an unusual reception . Instead of showing reverence , people cracked seemingly typical Zen koans ( problem riddles ) . " You look like the one who was admiring nude pictures , " giggled one housewife , slamming the door in a novice priest 's face . Snapped another tart-tongued woman : " Wash out your mind before I fill your bowl . " <P> The sneers and jeers were caused by the worst scandal in the temple 's 300-year history . Last June Photographer Mikio Tsuchiya got permission to record life in the temple , planned impressive exhibits in the U.S. , where enthusiasm for Zen 's ego-smashing techniques has become a semi-religious phenomenon ( TIME , Feb. 4 , 1957 et seg . ) . Tsuchiya expected to find the temple 's 30 pate-shaven novices undergoing the most Spartan life imaginable , for Zen is the harshest branch of Buddhism , and Shofukuji itself has a reputation as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photographer Tsuchiya published his pictures . Samples : loinclothed priests playing mah-jongg instead of sitting in immobile meditation , a priest drinking with a bar hostess , two novices staggering along a Kobe street late at night with a barmaid between them . Tsuchiya quoted one priest as saying : " By listening to good music and gazing on ikibosatu the living Buddha , I feel I can understand the teachings . " This wisdom was Tsuchiya 's caption for a photograph of the same priest happily gaping at pictures of virtually naked women . <P> Amid the general shock , some novices made matters worse by loud self-justification ( in itself an unZen act ) . Wailed one : " When we sit long hours in meditation , the blood tends to collect around our loins . It 's natural for us to seek outlets . " That was no surprise to some cynical Japanese , who say that novice Zen priests often slip anchor at night after the temple supervisor goes home . Many steer straight for the local brothel , where the madam courteously bundles them inside without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the temple , wolfing down undercover banquets to fatten a temple diet of soybean soup and boiled radishes . <P> At week 's end the embarrassed temple council set about saving face in the best Japanese tradition . Photographer Tsuchiya agreed to apologize publicly and destroy all his negatives . The two novices pictured most revealingly agreed to expulsion-and then reinstatement . Head Priest Mumon Yamada blamed it all on an influx of university-trained novices who lack moral fiber . Lamented Yamada : It was not so in the old days , when novices were poor boys without education or appetite for soft living .
