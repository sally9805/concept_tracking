" As for myself , " wrote the president of the $35 million North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Co. in 1948 , regarding his tour of 15 European countries , " I shall always feel grateful that my ancestors were transplanted to North America . It is the best place in the world that I have found to live and leave one 's mark . " The president 's name was Charles Clinton Spaulding . Last week , at the age of 78 , he died in Durham , N.C. And the mark he left was a high mark , made with a very long reach , for Charles Spaulding was a Negro , the son of slaves , born in a North Carolina log cabin ten years after emancipation . <P> Instead of Charity . At 20 , Charles struck out from the farm for Durham , because Durham had a colored school that went up to the eighth grade . At night he washed dishes ( at $10 a month ) in a hotel , after spending his days in school with a classful of youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle and a barber decided to form the nation 's first Negro life insurance company because they were fed up with the custom of " Pass the hat so we can bury this brother . " They took on Charles as their first agent . <P> Selling insurance to the colored people of North Carolina was a matter of squeezing nickel and dime payments from disbelieving clients across the countryside . Stunned by the untimely death of an early client ( six weeks after his first payment ) , the owners had to dig in their own pockets to pay off the $40 policy . But the payment gave them a reputation and sent Spaulding hurrying over to the nearest agent of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. to learn about life expectancies . <P> The insurance company thrived , especially after it began putting ads on cuspidors and clinical thermometers . The founders branched out into the Mechanics and Farmers Bank , and in the early ' 20s Spaulding became president of the bank and president of the insurance company .

Through it all he lived his faith in U.S. capitalism , a hard-tested faith that survived taunts of Negroes who hated him for his genial cooperation with whites , and taunts of whites who hated his prosperity . <P> A Pattern to Follow . " I was well on my way to success before I ever left the farm , " he once wrote . " My father had already taught me the most important lessons I have ever learned . . . Benjamin Spaulding believed in the promise of America . He never became disillusioned because , unlike so many , he had never expected something for nothing . His success story is vastly more impressive than mine could ever be , because-starting with the Emancipation-he had to work out a completely new pattern of existence . All I have had to do was to try to follow the excellent pattern he developed . "                  @ @ @
