Letters to The Times To Meet World Crisis Attempt at Appeasement Seen , Queries Posed Regarding Recent Letter To THE EDITOR OF Tan NEW YORK Timm : Your letter columns of Jan. 1 started the new year with one of the naivest attempts at Soviet appeasement I have ever noticed . The twelve-point program of Prof. Karl Loewenstein of Amherst is so full of mere assumptions , confused opinions and unproved assertions that it would take several columns to list its errors and dangerous half-truths . Permit me to refer to but a few of its absurdities . How does . Professon Loewenstein know that our war in Korea " serves no purpose " ? Is it not possible that it may lead to universal guerrilla warfare against Mao 's Moscow-sponsored tyranny ? Do the principles of the United Nations Charter " serve no pur-pose " ? Why should we " abstain from pressurizing " our " preference among the United Nations members " concerning Formosa ? When , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power without forfeiting its greatness ? If Formosa is vital to the victory in Asia , why abdicate our leadership ? Are n't we footing the bills , in men and materiel , anyhow ? Is n't Professor Loewenstein 's plea for admission of the Peiping regime to the United Nations an insult to the American nation , whose sons are being murdered by the Red hordes ? The suggestion to transfer the United Nations Korean forces to Germany recalls rather vividly the " Bring the Boys Home " campaign which , following World War II , helped in securing the Kremlin 's Far Eastern victories . By proposing another four-Rower conference Dr. Loewenstein seems to imply that the words of the Kremlin gangsters can be trusted and ignores the Machiavellian tactics of the Politburo to which we have been exposed all these years . The demand for " reviving the Potsdam Agreement " probably takes the prize in impractical theorizing . More than sixty official agreements have been broken by the Soviets , since 1945 ; but Professor Loewenstein 's faith in the trustworthiness of the Politburo seems to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free Western Germany with Moscow-controlled Eastern Germany is an invitation to open the gates of free Germany to the Communist Trojan horse . George C. Marshall was commissioned to do something of this sort in China , in 1946 . The lesson of his failure should be obvious . It is not to Dr. Loewenstein . His other points do not add anything basic that is not already being done by our Government . Their tenor is the same : Professor Loewenstein minimizes the Soviet threat and misrepresents our national awakening as " war hysteria . " He does not give any inkling of how we might get to the root of the matter and destroy the Kremlin source of power ; he endeavors to lull us into a dangerous slumber by reiterating the worn-out tale that the Soviets are n't so bad and that plenty is wrong on our side . That , I am afraid , is hardly the way to win the biggest war of our history . FELIX WITTMER . Upper Montclair , N. J. , Jan. 4 , lun . A. M. A. Gift to Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a letter published in THE NEW YORK TIMES Dec. 26. 1950 , George D. Braden refers to the American Medical Association 's proposal to promote private aid to the nation 's medical schools and the association 's contribution of a half-million-dollar nucleus for this year 's fund as a constructive approach to medical problems . Professor Braden , however , raises several questions , the basic one being " whether- A. M. A. subsidies will be free of the dangers that it has argued could come from federal control . " In announcing the A. M. A. 's contribution the board of trustees specifically stated : " This fund will be given to the medical schools for their unrestricted use in their basic training of future physicians . " This means that no strings of any kind are being attached to this ? fund . Each medical school will be free to determine for itself how it can ? best use its share of the fund to maintain and improve its educational program . The activities of all medical schools , whether they are departments of a university or independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees . The establishment of this fund will in no way alter the fact that these representatives of the public will in the future , as in the past , have the responsibility for determining that the medical schools are conducted in keeping with the best interest of the public . DONALD G. ANDERSON , M. D. , Secretary , American Medical Association . Chicago , Jan. 5 , 1951 . Taft Speech Commended To THE EDITOR OF THE Now YORK Tans : May I place myself on record as wholeheartedly rejoicing over the wisdom and splendid Americanism that Senator Taft showed in his really historic speech ? He has shown that he has passed from his honorary title , " Mr. Republican , " ' and can now be better named " Mr. America . " It is an absurdity that a President can send out soldiers to fight wherever he feels inclined . By not declaring war President Truman attempts to bypass the right of Congress over this fearful issue . Too long have the Administrations of Roosevelt and Truman by-passed Congress and have stolen from the people the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been handled by treaties , but which these . two Administrations have treated as though they were the whole business of a small clique . Thus Yalta , Potsdam , etc. , gave away the victory won by American soldiers . Never in history had such a crime to the citizens been enacted . Senator Taft , with his fair judgment , through investigation and genuine Americanism will wake America to its rights and how they have been destroyed . RUTH PARRIsii , Brooklyn , Jan. 7 , 1951 . Salaries of Court Reporters Increases Askei for Those Who Are Attached to City Courts To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Association of Official Court Reporters of the City of New York is an organization composed of official court reporters who are employed in the folm lowing courts of the City of New York : City Court , Municipal Court , Magistrates ' Court , Court of Special Sessions , Court of Domestic Relations . Court reporters in the aforementioned courts are selected after a competitive civil service examination given by the Municipal Civil Service Commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these courts are fixed by the Board of Estimate . The salaries of City Court employes , including court reporters , are fixed by the Board of Justices of the City Court . A court reporter receives no regular increases in salary ( in some cases twelve years passed without a single increase ) , and there are no opportunities for advancement . However , the responsibility of a court reporter is very great . Upon his skill and ability depend the protection of an individual 's freedom or property . Compensation should be commensurate with the great importance of the duties of a court reporter . This view is not taken by the City of New York . At the present time salaries for the majority of court reporters in the aforementioned courts range from $3,900 to $4,320 per annum . A small minority in the Magistrates ' and City Courts receive salaries in excess of these figures . Certainly there should be no differentiation in the salaries of court reporters in " City " courts who are appointed from the same list established by the Municipal Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salaries paid to official court reporters in the Supreme Court , County Courts and Surrogates ' Courts in New York City ( in some of these courts the Board of Estimate fixes the salaries ) , which range from $6,650 to $7,700 per annum . Examination of court reporters for these " State " courts is conducted by the New York State Department of Civil Service , but their salaries are wholly paid by New York City , with a few exceptions . It ? should be noted that the arduous and exacting , duties of a court reporter are exactly the same whether he be employed in the " City " courts or in the " State " courts . Nevertheless , the interests of justice demand that a perfect verbatim record of every trial be presented to an appellate court for review , regardless of whether it comes from one of the " City " courts or one of the " State " courts . Other cities acknowledge the importance and responsibility of official court reporters by paying adequate salaries . For example , regardless of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles or in San Francisco receives $6,000 per annum ; Allegheny County , Pennsylvania ( which includes Pittsburgh ) , pays $6,250 per annum ; Detroit pays $5,800 ; Philadelphia pays $5,900 per annum , and in New Jersey all official court reporters receive $7,500 , with Supervisors receiving $9,000 . Throughout the State of New York court reporters in the Supreme Court receive $6,647.50 , with the exception of those employed in the First and Second Judicial Districts , who receive higher salaries . In view of the foregoing , we propose that the minimum salary for official court reporters in the " City " courts be fixed at $6,650 per annum . Equity demands that this prOposlil receive favorable consideration from the salaryfixing officials . PAUL SIMONE , President , Association of Official Court Reporters of the City ? of New York . New York , Jan. 3 , 1951 . Health-Service Needs To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of Dec. 19 , 1950 , on " Medical Manpower " deserves commendation on at least two counts . " Unified planning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual physician and dentist within his own community . " A " Coordinated " plan should better serve both military and civilian needs in health-service matters . Planning , by experts , promises efficiency . Twice your editorial refers to " physicians and dentists , " which is in striking contrast to the common use of such careless phrases as " doctors and dentists . " My delight in the correct use of the English language was of short duration . Three days later I was surprised to read about " doctors , dentists " in a report published in your Jan. 1 issue .

Praise for the Dutch To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Hats off to the Dutch people for accepting the aged displaced persons , ' although these people have nothing to offer in return ! It is action like this that will mark the final decision between democracy and communism . J. TED Davis . Whiteland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
