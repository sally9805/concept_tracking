When Francisco Pizarro 's conquistadores began pushing their way up the coastal valleys of Peru , a fourth of them sickened and died of a strange fever . Others suffered for months from hideous warts . <P> In those same valleys , the fever and the warts still linger-a threat to strangers , though seldom to the natives . One fever outbreak killed 7,000 workmen and stopped the building of a railroad . But for 300 years the connection between the fever and the warts was unrecognized . Then in 1885 , Daniel Carrin , a medical student , inoculated himself with fluid from a patient 's warts . He fell ill of the fever and died . In his honor , the fever and the warts were lumped together as Carrion 's disease . Still there was no cure . <P> Last week , Peruvian and U.S. doctors reported that Carrin 's disease has been virtually defeated . It is spread by sand-flies , which bite mainly at night , and it attacks the native Indians in mild form in childhood . The severer cases in later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complication similar to typhoid fever . These cases , the doctors report , can be controlled by Chloromycetin . Streptomycin checks the warts .
