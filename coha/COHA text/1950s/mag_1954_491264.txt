. The Incredible Captain Kennedy By RICHARD THRUELSEN The City of New York  --  veteran of the Byrd antarctic expedition  --  was the last all-sail schooner in the freighting trade when Capt . Louis Kenedy took her to Barbados in 1944 . With seven aboard , she ran into a violent storm , tremendous seas  --  and tragedy . Here 's the exciting story of that famous ship 's last gallant achievements . CONCLUSION D T was the day before Christmas . 1944 . The City of New York . a chunky , 3110-ton cargo schooner , was slogging slowly norl hward on a run from Turks Island , in the lower Bahamas , to Halifax , with a load of loose salt . Aboard The City , in addition to its young skipper , Louis Kenedy , were a mate , a cook and four hands . Two of these hands were youngsters ? one a Nova Scotian boy who was making his first trip to sea and the other a young British West Indian from Antigua who had sailed with Captain Kenedy for some time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the skipper 's help . - We had cleared from Turks Island on December fifteenth , " relates Captain Kenedy , " and hadmade a slow passage against the trades and through the horse latitudes until we passed the latitude of Bermuda . Just south of the Gulf Stream  --  which would put us about three hundred miles southeast of Nantucket  --  we ran into a very heavy gale . This gale , which did a lot of damage to shipping along the American coast , started from the south and then hauled around to the nor'west and increased to a heavy and prolonged blow which drove up a tremendous sea . By the time the storm reached its height we were in the Gulf Stream , and on this particular night the wind became so furious that the seas could n't geL any bigger and started breaking at the top . They were like big comhers on a beach front . This was very dangerous for a small ship because the breakers would crash down on the lee side of the waves . " These breaking seas lashed the topside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded the small pumping engine . Most of the crew were gathered around the hand pumps on the afterdeck when The City rolled under the crest of an unusually large sea . " It was just after midnight of the day before Christmas  --  a cold and dreary time of night  --  when this big sea hit The City and completely engulfed her from amidships aft . We all grabbed for what was nearest and held on . The sea finally drained away and we could see that the cabin skylights were stove in and all the loose gear aft smashed and the lifeboat smashed on the after davits . The planking of the lee rails and the poop ladders had been washed away and the dodgers on the rails had disappeared . And when we looked ( Continued on Page 91 ) // " It 's Gavinl " she told him loudly . That ten ton o ' secondhand fishgut what calls hisself Bullwinkle 's pal ! " Sevelm stood up .

" bawled Annie furiously . " You wait till the Coast Guard climbs up yer neck ! This is a navigable channel ye 're blockin'l " " No , it ai n't , " he contradicted sharply . " Not till the Government declares it so ! We checked that first ! And the only things that ever traveled this river before was logs and Indians . Now the Indians is on the reservation . And the logs , missus , " he pointed out delightedly , " is what your head 's made of . But you was goin ' someplace , " he ended with elaborate politeness and waved his arm upstream .

" Better take her back down , Annie , " he advised quietly . " Time we get up to the foundry and back they 'd have them other pilings in place , and we 'd be trapped on the wrong side too . " It was only t hen that the full extent of the disaster hit her . " Alec ! " she gasped . " Sam 's right ! All our tugs an ' scows ? an ' those barges ! " " That 's pretty plain , is n't it ? " Severn replied bitterly . " They 're stuck ! They ca n't get out now ! I 'm stuck too , " he went on slowly . " Not only for loss of profit on this deal , but indemnities , for God knows how long , at a thousand dollars a day ! " For a long time there was silence in the boat ; and it was not until the wilderness of rock and tree stumps was left far astern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmland , wrested , generations ago , from the primeval forest , that Annie spoke . " There  --  there must be some way to git around this , Alec , " she said . " You name it ! " he returned flatly . " We ai n't licked yet , if on'y we have a little faith , " She continued doggedly . " That kin move mountains , ye know . It 's what the Good Book says . " He looked at her heavy , unhappy face in the faint light of the stars , and compunction moved him . " O.K. , Annie . Maybe you 're right , " he agreed quietly . " But the way I feel right now , faith could more easily move that big farmhouse over there right into town , than shift those barges out of their trap . " For more long moments Annie was silent , while her gaze traveled across the sleeping fields to the distant building , then back to his worried face . Then , presently , she stirred , and it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks , Alec , " she said , her voice low . " I knowed an idear would have to come . I 'm glad it came this way . " " Idea ?

" An ' if it do n't band Bullwinkle an ' that prize brain-buster o ' his the wust bellyache o ' their careers I 'm a monkey 's or-phan ! " By now Big Sara also was intrigued . " What you drivin ' at , Annie ? " he asked hoarsely . But . Annie , suddenly bristling with confidence again , chose to he mysterious . " You 'll find out , " she promised , with a sudden heartfelt chuckle . " An ' so will they ! An ' how ! " It was a full three days before Annie , a large , heavy and brightly wrapped parcel in her arms , again found time to visit , Mr. Bullwinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered when Mr. Bullwinkle sat bolt upright , every red spike on his bullet head bristling . " Go ahead , ya old fat-pot  --  crow ! " he challenged ; but Annie merely lowered the parcel to the bed , then sank into a nearby chair and wiped her brow . " Look , " he persevered , " I do n't want ya in here ! You 're a hex ! " " Now , Horatio , " reproved Annie indulgently . " Is that the way to treat a ol ' pal what brought ye a nice present an ' on'y wants to pass the time o ' day ? An ' by the way " ? she peeked archly , but not without significance , under his bed ?

Just the same , if you had n't of dynamited them pilings the next night I 'd ha ' kept those tugs and scows of yours up there forever ! " " I figgered that too . " said Annie calmly . " That 's why I done it . Any-ways , what ye gripin ' about ?

" Well ? " She got ponderously to her feet , looking shy . " I ? I hope ye enj'y it , Horatio , " she said softly and tiptoed out the door . " Well , kin ya beat that ? " said Mr. Bullwinkle in wonderment to himself . " Aside from bein ' the world 's ugliest monster , I guess her heart 's in the right place after all . I wonder what she brought . " Frank in his curiosity now , he quickly ripped off the gay paper and brightly colored ribbons , then plunged his nand in and closed his eyes . " Eeny-rneeny-miney-mo , " he counted in pleasurable anticipat ion , then opened his eyes upon Annie 's carefully selected gift  --  a box of oats and a small , tightly compressed bundle of hay . THE INCREDIBLE CAPTAIN KENEDY ( Continued from Pug , 2H ) around , so had the two boys . They were just gone . The ship was n't moving much , but they were n't , alongside anywhere . And we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have handled it in such a sea . There was n't anything that could be done . " That was a sad Christmas Day aboard The City , with only five of us where there had been seven before . You had the feeling that at any moment you 'd look around the corner of a house or around the rails and you 'd see them again . It was hard to realize that the boys were gone , becaffse we had n't seen them go  --  they 'd just disappeared . " The City of New York was the fifth schooner Captain Kenedy had owned and skippered during his thirteen years of freighting among the Leeward Islands and along the trade routes of the Western Atlantic . The thirty-four-year-old , Connecticut-born sailing master had found the hulk of The City ( which was twice his age ; lying in Quebec shortly after his three-masted Wawaloam had been sunk by a German sub in mid-Atlantic . The City of New York had something of a history , having been the flagship of Byrd 's antarctic expedition in 1929 ; after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City achieved the added distinction of being the last all-sail schooner to carry cargo between the West Indies and North Atlantic ports , Though The City of New York 's tenure as the last of the sailing freighters was relatively brief , it was enormously profitable . The shortage of commercial shipping in the Atlantic and skyrocketing freight rates combined to provide Captain Kenedy with all the high-pay cargo he could carry ? a welcome state of affairs for the young skipper who had spent a decade making a bare living under sail . For the first year of his wartime operations witch The City between the Maritimes and the West Indies  --  a period covering parts of 1944 and 1945 ? Captain Kenedy 's net profit more than equaled the original cost of the schooner . The paradox of the sailing-schooner cargo trade during the war years lay in the anachronism which permitted Captain Kenedy to carry a cargo worth , perhaps , half a million dollars in a ship which cost less than sixty dollars a day to run . The inscrutable gods of the sea , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must often have chuckled at this implausible state of affairs . On one occasion , during the late summer of 1945 , Captain Kenedy felt sure these nautical fates were having their fun with him . " We were coming north from Barbados with a load of molasses for Newfoundland . The cargo was worth a fortune in those war years and every day we wasted on the passage was worth a good sum to me , for the Halifax docks were piled high with cargo for the lathes . " This particular trip went well until The City of New York reached a position around the .30th latitude , some 300 miles southeast of Bermuda . Here , in the middle of the horse latitudes , the light airs died away to a dead calm and the schooner was left drifting in a world of oily swells . " It was a Sunday morning when we ran out of wind . We lowered all sails to keep them from slatting in the swell that rolled us about , and set up a vigil for a breeze . Each morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead calm . The empty cans we 'd thrown overboard the day before would still be bobbing around the schooner . We must have been on some air route between Bermuda and the Azores , because each day we would see a plane pass over  --  first to the eastward and then headed west . I often wondered whether it was the same plane and what they thought of us , lying there like a rock in the ocean . " This went on for a week . Each day we either harpooned or shot a shark . It was the mate 's theory that when we got seven sharks we 'd get a wind . And , sure enough , on the seventh day we got our seventh shark and the wind did come fresh and strong from the south . " When the economy of the West Indies began to show the effects of a postwar slump during 1946 , Captain Kenedy was forced to turn The City 's bowsprit toward the Arctic in order to make a living . " We brought , a load of Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 1946 spring ? the last salt load to come up under sail  --  and then laid up The City so that we could install a war-surplus engine . I knew I 'd need some power to fight my way through the arctic gales . " With an engine that gave The City of New York a nine-knot speed in good weather , Captain Kenedy spent two open-water seasons hauling men and material to various military and radar bases in Labrador , in Hudson Bay and on Baffin Island . During the intervals between his summer trips to these arctic bases , the skipper managed to keep The City busy carrying lumber between the Maritimes and Boston and New York . He also worked in a few trips to the island of Jamaica  --  one of the last Caribbean markets left for sailing-ship cargoes . The City carried pickled fish  --  herring and mackerel  --  on its trips south . On the way north Captain Kenedy stopped at Inagua , in the Bahamas , and picked up loose salt for the Nova Scotian fisheries . - We had one peculiar experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1951 and I had taken along my wife , Pat , and our two tittle girls , Gabrielle and Patsy , as sort of an Easter vacation trip . I had figured the round ( rip would take us about three weeks- " We were on our way hack and one day out of Matthew Town on Great Inagua  --  which is just off Haiti in the Southern Bahamas  --  when we broke our shaft . We were deep-laden with salt and . with the short sails we carried on The City , I knew we were in for a long voyage home . Fortunately , we had plenty of food aboard , but there was still the problem of water and of keeping I he kids comfortable and rieisormbly happy . " We had a few light winds in the horse latitudes and they drifted us along . To help matters , we put our lifeboat over the side and used it 10 tow the schooner . The lifeboat was powered with a tittle gasoline engine . We had very little gasoline , but we had plenty of Diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the 11111e engine ma that it would run on the Diesel fuel  --  he put in a double-throw switch so you could start it on gasoline and then change over to the oil . " While The City of New York drift ed slowly northward through the horse latitudes  --  with all her scanty sails set and the little motorboat tugging away at the end of the towrope  --  Captain Kenedy managed to get a radio message through to the Coast Guard . " We gave them our position and asked them to notify our agents that we 'd be delayed . And then our transmitter went dead ? we could hear things , but we could n't send anything out . So we were really isolated . Our main concern was water . I had three Husky dogs aboard and in I he soul kern waters they each needed at least a gallon of water every day . So we caught rain water at every opportunity . Every time there was a squall there was a mad scramble to catch water off the deck for washing and off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea water and the kids and the dogs used that as a bathing pool . It took us thirty-three days to get The City into Lunenburg . The little lifeboat towed her right into the wharf . That turned out to be quite an Easter vacation for the kids . " The coal and lumber freighting between the Maritimes and our East Coast ports was always a marginal trade for the cargo schooners , and Captain Kenedy. of necessity , became an expert in keeping The City 's operating costs at a minimum . One of the needless expenses on these trips as the schooner skippers saw it i was the pilotage charge demanded for entry into most American ports . " We always tried to escape that when we could . On one occasion , going into Philadelphia with The City to load coal , we managed to evade the pilot at the entrance of Delaware Bay . Very few people realized it , but there was some small print at the end of the rules governing pilotage up the Delaware which stipulated that any ship not hailed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Henlopen was free of pilotage . This time we dodged in toward Delaware Breakwater and managed to get up the river without attracting any unwelcome attention from the pilot boat . " The next morning our agent in Philadelphia received a complaint from the pilot office ? they said we should n't have come up without a pilot and Ihat we 'd have to pay for pilotage anyway . When we got together . I pointed out the small print in the hack of the hook of regulations , which had been published in 1901 . They had n't known it . was there ! Naturally , we agreed to take a pilot for the trip down the river , " Pat was aboard that trip and we 'd been up to see my folks outside of New York and had found an old fiddle while we were rummaging around my mother 's attic . We were taking the fiddle hack to Nova Scotia , figuring we might be able to sell it up there . While we were on our way down the river Pat heard this squeaking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddling on the fiddle . It ended up that we sold him the fiddle for most of the pilotage charge , after telling him that , as far as we knew , it might be a rare and valuable violin . " Pilotage charges are based on the amount of water a vessel draws . The draft of a large ship is always a part of the ship 's records , but the draft of an old sailing vessel is usually a matter of the skipper 's judgment ? and probity . Captain Kenedy ca n't remember an occasion when he overestimated the draft of one of his vessels . " To the inevitable question , ' How much water does the vessel draw ? ' we 'd always answer that she drew nine or eleven feet ? even though she might he drawing eighteen . There was one old pilot in Boston harbor , however , whom we could n't fool . He must have learned the hard way in the old days . The first time I went in there and he asked me the draft , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed back into his little dory . He had a line with a big hook on it and he snagged this hook under the rudder and measured her and then called up , ' By gorry , skipper , she must be leaking somewhere  --  she 's drawing sixteen feet ! ' So he had me there . " The distressing tendency of The City to break her propeller shaft at . the most inconvenient . times one such break forced the skipper to work for several hours in the icy waters of Corner Brook harbor in Newfoundland ) prompted Captain Kenedy to sell the schooner during the early months of 1952 . On the first trip for its new owners The City was returning to Nova Scotia from New York with a load of coal when it piled up on a reef off Yarmouth and caught fire . And that was the end of The City of New York . The passing of The City was another in the long succession of minor sailing-ship tragedies which marked the end of a nautical era . Not only were the tall ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the skills , the pride and the traditions which knit together the colorful world of the professional sailing masters . The sea is a lonely place for the schooner skipper now ; as one of the few active survivors of that salty clan , Captain Kenedy must turn back the memories of seventeen years to recapture the almost-forgot ten flavor of the age of sail . " Though we did n't realize it at the time , the little West Indian port of Bridgetown , in Barbados , was the gathering place for the last of the working sailing fleet . That was in the late 1930 's , when I was trading among the islands with my two-masted schooner , the Sea Fox . The harbor at Bridgetown was often crowded with sailing vessels  --  former Nova Scotian fishing schooners which had turned to freighting and the local trading schooners  --  and there was plenty of talk and company for the sailing man . 1 had kept the Sea Fox fully rigged with two topmasts , a fisherman 's staysail , topsails and a flying jib , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and controversy around the sailing fleet and among the island people . " The speculation regarding the sailing qualities of the Sea Fox and her rival schooners in the island freighting trade finally grew to such a pitch that in 1936 a race around Barbados was arranged for Boxing Day  --  the traditional British post-Christmas holiday . Prizes were donated by the local merchants and the whole island turned out to follow the schooners during their sixty-mile circumnavigation of the island . " We agreed not . to use our Hying jib or staysail because our bitterest rival , the Mona Marie , did n't carry them . The excitement was terrific . There were nine schooners in the race . We started out at eight in the morning and the entire population seemed to he following us as we beat up the south coast and turned and ran up the windward side of the island . Everything with wheels was on the move  --  private cars , busses and even bicycles . At some spots we were only a quarter of a mile offshore and we could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way . " The reef which guards Barbados ' windward shore was treated with caution by most of the racing fleet . Captain Kenedy and the Sea Fox hugged the harrier within a vessel length of white water and had gained a substantial lead by the time the contestants turned to run down the northern shore of 9. 1954 f the little Wand . As the skipper Jusounry describes the finish ; " We cut the reef very do , *ekun right along the edge of it  --  and by the time we reached up the leeward side of the island the other schooners were well astern . We reached the finish line at . Bridgetown harbor three quarters of an hour ahead of the Mona Marie . The careenage ? a little artificial harbor where we loaded the schooners and careened them for scraping  --  was lined with a solid mass of people . The crowd grabbed the line we threw ashore and began pulling the Sea Fox right up the careenage  --  we had to pay out on the line to lose way . And when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! the Sea Fox settle under their weight . They grabbed hold of me and carried me up the whole length of the main street . That was a day for any sailing-ship man to remember . " For winning the race that day the Sea Fox was awarded first-prize money of $300 and earned a small slice of immortality as the heroine of recorded calypso song , The Sea Fox Beat Up the Mona Marie . This bit of island storytelling may well have been the requiem of the working sailing fleet in this part of the world . Captain Kenedy 's replacement for The City was a 202-foot , steel-hulled , three-masted schooner built in Copenhagen in 1923 as a yacht for the Hutton family . The Hussar , as it was then known , once made the trip under sail from New York to Land 's End . England , in ten days and nineteen hours . At the start of the last war the schooner , renamed the Vema , was fitted out as a training ship for merchant-marine cadets . When Captain Kenedy found the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mud bank off Staten Island . The skipper bought the abandoned Vema for what was substantially her scrap value , cleaned up some of the accumulated grime , bent a few of her sails and nursed the schooner down to Nova Scotia during the early days of January , 1953 . " I had a four-man crew along to help me , and Pat did the cooking . We had no heat aboard except a small oil-burning cook stove and the only machinery that worked was a small auxiliary engine which provided lights . Fortunately we had generally moderate weather  --  though we had to run into Shelburne . Nova Scotia , and wait out a three-day snowstorm . The next westerly wind took us to the entrance of the Lahave River and we slipped over the bar at high water at three o'clock in the morning . We sailed past our house , twelve miles up the river , just at daylight , and when I tooted the horn , the three kids and the dogs all scuttled out like a lot of little rabbits to cheer us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the most mechanically complicated vessel Kenedy had ever owned . The 500-ton schooner was equipped with an 800-horsepower Diesel engine and such refinements as steam heat , electric winches , a freezer and a chill room , a machine shop , hot and cold showers , a radiotelephone , an electric dishwasher and a galley capable of feeding a task force of fifty . The schooner 's fuel capacity permits her to cruise at sea under power for a month . What was probably the final touch , from the point of view of a sailing-ship skipper , was t he cold-water drinking fountain in the Vema 's messroom . Captain Kenedy 's original intention had been to rip out most of the Verna 's accommodations and mechanical refinements , and turn the vessel into a 94 fundamentals to their work  --  the long spring days brought a reasonable content to all aboard the Venus as the two vessels jogged slowly back and furl h across the gulf . The only intransigent member of the expedition was Captain Kenedy 's seagoing Labrador Husky  --  a fearsome-looking animal named Gotlik who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare time capturing the tropical birds which landed aboard the schooner . Gotlik resented the presence of so many utile to ical strangers aboard the Verna and singled out the hapless chief scientist as the target for his displeasure . As Captain Kenedy tells the story : " I guess Gollik resented having anyone in the after cabin the head scientist was using , for we had lived there when we first sailed the Verna from Nev . York to Nova Scotia . Every day the dog would steal into the scientist 's cabin and take his soap . When he did n't eat the soap , Gollik would take it out of the chain and sit on it , and then snarl at anyone who tried to rescue it . And when he found the scientist  --  who was really a very pleasant fellow  --  in the cabin , Gotlik would lie across the doorway and refuse to let him out . So then they 'd send for me and I 'd call Gotlik off and it would be all right . " The Verna 's main engine broke down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the time the working part of the voyage was completed . Captain Kenedy landed all but two of the scientists in Galveston and returned the schooner to New York under sail . We bent the big main spanker on its seventy-two-foot boom and , profiting from a northerly set of the wind caused by a hurricane to the east , crossed the gulf to the Straits of Florida off Miami in ten days . Then we hit calms and headwinds , and drifted sluggishly up the coast for two weeks . When we got handy to New York the wind freshened up from the south'ard and gradually hauled southeast and we had a fine sail right up New York harbor  --  the only decent sail we had all the way up the coast . We picked up the pilot and sailed up the bay and the Hudson to the shipyard in Hoboken doing ten knots , with all sails set . It was a fine conclusion to a three months ' voyage . " The Vema 's first charter trip confirmed Captain Kenedy 's suspicion t hat the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain . The Verna had just too much machinery ? and most of it required expensive shipyard repair work when it broke down . When we cracked the cylinder heads of the Diesel in the gulf , the United States Naval Base at Guanhinamo , Cuba , tried to make repairs , but they did n't have the proper equipment . I finally had to order five new cylinder heads from Copenhagen ? at $20e0 apiece . That sort of an operation was too rich for my blood . I wanted a ship I could maintain and , in general , repair myself . " Fortunately , that first trip also convinced the Lamont Observatory group that the Vema was ideally suited to their needs and that the schooner could he permanently equipped for scientific work if it belonged to the university . This happy concatenation of the impulse to sell and the desire to buy resulted in the sale of the vessel to Columbia and a substantial profit for Captain Kenedy . On the Vema 's second scientific voyage ? which left . New York in July , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salaried master . " Part of my agreement with the university was that I could take my family along on this second trip . Pat signed on as second cook , Brian and several of his school friends came along as sailors , and even nine-year-old Patsy served as a stewardess . Little Gabrielle went along for the ride . On this trip , we worked the North Atlantic between Newfoundland and Bermuda and east as far as the Grand Banks . Aside from the severs occasions when we had to sidestep an early-season hurricane , it was , to me , a dull and repetitious trip . Any sailor gets tired of the constant starting and stopping and I he backtracking which are necessary in scientific work . " Though the purposeful loitering of the Vema tried the skipper 's patience , the presence of the ebullient Kenedy clan aboard the schooner made the voyage a pleasant . one . When tempers were frayed by minor mishaps or delays , Pat baked wholesale lots of pies to soothe the ruffled feelings . And when the two girls , Gabrielle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipper presented them with a brightly painted wagon he had fashioned of spare lumber , brass oarlocks and the lignum-vitae sheaves of discarded ship 's blocks . " The kids had more fun with that wagon than anything else on the trip . They used to gel up in the Vema 's how with the wagon . The schooner has a tong main deck and a high bow with a lot of sheer , so it gave them a pretty good hill . The kids would get on the wagon and come thundering down the deck . The scientists would he working there and someone would yell , ' Look out , here they come ! ' The wagon was built . like the one-horse shay , and if anybody had got in the way they would EVENING POST have broken a leg . It created quite a traffic problem . " The best laugh of the second Verna trip resulted from a contribution by Pat to the common cause . As Captain Kenedy tells it : We were taking in the head sails one night and somehow I gave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Very painful , whatever it was . After she 'd rubbed my back with a famous Nova Scotia remedy called King of Pain , Pat suggested that I get into her girdle . She felt a little strapping of my back would help . So we got the girdle and with h the help of the cook and the chief engineer and by shaking violently , they got me into the thing . But I could n't stand it  --  especially those things that hold the stockings up . They kept getting in the way . So after a day the girdle and I parted company . Later we cut it in half , horizontally , and put it on Ted Bligh , the cook , who 'd sprained his back in a fall on the galley floor . " Such improvised therapy has usually sufficed to meet the raedical emergencies on the Kenedy schooners . Though he has had to deal with an occasional injury while at sea , Captain Kenedy has never had to treat a serious illness during his two decades afloat as a sailing-ship skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sailing ship simply do n't get sick . " Of course , the fact that I would have been the doctor might have had something to do with that . We did have a few toothaches among the various crews . We had a young Newfoundland sailor on The City who complained of a toothache and said he could n't steer . I 'd run into that situation before and a dentist friend of mine had given me a pair of old tooth-pulling pliers  --  so I followed my usual practice of telling this chap that I 'd pull the tooth after dinner . Generally that was enough  --  the sufferer would brood about me and the pliers , and by the janttary time dinner was over his tooth would be bettor and he 'd go back to work- " On this occasion the young Newfoundlander insisted I pull his tooth right away . That was the first time my bluff had been called , I had to see it through , even though I knew it was going to hurt me more than it hurt him . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck with my pliers and an anesthetic needle . We sat our subject on the mizzen hatch . After some discussion between the cook and me about where I ought to stick the needle , I gave the sailor about half a dozen jabs in various places in his mouth . When the Newfie announced he had no feeling from the neck up , we figured he was ready for the extraction , but by that time he could n't remember which tooth was hurting him . So we looked around for the most likely suspect , and found they were all more or less decayed . Finally I spied an able-sized tooth that gave promise of a good grip , and while the cook held the Newfie back by the ears , I got a headlock on him and went to work . " My dentist friend had given me a few tips on how to pull a tooth ? he said that you did n't have to be big and strong , that it was all in the flick of the wrist . So I flicked my wrist this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tougher than I was . Meanwhile the mate , who was at the wheel where he could see us , asked us to please get out of sight behind the mizzenmast because he could n't steer with this torture going on before his eyes . " When I could n't budge the first tooth , the Newfoundlander suggested I try the one next to it . That second one came out without any trouble and for the rest of the trip the young chap seemed to feel much better . When we got to Jamaica the same boy came to me and announced that he 'd like to have me pull the other tooth  --  the one I 'd been struggling with on the way down , This time I was ready for him  --  I told him that there were good dentists ashore and that he could pay one of them to do it . I knew I could n't stand another extractiLn . " The Verna , with all the Kenedys aboard , arrived back in Lunenburg for repairs and a refit on September 16 , 1953 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gale-driven rainstorm the night before and the skipper had hove to outside the harbor to wait for better visibility . By morning the storm had passed and the Verna chugged sedately to its mooring under a bright fall sun . When the Kenedy children were asked about the storm their eyes widened in genuine surprise ? like the man at the wheel of the fabled Walloping Window-blind , they had been asleep in their bunks below . Captain Kenedy left the Vema without regret . " Wasting fair winds , wasting fair weather , waiting for the next gale in the same spot , going back over a course which has already been run  --  all go against a sailor 's ways . On a cargo vessel the ship is supreme and that 's what everybody is thinking about ? there 's no other consideration but the ship and its cargo . And it 's hard to work for someone else after running your own vessels for so many years . I 'll be looking for another schooner now ; something that Pat and I and a couple of boys can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll start out all over again . "
