Iowa 's Drake University football team ( six wins , two losses , one tie this year ) seldom makes headlines outside its own Missouri Valley Conference . But last year , in Sophomore Halfback Johnny Bright , Drake had the leading ground-gainer in U.S. football : 1,950 yards in rushes and completed passes . Last week Drake fans by the hundreds drove up to Ames to see what broad-hipped Johnny Bright would do against Iowa State and saw one of the great individual performances of the year . <P> Twisting , churning and pounding through Iowa State 's line and around the ends , big ( 6 ft. , 200 Ibs . ) Halfback Bright ran for four touchdowns , one of them a 71-yard sprint , passed to End Tom Bienemann for a fifth .
