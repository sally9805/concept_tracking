FROM Athens , TIME 'S Jim Bell Reported : <P> The Greek border where it adjoins Bulgaria and Albania is held and patrolled by tough , experienced troops under spirited officers . Armed with basic infantry weapons up to mortars , the troops ride the mountain passes astride husky mules from Missouri . Sunk back 15 to 60 miles behind the Greek frontier regiments are the support divisions , eight in the field and one around Athens , a total of 135,000 men . <P> Close to the Barrage . Last week Greece 's eight field divisions were engaged in an intensive six weeks ' training cycle . Many of the Greek officers had studied U.S. tactics at Fort Benning Infantry School . In all divisions , aggressive young U.S. captains , majors and colonels act as advisers . <P> Training has corrected many technical weaknesses of the naturally courageous Greek soldier : he no longer opens fire with a rifle at targets 1,000 yards away , or with a machine gun at anything in sight , and he has learned to keep close behind his own artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a recent practice barrage with live artillery ammunition , five riflemen were killed . <P> The Greek soldier owns one uniform , and often as not his shoes have holes in them . He eats and lives at a low standard . A battalion I visited well to the rear of the frontier had 500 men , only 150 beds . The mess hall for each company consisted of a leanto , two large pots , a meat ax , a couple of knives and some ladles . Bread and bean soup , liberally dosed with olive oil , is the main diet . Yet no one ever hears a Greek soldier complaining of the chow . Most of the men never had it so good . Corporal Elias Papadopoulos is a 25-year-old farmer from the island of Chios , a veteran of the Vitsi and Grammos campaigns . I asked him if he thought the Greek army had improved . Said he : " Sir , the Greek army is good and was always good . It is the best army in the world . " <P> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . Field Marshal Papagos , assessed by U.S. military men as a good sound soldier , has fired eight lieutenant generals , 30 major generals , and so many brigadiers and colonels that people have lost count . Papagos , a dignified man with a bald head , hooked nose and fierce eyes , has insisted that his officers be fighting men and not politicians . <P> " We Are Ready . " U.S. officers here have solid faith in the new Greek army . " I 've fought eight campaigns with these people , " said Major General Reuben Jenkins . " The first four were horrible . The last four were wonderful . " A rugged combat officer , Jenkins came here as General Van Fleet 's right hand , and , since Van Fleet 's transfer last year , has been chief adviser to the Greek army . He added : " If anyone thinks he can take these people on and not get his nose thoroughly bloodied , he is sure as hell mistaken . " Lieut . General Stylianos Maniadakis , whose Greek corps lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confident . Said he : " We are ready for them . We will fight them . We will beat them .
