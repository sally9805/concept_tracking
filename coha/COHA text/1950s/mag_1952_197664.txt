Nature , in whose eyes all men seem equal , last week tore down-at least for a little while-some of South Africa 's walls of prejudice . <P> All day long , the clouds had billowed above Johannesburg ; in the late afternoon lightning split a sky that was the color of an overripe plum , and the city 's jagged skyline vanished behind a curtain of steel-bright rain . Eighteen miles away , a tornado struck the mile-square shantytown of Albertynsville , where 5,000 Negroes and half-castes lived in mud huts . For an instant , the growling air was filled with flying tin roofs ; then the pelting rains crumbled Albertynsville 's mud huts into a slough of grey ooze that flowed like lava , choked with sticks of furniture , rusty pots &; pans , and here &; there a corpse . The toll was : 20 killed , 400 injured , 4,000 homeless . <P> To the Rescue . Minutes after the storm , Johannesburg 's Bronx-born mayor , 45-year-old Hymie Miller , sounded an appeal for help . Ambulances and double-decker city buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; enough shoes , clothing and blankets poured in to supply twice the number of homeless . When Mayor Miller appealed for emergency blood donors , thousands of Johannesburgers streamed out of movie theaters and cocktail lounges to line up , some all night long , at the blood-bank centers . <P> Few of those who rushed to Albertynsville had ever before set foot in the Negro shantytowns barnacled on to the gold-rich Rand hills . Stumbling through the debris , oftentimes unaware in the darkness whether the man beside them was white or black , the whites learned , painfully and humbly , how black South Africa lives . Some fetched water from filth-encrusted boreholes that had served the whole of Albertynsville ; others , ladling out Red Cross soup , porridge and stew to matchstick-legged Negro children , discovered that never in their lives had these children tasted anything so nourishing . Said one white rescuer afterward : " The place had no drainage , no sanitation , no streets and no lighting . Outside the houses , there were open latrines , pits and great piles of rotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added solemnly , " must not be allowed to rise again . " <P> Out of the Pits . Mayor Miller agreed . He called an emergency meeting of his city council at 8 a.m. , launched an Albertynsville relief fund that topped $45,000 . From Prime Minister Daniel Malan 's Nationalist cabinet came an offer of temporary shelter for the homeless in the big , unused army barracks at Lenz , three miles west of Albettynsville . At first , " Chief " Eric Kumalo , 48 , the black-bearded Negro racketeer whose goon squads charge Albertynsville 's shanty dwellers 5 shillings a month " protection " money , threatened to beat up any Negro family moving to Lenz . But not for long : protected by Mayor Miller 's cops , 1,000 homeless Negroes left their camp fires in the open veld and moved to Lenz to sleep , for the first time in their lives , in electric-lit bungalows , with running hot &; cold water . <P> At week 's end , cheering crowds met Hymie Miller as he and his white councilmen visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time since Negroes cheered a white man , " said one surprised Johannesburg official .
