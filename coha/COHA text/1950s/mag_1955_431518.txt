 | In the year 1948. according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , more than four hundred embezzlements from banks were discovered in the United States . This information . widely published in newspapers , was read . it must be supposed , by many millions of persons ; and of those millions , it was read with particular interest by three groups , the first composed of persons having accounts in the banks affected , the second composed of persons contemplating embezzlement , the third composed of a perhaps smaller , yet even more sincerely interested , number of persons ? that is , the practicing embezzlers who had not yet been detected . Of this latter group . Noble ( or . as his associates called him . " Nobbie " ) Blake was one . Nobbie Blake did not look at all like an embezzler . Embezzlers never do ; that is why they are always able to obtain positions suited to their peculiar talents . Indeed , it is likely that every one of us is latently an embezzler. needing . like volcanoes. only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces to make us active . So it was with Blake . Though he was not a president or even a manager of a bank ( many embezzlers are found , unfortunately . to occupy rather exalted positions of trust ) , Blake 's case is none the less important for being humble . It does not draw its motivation from such standard and satisfying sources as wine , women , and song , yet it has an authentic , human appeal , and on a higher plane than the ordinary . The denouement . or . better still , detonation , shook an area not much larger than the town of Niddleton ,  | but here again there was so odd a mixture of glory , shame , and humor , if one will concede the possibility of humor in such a situation , that Blake 's achievement deserves attention . As a boy , Nobbie showed no indication that he would one day be a banker , or an embezzler either , but he did show a marked aptitude for medicine . He often played doctor and nurse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat for a patient . He conducted medical experiments upon himself , not having reached the age where he would know enough to conduct them on other persons instead ; and now and then he suffered from his adventurousness , as when he drank a small glass of blue ginger ale ( concocted of ginger ale and blueing ) , and again when he tried to burn off a wart with the head of a match . For several years his great personal treasure was half a dozen small , flat sticks , given to him by the family physician , for depressing tongues . His mother had been , or pretended to be , virtually an invalid all her married life , and it was Nobbie 's often expressed ambition to grow up and learn how to cure her . This drew many a smile and pat on the head from relatives and neighbors , as well as from Mrs. Blake hersel ' . H IS FATHER , a carpenter , was much pleased by Nobbie 's bent toward so high a calling , and undoubtedly would have contrived somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a scaffolding when Nobbie was fifteen and been killed . As the family had no resources , Nobbie , after being graduated from high school , had to go to work . His sister , Bessie , was already working in the Niddleton Pharmacy as well as keeping house . Having been brought up to believe her mother incapable of useful exertion , Bessie was a rather long time persuading herself otherwise . From her earliest years she had had housework to do , Mrs. Blake increasing the amount as Bessie became stronger . By the time she was twelve , Bessie was doing almost everything , while Mrs. Blake , a stout , sour-looking woman with a long list of aches and pains exhausting in the mere enumeration , lay in bed all day or , when the weather was satisfactory , sat outdoors . Every physician for miles around had been summoned to her side at one time or another ; all had discovered nothing seriously amiss and most of them had told her so , whereupon she applied to a new one . She wrote away for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and amassed and swallowed a formidable armory of remedies . " None of them , " as she groaned stoically to her cronies , " do me the least bit of good . " Her husband seemed to accept this situation patiently to the very day of his death . Though who is to say that sometimes in the dead of night he did not take up his hammer with other intent than to carpenter ? If he did ( and it is pure supposition to say that he did ) , something always unaccountably stayed his hand . In spite of her dubious history , Mrs. Blake , after her husband was dead , gave long discourses on what she had done for his comfort while he yet lived and at the end was accustomed to say , " And now what is to become of my poor children ? " What became of them was that they went to work to support her , Bessie , as has been mentioned , in the pharmacy , and Nobbie in The County Trust Company . His character was good ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nobody was wise enough to take heed ) , and he had shown , in high school , an aptitude for figures . It was upon the recommendation of the principal that he received a job in the bank . Matters moved along at this level for three years . Then , just as Nobbie achieved his majority , his sister succeeded in snaring and eloping with the son of a wealthy manufacturer . She went to live in another part of the state , and there broke forth from her a resentment that had been accumulating for some years , ever since her first suspicion that her mother was not as helpless as she seemed . Once married , Bessie never again communicated with her mother or contributed to her support , and advised Nobbie to take a similar course . " She 's a fraud , and she 's always been one and always will be , " Bessie said . " She 's no more sick than I am . " This gave Mrs. Blake an opportunity , which she did not overlook , to deliver long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it was n't for Nobbie , " she often said , " I do n't know where I 'd be , a poor , sick woman like me . " Nobbie corresponded with his sister ? there had always existed a most tender relationship between them ? but he did not take her advice . He not only worked in the bank but did the housework that had used to be Bessie 's lot . He was generally regarded as a model son ( another warning sign that went unheeded until too late ) . Studying banking at night by correspondence courses , he made progress , unspectacular but steady , assisted by his natural knack for accounts . His salary barely sufficed to support his mother and himself , but the notion of seeking surreptitious assistance at the till did not occur to him . From time to time he obtained extra work , helping local merchants with their accounts and preparing income-tax returns . THERE were two things , besides a sense of duty to his mother , that sustained Nobble Blake . One was a love affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The love affair was with Gloria Smith , daughter of a plumber . She was a reserved , blond girl , somewhat taller than Nobbie and slightly bowlegged . She was employed as a salesperson in Niddleton 's only department store . On their lunch hour she and Nobbie met at the public library or strolled in the park , and once or twice a week he got out of the house on some pretext to visit her . Rumors of the friendship reached Mrs. Blake , but Nobbie always denied that he was seriously attached to Gloria , and Mrs. Blake , in spite of her strong instinct not only for the preservation of herself but for the preservation of her whole manner of existence , believed him . Had she thought him capable of marrying , and so either diminishing or ceasing his efforts to support her , she would have taken whatever heroic measures were necessary . But she could  | not envision him deserting her , and her confidence , as it turned out , was justified . Nobbie lied to his mother about Gloria and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him there was an even deeper involvement with the art of medicine . Though he could now never hope to be a physician , his interest remained constant and powerful . He read the lives of famous physicians , from Hippocrates to Cushing ; he plodded through original papers by Jenner and Pasteur , not understanding everything he read but perhaps the more fascinated for that reason ; he absorbed articles on medicine in newspapers and popular magazines . At the bank he was particularly cordial to physicians who had accounts there , and one of them regularly lent him the British medical magazine The Lancet . Nov and then Nobbie would sit at a typewriter and write " Dr. Noble Blake " and " Noble Blake , M.D. , " then tear the paper into tiny pieces . And he would look at his hands , which had the short , thick fingers not uncommonly found among surgeons , and sigh . During World War II , which he did not have to attend in person , owing to flat feet and a defect in hearing , Blake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructor . His familiarity with tourniquets , splints , and various medical practices was both profound and a trifle frustrating , for no disaster occurred in Niddleton to give scope to his achievement . He did not actively wish for disaster , but he could not help a feeling of chagrin that he was never in the vicinity even of minor emergencies , as when a person was struck by an automobile or burned in the kitchen or shot by an " unloaded " gun . Once or twice his skill was useful . When a woman fainted in the bank , Nobbie revived her . When a fellow employee accidentally cut his wrist with a broken drinking glass , Nobbie stopped the flow of blood . He kept a small supply of aspirin , smelling salts , iodine , and oft- er remedies in his locker and was never more happy than when sought out to deal with the common cold or to give his opinion on whether an ache arose from gout , arthritis , rheumatism , or a draft on the bank . Where other persons turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nobbie listened with genuine attention . He was a constant visitor to acquaintances who chanced to be hospitalized , though the nearest hospital was twenty miles distant . He always asked what the attending physician had done and prescribed , listening with a mysterious air of doubt and incredulity and sometimes softly clucking to himself , as though he would have done quite otherwise but was restrained from censure by the ethics of the profession . NOBBIE 'S life went on thus placidly until he was thirty , toward the end of the war . Then a loss almost as severe as the loss of his father befell him . His sweetheart , Gloria , married another , a man of whose very existence Nobbie had been unaware . Finally giving up hope that Mrs. Blake , for all her many afflictions , would die within a normal lifetime , Gloria had seen that if she were ever to marry , it had better be soon and better be to somebody other than Nobbie . The man she selected ? though an unimportant fellow in himself , a welder by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had happened not only to Nobbie but to Niddleton . With the war a naval establishment fifty miles away had been much enlarged , and there had been a great increase in manufacturing and all sorts of business . Thousands of new persons had migrated to the area , and many of them had come to live in Niddleton . In a word , the Niddleton of 1944 was not by any means the Niddleton of 1934 or 1924 . Now , for many years the County Medical Society had desired to have a hospital in Niddleton . The wartime growth of population seemed to provide the final argument of necessity , and early in 1946 the Society proposed a hospital , and the Chamber of Commerce indorsed the proposal . Not only Niddleton but all the surrounding towns would be served , it was urged , and a hospital would much increase the importance and prestige of Niddleton itself . All the lodges in town . the organizations of war veterans , the service clubs , the pastors , and the town council gave support ; a bill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then signed by the governor ; committees were appointed : funds were solicited ; a site was chosen ; and an architect 's rendering of the proposed building presently appeared in a window of The County Trust Company . THE war was over , and the raising of funds went forward with undivided energy . Everybody , from corporation president to schoolchild , was pressed for a contribution . Hospital bazaars and garden parties were arranged . Dances . theatricals , cake sales , a circus produced by half a dozen children in a back yard , collections of newspapers ? all means were resorted to . Nobody was more energetic in the cause than Nobbie . Hundreds of dollars were collected by him . Though he had always been a somewhat bashful fellow , he brought himself to the point of addressing a meeting or two , and his enthusiasm overcoming his want of skill , he made a most satisfactory impression , even on himself , so that he presently became able and willing to deliver a short address on this one subject at any time and in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group from his church to bring a bit of cheer to the prisoners , he took the occasion to speak on the need of funds for the hospital , and the prisoners subsequently collected more than $200 among themselves and contributed it . Unlike many of the solicitors , whose interest , as is usually the case , waned rather quickly , Nobbie became more and more devoted to the project as time went on . Devotion was needed , for building costs ? it was now the late forties ? had been increasing faster than contributions . The first estimate of the cost had been about $800,000 ; by the time contracts were let and ground was broken , in mid1949 , it was plain that the cost would be more than $1,000,000 . A grant of Federal funds was expected , but even so the prospect was hazardous . Nobbie Blake had given generously from his own meager funds ; he had even contributed a secret fund that he had been saving to buy a television set for his mother , arguing to himself that a hospital might very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had also given the small sum he had once been  | saving for his marriage to faithless Gloria . When he had done all this and could give no more himself , he attacked with pristine zest the people whom he had already milked . From some he received further contributions , from others he received irritable refusals . In his free time during the day , and lying in bed at night , he turned over plans for obtaining more money . He thought of people who , as he was aware from their balances at The County Trust Company , could well afford to give more , and he wondered how he could induce them to . He hated them for their niggardliness . He reflected on their extravagances . He felt a personal as well as a public hostility and indignation against them , for the hospital represented the one way in which , despite the misfortunes of his life , he could still significantly assist the art of medicine . ARLY in his study of bookkeeping there had occurred to Blake what appeared to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very thought shocked him , for he had been raised in a tradition of strict honesty ; yet there was fascination , and no harm , in merely thinking how it could be done . He perfected the method , as well as such matters can be perfected . It was , for him , simply an exercise in virtuoso accounting , and when he had achieved his hypothetical aim , he forgot about it . But the plight of the Niddleton Hospital , which seemed likely to become four fine walls and a roof without equipment , awakened the dormant scheme . At first he approached it gingerly , his whole character balking and rearing . Then he began to ask himself whether the cause did not justify a sacrifice of principles , and presently he convinced himself that it did . There came into Blake 's life an excitement and a positive purpose lacking ever since the end of his boyhood vision of a medical career . Even his disappointment in love was forgotten . But how was the money to be contributed , once he had obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , obviously . Blake solved this difficulty as ingeniously as the other , for now that his talent had been diverted into a clandestine channel , it seemed to irrigate and fructify a side of his nature that had been a desert . Early in December of 1949 , when the spirit of Christmas was beginning to walk strongly abroad , the Niddleton Times received a curious letter . The address and the message were spelled out in letters and words that had been cut from another newspaper and pasted onto the stationery . The message said : " I have learned that the Niddleton Hospital needs more money . It seems to me a worthy project , and I will be glad to help it in this way : Whatever the citizens of Niddleton will give toward the deficit , I will match . Years ago I left Niddleton as a poor boy , and now I have plenty of money and I would like to do something for the town , but you are not going to know my name . When $500 more is raised , announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and send $500 in cash , and so on . I could give all the money myself , but I 'm not going to . I think the citizens can do more . Lots of them have almost as much money as I have . "  | There was no signature . The envelope was postmarked " New York . " In the office of the Niddleton Times there was at first a disposition to take the letter as a joke , or as a stunt launched by the funds committee . After some inquiry , however , the editor , Chester Goodhue , decided to print the letter , at the same time disclaiming any responsibility for it . The letter caused a great deal of talk , a great deal of speculation as to who the author might be . Efforts were made to recall poor Niddleton boys who had left the town and become wealthy , but not one could be thought of . It was suggested that somebody in the state mental hospital had sent the letter , or some traveling man who lived in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of Niddleton . However , as Nobbie Blake himself said at a meeting of the committee , " Why do n't we act as though it was on the level ? We have to have money anyway , and every $500 we raise is to the good , whether this fellow matches it or not . " This was seen to be sensible , and Nobbie 's attitude was officially adopted . NUMBER of persons were persuaded to contribute just to see whether the anonymous correspondent would make good . Two days before Christmas , the first $500 had been amassed . The Niddleton Times printed a story about it on the first page and an editorial calling upon the mysterious benefactor , if such he was , to take note that his terms had been met . The editorial was partly facetious , so that if no matching $500 was forthcoming Editor Goodhue would not appear to have been gullible . The day after Christmas a neat , flat package arrived for the funds committee , in care of the Times . It was opened by the chairman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter . The package proved to contain fifty $10 bills pressed between two pieces of cardboard and bound with a few turns of black thread . It had been mailed first class from a city fifty miles distant . Niddleton was joyful and amazed . As the winter progressed to its end and the spring arrived , solicitors for the fund attacked their work with resurgent enthusiasm and shook thousands of dollars from tills and pockets . The secret benefactor kept his promise . His contributions always arrived from a different city or town and in a different container ? a tobacco tin , a candy box , a soup can , and so on . Meanwhile Nobbie continued his routine employment at The County Trust Company . He continued it with greater assiduity than ever , for upon assiduity depended the success of that far from routine employment that had come to engross him . The method by which he embezzled I shall not explain , for the details would be of interest only to accountants and might lead some other soul astray ; furthermore , I do not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false records was necessary , and these Nobbie skillfully prepared . The great hazard was a visit from the bank examiners . It was essential that on such an occasion the true records should be substituted for the false ones , or the other way around ; no matter , there had to be a substitution and Nobbie had to be present to make it . He no longer dared to be absent from work a day for sickness . Nor did he dare to take a vacation .  | It is one of the telltale signs of embezzlement , a sign always worthy of suspicion , that the embezzler appears so devoted to his work that he can not bear to leave it even for a day , let alone for two or three weeks . Fortunately for Nobbie three of his associates fell sick that summer and he was asked to forego his own vacation for extra pay , which he thankfully did . Many a night he awoke from nightmares in which he was trying to run to the bank ahead of the examiners but could scarcely move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nobbie made his substitution of records with such dexterity that nothing at all was suspected . He experienced a thrill that no honest endeavor had ever provided . He went on boldly matching funds , and even speculated successfully with some of he stolen money . This suggested a way in which he could return what he had stolen as soon as the hospital was paid for . There were things Nobbie Blake would nave liked for himself or his mother ? an automobile , a television set , a clear title to the house they lived in ? and often he was tempted to use some of his money or such purposes , but he always honorably refrained . He took his whole satisfaction from the daring achievement and he progress of the hospital . Sometimes on his lunch hour , and always on Saturdays and Sundays , he visited the site and noted , with a proprietary pleasure , the growth of the building and took photoraphs for his album . Nothing more weetly penetrated the somewhat deafened ears of Nobbie Blake than the sounds of bulldozing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a hearing aid , but it had been purchased with nis own money . The identity of the mysterious donor occasioned interest not only in Niddleton but in the outer world . Press associations sent reporters looking for clues ; so did a national magazine . Blake himself was among the many persons interviewed . But nothing was learned . IN THE town there was almost continuous speculation . At one point a ne'erdo-well family named Muller tried to attach the money , on the ground that possibly it came from an uncle , the white sheep of the family , who had escaped from his relatives twenty years earlier and had not since been heard from . The Niddleton Mullers said he had left owing them money , but nobody believed them , which was sensible . Then there was a Mrs. Sara Upjohn , a wealthy and elderly widow , who lived in a large house with two servants and had a surly German shepherd dog running loose on her grounds . Her house was on a hill and surrounded by an iron fence , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to contributing to causes , worthy or unworthy . It was reported ( though this may not have been true ) that she had turned her own sister from her door . Mrs. Upjohn was heard to say in The County Trust Company one morning , when she came to deposit dividend checks , " How is it you 're all so certain it 's a man giving this money ? More likely it 's a woman . " " A woman ? " cried Mr. Ellsworth Tillotson , the president of the bank . " Why , bless me , I never thought of that . " He was silent a moment . Then he looked at Mrs. Upjohn meaningfully and said , " And who might she be ? Can you give us a clue , Mrs. Upjohn ? Mrs. Upjohn , with the air of one who could do many things if she chose , replied , " No , no . I know nothing about it . It 's merely a suggestion . " But she spoke , and moved her eyes , in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is I , Mrs. Upjohn , who is giving the money , but you shall never hear it from me . The word spread , and not a few persons wondered whether it was she after all , nearing the grave and trying to get on the right side of the Lord before it was too late . Mrs. Upjohn herself , somewhat carried away by the unfamiliar notion of benevolence , made a public contribution of more than she had intended , though it was not by any means as much as she could have afforded . There was , however , a certain justice in whatever credit she received as the hidden benefactor , for it was partly from her large account , which she seldom molested except to add to it , that Blake was privately drawing his funds . BUT THE person most widely suspected of being the secret giver was Mr. Ellsworth Tillotson himself , a stout man with a quick , broad , chilling smile and matching eyes . As a boy he had been too portly for successful athletics , and his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he had lived to get them all under his thumb and to become the wealthiest and most important personage in Niddleton . He could have risen in the banking world , perhaps even become a bank president in New York , but he did not choose to . In Niddleton , at fifty , he had a good thing and he knew it . His roots sucked sustenance from many fertile places in the state and beyond . It was not supposed by anybody who knew him well that Mr. Tillotson would be giving money freely and anonymously for no reason but charitable impulse ; somewhere in the transaction there would be a profit for him . Whence or how this profit would accrue , nobody was able to guess , but that only proved , as everybody conceded , how much cleverer Mr. Tillotson was than the rest of Niddleton . Mr. Tillotson was , indeed , far too clever to give any hints that he was the man , but he was indulgent in allowing persons to think what they wished , so long as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original letter had been composed of words and letters clipped from The Wall Street Journal . This in itself powerfully indicated Mr. Tillotson , for he was one of the three or four persons in town who subscribed to that newspaper , and the others were not sufficiently wealthy to be suspected . One day Nobbie Blake , happening to encounter Mr. Tillotson at the hospital site ( Mr. Tillotson was chairman of the hospital association ) , boldly said , " Mr. Tillotson , everybody believes you are the man that 's giving the money . Are you , sir ? " Mr. Tillotson , exhibiting the spontaneously dispiriting smile that Nobbie Blake knew so well , did not reply for a moment . Then he said , " But would n't it rather spoil the fun to let the identity be known , Blake ? Whoever it is ? " " I suppose it would , sir . But ? " " Then think no more about it , Blake , " said Mr. Tillotson , and he turned abruptly away .  | On Sunday the Reverend Mr. Cutler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon on the charity that doth not blow a trumpet but doeth its good work in secret . And as he spoke , he glanced from time to time with solemn eye at the pew occupied by Mr. Tillotson and his wife . He glanced elsewhere too , but not with the same expression . Mr. Tillotson maintained his own gaze steadfastly and calmly at the lower edge of the pulpit . " The disciples asked , " said the Reverend Mr. Cutler , " ' Who then can be saved ? ' For they had been told that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . " It is by such deeds that the rich are saved , and that they show themselves superior to us all . For how many of us. if we were wealthy , would be equally charitable ? Let each man and woman search his heart . " This sermon was allowed not only to have been a superior effort in itself but to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known that the vestry had been dissatisfied with him ? owing to a laxity in making parish calls and to the daring clothes sometimes worn by his pretty wife ? and Mr. Tillotson controlled the vestry . Nobbie Blake , who seems not to have been without humor in his dangerous and dastardly operations , several times led cheers for the anonymous patron at meetings of fund solicitors ; and it was Blake 's suggestion , adopted by the hospital association , that a bare plaque be installed in the hospital lobby , ready to be inscribed with the patron 's name when that name should be disclosed , as it almost certainly would be in time . AT LENGTH the splendid day , which Nobbie Blake , of all Niddletonians , had most eagerly desired , was at hand . The three clean and beautiful stories , the seventy-five beds , the X-ray room , the operating rooms ? everything was ready , and on a magnificent Sunday in May . 1951 , the dedication took place . The Niddleton Band , seated in front of the speakers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing by a chorus from the Niddleton public schools . Small children and dogs ran about in the crowd . Loud-speakers carried prayers from representative leaders of the Niddleton faiths . The lieutenant governor of the state and Niddleton 's representatives in the legislature praised the citizens of Niddleton . Mr. Goodhue , editor of the Niddleton Times , delivered an address , carried in full next day in the Niddleton Times , on " The Anonymous Benefactor of Niddleton . " Then came the culminating address , by Mr. Tillotson , chairman of the hospital association and , as most people suspected , himself the anonymous benefactor of whom Editor Goodhue had just spoken . Cameras were aimed , the microphone was adjusted . There was long , loud applause . Mr. Tillotson , to do him justice , did not claim to be the man of secret charity , though many had expected him to make the disclosure at this appropriate moment ; nor , on the other hand , did he do much to mar the illusion . In a word , he was circumspect . He accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edifice as evidence of the growth of Niddleton , and praised all those who had  | helped in the project . Several contributors of large sums he deferentially named , and he presented a bouquet of sweet peas to a small grammar-school girl , who represented the contributors at the other end of the scale , It made a charming picture . Alone in the throng , unnoticed and unsung and perfectly willing to be so , sat Nobbie Blake who had personally given somewhat more than $100,000 to the hospital . Of other people 's money , it is true , but without it the hospital would not have stood there , fully paid for , gleaming in the May sunshine , a monument to the progress and enlightenment of Niddleton , ready to serve the community ( as Mr. Tillotson said ) " in the ordinary vicissitudes of life or in disaster , which , let us hope , Niddleton will never see . " Nobody applauded louder than Nobbie . After the speaking , as many as desired toured the hospital . In the lobby was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profile in low relief , of the great giver . Nobbie paused for a moment to view it . Then he went along with the others , saw the ingenious beds , the operating rooms , the glittering equipment everywhere , and tears of happiness came into his eyes . If only fate had allowed him to become a physician , he thought wistfully , so that he might make use of all this for the relief of mankind . At any rate he had done what he could . Later in the afternoon there was a buffet repast , prepared in the hospital kitchen , for the board of trustees and other influential citizens . Nobbie , of course , was not invited , but he did not mind very much . The Niddleton Hospital had its first patient the next day , an elderly lady who was successfully operated on for a cataract . Nobbie , though he was not acquainted with the lady , sent her an anonymous bouquet , paying for it with his own money , some that he had been saving for a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fulfilled his obligation to medicine and the community , and he was content to let the hospital make its own way in the world thenceforth . UP TO this point the zest of great adventure and humanitarian endeavor had supported Blake . He had several times outwitted the bank examiners . He had learned to look policemen in the eye . He kept two sets of bank records as deftly as he had kept one . He had taken the measure of men like Ellsworth Tillotson . He ate well . He slept well . Now he began to worry . He felt eyes constantly upon him . He began to see himself as he truly was , not a philanthropic hero but an obscure and ordinary fellow , a bank slave , without wife or child or prospects , who went home every night to his mother and allowed himself to be tyrannized by her , and who was in the gravest danger of a shameful ending . A hundred nights at home he woke up in prison . A thousand times at the bank he trembled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought of abstracting yet a few more thousands of dollars and fleeing to some foreign land . But his sense of duty both to his mother and to the bank deterred him . He determined to repay what he had taken ; and since he could not hope to do so from his salary , he would have to do it by speculating on the stock market , a calling in which , it will be remembered , he had  | already shown promise while raising funds for the Niddleton Hospital . In hazarding money that is not one 's own , there is a certain freedom , very often , that is not experienced when one stands in danger of personal loss . Blake plunged into the perilous tides of the market with bold confidence , and before the summer was half-done , he had returned more than a quarter of the money owed to the bank . He saw that he had only to keep his nerve and he would extricate himself , with no one the wiser or the worse . The former thrill and competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent , but Blake was no more worried about it than he was about a summer shower . Once more he was going to be able to avoid a vacation , for one of the tellers had died . Nobbie said he did n't mind staying on the job , because his mother 's condition prevented him from taking a vacation trip anyway . Mr. Tillotson promised him double compensation and time off in the winter if he wanted it . H AD he been of a philosophic turn of mind , Nobbie Blake would have trembled , for matters were going far too well . But he was occupied with his investments and the felicities of deceptive bookkeeping and would not have had time for philosophy even if he had had the bent . So it was that , crossing Main Street one August day , his head full of arithmetical manipulations and his hearing aid switched off , he reached not the other side of the street but the Niddleton Hospital . In what seemed only a moment two days passed , and there he was , lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed a hundred pounds apiece . for they were in casts , and he could not move his bookkeeping arm . As his plight dimly impressed itself upon his conscious mind . Nobbie Blake vented an appalling groan . A nurse was close by . " You 're all right , Mr. Blake , " she said kindly . " Everything will be all right . " He opened his eyes , then let the lids dispiritedly fall . Toward evening he asked what day it was and what had happened to him , and he was told . An automobile had struck him . Both his legs and his right arm were broken , and it was a wonder that it was no't worse . Mr. Tillotson himself had witnessed the accident and had stood so as to cast a comforting shade on Nobbie while he lay in the road awaiting the ambulance . At the mention of Mr. Tillotson . Blake 's heart sprang against his chest in terror , and he saw the bank examiners , in the form of vultures wearing Homburg hats , sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered wriggling down the corridor , trailing his heavy legs and muttering to himself hysterically , " The books . The books . Got to go to work ? to work . " Such devotion to duty was , on all sides . found touching , though excessive . A day later , when his condition had improved , his mother visited him and spent an hour berating him because she now had to cook and do the housework herself . She related all her pains and fears , which Nobbie had already heard innumerable times , and she did not once inquire how he felt himself . Her admonition as she left was , " Now , Nobbie , do n't you be lazing abed longer'n you have to . I do n't know how I 'm a-going to hold out much longer , what with my arthritis and all . " Nobbie wearily nodded on his pillow . Every day Nobbie 's sister , Bessie. drove to Niddleton to entertain and comfort him . She came in a light-blue car driven by a chauffeur . When Nobbie had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit him one afternoon . The bank had already sent flowers , and this gesture of the president 's coming himself to call was whispered down the corridor from nurse to nurse and accounted a most democratic act , much to Mr. Tillotson 's credit , the more so because it was unexpected . Mr. Tillotson drew a chair close to the bed and rumbled , " How are you , Blake ? " " Better , thanks , Mr. Tillotson . " Mr. Tillotson lowered his voice and brought his face close to Nobbie Blake 's . " I am sorry to hear that , " he said . " You scoundrel . The game is up , Blake . The examiners are on the premises at this moment . Where is the money ? " Nobbie Blake would not answer a single word . He was wheeled to a private room . Day and night , a policeman sat with him . On the first page of the Niddleton . Times the news exploded with a force that caused the town and the county to shudder and shake from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house from the ridgepole to below the foundations . The yard was dug up The stuffing was pulled out of Mrs. Blake 's easy chair . The small amount of coal remaining in the cellar was shoveled from one side of the bin to the other . Nobbie 's past was investigated for traces of secret bank accounts , gambling and gamesome blondes . Nothing to his discredit could be found , nor could single dollar be recovered . The Reverend Mr. Cutler privately visited him and urged him to clear his soul , but Nobbie would say nothing . Probably he felt that both the hospital and the art of medicine would be brought into disrepute is he confessed the use to which he had put the money . WHEN he appeared in court some vv weeks later , on crutches , to answer an indictment charging embezzlement of more than $70,000 , he pleaded guilty , but he still would not say where the money had gone . The judge sternly exhorted him . Nobbie remained silent . For his obduracy he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expected to live in leisure on it when he was released : but it was certain that he would never be able to do so , for he would be watched too closely . When Nobbie vanished behind the gray , impervious walls of the state prison . he had upon his head not only the curse of society but of his mother . It was generally supposed in Niddleton that her indignation was caused not so much by the great defect in his character as by his failure to apply any of his plunder to her own comfort : now , furthermore , she had to go to work to support herself . The wealthy Bessie still declined to give her mother a penny . Having nobody else to turn to , Mrs. Blake obtained work in Niddleton 's department store and managed quite well . It would have been sensible , probably , to sell her house , but she was afraid to do so for fear Nobbie had concealed a fortune in it after all . and many an hour she spent examining  | the floors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detectives had done ; but , like them , she found nothing . She neither visited Nobbie in prison nor wrote to him . His sister , however , visited him regularly , without thought of the harm that such a connection might do to her social position , for it was on her conscience that she had left Nobbie alone to cope with their mother , which had probably affected his mind . Bessie usually drove her own car , an expensive one , and spoke with the warden on each occasion . She had wanted to engage counsel to defend Nobbie , but he would not permit it . Where the money had gone , she never ventured to ask , for fear of learning something she would rather not know . ODDLY enough , Nobbie Blake was not unhappy . For one thing , it eased his conscience to be making amends for his crime . For another thing , he no longer suffered the strains and fears that had harassed him in mid-career , when any moment might have brought exposure , any chance word or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , it was wonderfully peaceful to be rid of his mother , though he was far too kind to acknowledge it . Beyond these considerations was another , yet stronger . A career in medicine , however limited , unexpectedly opened before him . Assigned , through his sister 's intercession , to help in the prison infirmary , he showed such quick grasp that the prison physician was solidly impressed . He trained Nobbie in various techniques and found him skillful and dependable . The prisoners , indeed , came to have more confidence in Nobbie than in the physician . Even before he had come to dwell among them , his professional reputation as an embezzler had spoken in his behalf . The address with which he had plied his craft , the ill fortune that had betrayed him , and the indomitable silence with which he had concealed the whereabouts of the swag could not but commend him to the special community in which he was about to begin a novitiate . His kindness and cleverness in the medical line confirmed the prisoners ' acceptance of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the infirmary he wore a white coat and had a discarded stethoscope in his pocket ; his companions liked to have him listen to their real or fancied heart murmurs and leakages . He also carried one of the small , triangular hammers that physicians affect , and with it he would learnedly strike his patient below the knee to make his leg jump . Rather often there were quarrels among the prisoners , and sometimes fights with homemade knives and stilettos , and Nobbie had opportunity to distinguish himself with needle and thread . In the great prison riot of 1953 , when guns , fire hoses , and tear gas were resorted to , Nobbie bravely and impartially treated the wounds of both sides and was highly commended by the warden , who said he would not trade Blake for the head of the A.M.A. ( No such offer , of course , had been made to him ; the warden was merely indulging in a not inapt hyperbole . ) Yet another incident showed Nobbie a silver lining in a cloud that had seemed dark and suffocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @#  | Kettleby . He was soon afterward sent to the infirmary , where Nobbie treated him for a sprained thumb . Talking with the patient , Nobbie learned that he was the very Kettleby who had run off with Gloria , the plumber 's fickle daughter . Nobbie sighed that he had once been her sweetheart . " Well , " said Kettleby , " so you 're the one . So it 's you . You 're the one I saved from a lifetime of misery . Nag , nag , nag . Nothing I ever done was right . " " Oh ? " said Nobbie . " I 'm sorry to hear that . " " I puts up with her for years , then I slugs her , and here I am . It 's how I sprained me thumb , but it was worth it . It 's the first peaceful place I been in since I got married . I 'm only here for a month , though . " He showed an unreasoning resentment at Nobbie for not having married Gloria himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been three years in bondage , he one day , in a confidential mood , disclosed to his sister what he had done with the money . She was astounded . Though he had imposed secrecy upon her , she went quietly about ? to Mr. Tillotson , to other influential persons in the hospital association , to the Attorney General ? and offered to repay all the money Nobbie still owed if certain conditions were met . These were to include an early parole for him and a job in the Niddleton Hospital when he was released . Bessie had in her own name more than the amount needed , and her husband gave her a generous allowance in addition . There were several circumstances , besides the return of the money , that made Bessie 's proposal acceptable to the law : Nobbie had not put the state to the expense of a trial , he had maintained an excellent record in prison , his criminal activities had had a novel and worthy objective . All things argued in his behalf . At present , then , the contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every prospect of obtaining the necessary degree . Soon thereafter he can expect parole and suitable employment in the institution he helped so substantially to found . What he does not yet know , and will not know until his first visit to Niddleton Hospital as a relatively free man , is the final concession obtained by his sister . In the lobby he will find the name " Noble Blake " engraved on the plaque reserved for the Unknown Benefactor .
