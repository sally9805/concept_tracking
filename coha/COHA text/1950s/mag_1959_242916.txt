Few democratic statesmen have less to fear from their parliamentary opposition than Ghana 's Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah ; in Ghana 's last general election three years ago , Nkrumah 's Convention People 's Party won 71 out of 104 parliamentary seats . But U.S.-educated ( Lincoln and the University of Pennsylvania ) Kwame Nkrumah remained unsatisfied , ever since has spent much of his time working toward the total eradication of the opposition . <P> In the process , Nkrumah has pulled every political trick he knows . He has deported some critics , jailed others . At least nine M.P.s belonging to the opposition defected to the C.P.P. when Nkrumah made it clear that , unless they did so , no government money would be spent in their constituencies . And in persuading ordinary villagers to see the light , Nkrumah 's government got good service out of the Builders ' Brigade-ostensibly a kind of Civilian Conservation Corps , but actually an army of young toughs in yellow shirts , green trousers and red caps . <P> But successful as his methods were , Nkrumah still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat on Oxford-educated Kofi Busia , 46 , head of the opposition United Party . In his efforts to undermine Busia , Nkrumah managed to get Busia 's brother deposed as the Paramount Chief of Wenchi , and last June had himself installed as the yeferiheni ( head ) of the Wenchi royal family . Finally , Nkrumah got his chance to eliminate Busia himself when the opposition leader announced that he was leaving for a lecture tour of Europe . The government broadly hinted that if Busia ever came back , he might be thrown into jail under Ghana 's egregious Preventive Detention Act . Busia took the hint ( TIME , July 13 ) , decided to stay abroad , and all that was left for Nkrumah to do was to get his own stooge elected to Busia 's vacant seat . <P> This time Nkrumah added something entirely new to his already colorful manual on how to succeed in African politics . As United Party leaders got set for the election by taking the precaution of recruiting some young goons of their own , Nkrumah sent out secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was a moral disaster for the U.P. : by the time election day came round last week , Ghana 's uncorrupted , British-trained police had been forced to arrest 82 United Party toughs , while only seven of the C.P.P. 's boys got into trouble . And two C.P.P. men-the only martyrs of the whole election-lay dead , the victims of a U.P . mob . After that , Nkrumah 's candidate was a shoo-in , and the P.M. himself could turn to other things . At week 's end he turned up before the steering committee of the All-African People 's Congress in Accra to deliver a stirring anticolonial address . Its theme : no African will ever be really free so long as other Africans are not .
