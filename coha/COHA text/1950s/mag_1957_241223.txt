Liberalization of the hidebound Spanish church seemed to get strong backing last week from Pope Pius XII . In a speech that sounded like an endorsement of Spain 's liberal , fast-increasing Opus Dei organization ( TIME . March 18 ) , the Pope urged a group of newly ordained Spanish priests to foster a " higher grade of generous catholicity " and to incorporate the church " more and more resolutely in those currents of mutual cooperation in which many persons today see the future and salvation of the world . " He reminded them that Spain , " although placed in a corner of this old Europe , is conscious that today already the trumpets are sounding in a world that must throw down the cracked walls of puny particularism . " The priests , said the Pope , should foster a " Catholic spirit that is ... capable of surpassing itself to reach others better without prejudice toward anyone ... "
