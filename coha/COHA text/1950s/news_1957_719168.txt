txt Formal proposals by Japan , India , and the Soviet Union , that the testing of nuclear weapons be halted , have highlighted one of the principal diplomatic problems facing the United States at the United Nations . How can the United States explain  --  and successfully " sell " ? its viewpoint that tests must continue until the whole nuclear arms race is brought under control ? The Soviet Union is riding high on the test-ban issue . Moscow has managed to portray itself as on the side of the angels . The Soviets have proposed that tests be halted for tw , o to three years , under UN control . Japan has suggested a suspension for approximately one year , beginning as soon as there is agreement " in principle " on inspection . India asks an immediate and wholly unconditional suspension , without any provision for control , The ban would continue indefinitely . The United States , on the other hand , is in the position of insisting on " all or nothing . " Washington has made the suspension of tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part , Washington says , may be separated from the whole . Britain , France , and Canada agree . Western Plan Outlined . Other parts of the Western plan include : I:Air and ground inspection to guard against surprise attack . ! - Diversion of all future production of atomic fuel to peaceful uses , under strict control . ' ' Reduction of manpower , conventional armaments , and arms budgets . ' , l Steps ( as yet unspecified ) to curl ) the development of space missiles . Must the United States and its allies hold out for the whole program ? Diplomats arc asking . A growing number of countries favors beginning with the test suspension . So many countries , in fact , feel this way that the United States may not be able to muster the necessary ma- jority for a UN endorsement of its package . In other years , the United States has escaped from a similar dilemma by one of two devices : either by combining all outstanding ideas into a single omnibus UN resolution which , when passed , can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " right " subjects ; or else by referring all proposals to the disarmament subcommittee " for further study , " thus avoiding a showdown . Difficult Task This year , however , it will be difficult if not impossible to take either tack . UN draftsmen , are skilled with language . But even they would find it hard to write a resolution which endorsed both a " package " and a single step at one and the same time . Referral to the subcommittee is a device which can be used to save face when both sides are willing to have their laces saved , or when one side is the Soviet Union and therefore a majority of the UN is willing to disregard its wishes . But when one side includes Japan and India . which want action , the diplomatic problem is far greater . The United States wants to retain their friendship . This is why their proposals  --  and especially that of Japan  --  are causing United States diplomats serious concern . Secretary of State John Foster Dulles attempted to explain to the Assembly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 why the United States feels it must go on testing its bombs . British Foreign Minister Selwyn Lloyd added further reasons Sept. 24 . Cool to Dulles Plea The Dulles case was that it is important to make atomic and hydrogen weapons " cleaner " ? that is , less productive of fallout  --  and better adapted to defense . " The Soviet Union seems not lo want the character of nuclear weapons thus to be refilled and changed , " he said . " It seems to like it that nuclear weapons can be stigmatized as ' horror ' weapons . Does it calculate that , under these conditions , governments subject to moral and religious influences will not be apt to use them ? " ? This argument was not particularly effective in the UN , where it is hard for many to think of atomic bombs as anything but " horror " weapons , whatever their size and cleanliness . Nor did Mr. Dulles meet the concern of many over the etTects of radioactive fall-out test explosions . Mr. Lloyd took a new tack , contending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does nothing to reduce armaments , " he said . " 11 does not prevent further countries emerging ? possessors of nuclear weapons . " . Lloyd View Disputed This argument was not much more successful . Advocates of a test ban , while agreeing that the step would not be " disarmament " in the strictest sense , vigorously disputed Mr. Lloyd on the second point , Few countries , they said , would invest . the huge sums necessary to build nuclear weapons which they could not legally test . The West 's problem , therefore , remains unsolved . It might be easier , observers feel , for the case to be presented simply and persuasively , if the government in ' Washington were wholly agreed within itself that its test program is essential . There is , however , no such agreement . And even if the United States were to decide to bow to popular pressures . Britain and France ? especially France  --  might well hold out . Some diplomats and observers here , recalling earlier suggestions that the United States offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this had been taken before Washington was pushed into its present uncomfortable position .
