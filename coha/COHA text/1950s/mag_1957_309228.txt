HEROIC measures have been taken through the centuries to preserve the art of ancient civilizations , but in some cases the best preservation was disguised as destruction . Swallowed up and believed lost forever when ships carrying them went down , countless Greek statues rested at the bottom of the sea for a couple of millenniums . Now many of them have been fished out , and it is plain that Father Neptune was a first-rate curator . Among others , three bronzes , of a god a philosopher and a youth ( opposite ) , came up looking little the worse for their long immersion , were sent back to the place of their origin , and are now on view at the National Museum in Athens . <P> These three from the sea make their latest appearance with more than 150 other works of art in Greek Sculpture , text by Reinhard Lullies , photographs by Max Hirmer ( Abrams ; $12.50 ) , a handsome book that presents the entire range of Greek sculpture , from its origins to its final decadence , through Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman copies . In form , these figures are exactly what the ancient Greeks saw . But the note originally struck is muted : the brilliant colors with which the Greeks painted their statues have rubbed off the marble , and the burnished-gold hue of the bronzes has tarnished . Nonetheless , like buildings whose stone faades take on a glowing quality with age , the Greek bronzes may be no less winning for their centuries-mellowed patina.
