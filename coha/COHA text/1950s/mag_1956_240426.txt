Charging past the 16th-pole , the four great horses seemed almost to be running in harness . Tensely the crowd at Florida 's Hialeah race track watched the melee of heads and hoofs . The spectacle was a tribute to the talent of Handicapper Charles McLennon , who had carefully weighted the entrants in the mile-and-a-quarter Widener . There was Nashua ( running for the first time since he was bought by a syndicate from the Woodward estate for $1,251,200 ) , lugging 127 Ibs. ; " the Big Horse " was inching up gamely on Alfred Vanderbilt 's Find ( 114 Ibs . ) . Between them , Brookmeade Stable 's Sailor ( 119 Ibs. ) hung on under his own courage . On the outside was Vanderbilt 's late-closing Social Outcast ( 121 Ibs . ) . <P> It took a photo to separate the four ; Jockey Eddie Arcaro had booted Nashua home by a head . Second was Social Outcast , third the tired Sailor . As a first dividend for his new owners , Nashua earned $92,600 , boosting his earnings to $1,038,015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just $47,745 poorer than Citation .
