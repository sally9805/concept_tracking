In the battle over which is to be the TV capital of the U.S. , Hollywood last week had a comfortable edge over Manhattan . On a 25-acre tract in the middle of Los Angeles , CBS dedicated a new TV City , a supermodern expandable plant covering 8 acres , and outfitted with enough doodads and gadgets to make even the best-equipped movie studio envious . <P> For its dedication ceremony , CBS brought out a flock of stars-M.C . Jack Benny , Burns &; Allen , Lucille Ball , plus such other big California names as Governor Earl Warren and Los Angeles ' Mayor Fletcher Bowron ( who all turned in first-rate performances ) . The program , like most such , was long ( 60 minutes ) and draggy , but it perked up in spots . Sample : Gracie Allen telling Governor Warren about the " deplorable " excessive drinking in the Senate- " I read about Senator Knowland trying to make a speech from the floor-and the Speaker of the House was even in worse condition-he did n't even recognize him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onetime ( 1946-50 ) president of Lever Bros. , whose architectural firm ( Pereira &; Luckman ) designed the building , are flexibility and low operating cost . The new plant is supposed to save 37% in the time necessary to put on a show . Everything-from raw materials to finished product-is under one roof : rehearsal halls , four studios , a 35-man carpentry shop , a paint shop , even a plaster shop that makes everything from fake balustrades to bottles that shatter when bounced lightly off an actor 's head . CBS can also store , for quick reuse , all its scenery and sets ( in Manhattan the company spends about $40,000 a week just trucking sets to &; from the studios ) . <P> " We discarded every idea that took our eyes off the ball , " says Luckman . For example , TV City has no restaurant , because no place could be found for it " without interrupting the production flow . " For the same reason , there are only four of five showers for the droves of actors . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western notion : actors do n't have them in New York . One innovation that harried network vice presidents in Manhattan will envy : the sponsormobile , a 14-ft. - by- 16- ft. portable glass bubble designed to be rolled about the TV stages by an electric truck . The sponsor , sitting inside , can see and hear but can not be heard . Says Luckman : " We can move the sponsor where the action is best , so he can see how he 's spending his millions . " <P> TV City is intended , for a time at least , only for live programs . Such filmed shows as I Love Lucy will still be made at movie studios . The thing that worries some television producers : will top-quality programs suffer from movieland 's standardizing touch ? Said one official : " Everything will be bigger and more imitative than ever . " Another agreed : " We 're going to get quiz shows that are better lighted than ever before , but they 're still going to be quiz shows . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
