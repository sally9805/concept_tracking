In a weak moment Gossipist Walter Winchell confided to his readers : " The reason I talk fast is that if I talk slowly people will be able to hear what I say and find out how dull and unimportant it really is . " But for his return to TV last week on ABC 's filmed crime series , The Walter Winchell File , the columnist-turned-actor slowed down his Teletype voice ; what he said was still unimportant but , thanks in considerable part to a good script by ex-New York Daily Mirror Reporter Adrian Spies , never dull . The story concerned a psychopathic killer , who haunts a frightened cop , " a man without guile , walking perhaps to death when his heart was full of new life . " Winchell 's old vaudeville training stood him in good stead , especially when he had to talk about " the tabloid fury of the only city that never truly goes to sleep " or play amateur detective and whoosh across town in his radio car , sirens screaming , to beat the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plain little moral : " It 's all right to be afraid-just as long as you still do what must be done . " <P> The Winchell of File , white-haired and 60 , was a tame version of the once combustible keyhole crier . Gone were the high-decibel-count croak and Morse-key jangle , the creaky song-and-dance routines of last year 's variety show . Now there was only the occasional clatter of the typewriter-onscreen and off-and on TV even this was restrained enough to be realistic . Though File claims to be based on his " private files , " Winchell admits there are fictitious strokes " to avoid any trouble legally . " Did he always beat the cops to the scene when prowling around Manhattan ? " Normally the cops were there when I arrived , " says he , then adding , like the more familiar Winchell : " Once or twice I got there too early . " <P> Its own officials deplore the U.S. postal service as a relic of shabby inefficiency , but no harsh words do it quite the justice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Murrow back to a new season of See It Now on CBS this week . Cameras behind the scenes of Manhattan 's main post office caught the overwhelming frustration of an archaic system , dispirited employees and a staggering , endless load of work . They also recorded pent-up grievances of clerks , letter carriers and their boss , Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfield , presented the contrast of smooth modernity in the mails of Switzerland and The Netherlands and such private U.S. businesses as United Parcel Service , explored the problems of whether and how the post office should pay its own way-instead of losing $2,000,000 a day . Murrow gave both sides of such thorny issues as whether to charge more for magazines and periodicals that enter the mails at second-class rates . Summerfield told Murrow that the rates amounted to a $250 million a year " subsidy " to publishers . For magazine publishers the Reader 's Digest 's Albert L. Cole hotly disputed such figures , argued that Congress intended low magazine postal rates to promote education and the public interest . <P>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
