Some 10,000 years ago , when glaciers chilled northern Europe , the Sahara desert was a fertile , well-watered land . Among the most favored parts of it must have been the Tassili-N-Ajjer , a plateau about 900 miles southeast of Algiers . Today the region is one of the driest deserts on earth and almost uninhabited , but in prehistoric and early historic times it boiled with vigorous life . Last week French Anthropologist Henri Lhote was back in Algiers with proof of what Tassili-N-Ajjer ( which means river plateau ) was like while the rains still came . <P> Four Hundred Paintings . Dr. Lhote took four young painters to copy colored drawings in cramped caves . Like stone-age Europeans , the early people of the Sahara had their holy shrines deep underground , and they decorated them with magical drawings long after Europeans had given up the custom . The Lhote expedition copied faithfully 400 cave paintings . Ten thousand more were found but not copied . <P> No high civilization ever developed in the Sahara , but the Tassili region seems to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The earliest paintings in the caves are primitive . Slightly later drawings are more sophisticated . Dr. Lhote believes that the ancient people of Taasili developed an independent artistic style not derived from cave art elsewhere . <P> Tassili , though remote , was not alone in the ancient world . Some of the drawings show great troops of cattle , proving that the domestication of animals , one of man 's greatest achievements , had reached Tassili , probably through Egypt . <P> Camels &; Masks . Other signs of Egyptian influence are drawings of Nile boats and of bearded strangers with shields and spears and feathers in their hair . Then appear camels and horses . The war chariot - that great invention of ancient warfare - was at least heard of in the depths of the Sahara . Many of the drawings have not been interpreted yet . They show drinking bouts and hunting scenes , priests sacrificing a bull , a " ballet " of 40 ostriches and humans wearing animal masks . <P> Besides the copied drawings , the expedition brought back tools , mortars for grinding colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the finds contain carbon and can be dated by radioactive carbon 14 . When this has been done , and when scholars have studied the drawings and artifacts , a history of a sort can be written of the fertile river plateau that slowly died of thirst after the glaciers melted.
