Ever since the cold war began , the U.S. and U.S.S.R. have been locked in a world-wide grapple for men 's minds . Often it seemed that the U.S.S.R. was making giant strides ahead , particularly among the emergent new nationalists and neutralists of Asia and Africa . Last week the U.S. was winning new trust and confidence while the U.S.S.R. reaped a bitter harvest of distrust , disillusionment and despair . <P> During the 40 days of the world crisis , the trend to the U.S. was often lost in the gunsmoke ; yet it was the manner in which the contestants were behaving in the test that affected the course of world opinion . U.S. Middle Eastern policy was the target of angry criticism in Europe and unofficial Washington , but it was precisely this policy that demonstrated to the world , In terms of high drama , the U.S. 's traditional adherence to the principles of law and justice . U.S. policy on Hungary was criticized as too little and too late ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , but nevertheless the U.S. was offering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deportation to the steppes . <P> The New Heroes . Around the world as the Christmas festoons went up , the contrasting impact began to show . Only last spring , Iceland ( pop . 158,000 ) , lulled by Soviet coos of coexistence , had asked U.S. troops and airmen to pull out of the strategic air base of Keflavik ; last week Iceland considered Budapest and reversed itself , asking the U.S. troops and airmen to please stay . <P> India was gripped by such a wave of articulate anti-Communist opinion that even Premier Nehru , World Neutralist No. 1 , had to heed it . On the eve of his visit to Washington , Nehru still talked about a Communist thaw and a need to conciliate the Soviet Union , but he also had much kinder words for U.S. policy past and present , overflowing personal tributes for President Eisenhower and , most surprisingly , thoughts of stronger support for South Viet Nam 's doughty anti-Communist President Ngo Dinh Diem , whom Nehru had once belittled as a U.S. puppet . " What good will the U.S. has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's Statesman reported , " was accomplished overnight by a bold and imaginative decision . " <P> Every day across the Arab world Eisenhower was hailed as a hero . While the ambassadors of Iraq , Iran , Pakistan and Turkey made a special call at the State Department in Washington and thanked the U.S. for its support , U.S. ambassadors in the Middle East reported a friendliness they had never known before . <P> The Next Task . Nowhere had the U.S. stand against aggression in Suez been more hotly criticized than in Britain and France , but last week , after a speech by Vice <P> President Richard Nixon that foreshadowed new U.S. economic aid ( see below ) , British and French bitterness eased . Over all , Budapest cast its dark shadow . " Communist prestige , " said a French Foreign Office spokesman , " has dropped to an alltime low in Europe . " <P> In the free world , doubts , problems , deficiencies and divergences persisted , and events to come could well shake and Change the new trend toward unity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for peace and justice in the world . To turn that realization into a lasting asset is the next task of U.S. foreign policy .
