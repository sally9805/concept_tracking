The hottest form of advertising promotion is the giveaway . This year U.S. businesses will hand out $16 million worth of appliances , cars , cameras and bric-a-brac on 22 network shows seen by most of the nation 's 43 million TV homes , and 250 local radio and TV programs . So popular are the shows that this week CBS and NBC each will add three new TV giveaway programs . NBC and ABC will start two more later in July . <P> Giveaway games are probably the cheapest form of TV publicity , since the manufacturer swaps merchandise-often low-priced items-for screen time . Ohio 's Tappan Co. gives away $230,000 worth of ranges yearly , figures a giveaway plug costs only .0042 per 1,000 viewers , far less than a regular TV commercial . But there is hot debate over how many sales are actually created by the giveaways . Says Bell &; Howell , which passes out $17,000 worth of movie projectors a year , mostly on This Is Your Life : " We like the idea , but we find it hard to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> What Sells ? Ronson Corp . hands out about $150,000 worth of lighters and shavers yearly on TV , figures it gets about $600,000 worth of screen time , which it feels ultimately boosts sales just as regular TV commercials do . Longines-Wittnauer believes that awarding its watches on TV greatly enhances their value : " People may not rush right out and buy , but over the year it pays off . " RCA Victor , Polaroid Corp . and Ford 's Lincoln-Mercury found that traffic jumped appreciably in their showrooms and stores after a single showing on NBC 's The Price Is Right , one of the fastest-rising shows on television . <P> Of all the programs , The Price probably gives the biggest payoff in sales because it reveals the prices of its prizes , also gives them several plugs , each with a camera shot and description . Furthermore , The Price allows its 30 million night-time viewers to bid for a $15,000-$40,000 giveaway " showcase " of merchandise ( the nearest estimate of the total retail value , without going over , wins it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each marked with an estimate of the showcase 's value . That meant many a viewer had gone to local dealers , at least to ask the price . <P> What Fails ? Philco Corp . is snowed under with price queries after a spot on The Price , calls the show " a genuine free commercial . " But Philco believes there is almost no value to lesser shows , in which the winner gets a staggering list of prizes , the product itself gets only a quickie mention , and the viewer gets only a flash look . Furthermore , to break onto one of these shows , a company often has to make an under-the-table payoff in cash or merchandise to the show 's producer or to a middleman . <P> Sunbeam gave up such giveaways because " they do n't do much good . " Motorola shuns them because they tend to cheapen the product . Lanvin Parfums <P> President Edouard Cournand holds that " if you give away too much too often , it loses its value . " The Evans Case Co. recently scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year on such matinee tearjerkers as Queen For a Day and The Big Payoff , because " we never traced a single sale to the TV giveaways . " General Electric also is cool to giveaways . Reasons G.E. : " Viewers may be encouraged to try to win a product rather than go out and buy it . "
