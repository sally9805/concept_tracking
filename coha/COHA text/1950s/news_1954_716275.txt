" The President did not refer directly to the Secretary nor to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , the Wisconsin Republican who is locked in ' dispute with the Army and its high command .

Introduced shortly before President Eisenhower spoke , the Secretary drew a warm response from the crowd that swarmed over the spacious natural amphitheatre of Freedom Park . The reception was at least equal to that given to Gov . William B. Umstead or Senator Alton Leanon , though it fell short of the rousing greeting given to the President .

" Ninety-nine per cent of all public officials that you have in city councils , in your state governments , in your governors ' chairs and in Washington , are devoted to that one purpose , because all Americans know that until we have peace , we can not ' march forward to attain the dream that was held  --  and so clearly stated ? by the men of Mecklenburg. " - Notes Disputed Record The Mecklenburg Declaration , thouhg its authenticity rests un-I der some cloud , is said to have been signed May 20 , 1775 , a full Year and six weeks before the national .

" The President , speaking extemporaneously. said the spirit of the Mecklenburg Declaration was under challenge from another doctrine that asserted , " The only values in the world that mean anything are materialistic values . " This conflict in belief is complicated , he said , by scientific discoveries that open up new ways of self-destruction . It was against this background that the Administration worked for peace , he declared .
