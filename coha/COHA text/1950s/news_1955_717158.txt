Details in Sports Section BY CHARLES BARTLETT ! Chicago Tribune Preen Service San Francisco , June 19 ? Jack ' Fleck , 32 year old Davenport , Ia. , professional ? operator of two municipal courses , is the new Open golf champion of these United States . Fleck dresses somberly like I a man named Ben Hogan . He is as impassive in mien as Ben Hogan . He uses the golf clubs Ben Hogan manufactures . He has a swing and an approach to shots mindful of Ben Hogan . On this misty afternoon , the relatively unknown Iowan , who Jack Flek stands 6 feet 1 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Hogan , in person , for the 55th Open championship of the United States Golf association . I Last Stroke 20 Foot Putt Fleck won the 18 hole playoff , 19th in U. S. G. A. history , with 69 strokes , one under par of 35-35 -- 70 for the slanting hills of the Olympic Country club 's 6,700 yard Lake course . The weary Hogan , seeking an unprecedented fifth title , took 72 swipes at the ball , two of them futile jabs in the thick rough off the 18th fairway . The Texas master 's last stroke was a 20 foot downhill putt that fell into the cup for a double bogey six on the last hole Ben Hogan may ever play in the National Open . 1st Midwest Victor Since 1933 Not since Sam Parks Jr . at Oakmont in 1935 , and Tony Manero at Baltusrol , N. J. , in 1936 , has an unexpected long shot come , thru to capture this country 's No. 1 prestige championship . Certainly Parks and Manero did n't earn their victories the way this lanky Iowan did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this titI6 since Nebraska 's Johnny Goodman scored in 1933 at Chicago 's North Shore club . Fleck gained his place in this cast by qualifying in the Chicago district trials at Lincolnshire June 6 . When he arrived here a few days before the tournament , Fleck was increasingly unhappy with his practice play . Ile scored a commonplace 76 in the first round . Twenty-six putts were valuable in a second round of 69 Friday . A 75 in yesterday morning 's third trip left him three strokes back of leader Hogan at 54 holes , 217 to 220 . Uses Only 29 Putts At 8:15 o'clock Chicago time last night , he climaxed the greatest finish in Open annals since Gene Sarazen played the final 28 holes with 100 strokes in 1932 . A No. 7 iron from the rough off Olympic 's last fairway and a 7 foot pressure putt earned bail a 67 and a tie with Hogan at 287 . Today , Fleck more than matched the man whose clubs he began using a month ago . The quiet Hawkeye , who was competing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out , that you expect only of Hogan . He sustained his reputation as one of the ' best putters ever to play in this tournament by using only 29 putts , seven of them single stroke greens , against Hogan 's 33 . Fleck went to the front at he dogleg fifth , when Hogan played a deliberate safety shot irons inc wiry grass for a bogey . The Iowan nicked a shot off par on the 8th , 10th , and 11th , giving him a three stroke reach , since Hogan fought back with a 40 footer for a matching deuce at the short eighth . Ben Only a Stroke Away Olympic 's feared rough , the bone of contention in this week-end 's autopsies , cost him a stroke at the 11th , but Hogan returned the favor by three-putting the 12th . The tired Hogan threw one of his last Sunday punches at the 14th , a 20 footer for a birdie that cut Fleck 's edge to two strokes . The old champ made his last stand at the 17th , where Fleck missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . Hogan was now only one stroke away and thus had the honor on the 18th tee . His driver shot to the 337 yard target darted into the deepest kind of rough at the left side . Fleck then pounded out his biggest drive of the day , 265 yards into the sloping fairway . Hogan swung once to escape the grasping stuff below him . He barely moved the ball . Another swing and he was still among the thistles . He finally reached the fairway in four and sent his pitch 20 feet above the pin . He rolled that borne like it was a two foot gim me . Fleck , a consistent member of the touring troupe this winter , will rejoin the troupe after flying home tomorrow morning . He collected first prize of $6,000 for his astounding uphill victory . Hogan earned $3,600.
