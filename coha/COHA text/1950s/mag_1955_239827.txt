Harold Macmillan , 61 , Eden 's successor in the Foreign Office , has long been regarded as the Conservatives ' " other " expert on foreign affairs in the House of Commons . With a self-assured stride , Macmillan last week left his desk at the Ministry of Defense and moved to Downing Street , where sits Her Majesty 's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . <P> Proper Background . In appearance , manner and background , Macmillan is typecast for Foreign Secretary . He is tall ( 6 ft. ) and debonair , with a dashing guardsman 's mustache and expensive tailoring casually worn . His grandfather , Daniel Macmillan , was a Scots crofter ( tenant farmer ) who migrated to London , and in years ago founded the now prosperous book-publishing house of Macmillan &; Co. , Ltd . Macmillan 's mother , the former Helen Belles of Spencer , Ind. , gave him what the English call " an American connection . " Wealth and precocity led to good schools ( Eton and Oxford ) , good marks ( a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good military record ( wounded three times in World War I ) , good marriage ( the second daughter of the ninth Duke of Devonshire ) . To these accomplishments , Macmillan added personal qualities of ability , ambition , independence . <P> Rebellious Years . Despite a proper Tory preparation , Macmillan spent the first half of his 30 years in politics in rebellion and dissent . In Depression years he attacked old-fashioned Tory economics , urging a society that would be " neither jungle nor beehive . " He once attacked the whole government bench as " a row of disused slag heaps , " and said the party was " dominated by second-class brewers and company promoters . " He protested Baldwin 's appeasement of Italy in the Ethiopian war by " renouncing the whip , " choosing the role of parliamentary independent almost two years before Eden 's better-remembered withdrawal from the Chamberlain cabinet in 1938 . <P> Climb to Power . When his friend Winston Churchill came to power , Macmillan , at 46 , at last got his first post , No. 2 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in North Africa as Churchill 's Minister Resident and political troubleshooter . There he helped negotiate the settlement between France 's Generals de Gaulle and Giraud , and became a good friend of Lieut . General Dwight Eisenhower . With his " American connection , " and acquaintanceships begun in North Africa , he feels a confident ease about relations with Washington . " We have been through it all together before , " says Macmillan . <P> After Churchill was driven from office by the Socialists in 1945 , Macmillan , along with Rab Butler , played a workhorse role in modernizing Tory doctrine and preparing the party 's electoral comeback . His reward : the Ministry of Housing , where , working a 16-hour-a-day clip , he brought the building of houses in Britain from 205,000 in 1950 to 354,000 in 1954.
