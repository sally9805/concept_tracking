As a young newspaper cartoonist in the early 1900s , Fontaine Fox took a streetcar ride that changed the course of his life . On the way to a friend 's house in Pelham Manor , near New York City , Fox rode a ramshackle suburban streetcar with a cheery Irish conductor who greeted every passenger by name , chatted about their families , and even waited for passengers who were not at their regular corners on time . When Fox asked for directions to his friend 's house , the conductor stopped the car , got out , walked to the top of a nearby hill , and pointing , said : " That the fellow who moved in a couple of months ago ? He lives over there . " Fox not only found the house ; he also got the idea for the Toonerville Trolley , and made it the basis of one of the best-known syndicated U.S. comic strips . Since he launched the trolley on its rickety way in 1916 , it has become synonymous with broken-down transportation everywhere , earned Cartoonist Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 70 , who likes to wear a cap like the trolley 's Skipper , drove his streetcar with its stovepipe mast to the end of the line . He drew his final panel and retired . <P> The Skipper deserves a rest . For 36 years his trolley , which was off the track as much as on , has done much more than erratically " meet all trains . " It has been the community center for a full cast of Toonerville characters , including derby-wearing Mickey ( " Himself " ) McGuire , who , says Cartoonist Fox , " is not merely a bully but a juvenile terror " ; Terrible Tempered Mr. Bang , the local thunderer ; Aunt Eppie Hog , the fattest woman in three counties ; " Whisky Bill " Wortle ; the Powerful Katrinka and dozens of other caricatures of small-town life in the U.S. Mickey McGuire became so well known as an impish tough guy that a child actor named Joe Yule Jr . changed his name to Mickey McGuire when he started out in Hollywood . He abandoned it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he owned a copyright on the character . Two years ago , with trolleys disappearing in the U.S. , Cartoonist Fox shattered the car in a wrenching accident and salvaged its parts for a new Toonerville Bus . But three months ago Proprietor Fox put the old Toonerville Trolley back on the track again , ready for its final trip . <P> Fontaine Fox has no intention of letting anyone else carry on the strip after his retirement . Says he : " I do n't think anyone can really carry on something that another person has created and worked on all his life . "
