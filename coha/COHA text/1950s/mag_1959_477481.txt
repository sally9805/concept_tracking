THE casual visitor to Madison , Wisconsin , is often bemused by the sight of rival state capitols , a mile apart on the main thoroughfare . One of these buildings bulks large behind a huge statue of Abe Lincoln , seated , brooding , and timeless . Actually it is not a state capitol ; it is Bascom Hall , the antique nerve center of the University of Wisconsin ? in many ways the archetype of the Big Ten and certainly one of the most vigorous of our state universities . The way the two " capitols " confront each other across a mile of department store and supermarket is no accident , for at Wisconsin the relationship between legislature and university is intimate , contentious , and fruitful . The University occupies the higher ground , and this , too , has symbolic overtones . " Madison is the only place where the academician looks down on the politician , " an alumnus told me recently , when I visited the city . And it is clear that no politician can propel his career by attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst , refrained from taking on Bascom Hill , despite its history ofliberalism at least equal to that of Harvard . The University of Wisconsin , encompassing hill and wood and plain and fronting the waters of Lake Mendota , is a merging of dizzying polarities . It is a state institution with relaxed admission standards . ( " Any high-school graduate in the state who really wants to can shoulder his way in , " an official admitted . ) Nevertheless , it is one of America 's great universities , with a Ph.D . production rate ? the Dow-Jones yardstick of the academic world ? up among the leaders . Amiably schizophrenic , it is at once an intellectual center and a playground for adolescents with an indomitable appetite for fun . It is where rural Wisconsin meets urban sophistication . Beer cascades endlessly , as one might expect in Wisconsin . Yet the Student Union sells five times as much milk as beer ; at 10:00 A.M. huge farm boys sip containers of milk while waiting for their next class . U11T is a seat of liberalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the supervision of student life is repressively mid-Victorian . ( Here rural values triumph , and the gaunt presence of mythical Aunt Minnie of Kenosha is heeded . ) Such collisions of opposites engender little comment . Last spring no one saw anything surprising in two adjacent art exhibitions at the Student Union . One was a cornball collection of Norman Rockwell 's Americana ; the other . a group of impenetrable and tortured canvases by German expressionists . The Hoofers , stolid partisans of ski trail and mountain , are next door to as arty a theater crowd as can be found west of Chicago . The silos and pigpens of the School of Agriculture border the tennis courts , alive with shapely girls in short shorts . It is a school where fusty professors are football-happy and the annual Military Ball must share the limelight with the annual anti-Military Ball . Its lake is legendary , but for most of the year it is locked in a Siberian winter . A final paradox : LW is in the heartland of America , but its personality is ineradicably European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , and its new President , Conrad Elvehjem , is a proud member of the Ygdrasil Norwegian Literary Society . In short , UW is an academic cosmos , where the enterprising student can find almost anything he wants . The statistics are awesome . To its 17,000 students ( 12,000 undergraduates , 5,000 graduate students ) UW offers a staggering 1,350 courses in 86 departments , ranging from the most crassly vocational ( Office Procedures ) to the most magnificently useless ( Advanced Sanskrit ) . It has a physical plant worth more than $84 million , and its annual operating budget exceeds 350 million . One thousand scholars , out of a faculty of 3,000 , hover over 1,500 research projects . Students from every state and 70 foreign countries jam its fraternities , dorms , and rooming houses . The main campus is so far-flung that there is a bus from the faculty parking lot to Bascom Hall . Its marching song , " On Wisconsin , " is known to more millions than any other and has been endlessly pirated . Traditionally it has the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students seem slow to anger . The unique flavor of the school ? the way citizen-student and administrator stand nose to nose ? was reflected in a recent meeting of the Contemporary Trends class at which President Elvehjem was a speaker . A sports-shirted studentgot up and asked bluntly if friction between the President and Dr. Joshua Lederberg was responsible for the departure of the Nobel Prize winner to the promised land of Stanford University . This struck Dr. Elvehjem as an entirely reasonable question , and he explained Lederberg 's departure in terms of shifting research interests . The populist tradition is deeply imbedded in the " Wisconsin Idea , " the conviction that the University belongs to the people and should render service to it ? " a wedding of soil and seminar . " This is expressed in extension centers , in research , and in the travels of the University 's resident artist , Aaron Bohrod , who tours the state talking art to farmers and their wives . As part of its extension service , the University will answer almost any question asked by a responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics , said reverently : " Wisconsin civilized the United States . " He meant such things as workmen 's compensation and social security , in which the state , under the leadership of University personnel , pioneered . SLICKERS AND BUMPKINS W ISCONSIN used to boast that it has more cows than people . UW , however , is no " cow college . " In fact , its ag students are the new Organization Men of farming headed for careers in food processing , farm machinery , or government service . Authentic bumpkins can be found among the short-course students in farming , for whom only grade-school education is required . Social cartographers abound at UW , and they are quick to divide the students into Langdon Street ( fraternity row ) , the dorm crowd , and the Independents . Langdon Street is identified with fun , anti-intellectual vigilantism , and consumption of beer little less than heroic . The dorm students ? most of them at the far end of the campus ? are reputed to be small-town or rural , ingenuous , and intellectually unformed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . The Independents ( called G.D.I. by Langdon Street ? God-damned Independents ) spill out of rooming houses and apartments to oppose Langdon Street Philistia . They provide the soldiery of dissent on campus and man the few frail barricades of radical causes . There is a sharp urban-rural split at UW . A sociologist summed up the rural personality : " The rural kids tend to be absolutist in matters of religion and family . They see divorce as an evil ; they lean towards ' familism , ' with relatives as part of the inner family . They are not really independent because of the extended family pattern . The University is expected to stand in loco parentis- We 're really euchred into a semi-parent position . " This has a great deal to do with the tight mesh of regulations under which the students chafe . A graduate assistant in English from New York City observed : " The urban students are more acute ; they catch on faster . But they sometimes have a superficial brightness . Rural kids are ingenuous , friendly , and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony , and he described with amusement the Chicago girl who sits and smiles with a sense of superiority whenever he indulges in irony . Her smile says , ' ' You and I get it , but the others surely do n't . " Martha Petersen , the amiable and perceptive Dean of Women , observed that city girls with problems " have a big thing about going to the psychiatrist . " On the other hand , to refer a small-town girl for therapy , " you have to sneak up on her . " The small-town girl sets modest goals . She is unlikely to think of a glamorous career in the State Department , and some with a four-point index ( as close as you can get to scholastic charisma ) are content to settle for elementary school teaching . There are striking differences in social life too . A rural boy came to a house-fellow and asked him for " some topics of conversation for a date . " Another bucolic gallant is in the habit of carrying three-by-five cards with deft little conversational gambits neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country kids to death . LOVE IN A COLD CLIMATE S E X morality has its rural and urban variations . When rural girls become involved in intimate relationships it is because of a deep and solemn love . They are often appalled at the cavalier way some of the more sophisticated girls have affairs with only a mild affection or a hazily defined intellectual compatibility as sanction . Carnal anarchy prevails no more at UW than at other universities . Certainly , the administration exercises a steely-eyed vigilance . ( A recent satiric skit has the president saying : " I spend 90 per cent of my time regulating the sex life of students , football for the alumni , and parking for the faculty . " ) Nevertheless , in warm weather there are beaches and cars . In the winter , according to a dorm supervisor , " sex is more challenging . " Satyrs do n't gambol in Midwesterngroves , but it would be naive to assume too much sexual quiescence . However , students feel little need to dramatize their sexual liberation . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue . A member of a big " social " fraternity said : " Oh , the boys talk about sexy girls . They like to take them out once or twice but do n't want to go steady with them . " And the women students , for the most part , are girdled in propriety . However , one girl , a freewheeling Independent . observed tartly : " The vividness with which so many nice girls describe what happens to other girls would suggest that they 're not as pure as they say . " Last spring , a mass-circulation magazine featured a provocative article entitled : " Are We Making a Playground Out of College ? " In it , UNA ' was severely castigated as a high capital of frivolity . The Daily Cardinal , UW 's newspaper , said : " We 've made Wisconsin a playground ; it 's up to us to reconvert it into an institution of higher learning . " A student leader , however , declared : " I 'm proud that we 're a college playground . They refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we pull some of our humorous events is a distinguishing feature . " A young man in the student Senate explained : " When visitors from Iowa come on a weekend . they tend to overdo things , because this is supposed to be a big play school . Students , however , do n't go out on a nine-month bender . " Then he pondered a moment and added , " Not unless they can adjust to it . " " Adjust or drown , " another boy said , as he hoisted his can of beer . How much fun is enough ? Has the University attained a balance between the life of ideas and extracurricular activity , or is the very notion of a great university sponsoring the elaborate apparatus of fun an absurdity ? Some faculty members think it is . " Our prestige goals are wrong ; they 're largely social , " a professor said . ( " College professors everywhere think their students are stupid , " an administrator countered . ) This much is clear : the pursuit of fun is ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homecoming ( floats and parades ) , Humorology ( skits ) , Campus Carnival , Haresfoot ( " All our girls are men , and everyone 's a lady " ) , weekends on lakes ( for which fraternities charter buses ) , dances , and parties , parties , parties . One of these was a " Pink and Blue Party " where , in an unwitting parody of themselves , the boys came in blue , the girls in pink , " and they were all supposed to look like children . " There may be something amiss when only seven students turn up for an academic-freedom forum , while thousands mill around at Campus Carnival . ( It is only fair to point out , however , that J. Robert Oppenheimer and Eleanor Roosevelt drew capacity crowds when they gave talks . ) Or it may simply be as one corn-fed girl remarked : " When we work , we work hard ; when we play , we play hard . " This playfulness sometimes has an unexpected element of social criticism . The word " Mickey-mouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the students are looking uneasily over their own shoulders . Two years ago , a naval ROTC unit was proudly doing close-order drill in a crowded stadium between halves of a big football game . Suddenly , out of Badger Block , the chauvinist cheering section , came a derisive song : " M-i-c-k-e-y-m-o-u-s-e . That 's the way you spell Mickeymouse . " ( There has long been opposition to compulsory ROTC . ) Throughout the enormous stadium , students picked up the chant . Fraternity and sorority row incurs a good deal of animus about UW 's overdeveloped play habits , since the Greeks are the chief artisans of fun . And beer consumption is the hallmark of the fraternity man . ( State Street leading away from Bascom Hill is lined with beer joints . ) A girl from Sweden described beer parties as " just a huge noise . You do n't even get to know the boys because they 're drunk before you even get settled . " A sorority girl frowned at the mention of beer . " ft gets to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a party I asked for a Coke . My date was so embarrassed , he asked me to pour the Coke into an empty beer can . " A fraternity boy , with a scrupulous sense of the fitness of things , said : " We want lots of milk on the table during the week and lots of beer on Friday and Saturday nights . ' ' I attended a fraternity party ? liquid and raucous ? in which the empty beer cans were placed neatly on top of one another in the shape of a pyramid . It mounted to the ceiling as the evening went on . Another party had a rock ' n ' roll combo ( Blackjack Corfines and his Hound-dogs ) , and couples twitched spasmodically to the music . UW students take a wry pride in having fathered the panty raid . There was also a small flurry of phone-booth jamming , some of it engineered by a local department store which offered prize money for a contest in front of the store . Rut . UW 's particular genius for horseplay expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deluge . Students pelting each other with buckets of water may conceivably be somekind of Jungian fertility ceremony . It is certainly part of the rites of spring . I arrived in Madison on a soft spring night , the first warm evening of the year . More than a thousand students milled around Langdon Street under the benevolent surveillance of the police . ( In the old days they used to fire their pistols over the heads of the students . ) The students offered a persuasive rationale for water fights . They had endured a bitter winter . " You did n't know which was more confining , " a student explained , " the four walls of your room or the snowbanks outside . " Springtime is the great liberation . Couples can hold hands without fear of frostbite . And the cracking of Lake Mendota , which had taken place just a few weeks before , was apparently sheer drains . DATING AND RATING S O C I AL life at UW has characteristic elan . The girls , of course , are coolly marriage-conscious . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy said testily . ) ' The ratio of men to women ? twelve to five ? is helpful . The royal road to matrimony was outlined to me : lavatiered in the sophomore year ; pinned in the junior year ; engaged in the senior year . To be sure , there are anxieties . A sorority girl confessed that if she is dateless on Saturday night she hesitates to be seen on Langdon Street . A fraternity boy remarked that he is taunted by his brothers if he chooses to study on Friday evening . " I think it 's a freshman 's school , " a sophomore girl said . " Freshman year is a big blast . You 're a new face and it 's all snow and beer and fraternities . Then when you 're a sophomore you see the boys on the street , and it 's just ' Hi . ' In the meantime , they 're looking over the new crop . " The Greeks and Independents glare at each other balefully . ( The dorm crowd , though populous , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucolic torpor . ) The Independents watch the pageantry of play with awed disapproval . The fraternity houses strike them as indecently Sybaritic ? some are remarkably luxurious ? or childish . ( One house is ornamented with a toilet bowl and a Model T Ford at its entrance . ) Sorority girls are stereotyped as trench-coated , short-haired , and rah-rah . " The sorority stuff , " a Student Union activist observed , " is even more Mickeymouse than the Union . Here are seventy-five girls who are automatically my friends because we all paid our dues . " The fraternity boys do their share of glowering . " The Independents are just people who do n't fit into groups , " one of them said . And an angry polemicist summed up the Bohemian fringe : " They scorn conformity , yet they all look alike . Each gray face and each black-stockinged leg , and each uncombed head looks like every other . They scorn the Bascom Hill cult without realizing that they are just as conformist . " Sooner or later , everybody meets at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Occupied daily by about 14,000 people , it is at once cultural heart of the University , lounge , restaurant , art gallery , workshop , forum , dance hall , meeting room , theater , and more . ( It also has a lovely dining terrace on the lake ) . No student need stray from campus , for the Union is both Parnassus and juke joint . On a Saturday night last spring , the Dolphins ( water ballet ) were splashing synchronously at one end of the campus : in the Union actors were posturing elegantly in scenes from " The Importance of Being Earnest " ; and a costume dance was in progress in a ballroom , where a Burmese student did an interminable fire dance . Meanwhile , the Rathskeller ( invariably called " The Rat " ) churned with talk , boy met girl in cavernous corners of the gloomy cellar , the juke box jumped , and all activity , solemn or gay , was lubricated by a flow of 3.2 beer ? mid milk . The Rat is the hangout for bearded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as for small-tow-it types enthralled by the colorful outlanders . But despite a lot of official rhetoric about foreign students , all is not well . A campus survey revealed that though students are willing to live in the same house with members of minority groups , they are reluctant to date them . Over half would not date a Negro or Oriental ; a third side-steps social contact with Latin Americans . Not unexpectedly , fratcrnity and sorority people are less tolerant than others . The bulletin hoards proclaim the teeming diversity of campus life . Under the sign for the Annual Military Ball ( ROTC formal ) is the announcement of the third annual anti-Military Ball ( informal , with recorded music ) whose theme is " The Street Where You Lived , or Dig You Later , Atom Crater . " The anti-Military Ball 's attendance doubled last spring ( from 200 to 400 ) and was enlivened by an attempted kid naping of its organizers as a reprisal for the abduction , by parties unknown , of a guard at the Military Ball . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old-fashioned college musical at UW . Wisconsin , of course , has Big Football . Even the more serious students respond to the zip and sparkle of a football weekend . One student described football as the only communal activity at the University , and he spoke with genuine affection of the march to the stadium ( " Nobody would think of driving " ) . To the highly sophisticated , football is a kind of secret vice publicly enjoyed . No intellectual will openly espouse it though he may attend all the games . A professor who grew up in the Midwest defined his attitude : " I like football . I like the pageantry . But colleges ought to hire good football teams and stop pretending the game has anything to do with education . " One faculty member suggested that the Chicago Rears be hired as artists-in-residence . President Elvehjem pointed out that the athletic budget is a modest million dollars against eleven million for research . " When you have 16,000 students on campus and no football to let off steam , you 'll have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( last season 's record : 7-1-1 ) , the football coach wants the team in the top 10 per cent to keep it even with the University 's academic standing . The coaching staff , by the way , shrewdly resists the impulse toward punditry so characteristic of coaches at other schools . ( The attraction of the life of the mind for muscle merchants has long been underestimated . ) Football players have become seriously devalued in recent years . They are Saturday 's children , neglected the rest of the week . No longer heroes , they are just hulking mercenaries to the students . THE LIFE OF THE MIND W HAT about intellectual life at UW ? Estimates vary . A recent study reveals that the University , despite its open-house philosophy , is getting higher-ranking students from high schools than do the country 's colleges as a whole . ( In 1955 , 54 per cent of the freshmen were from the top quarter of their class , while only 5 per cent were from the bottom quarter . ) Fred Harvey Harrington , the able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Students are better academically than they were . " The range of ability is wide . According to an informal estimate by an English professor , one-third of the students have difficulties in expressing themselves . " 1 gave an exam and used the world ' expendable , ' " one man reported . " A number of students asked what it meant . " But it is the flaccidity of intellectual life that grieves the faculty . " It 's difficult to get them to talk , " a distinguished teacher of literature observed . " They 're so accustomed to a passive role . They submit to authority ; they hesitate to risk their intelligence . It 's almost as if they were painted on the wall . " Then he added compassionately : " I often think there arc too many of them and too few of us . ' ' A girl made a bold assertion about mass education in one of her courses . Her instructor challenged her thesis . " I take it back , " she said meekly . A social scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't inquire about religion . There is an organized religious structure , and they accommodate themselves to it . They take for granted that they 're going to be married ? and married soon . This represents a decline in individuality , for when you marry you limit your individuality . You take on a conservative component . They simply do n't feel enough . The job of the social scientist is to get people to think objectively about subjects for which they feel some passion . But these kids are not impassioned about anything . " There is , to be sure , a free commerce of ideas on campus . Recently a Marxist ideologist spoke to students about racial segregation , and shortly thereafter a priest advanced " Christian arguments for capitalism " to the members of the Conservative Club . It is UW 's proud boast that it was the last college campus to maintain a chapter of the Labor Youth League , an allegedly Communist-front group . ( Former President Ed. win B. Fred fought the American Legion on this issue . ) The small group finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt accelerated by the Student Handbook , which let people know that the LYL was on the Attorney General 's list . At one time , membership rosters of organizations had to be submitted to the administration , but the students successfully fought that regulation . The students have also officially opposed loyalty oaths in connection with the National Defense Education Act . Student intellectuals fall into at least three elites : the New Idea group ( editors of the literary magazine , who , according to one critic . " have not budged an inch from the avant-garde " ) ; foreign intellectuals ; and fraternity boys with a taste for ideas , who have tired of fraternity-house fatuities . ( One professor asserts that there are many intellectuals immured in a kind of cozy concentration camp on Langdon Street . " Our job should be to help them break out , " he said . ) The Green Lantern , an eating co-op , is one of the more spirited intellectual enclaves . Reputed to be vaguely leftist and aggressively Bohemian , its members are full of a strident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurdity of some of their postures . A raffish congregation , they hunch over cigarette-scarred tables in their co-operative cave ( the co-op is in a cellar ) and intone slogans for new crises . The hard core is from New York , shaggy-headed and fiercely intellectual , wise-guy heirs of the dead wars of the ' thirties . Around them are a few pretty girls , surfeited with the inanities of Langdon Street , and some small-town boys awed by these articulate avatars of protest . ( " They come as Taft conservatives and leave as Socialists , " one of the ideologists said . ) Nevertheless , one boy called me stealthily by phone to protest his innocence of the heresies I heard expressed . He was opposed , he said , to " creeping Socialism . " " I go there only because the food is cheap . " The Green Lantern denizens express themselves pungently . Football : " We sit on the steps and watch the parade of citizens go by . Then we listen to the roar . " ROTC : " You march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Fraternities : " They metabolize a lot , but their ends are trivial . " Wisconsin boys : " Naive but very decent ; free from the oppressive neurosis of New Yorkers . " Themselves : " We 're not rebels ; we all had happy childhoods . " They even have a social chairman to betoken their normality . Particularly exhilarating are visits by candidates for office in student government . These poor innocents are badly roughed-up by the cerebral hoods of the Green Lantern . The final word , however , belongs to a Wisconsin girl who fled the joys and terrors of the co-op . " I could stand the talk , " she explained , " but I could n't endure the dirt . " No doubt the most talked-about student at UW is Richard S. Wheeler , the Cardinal 's acidulous commentator on manners and morals . An unabashed disciple of Mencken , Wheeler assails the students ' liberal pieties in a prose of unusual trenchancy . ' The trouble with fraternities , " Wheeler wrote at a time when the University passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is not that they are undemocratic but rather not aristocratic enough . " He dismissed idealism as " a malignant tumor of adolescence . . . a kissing cousin of superstition and fantasy . " He raised hackles with a column on necking : " Every time a young lady necks , she 's taking a lesson in frigidity .... " After the piece appeared , he received calls from irate young men whose erotic maneuvers had been repulsed by young ladies brandishing the column . Wheeler also does deadpan interviews with Badger Beauties to " make them look like the dumb blondes they usually are . " One guileless doll prattled on in this fashion : " I think psychology is so interesting . One professor has a wonderful theory and at the end of the semester you really believe him , and then next semester another professor refutes everything . I would say that psychology is a science ... it 's good , but it has its bad aspects too . " Another beauty confessed : " I was thinking of attending Radcliffe , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's not moral . " THOSE WHO CAN , TEACH T H E faculty at UW is considered strong and no more factious than most . Salaries are good but not good enough . The average for a full professor is $10,052 ; associate professor , $7,572 ; assistant professor , $6,166 ; instructor , $5,068 . The campus , which has been described as " sublime " by at least one visiting Englishman . is supposed to be worth $1,000 a year , but assent to this quaint notion by faculty is not easily obtained , Nevertheless , many faculty people , modest salaries notwithstanding , live in handsome suburban developments . There are even some futuristic homes which make East Coast suburbia look timid and unadventurous . The strongest departments are biochemistry and history . There is some uneasiness among the arts people about the research bounties that scientists have for the asking . There was the hope that President Fred would be succeeded by a man in the humanities or social sciences , in a kind of rotation . ( Elvehjem is a biochemist who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has not been too much grumbling about research money . Frederick Hoffman of the English Department pointed out that a state legislative committee would have to approve a research grant for him . " How will they react to the theme of death in American literature ' ? " he mused . " Better than the Scottish Chaucerians . ' " A normal teaching load is three courses a week ( nine teaching hours ) , and the University expects scholarly output from its faculty . Faculty members range from strenuously informal types in sports shirts and tennis shoes to a Harvard Ph.D . in pencil-thin tie , scrupulously narrow suit , and a faintly supercilious manner , who seems determined to maintain an outpost of gentility among the corncribs . Careerism rockets along at UW , and relief is in sight only when one is a full professor with tenure . There is also fierce intercollegiate rivalry for academic talent , and former President Fred used to keep a scoreboard of faculty people who went to the University of Michigan ? the big rival ? and vice versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Chicago asserts that there is far more communication among departments at UW . There is even a measure of good will toward deans . " At least they 're scholars and researchers , " a faculty member said grudgingly . I talked with a sociologist who was full of that ponderous jargon without which the social scientist feels undressed . After discussing " well-structured family interactional patterns , " he turned to life in Madison and plunged into a more comprehensible idiom . " Boy , this town 's a drag , " he said . " Occasionally , my wife and I want to get something to eat late at night , but Madison folds up at 1:00 A.M. On New Year 's Eve , there are the same people counting noses to see who is at whose party . " It is characteristic of UW as an open society that the phone numbers of faculty members , and their addresses , are published in a directory available to all students . Students phone for the flimsiest of reasons . It was former President Fred who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our dirty linen in front of Abe Lincoln 's statue and wash it in public . " In recent months , the proposal to erect a new building in Bascom Woods , near the famed carillon tower , provoked a spirited controversy . Everyone had his say ? the woods are sacred ? and the building plan finally squeaked through by a narrow margin . The University 's grandiose building program has generated some student resentment . The new Chadbourne Dormitory , eleven stories of Miami Beach decor with a huge ? V on top , was quickly tagged the Chadbourne-Hilton . " How much is the University going to waste ? " a student asked . Currently , there is agitation to eliminate compulsory ROTC . Repeal is favored not only by students but by the administration , which feels that the University should be in position to decide about it . And next year the 1960 Clause , which outlaws discrimination in fraternities and sororities , goes into effect after a long and bitter debate . But the most acrimonious dialogue has to do with apartment regulations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and will increase , " an official pointed out , " but the rules are old and outmoded . " In truth , they smack unpleasantly of a police state . A male student living in a building into which an unmarried woman moves is required to move out . A forty-five-year-old New Zealander lived in the same building as a seventy-one-year-old woman . Haled before the Student Conduct Committee , he protested , " Really , I had no designs on her . " A student living in an apartment is required to report a roommate who entertains a female . ( " But I was asleep , " a boy protested . ) This rule , of course , is contemptuously ignored . ON WISCONSIN ? WHITHER ? T H E University views itself ? its progress and grandeur ? with uneasy pride . UW is so ambitiously extended that the new shibboleth on ? campus is balance ? between teaching and research , between undergraduate and graduate work , between the liberal arts and professional education , between service to the state and to the nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare . Maintaining quality in a school determined to give everyone a chance is also a headache . The fact that eight state schools have changed over from normal schools to four-year colleges may , in the future , drain off weaker students who would otherwise come to UW . The University now gives advanced standing to particularly able high-school graduates , and it is instituting an honors program ? hut with a peculiarly egalitarian twist . " Our hope is to help gifted students without tagging them , " the President said . " Our bright people will learn by rubbing shoulders with average ones . " A great tradition is a burden as well as a joy . Has Wisconsin already had its great day ? " There is little doubt that it lost some of its fire between the wars , " Vice President Harrington said . " There was a deflation of idealism , and other states began to originate things .

UW people cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California ? the General Motors of higher education ? has been raiding faculties remorselessly .

" There is something extraordinary about Wisconsin , " an administrator said . " After all , it 's just an ordinary little state , its population no larger than that of Brooklyn . Yet this small state has created a great university . " At the conclusion of his inaugural address last fall , President Elvehjem declared : " Give us , then , the hills to climb and the strength to climb them . " Students wheezing up Bascom Hill would no doubt find this funny , but they too have been touched by the vision .
