Five years ago , Norway 's Trygve Lie was the Soviet Union 's candidate for first president of the U.N . Assembly . He was beaten , 28 to 23 , by Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak . Then Lie , with the warm approval of the U.S.S.R. , was elected U.N . ' s secretary general . Lie continued to enjoy Soviet favor until he reacted with indignation to Communist aggression in Korea . <P> Last week in the Security Council , the U.S.S.R. cast a veto-its 46th-against another five-year term for Lie . The General Assembly can not re-elect Lie unless the Council so recommends . But , the Assembly , which fixed his original term , can - and probably will-extend Lie 's present term of office .
