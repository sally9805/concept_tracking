Amid the gently rolling countryside of Beltsville , Md. , there is a strange garden that would drive any weekend horticulturist to distraction . Among the odd sights : pine trees that grow only 8 in. tall , chrysanthemums that flower in spring instead of fall , poinsettias that bloom in June 's heat instead of Christmastime cold . But these plant anomalies are manmade . For U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists have discovered the mysterious chemical in plants that regulates plant growth , have found that they can stunt trees at their pleasure , make flowers bloom when they choose . <P> Light in the Darkness . Nurserymen have known since 1920 that certain plants could be made to bloom earlier than usual by shading them with opaque cloth for part of each day . Guess was that something in the plant 's internal mechanism recorded the smaller amount of sunlight , signaled the plant that the days had shortened , that colder weather was approaching , and that it had better flower fast . But botanists were unable to identify the day-measuring mechanism or explain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists under Dr. Sterling B. Hendricks , 60 , first played all the colors of the spectrum on a variety of plants . Most colors had no effect . But when red light was played on the plants , the effect was dramatic . They reacted even to a brief , 30-sec. flash of red light during a 14-hour period of darkness . Apparently programed to the proposition that a new day had begun , the plants altered growth cycles accordingly . <P> Having learned that red light was the key , the scientists squeezed the juice out of bean seedlings , separated the juices into many different fractions , and tested each for its reaction to red light . Their quarry proved to be a protein-containing pigment that makes up only one part in one million of the juice . <P> Change in the Morning . In a way that scientists still do not fully comprehend , the pigment changes its chemical structure when red light hits it . As long as the red light lasts , the new structure persists . When the light dies , the pigment begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process that takes roughly twelve hours . Thus , when the red rays in the morning sun strike a leaf , the light-sensitive pigment changes into its new state and stays that way until sundown . This tells the plant , in the chemical language to which it responds , how long the day is and therefore what the season is , <P> To check their findings , Beltsville 's men dosed plants with red light at all hours of the night . Fooling plants into believing the nights were longer or shorter than they really were seasonally , the scientists were able to make plants bloom months early or late . They have so efficiently programed some pine trees that they grew only 8 in. in four years-responding to the signal that it is winter , no time for growth-while their unmolested neighbors rose to 20 ft . <P> The Beltsville substance is so new to chemists that it has not yet been analyzed or even named . But it is a major discovery in basic knowledge , may lead to bigger crops grown faster , and to control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hitting a carburetor with a hammer for years in an attempt to adjust it , " says Dr. Hendricks . " Discovering this pigment is like learning that a screw on the bottom of the carburetor is what regulates it . "
