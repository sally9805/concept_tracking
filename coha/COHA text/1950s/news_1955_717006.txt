txt The Senate Republican leader , William F. Knowland of California , asked today for a Senate inquiry into the Administration 's failure to free fifteen United States airmen from Communist China 's prisons . Senator Knowland , who has often criticized the Administration 's general policy toward China from the Republican Old Guard point of view , was joined in his plan by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon . Mr. Morse is a critic of that policy from the Democratic liberal wing . From the floor Senators Knowland and Morse expressed dissatisfaction with the efforts both of the State Department and the United Nations to obtain the release of the airmen . Eleven of the airmen were shot down in a B-29 on Jan. 12 , 1953 . Peiping charged the plane was over Communist Chinese territory and sentenced the fliers to terms ranging from four to ten years as spies . The United States contends the plane was over North Korea when it was shot down . Washington also has informed the United Nations that Peiping is holding four American jet fighter pilots in violation i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to propose an investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees in which Secretary of State Dulles would be summoned to tell " specifically and exactly " what has Department was doing in the matter . The Department , Mr. Morse told the Senate , has not been effective in persuading the United Nations to perform " its clear obligation . " " I fully concur , " said Mr Knowland . " I should go a step farther . I think the matter is of such importance that the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee shouI3 , not later than next week , get together and receive testimony from both the State Department and the Defense Department on the whole question of American prisoners of war still being held by the Chinese Communists . " " For while they admit to the holding of only fifteen airmen there is strong reason to believe , from evidence in the archives of the Pentagon , that there may be many other American GI 's who were supposed to have been released at the time of the Korean war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Californian added . The Senate Democratic leader , Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , made no comment on the Knowland-Morse proposal . The Democratic foreign policy leader , Senator Walter F. George of Georgia , was absent . Mr. George 's assent would as a practical matter be necessary before any such inquiry could be launched . The situation of the prisoners has " come to such an impasse , " Senator Morse asserted , that the Senate has " a clear duty to find out the facts and no longer leave this matter in the secret jurisdiction of the State Department . " Three months have gone by , Senator Knowland complained , since the United Nations Secretary General , Dag Hammarskjold returned from a mission to China that has not yet brought about the liberation of the prisoners , Mr. Knowland continued : " It seems to me that Mr. Hammarskjold owes a duty to the United Nations as a whole , because there may be other United Nations countries which also have citizens held as prisoners of war in clear violation of the terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthright report to the United Nations . He should say either that ' in my judgment we can not get these men out by the negotiations we have conducted and I am recommending a course of action which will put effective steps into motion to get them out , ' or he should say , if it is his decision , ' I do not believe the United Nations can do anything more effectively and I am not willing to recommend any steps which might be effective and I return the matter to the United States ' . " Senator Knowland once recommended a blockade of the Communist China mainland ? a course rejected by President Eisenhower  --  if necessary to free the United States prisoners . who have been held more than two years . He is also an advocate of military action to hold Quemoy and Matsu islands off the Communist mainland even , he has said , if the risk of a third world war should be involved . Senator Morse , on the other hand , opposes any action to hold those island positions for the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
