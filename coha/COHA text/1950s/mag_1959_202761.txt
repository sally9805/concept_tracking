Surrounded by countries that are having economic and financial difficulties , tiny Ecuador ( pop . 4,000,000 ) is a striking exception . It has an annual trade surplus , a currency more solid than the dollar , an economy growing by an average of 9% each year . Last week Conservative President Camilo Ponce Enriquez. 47 , dedicated 13 more miles of blacktop road through virgin farmland , rushed ancient Quito 's $10 million face lifting ( a jet airport , a new congressional palace ) , timed for the eleventh meeting of the Pan American Union next year . " Our people are working , ' ' says Ponce . " Our soil is flowering . " <P> At the base of Ecuador 's boom is a ten-year record of political stability , starting with Galo Plaza Lasso , 53 , onetime University of California fullback , who won the presidency in 1948 . The secret ingredient is democracy , both of thought and action . Coupled with the brains to take advantage of Ecuador 's rich soil , it brought the boom . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banana plantations through Central America , Galo Plaza spent every dollar his government could spare to open up the virgin coastal plain , where rich topsoil lay three feet thick . In ten years Ecuador built 1,600 miles of road . United Fruit opened a 7,000-acre plantation . Poor settlers from the highlands joined in and got 124 acres of government land free . Now Ecuador is the world 's biggest banana exporter , with shipments of $70 million last year . <P> " Crops are as sure as a blue-chip stock , ' ' says a Quito attorney . " You plant bananas for quick returns , and a second crop-either coffee or cocoa-for the long term . In five years your annual income equals your original investment . " As the second crops came to fruit , Ecuador 's coffee exports jumped from $3,000,000 to $25 million , cocoa from $6,000,000 to $20.5 million . <P> Realists point out that one reason why Ecuador moved ahead so fast was that it had far to go . Per capita income , though it almost doubled in a decade , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is run as an old family affair , grossly inefficient , protected by high tariffs . Yet Galo and his successors down to Conservative President Ponce Enriquez have brought hope for the future and , above all , freedom . Almost daily one paper or another roasts Ponce for " fraud , deceit and treason . " The President ignores them all . " Neither calumny nor insult disturbs me , " he says . " I have given the press free rein . "
