When the University of Connecticut chapter of the Phi Epsilon Pi Fraternity pledged Sophomore Alfred R. Rogers last fall , the grand council of the national organization promptly suspended it . The reason : Rogers is a Negro . Last week , at a special convention called for the purpose , delegates unanimously voted to reverse the decision . They not only approved of what Connecticut had done , but said that any of Phi Epsilon Pi 's other 35 chapters might do the same , if they liked .
