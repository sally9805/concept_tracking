Ancient Rome had a population of 1,000,000 . In 546 Totila the Goth sacked the capital ; for 40 days it had no inhabitants at all , according to the historian Gregorovius . Almost a millennium later , in 1527 after plunder and rapine by Charles V 's troops , Rome 's population stood at 32,000 . During the past century Rome grew from 201,161 in 1862 to 1,173,034 in 1936 . Last week the capital 's first census in 15 years found that it is growing almost as fast as Los Angeles , now has 1,600,011 people .
