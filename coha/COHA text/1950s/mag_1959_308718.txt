<P> The county-sized Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ( pop . 315,000 ; area , 1,000 sq . mi. ) is the smallest member of NATO , of the European Common Market and of the United Nations . But in some matters , little Luxembourg looms big . It is the tenth largest steel-producing country in the world ; its citizens are the most prosperous in Europe , and so fond of its own frothy beer and heavy dumplings that the Germans market corsets in Luxembourg that are outsized even by German standards . And , according to a U.N . report , Luxembourg 's drivers have the highest automobile accident rate in the world . <P> In an attempt to remove the bad-driving stigma from Luxembourg 's good name , the coalition government last year pushed through a seemingly routine law requiring all of the grand duchy 's drivers to undergo a yearly checkup on their cars , at their own expense ( $4 ) . It did not sit well . Opposition Leader Eugene Schaus charged that one firm had tried to bribe the Ministry of Transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister eliminated the firm from the list of candidates . Aha , said Schaus , but had he reported the bribe attempt within six days , as required by law ? In the resultant fuss , the government toppled and a general election was called . <P> Schaus 's party won , and last week , when the new government was formed , the furor over the accidents produced a major casualty . Portly , white-haired Joseph Bech , 72-a Christian Socialist who has been Foreign Minister for the past 33 years and a familiar florid figure at nearly every international conference since League of Nations days , in the company of the famed from Lloyd George to Macmillan-lost his job . The new Foreign Minister : Eugene Schaus.
