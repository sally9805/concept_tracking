The record number of straight passes in a dice game , according to Historian John Scarne , is 39 , set by a Texas lady at San Juan 's Caribe Hilton Hotel casino on January 18 , 1952 . The odds against the feat are 956,211,843,725 to 1 . ( Crapshooters will be appalled to learn that she netted a mere $1,600. ) // There is luck in prizefighting , but a principal factor is the quality of the opposition . The odds , therefore , are 9 to 5 that Sugar Ray Robinson will not make his fourth straight successful pass at rewinning the middleweight championship , which would be a bit of a record all its own . Though Robinson 's punch has , on occasion , upset the odds , the quality of his opposition on the night of March 25 at Chicago Stadium will be Carmen Basilio , a little man but young and tough , a stouter defender than Robinson has recently met. // Robinson 's previous rewinnings of the title were against Randy Turpin , Bobo Olson and Gene Fullmer . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in boxing , Sugar Ray 's reputation as a miracle-worker has benefited by a common wise guy belief that he sometimes has lost the title deliberately in order to take advantage of a rematch purse and betting odds . Let us say fie on such notions , which are belied by the pictures on the next few pages . They show Ray was trying against Basilio in their first fight . // The victories cited have been overrated , it seems here , as a gauge to what will happen against Basilio . The second Turpin fight was six years ago , when Sugar Ray was much closer to the prime of his fighting life than he is today . He beat Olson every time they met , which was four times . When he fought Fullmer the second time he took advantage of a country boy 's overconfidence. // But Sugar Ray is now far past his prime  --  he is officially 37 years old . He will be fighting a Basilio who has already beaten him , not an Olson who never could beat him . He will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson punch , as Fullmer could not . // That is the common sense of it . What Robinson has going for him in this fight is largely superstition ( Chicago has been a " lucky " town for him , " unlucky " for Basilio ) and the memory of what he used to be . Even the superstition does n't quite stand up for Robinson , though he first won the middleweight title in Chicago against Jake LaMotta , knocked out Rocky Graziano there and beat Olson and Fullmer there . But Chicago luck did him no good against Tiger Jones , who almost wrecked his comeback campaign with a 10-round victory three years ago and never could get a rematch . // The memory of what Robinson used to be returns to his muscles and reflexes now and then in a big fight , as it did last September when Basilio beat him in 15 rounds . There were moments in the fight , and not a few of them , when the Sugar Ray of the glory days seemed born again . But the renascence was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he lost the fight . Basilio fought full three-minute rounds , never looked brilliant but always looked tough . Robinson fought in flurries. // The flurries were just magnificent , though . With a year or two more of youth on his side , and a year or two less of games and gaiety , Robinson might well have kept his title . At least a couple of his punches were good enough to stagger Basilio. // Those punches , or more like them , are Robinson 's big hope . He may rely also on a tendency of Chicago officials to score more heavily on a good defensive showing than is customary elsewhere in the country . He has proved against Fullmer and Basilio that his dancing legs can carry him through 15 rounds without trouble , provided he does n't use them too much in pursuit of his man . // Well , he wo n't have to pursue little Carmen . So it could go the distance again . // It could end in another disputed decision , too . Quite a surprising lot of watchers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson won the first fight . But Basilio 's strong finish , capped by an 11th-round exhibition of pure fury , earned Basilio the decision in the minds of most ringsiders . The 11th saw Robinson driven to the ropes , where only his superb ring wisdom and Basilio 's suddenly amateurish eagerness prevented what seemed like an inevitable knockout . A fighter who is ordinarily contemptuous of head-hunters and believes in the virtue of a sound hook to the belly , Basilio forgot his precepts and concentrated on Robinson 's well-protected head . // AGE AFFECTS TIMING // He made another tactical error in the early rounds by electing to fight Robinson from an upright stance . He did this because one of Robinson 's finest weapons is an uppercut delivered against a crouching fighter . The stance taught him that Robinson has other fine weapons , too , and he quickly shifted to his natural bobbing , weaving style . The shift disclosed that age has affected Sugar Ray 's timing on moving targets . He missed repeatedly , and at times when he clearly hoped for a knockout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force had been spent . Such punches , which do not show clearly on television , or even a few rows back from true ringside , may have accounted for disputes about the decision . // In watching next week 's fight it might be well to note how much of each round Robinson spends in actual fighting , how much in resting himself for a spectacular flurry just before the close . He is a better actor than Rocky Graziano , you might say , when it comes to going through the motions without seriously expending an energy that must now be conserved if he is to last through a long bout . // What Sugar Ray needs in this fight is a knockout . These days he loses decisions to rugged , durable fighters like Fullmer and Basilio , men who have the youth and strength to force their kind of fight on him , who can counteract his skills with a kind of desperate doggedness . // He may get his knockout , though it did seem pretty well established last September that Basilio can absorb Sugar Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . Basilio never has been knocked out , but neither had Gene Fullmer until he invited a Robinson hook by advancing on one of the ring 's great punchers with his guard down . // One of the features of the fight is that in some parts of the country it will be shown on closed-circuit TV in fight arenas as well as movie houses . Some arenas will present live fights as preliminaries , then drop screens on the four sides of the ring for the televised main event . Others , and some movie houses , plan to show the films of the first fight . // That will make it a long evening of Basilio and Robinson but a fight fan could n't spend it better . Despite the long 9 to 5 odds , which may shorten , this will be a suspenseful affair right from the weighin. // The choice here is with the odds and for Basilio . Robinson ca n't keep coming back forever , can he ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
