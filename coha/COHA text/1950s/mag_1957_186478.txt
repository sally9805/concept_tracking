" Surgery of the heart has probably reached the limits set by Nature to all surgery : no new method , and no new discovery , can overcome the natural difficulties that attend a wound of the heart . " So in 1896 wrote eminent British Surgeon Stephen Paget . A few weeks ago at Philadelphia 's Hahnemann Hospital , eminent U.S. Surgeon Charles Philamore Bailey walked into a cluttered , unpretentious operating room which has attracted visiting medical men from all over the world . Dr. Bailey , at 46 one of the most daring innovators in heart surgery , was ready once again to push " the limits set by Nature " far beyond what was considered possible only five years ago . <P> The anesthetized patient on the operating table was a man of 50 whose heart had been seriously damaged by rheumatic fever . Electrodes taped to his ankles and wrists led to an electrocardiograph screen . He had a blood pressure cuff on the left arm , and the usual tube down the wind pipe , hooked up to an oxygen cylinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table . He drew a scalpel lightly across the patient 's chest , barely breaking the skin in a thin red line , to show where he wanted the incision . Then he stood by , relaxed , while an assistant cut deeper . To the surgical nurse standing on a low stool at the foot of the operating table , surrounded by trays of sterile instruments , went a running fire of orders : <P> " Mosquito " ( a small blood-vessel clamp ) . <P> " Four-O " ( a thread size ) . <P> " Peanut " ( a little pledget of gauze ) . <P> Three dozen or more minor blood vessels had to be tied off to stanch the bleeding . One surgeon would hold a clamp on a blood vessel while another passed the suture silk around it , deftly tying knots . With ribs and breastbone now lying bare , Bailey chose which bones to cut , called " rib shears . " A scrub nurse handed him a device like fowl shears with offset handles . With firm pressure of powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rib spreaders . " A bridgelike gadget was clamped in place ; with a few turns of the screw it spread the ribs six inches apart . The assistants cut deeper through the chest . " Lung retractors . " The heaving lungs were pushed aside . Many more blood vessels were tied off . Bailey slit the heart sac almost from top to bottom , took quick stitches in it , left long threads which were clamped to the rib spreaders to hold the sac open . <P> At last the heart lay bare , red and purple with a greyish cast , glistening under the strong lights , squirming and rippling with life-a life Dr. Bailey and his team were fighting to save .
