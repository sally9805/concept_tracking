With homosexuality in Britain a matter of government concern and wide-open public discussion ( TIME , Dec. 16 ) . the once-taboo subject got a whirl in last week 's British Medical Journal . First difficulty , reported a three-man research team which had worked at Bristol Mental Hospitals , is to find out just what a homosexual is . So the Bristol psychiatrists went to nearby prisons , got 64 volunteer subjects , aged 20 to 61 , doing time for unnatural acts . The researchers exploded a lot of widespread fallacies : CJ Even among prison cases , homosexuality is no all-or-nothing quality . Only nine of the 64 were 100% homosexual ; all the rest were " mixed " cases with varying degrees of heterosexuality . While half definitely preferred the company of other males , 18 preferred that of women ( 13 were indifferent ) . Several would have been willing to marry for the sake of having children , but could not bear the thought of heterosexual intercourse. &lt;f With only four exceptions , the subjects were no different physically from men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have overdeveloped breasts , their pubic hair grew in the normal male pattern . <P> CJ There was no consistent predisposing factor ( such as head injury ) as some investigators have alleged . Alcohol was not important in their own lives , but had been in many cases for their fathers , often to the point of breaking up the home . CJ The difference between the homosexuals ' ratio of male-female hormone output and that of normal men used for comparison was negligible . <P> One disturbing finding : nine of the 64 had been scoutmasters and had had relations writh boys in their troops . " This suggests , " say the three psychiatrists guardedly , " either that scouting strongly activates latent homosexuality or that homosexuals . . . join the scouting movement because of the . . . opportunities .
