One of nature 's most baffling phenomena has been the extraordinary power of female moths to attract mates over long distances . In one experiment , a female emperor in a gauze cage collected 127 males of her species in seven hours ; male Chinese silkworm moths have been known to home in on intended mates from as far away as seven miles . Since a female under a bell jar will stir nothing in males on the outside only inches away , biologists have concluded that the secret of her charm must be an odor-from a substance so strong that a few molecules send males fluttering into the wind , and so selective that only males of her own species are attracted . <P> In a massive experiment conducted by Adolf Butenandt , 56 , who was co-winner of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ( for isolating the male sex hormone , androsterone ) , a research team at Munich 's Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry imported 1,000,000 silkworm cocoons from Italy and Japan , opened them up with razor blades , separated the pupae of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of one researcher , was " a mass slaughter , and not for the fainthearted . " Each tiny pupa was disemboweled , the scent glands carefully cut out . Male moths served as lab assistants : when they were placed near fractions into which the gland material had been divided , their fluttering wings told the scientists which parts contained the magic substance . <P> Finally isolated , it turned out to be a yellowish , fatty substance with a subtle , not unpleasant odor of leather . Study of its chemical structure revealed a relatively simple formula : C10H30O- technically an alcohol . The million cocoons had yielded only a barely visible 1.6 mg . <P> Most moths are not pests in themselves , but their larvae are-e.g. , the larvae of the gypsy moth destroy thousands of trees every year . Butenandt 's discovery opens the way to a new attack on such pests . Insecticides kill off useful insects along with the pests . But if the sex attractant for one particular species can be isolated and synthesized , its males can be attracted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The males will come flocking , " said a Munich researcher . " Females , of course , will continue to lay their eggs , but they will be unfertilized . The main advantage over DDT is that no resistant strains are likely to emerge . Whoever heard of a male animal becoming immune to sex ? "
