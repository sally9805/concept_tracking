Black Orpheus ( Dispatfilm-Gemma ; Lopert ) is perhaps the most impressive can of film so far cast up on U.S. shores by the New Wave ( La Nouvelle Vague ) of creation that has swept across the French movie industry . It is an amazing creation . The picture was made by Marcel Camus , * a 47-year-old assistant to some of France 's top directors . In 1957 he found an adaptation of the Orpheus legend by a Brazilian poet and playwright named Vinicius de Moraes ( TIME , Nov. 19 , 1956 ) , and for the hell of it he used the wildly poetic mountains around Rio de Janeiro , where thousands of Negroes live in conditions of infernal poverty among scenes of paradisal beauty . <P> In Brazil , Director Camus soon ran out of money . He slept on the beach to save hotel bills , lived from meal to meal , worked from reel to reel . Down to his last $17 , he was rescued by Brazil 's President Juscelino Kubitschek , who told the army to get him some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome Brazilian futebol player named Breno Mello , for his Eurydice an unknown dancer from Pittsburgh with serenely lovely looks and a name that nobody could possibly forget : Marpessa Dawn . " The poverty , " says Camus , " was not such a bad thing in the long run . I spent so much time trailing around on foot , just looking , that in the end I had a deep awareness of Brazil . With money , I would never have made the same film . Everything would have been done too quickly . " <P> Shown in France , the picture delighted the public , astonished the critics , won the 1959 Grand Prix at Cannes . Part of its appeal , no doubt , derives from the timeless charm of the old legend itself , which Scenarist Jacques Viot has adapted simply and gracefully . Orpheus is a Rio streetcar conductor ; Eurydice is a village girl who comes to the big city to visit her cousin and to escape from a sinister stranger who wants to kill her . They fall in love and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets . There her enemy , who is Death , seeks her out and carries her away . Orpheus , heartbroken , goes looking for his lost love at the Bureau of Missing Persons , then at a diabolic rite where spirit-rappers summon up her ghost . In the end , he joins her in death .
