For the members of the congregation who jammed the Sunday service at Atlanta 's All Saints ' Episcopal Church this week , the news came as a blow . In six years , they had come to have a warm affection for their 44-year-old rector , and now , he announced , he was about to leave them . Next June the Rev. Matthew Madison Warren will be heading north to train for an important job-the rectorship of St. Paul 's School for boys in Concord , N.H. <P> Matthew Warren will not officially take over at St. Paul 's until 1954 , when Rector Henry C. Kittredge retires . But for the next two years he wants to study , first at Columbia and then in Concord , where he will learn his job at first hand . As rector of hockey-playing , uppercrusty Episcopal St. Paul 's , he will become headmaster of one of the nation 's top prep schools , and both he and his trustees want him to have plenty of time to get ready . <P> Matthew Warren 's own education was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Paul 's . The son of a small-town banker in West Virginia , he went to the local high school and West Virginia University , and worked during the summer in a coal mine . By the time he graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary , he had decided that he wanted to be both teacher and minister in one . " When I left Virginia , " says he , " I had a suitcase full of books on the teaching of religion and how it was learned . " What he learned from those books , he carried wherever he went-from Macon , Ga . to St. Louis , where he headed the Episcopal education center , and finally to Atlanta . <P> There , parishioners found him a kindly , angular six-footer , who could play both Bach and boogie-woogie on the piano , and liked to give big coffee parties after church . He was also a man who could inspire faith whether in or out of the pulpit . Every Sunday before service , adults and children would flock to his classes at the church 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more . <P> To Matthew Warren , religion and education have always been one . " Education , " says he , " is organic to life , and not just pasted on life like a shin plaster . " As far as he is concerned , there will be no shin plasters at St. Paul 's . " A church school should be more than a school . I should like my contribution to be in the field of being a good pastor for the boys , teaching them to come to grips with their lives on the highest possible level . But I am not going to St. Paul 's with any high-flown theories . It 's been in the education business for 95 years and doing very handsomely . I expect to learn . "
