txt Britain is convinced that the Soviet Union 's primary objective in the forthcoming round of East-West negotiations will be to maintain the division of Europe between East and I West . To attain this objective , the British believe , the Soviet Union will try to obtain what would amount to the neutralization of West Berlin . Diplomats here say the Soviet Union regards West Berlin as a Western outpost in Communist territory . In the Soviet view , it is said , the present arrangements under which West Berlin is occupied by the Western powers and the propaganda emanating from it are psychologically upsetting for Communist Europe . The diplomats believe that for these reasons the Soviet Union would accept a new international status for Berlin that would guarantee the // freedom and economic viability of West Berliners . They . also are confident that , for somewhat the same reasons , the Soviet Union would agree to a zone of limitation and inspection of troops and arms that would include Berlin and the surrounding territory . The Western positions on these questions have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will be at the meetings of the Western foreign ministers that will precede the four-power foreign ministers ' conference . Western Unity Stressed The United States , Britain and France suggested in notes to Moscow today that this conference open May 11 . The wording was somewhat different , but officials here professed to see no particular significance in this . They stressed the unity of the Western approach . With regard to the negotiations , informed circles here see definite advantages for the West in obtaining a new international status for Berlin and a zone of limitation and inspection of arms and troops in Central Europe . They believe that a new arrangement , possibly with United Nations participation , would ' eliminate or minimize the Soviet ability to put periodic squeezes on the city and that it would ease tension between East and , West . They recognize that West Germany is suspicious of any move in that direction , but say the new status might in fact offer hope to West . Germany of some ' day achieving reunification . For one thing . they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit wider con tacts between the two Germanys and this would help progress toward eventual reunification . The same would be true if tension were eased through establishment of a zone of military limitation and inspection , it is believed . The view here is that the Soviet Union would agree to this I zone because it would lessen its fears of attack from the West . These fears are regarded as real ones . I Prime Minister Harold Macmillan 's visit to Moscow convinced him that the Soviet leaders , despite their cleverness , do not understand the workings of Western democracies . These leaders , it is said , accept as government  --  policy statements that are made by generals or others in the West who are simply expressing their own views . Reunification Held Remote The British do not expect any progress toward reunification of Germany at this time . They beIlieve that it could be achieved . only by war and that scarcely anyone in the West is ready to go to war to bring it about . Even in West Germany , it is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to go to war for reunification . The British also are convinced that the Soviet Union will not , insist on formal recognition of the East German regime ? something that is anathema to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany . They think the Soviet Union would accept Western agreement to a new status for Berlin as equivalent to de facto recognition of East Germany and be content with that . The fears reported to have been expressed by Dr. Adenauer that a zone of military limitation and inspection would halt the development of his army are considered unjustified . With ground forces substantially superior in numbers to those of the West in Europe , the Soviet Union could hardly object to the planned expansion of the West German Army , it is said . The Chancellor is also said to have expressed the fear that establishment of the zone would mean his forces would be permanently deprived of nuclear weapons . On this the British are less clear . But there seems to be a disposition here to believe that the Soviet Union would not balk at the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a guarantee that West Germany would not get intercontinental ballistic missiles .
