It might have been the Winter Garden in 1935 . The girls drifted languidly down an outsized ramp while the music came pumping out of the pit like an echo from a Ziegfeld revue . A couple whisked onstage to do a comic turn , punctuated with the oddly archaic slang of the hepcat : " Hey , baby ! Let 's have a ball ! " Occasion : the Manhattan opening of Japan 's all-girl Takarazuka Dance Theater , an amalgam of the Folies-Bergere , the Radio City Rockettes , and native Kabuki styles . <P> Founded four decades ago as a " musical bridge between East and West , " Takarazuka ( named after its home town in Japan ) presents thinly disguised Broadway and Paris turns , together with jazzed-up versions of Japanese fairy and folk tales , all held together in a sukiyaki-like mixture of muted native music and brassy show tunes . The 400 girls of the Takarazuka company ( their motto : " Be pure , be right , be beautiful " ) sing everything from high soprano to near baritone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the thousands to their frenzied teen-age following . <P> Last week 's 42-member visiting troupe , now at the Metropolitan Opera House in the middle of a three-month cross-country tour , avoided the more blatantly Westernized confections in the repertory , such as Broadway Cinderella , in which the chorus line appears in white top hats and tails . Instead they concentrated on a number of vaguely oriental-flavored exercises , whose paper-thin plots were bolstered with barbarically blazing sets and sumptuously encrusted costumes . Pastel-colored paper globes hung in grapelike clusters , spangled parasols twirled like colored tops , flowery kimonos fluttered beneath frozen comic masks . <P> Occasionally , as in the military exercise known as Bo Odori , in which sticks , sickles and wooden swords were flourished in ritualistic confusion , the dance had an authentic feel . But more often , Takarazuka 's " musical bridge " seemed a one-way street that fell 20 years short of its goal . After watching an animal turn called Shan Shan Uma , in which two dancers represented the front and hindquarters of a horse , the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttering to myself ' Shan Shan Uma on the Rillera . ' This helped some . "
