The President , coming up out of his cellar now that the MacArthur storm seemed to be blowing over , found another thunderhead on the horizon . The Sand Congress was away behind in its work , and since it is a Democratic Congress , he hesitated to call it " do-nothing . " Yet all the Administration 's complicated and vital price-control machinery was about to expire on June 30 , and Congress was dawdling and balking at its renewal . <P> To stir up Congress , Harry Truman decided to stir up the homefolks . Earnestly facing a battery of microphones and television cameras one night last week , he accused an old enemy , the National Association of Manufacturers , and unidentified " beef lobbyists " of trying to scuttle wage-price controls . Unless the people banded together to defeat these " special interests , " he warned , prices would go " through the roof , " the nation 's economy would be wrecked and Russia would " win the world to totalitarianism without firing a shot . " <P> Worst to Come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , " he said . " This makes some people think the worst is over . But ... the full force of inflationary pressure is still to come . Controls are absolutely necessary for at least the next two years , no matter what happens in Korea . " Congressmen had told him that " consumers were not making themselves heard . Well , I told them I represented the consumers . " <P> Then he waited for the avalanche of telegrams which usually follows such a speech , hoping-that they would stir Congress to action . By week 's end the telegrams began trickling in . Congress would take some stirring . The banking committees of both houses had held six weeks of hearings , heard more than a hundred witnesses , and had barely gotten down to writing a bill . They showed little sympathy for the President 's request for authority to stiffen rent controls and to tighten credit . Likeliest action : a last-minute 30-to-60-day extension of the present law . <P> The President had tried every which way to prod Congress . At least four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of congressional leaders to drop by Blair House in the evening for pep talks . The meetings all followed the same pattern . Guests arrived about 8 o'clock , were greeted cordially by the President , got a highball , and were drawn into a few hours ' discussion led by the President . Among the guests were such Administration stalwarts as Connecticut 's McMahon and Minnesota 's Humphrey , but there were also a few unpredictable Democrats ranging from Florida 's freshman Senator Smathers on the right to New York 's Congressman Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . on the left . <P> The President 's manner was relaxed and his talk unrehearsed , but always he upheld his Administration 's foreign policy , reviewed " successes " in Greece , Turkey , Berlin and Korea . He rehashed the MacArthur story , explained ruefully how he thought his differences with MacArthur had been patched up at Wake , was at his most emphatic when he declared his Administration had kept the U.S. out of war for the time being . He ended by asking his guests to support his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions at him , he said : You can give me hell , if you want to-I'm. used to getting hell .
