Homespun , poker-playing Frank Chambless Rand , who expanded a horse &; buggy shoe-selling route into the biggest U.S. shoe company , had a horror of nepotism . " I 've learned in my lifetime , " he liked to say , " that friendship is no basis for business , but business is an excellent basis for lasting friendship . " Thus when Frank Rand died at 73 last December , his job as board chairman of St. Louis ' International Shoe Co. was filled by no relative but by President Byron A. Gray , a former clerk . <P> Last week , nobody cried " nepotism " when Edgar Eugene Rand , 44 , the founder 's eldest son , moved up to the company 's presidency . Like his father , husky Ed Rand was a poker-playing , hardheaded businessman who had never been coddled . He was sent to public school , later prepped at the Webb School in Bell Buckle , Tenn. , where the boys took their baths in wash-tubs , got their water from a well . <P> In 1927 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in his father 's factory sorting leather ; two years later he became a leather buyer . After a wartime hitch with OPA , WPB and SPAB , where he had charge of selling millions of surplus Army shoes , Rand went back to International as boss of production , merchandising and distribution , was made a vice president in 1947 . The company he went back to had mushroomed from one plant in 1898 to 55 factories , eight tanneries , a rubber plant and a cotton mill , with 35,000 employees and 12,000 stockholders . International Shoe , which makes 10% of all U.S. shoes ( 48 million pairs last year ) , has never been in the red . Last year it rang up sales of $190 million , profits of $7.6 million . <P> Like his father , Ed Rand believes that the company 's success is due to its flexibility of operation and concentration on sales to independent jobbers and retailers . Though fully half the U.S. shoe industry has set up its own retail outlets , Ed Rand still intends to rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roebuck and J. C. Penney . But he hopes to make some changes . Where his father carefully avoided any razzle-dazzle , Ed Rand hopes to step up sales with a louder blast on his advertising horn .
