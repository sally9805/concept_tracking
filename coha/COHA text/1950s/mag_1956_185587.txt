The name Murray Chotiner , dropped into the Senate investigation of military uniform procurement frauds a fortnight ago , set journalistic and political antennas twanging all over Washington . Reason : in the political context of 1956 , the name Chotiner goes with the name Nixon . <P> A professional political manager , Lawyer Chotiner has been an important figure in California G.O.P. politics for 15 years . In 1942 he was field director in the first campaign for governor waged by Earl Warren , now Chief Justice of the United States . In 1946 and 1952 he was a campaign manager for Bill Knowland , now Senate minority leader . He helped in the Nixon campaigns for Congress in 1946 and 1948 , and managed Nixon 's campaign for the Senate in 1950 . In the vice-presidential campaign of 1952 , Chotiner helped guide Nixon through the hectic days of the Nixon fund uproar , and after the election was generally recognized-much to the irritation of some Southern California Republican bigwigs-as Nixon 's closest home state contact . <P> <P> " Situations . " What interested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name appeared in the records of one Herman Kravitz , a uniform maker from New Jersey , who had been convicted of misappropriating Government material and blacklisted as a Government contractor . What had Chotiner done to earn the $5,000 fee that Kravitz ' accountant had recorded ? To find out , the subcommittee called Chotiner to testify in private , and then subpoenaed him for a public hearing . <P> The story began , Chotiner testified , when Kravitz telephoned him in Los Angeles , saying that he was looking " for a good lawyer , and that I had been recommended to him . " Kravitz said that he wanted to move his business to Los Angeles , and later asked Chotiner to make two trips East to discuss the proposed relocation and other " situations . " At that time Kravitz was awaiting trial for misappropriating Government property and making a false statement in connection with the case . Chotiner eventually discussed the charges with an attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice , and they reached a prosecution-defense agreement : Kravitz ' appeal from a guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. dropped the false statement charge . Kravitz ' sentence : a fine of $5,000 . Choti-ner 's total fee : $6,000 . <P> Beyond the Kravitz case , Committee Counsel Robert Kennedy ( brother of Massachusetts ' Democratic Senator John Kennedy ) began to throw some other names at Murray Chotiner . It developed that the California lawyer had represented Marco Regnelli , a notorious New Jersey hoodlum , who was trying ( unsuccessfully , it turned out ) to set aside a U.S. order of deportation . Also involved in Chotiner 's dealings with Kravitz and Regnelli , in a way not entirely clear , was a man named W. A. Parzow , a convicted jury tamperer from Miami and Atlantic City , who seemed to have been instrumental in getting Chotiner and his troubled clients together . Called to the stand to tell his . own story , Parzow hid behind the Fifth Amendment , guzzled one glass of water after another , complained that he was a sick man and wailed : " All I want to do is drink a lot of water to flush out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
