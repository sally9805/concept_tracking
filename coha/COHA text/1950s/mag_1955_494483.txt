? ow that Eisenhower 's illness has given us an open field for Presidential candidates , it is . a good time to ask what constitutes " political appeal " in a pub ? lic figure . And who has it ? an Adlai , or an Ave , a Dick , or . a Goodie , or a Torn ? What ? ever it may be , it is this power of ap ? peal that makes a good candidate . To some extent it is possible to separate the man as candidate from the man as incumbent . What helps a poli ? tician to get elected is not necessarily identical with what enables him to hold on to his office once he gets it . One remembers that when the exceedingly personable Jimmy Walker was put up to run on the Democratic ticket for mayor of New York City , the question was asked , " Will he make a good mayor ? " and this question had its sufficient answer with , " No , but what a candidate ! " The unhappy conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for office does not also have some talents for administration , he may bring discredit upon himself and disgrace upon his party . But this does not alter the fact that political appeal is-not perfectly correlated with professional com ? petence . What I mean to offer here is a formula for the generic , not the specific , analysis of political appeal , in order that we may discriminate three kinds of candidates : the Aver ? age Man , the Aristocrat and the Leader . The Average Man has his strength in his kinship with the people , and in his lack of any distinctive qualities . The Aristocrat has his power in , superior gifts of character , of intellect and of intuition . The Leader is one who combines the Average Man and the Aristocrat : who is really one of the people in a way that they can acknowledge , and yet surpasses them in ways essential to his function . The Average Man has his political appeal in what are called normal times . But such times may be normal only in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Average Man in the White House covers the period from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt . It is inter ? esting that almost all of these mediocre Presidents , whose names we can scarcely remember today , were Republi ? cans . The Average Man suited the political occasion because the real brains and genius of the country at that time were turned into industrial and financial concerns . It needs to be said also that normalcy exists mainly as a public state of mind . The American people will elect a normal man to the Presidency because they are resolved to believe in normalcy . The greatest Avatar of the Aver ? age was Calvin Coolidge . Yet we know now that when he presided over our national destinies , the times ' were anything but normal . However , as William Allen White put it , even while our private and public morality looked toward Babylon , we wished to believe that we were still loyal to the Puritan ideals of thrift , integrity , hard work and plain living . Shrewd and silent and com ? placent Cal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When in 1936 the Republican Party set up a reincar ? nation of the Coolidge archetype in Alfred M. Landon , it misjudged the times . In the mid-thirties we were learning to gee a thrill out of government by crisis . There are some indications that now we are about fed up with crisis , and would like to return to , normalcy . If . such is the present mood of the American people , the Republican Party could not possibly put forward a better candidate than Governor Goodwin Knight of California . . Knight is one of the purest of pure politicians in the game today . Like Harry Truman , he admits it and is proud of it . When Knight was still struggling toward the Governor 's post , he set himself off from Governor War ? ren by playing along with conserva ? tives and reactionaries . Once he got in ? to office , he reversed his line , adopted the liberal policies of his predecessor , and suddenly became the ardent friend of organized labor . He has not yet shown an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's great institutions of higher education . Indeed there are few men in public office so utterly without intellectual distinction as Goodwin Knight . But it would be a grave error , on that account , to under ? estimate his power of political appeal . His endowments . in this respect are enormous . He is a somewhat more canny Mortimer Snerd who can win a popularity contest against any elegant and glib-tongued Charlie McCarthy by the sheer appeal of his ingenuous and engaging per ? sonality . When he overwhelmed his Democratic- oppo ? nent , for Governor ' a year ago , he demonstrated the triumph of affability over intelligence . The fact that he does n't always talk sense is irrelevant ; he never fails to warm the cockles of the heart . Indeed , Goodie is the Average Man for our times , with an ebullient good humor , an unaffected delight in folks , a power of posi ? tive thinking , and a zest for confident living , that infectall who come near him with their contagion . He is mediocre to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chances for the Presidency are always very low . He may make it as Senator , or as Governor , or even as a distin ? guished member of the Cabinet . But it MacArthur is unlikely that he will ever be elected to the highest office in the land . What he lacks , quite simply , is the common touch . One thinks here of some men of very great abilities ? the late Senator Robert Taft , Dean Acheson , John Foster Dulles , Charles Evans Hughes and perhaps Tom Dewey . All of these men are intellectuals in politics . They bring to their task a discipline of mind , a habit of thorough ? ness , an efficiency in action , which set them away above their colleagues . When they do win a large public fol ? lowing , it will be through a sheer brilliance of achieve ? ment , like that of Hughes or Dewey , which may ' re ? concile the public to the lack of the common touch in the candidate . There is always the bare possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we are willing to follow , not just a Leader who is still one of us , but a sort of demi-god , whose quality is far above our own , but in whose idealism and competence we have learned to trust . Nevertheless , there will be too many plain folk who say of this demi-god , what they would never say of Goodie Knight , " he leaves me cold ! " ? When an Eisenhower displaces a MacArthur as candidate , it is because there is too much of the pure Aristo ? crat in a MacArthur . We are glad to vote for a Leader whom we can call Ike while still retaining our respect for him . It is scarcely possible to vote for a man whom we would not think of calling Mac without fear of giving him personal offense . When a Harry Truman finally licks a Tom Dewey , it is the triumph of the Average Man over the Aristocrat . Doubtless many factors entered into the shifts in voting and the abstentions from voting in the campaign of 1948 .. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one felt increasingly the humility and the courage of the Average Man and the arrogance and complacency of the Aristocrat . It is a peculiar weakness of the Aristocrat , when he is an intellectual , that he is apt to be an individualist who has never mastered the important arts of political co ? operation and team-work . This is illustrated in the two Douglases ? the Senator and-the Justice ? as well as in a Wayne Morse , or a Henry Agard Wallace . Off-hand each of these men would seem to meet the requirements of the Leader : the natural kinship with the plain people of the country , plus the superior endowments of mind which fit them for pre-eminence . But neither a Douglas , nor a Morse , nor a Wallace , knows how to call forth the loyalty and devotion of ' his colleagues in a consistent pattern of co-operation . Such an Aristocrat is a Lone Wolf , hot a Leader of the . Pack . While I am not too sure about it , I have a notion that Senator Kefauver belongs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned , only , whether Kefauver has the intellectual endowmentS of the other three men . One has a nervous feeling that this bright young man does n't know as much about statesmanship as he thinks he does ; that his inability to elicit sup ? port from his colleagues in Congress is due , more than to envy and resent- Douglas ment , to a basic ineptitude in the higher arts of govern ? ment . If it be granted that he is a skilled showman , then his appeal must be to the infants and the atavists , the appeal of a Disneyfied Davy Crockett who will restore us to the grand simplicities of courage and moral purity in politics . There is here something which the Aristo ? crat-As-Intellectual too easily brings into public affairs ? something callow and unseasoned , a radical immatur ? ity , a naivet ? that we can scarcely call wholesome . Per ? haps all that it amounts to is a lack of good judgment . When we turn our attention from the Aristocrat to the Leader , we may remark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? make a very similar appeal to the American public . Each of them is unmis ? takably a man . of the people . The Average Man shines through Harry 's whole career and personality . With Ike it is reflected not just in his humble beginnings but in the ineradicable democracy of disposition which has radiated from the man even when he was loaded with the highest honors . What lifted Truman above the merely Average Man into the ranks of Leader was his superlative courage : the courage that showed itself so decisively against Communist aggression in Greece , in Berlin and in Korea ; the courage , way beyond that of any mere politician , which made him bold to split his party over the civil-rights issue , and to stand adamant for civil liberties throughout his Presidency . What lifts Eisenhower above the mere-ly average is his superlative integrity of character . General Eisenhower , like General Washington , should remind us that the aristocratic element in the Leader of a democracy is a quality of character rather than a quality of intellect . The radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eisenhower 's talents in 1952 lay at just this point . They were looking for some genius of mind , which they did not find in Ike and which they did find in Adlai . General Eisenhower has no more brilliance of in ? tellect than did George Washington . But each of these men had , or has , something which the intellectuals com ? peting with them may lack ? the ability to lead others . I think I began to learn this lesson some years ago when I had to appear on the program of a Los Angeles breakfast club along with the Governor of the state , a college glee club , and other assorted items of entertain ? ment . It was not just vanity , I believe , when I compared my 10-minute discourse with Governor Warren 's 20-minute speech , and wondered how he could say such a great deal less in such a great deal more time . But it was the characteristic error of the intellectual that I should have judged Warren 's merits as a statesman by the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could talk only in terms of the trite would be cap ? able of acting only on the level of the commonplace . It took me a little time to learn . Chief Justice Warren is not an aristo ? crat of the intellect . He is an aristocrat of character . He is a good politician , a good boss of his own party , a good administrator , a good family man , a good constitutional lawyer , a good de fender of human rights and liberties , a good embodi ? ment of the best ideals of democracy in public office ? to the point where the sum total of so many positive good ? ness adds up to a superlative degree of excellence . As a candidate for public office he may be a trifle stolid ; as an incumbent of public office he is unquestionably solid . It is a curious fact that the so-called party of the com ? mon people , the Democratic Party , has recently offered ? us Leaders in whom the Aristocrat was more pronounced than the Average Man . Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . He was also above the average in his superb courage and in his humanitarian impulses . These were virtues that he learned perhaps when he passed through a terrible ill nesses , in the shadow of which he always lived . But these were also the qualities that gave him a natural kinship with the common man , and with a whole nation that had to fight its way up from depression and through war . The Democratic Party has another Aristocrat for can didate in Adlai Stevenson . This one is an Aristocrat by intellect as well as by birth and breeding and manner . His spiritual prototype is Woodrow Wilson . Both men share in the Calvinist heritage of intellectual discipline and of austere moral idealism . But with Stevenson the Unitarian , or left-wing Calvinist ? we knock out the Presbyterian austerity and substitute personal gracious ness and charm . This is Wilson with a wisecrack . Can Stevenson make it ? Rephrase the question : Is there in this Aristocrat enough of the Average Man to give the people a real sense of kinship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If he is to be such a Leader , he will have to rid himself of the air of an heroic Hamlet with which he first came on the national scene . He will have to go after the nomination , unhampered by the Gethsemane complex with which he acquiesced in it before ; and he will have to fight his , campaign , unclouded by the Golgotha complex ' which overshadowed it in - 1952 . He will also have to come down a bit from that very high plane where he likes to commune with the minds of men , and learn that human beings arc creatures of faith and hope and love as well as of reason , and that it is as Stevenson necessary to touch their hearts as to titillate their intel ? lects . It is true that , once this Hamlet makes up his mind to it , he can put on a splendid exhibition of fighting guts . And when courage is linked with integrity of character and proved professional competence , it is a big element in political appeal . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon , another tough fighting man , then Ste ? venson will have the advantage of hay ? ing already displayed an additional type of courage , the courage to he one 's self . Coming as he did after Harry Truman , the Leader with a pre ? ponderance of the Average Man , it was not so easy to present himself to the public as the Leader with a preponderance of the Aristocrat . That Stevenson had this courage to be himself is all in his favOr With the electorate . - Richard Nixon up to this point has been too busy as the master politician and as the faithful servant of his boss in the White House to give us a real insight into his true self . In disagreement with a good many critics I am disposed to think that , when that self is fully re ? vealed , we shall be surprised at its statesmanlike breadth and maturity . But what many of us will not like will be the very fact of the surprise . We shall be wondering where Nixon kept that self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable self which is so suddenly put on view may not as readily be tucked out of sight when the display of it is less appropriate . If Stevenson has to come up against , a Goodwin Knight , then the Aristocrat may well fall before the Average Man . But if Stevenson runs against a Richard Nixon , then , of two men who pretend to be genuine Leaders , the public is apt to prefer the unmistakable statesman to the patent politician , prefer the man who sticks to his principles on principle to the man who exercises his principles only out of motives of expediency.
