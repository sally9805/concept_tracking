" It is impossible to answer for the madmen of the imperialist world , " said Nikita Khrushchev in a speech broadcast by Moscow radio last week . " But at the present time it seems to me there is no cloud from which thunder might crash out . " <P> Barely 72 hours later , the Communist military commander for the Fukien district of South China , who may not be a madman but hardly qualifies as a preserver of the peace , sent crashing out an entirely different message , addressed to the Nationalist Chinese garrison entrenched on Quemoy Island : " No military works can avoid complete destruction under the assault of our modern army and air force . . . The landing on Quemoy is imminent . . . Surrender ! " <P> Peking 's ultimatum was backed up by the thunder of the heaviest sustained artillery barrage the world has seen since the Korean war . Day after day . Red Chinese batteries rained 152-mm. and 122-mm. shells on Quemoy and the smaller surrounding islands of Little Quemoy , Hutzuyn , Tatan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 122,000 rounds estimated by Nationalist headquarters in Taipei . Nationalists reported about 700 civilian and military casualties , killed and wounded . <P> From a strategic point of view , the targets that Red China 's gunners worked over were not worth anything like the ammunition expended . Even if all of them fell into Red hands , the Nationalist bastion of Formosa , about 120 miles to the east , would still be screened by the Pescadores Islands ( see map ) . But the Nationalist garrisons of the offshore islands mock Mao Tse-tung on his very doorstep . ( Tatan and Erhtan , with a combined area of 143 acres , lie smack in the mouth of Amoy harbor only 2 miles from shore . ) Moreover , since Formosa itself was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945 and has a strong separatist tradition , the islands of the Quemoy complex-together with Matsu and a handful of other islets to the north-constitute the only indisputably Chinese soil remaining in Nationalist hands . To hold these largely symbolic specks Chiang Kai-shek has crammed them with 95,000 troops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duels , the inconclusive sea skirmishes and occasional dogfights between MIGs and Sabre jets , the U.S. sought to decide how serious were Communist intentions in Formosa Strait and concluded that even a probing action required an unmistakable response . The dispatch to Formosan waters of the U.S. carrier Essex-which in mid-July was helping to land marines in Lebanon-and the dispatch from Pearl Harbor of the big Midway the next day were ordered to make a show of force and to dramatize U.S. concern . As an added evidence of U.S. activity , Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker turned up in Taipei to confer with Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , his aides , and top U.S. brass in the area .
