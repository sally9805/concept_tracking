The Condemned Librarian A Story by JESSAMYN WEST Drawings by Mary M. Lohrnann I 40 UI SE M cKA V , M.D. , the librarian at Beaumont High School , sent me another card today . It was on the wickerwork table , where Mother puts my snack , when I got home from teaching . This afternoon the snack was orange juice and graham crackers , the orange juice in a plain glass so that the deepness , the thickness of the color was almost like a flame inside a hurricane lamp . The graham crackers were on a blue willowware plate and it just so happened that Dr. McKay 's card was Van Gogh 's " Sunflowers . " It was a perfect still life , the colors increasing in intensity through the pale sand of the wickerwork table to the great  --  bong ( I want to say ) for I swear I could hear it , of Van Gogh 's flaming sunflowers . I looked at the picture Mother had composed for me ( I do n't doubt ) for some time before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four cards a year ? not at any particular season , as Christmas , Easter , or the like . Her sentiments are not suited to such festivals . Usually her message is only a line or two ? " Why did you do it : " or , . " Condemned , condemned , condemned . " Something very dramatic and always on a post card so that the world at large can read it if it chooses . Mother shows her perfect tact by saying nothing if she does read . Perhaps she does n't ; though a single sentence in a big masculine hand is hard to miss . Except for her choice of the Van Gogh print , which showed her malice , Dr. McKay 's message this afternoon was very mild  --  for her . " I am still here , which will no doubt make you happy . " Apart from the fact that any one interested in the welfare of human beings generally would want her there ( or at least not practicing in a hospital ) it does make me happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow reassured , standing there in the schoolyard with the cold north wind blowing the dust in my face , to think that over there on the other side of the mountains Louise McKay was ending her day , too . Take away the mountains and fields and we might be gazing into each other 's eyes . I sat down in my perfect little room with the juice my mother had squeezed  --  we hate substitutes  --  and looked at the card and remembered when I had first seen that marching handwriting ? everything else about her has changed , but not that . I saw it first on the card she gave me telling me of my next date with her . From the moment I arrived at Oakland State I started hearing about Dr. Louise McKay . She was a real campus heroine though for no real reason . Except that at a teachers ' college , with no football heroes , no faculty members with off-campus reputations , the craving for superiority must satisfy itself on the material at hand , however skimpy . And for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oakland from the lost little towns of mountain and desert I suppose it was easy to think of Dr. McKay as heroic or fascinating or accomplished . I was different , though . I was neither middle-aged nor a kid . I was twenty-six years old and I had come to Oakland expecting something . I had had choices . I had made sacrifices to get there , sacrifices for which no " heroic " lady doctor however " fascinating , " " well dressed " ( I ca n't remember all the phrases used about her now ) could be a substitute . I had a very difficult time deciding to go to Oakland State . I had taught at Liberty School for six years and I loved that place . It was " beautiful for situation " as the Bible says , located ten miles out of town in the rolling semi-dry upland country where the crop was grain , not apricots and peaches . It was a one-room school and I was its only teacher . It stood in the midst of this sea of barley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big green sea of ripening grain rolled and tossed about us  --  all but crested and broke  --  all but  --  though never quite . In a way , this was irritating . For half the year at Liberty there were no barley waves to watch , only the close-cut stubble of reaped fields and the enormous up-thrust of the San Jacinto mountains beyond . Color was my delight then . I used to sit out in the schoolyard at noon or recess and paint . A former teacher had discarded an old sleigh-hack sofa , had it put out in the yard halfway between the school and the woodshed . It stood amidst the volunteer oats and mustard like a larger growth . It seemed planted in earth . In the fall when Santa Anna 's blew , tumbleweeds piled up about it . I do n't know how long it had been there when I arrived but it had taken very well to its life in the fields ; its legs balanced , its springs stayed inside the upholstery , and the upholstery itself still kept some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't playing ball with the kids  --  like a hunter , hidden in a game blind , only my gamc was n't lions and tigers , it was the whole world , so to speak : the mountains , the grain fields , the kids , the schoolhouse itself . I sat there and painted . Oh not well , I 've never said that , ever . Never claimed that for a minute . And it 's easy to impress children and country people who think its uncanny if you can draw an apple which looks like an apple . And I could do much more than that . I could make mountains that looked like mountains , children who looked like children . How that impressed the parents ! So I had gotten in the habit of being praised , though from no one who counted , no one who knew . I had been sensibly brought up by my mother , taught to evaluate these plaudits rightly . I understood that my schoolyard talent did n't make me a Bonheur or Cassatt . Even so there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolteaching was just a way of making money , of helping my mother who was a widow . So , because of the time I had for painting and because of the gifts Liberty School had for my eyes , I had six happy years . I sat like a queen on that sofa in the grass while the meadowlarks sang and the butcher birds first caught their lunches , then impaled their slippers , still kicking , on the barbed wire fence . I did n't paint all the time , of course . Kids learned to read there . At the end of the sixth year there was only one eighth grader who could heat me in mental arithmetic . I was the acknowledged champion at Skin the Cat and could play adequately any position on the softball team . There was not much left to learn at Liberty , and I began , I do n't know how , to feel that learning , not teaching , was my business . In the middle of my sixth year I had to put a tarpaulin over the sofa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that I had to prop it on a piece of stove wood . That spring I noticed for the first time that the babies of six I had taught my first year were developing Adam 's apples  --  or busts . Girls who had been thirteen and fourteen my first year came back to visit Liberty School , married and with babies in their arms . " You have n't changed , " they would tell me . " Ohiit 's a real anchor to find you here , just the same . " Their husbands who were often boys my own age , twenty-four or twenty-five , treated me like an older woman . I might have been their mother , or mother-in-law . 1 was the woman who had taught their wives . I do n't think 1 looked so much old then as ageless . I 've taken out some of the snaps of that year , pictures taken at school . My face , in a way , looks as young as my pupils ' ; in other ways as old as Mt . Tahquitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence of a face in a coffin  --  or a cradle . At Thanksgiving time I was to be out of school three days before the holiday so that I could have a minor operation . When I left school on Friday , Mary Elizabeth Ross , one of my fourth graders , clasped me fondly and said , " May I be the first to hold your baby when you get back from the hospital ? " She would n't believe it when I told her I was going to the hospital because I was sick , not to get a baby , and she cried when I came back to school empty armed . That I noticed these things showed my restlessness . It might have passed , I might have settled in to a lifetime on that island except that at Christmas I hung some of my paintings with my pupils ' pictures at the annual Teachers ' Institute exhibit . They caused a stir and I began foolishly to dream of painting full time , of going to a big city , Los Angeles or San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't mention the idea to anyone , scarcely to myself . When any one else suggested such a thing to me , I pooh-poohed it . " Mc paint ? Do n't be funny . " But I dreamed of it ; the less I said the more I dreamed ; and the more I dreamed the less possible talking became . I did n't paint much that winter , but I moved through those months with the feel of a paint brush in my hand . I could feel , way up in my arm the strokes I would need to make to put Tahquitz , dead white against the green winter sky on canvas , put it there so people could see how it really floated , that great peak , was hung aloft there like a giantship against the sky . But I did n't say a word to any one about my plans , not even to the School Board when I handed in my resignation at Easter . I had n't lost my head entirely . I told them I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thought education , of course . The minute I had resigned I was filled with fear . I sat on my three-legged sofa amidst the waves of grain that never crested and shivered until school was out . I had undoubtedly been a fool : not only was I without serious talent , I was without money ; and where would I find anything as good as what I had ? Everything began to say stay . I would enter my room at night ( the one in which I now write ) which my mother kept so exquisitely , books ranged according to size and color , the white bedspread at once taut and velvety , the blue iris in a fan-shaped arc in a brown bowl  --  and I was a part of that composition . If I walked out , the composition collapsed . And outside , 1 too was a Fragment . I would stand there asking myself , . " Where will you find anything better ? " There was never any answer . I COULD only find something different , and possibly worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady Sherwood Anderson , locking the factory door behind me and walking down the tracks toward freedom and self-expression . I could dream that dream but I was afraid to act it . I would stand in my perfectly neat bedroom and frighten myself with pictures of my next room , far away , sordid , with strangers on each side . Fear was in my chest . like a stone , that whole spring . I had no talent , I was gambling everything on an egotistical attention-seeking whim . It was perfectly natural to have done so  --  my misery finally drove use to talking with my mother . It was perfectly natural she assured me to want a change of scene and occupation . Who did n't occasionally ? But why run away to big cities and studios ? Why would n't the perfectly natural , perfectly logical thing ( since I 'd already resigned ) be to go to Oakland State and study for my Secondary Credential ? The minute I , or Mother , I do n't remember which of us , thought of this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would get away , go to a real city , be surrounded with people devoted to learning , but not risk everything . I heard about Dr. Louise McKay from the minute I arrived on the . campus . She was as I 've said a kind of college heroine , though it was hard to understand why . What had she done that was so remarkable ? She had been a high school librarian , and had become a doctor . What 's so extraordinary about that ? The girls , and by that I mean the women students ? for many of them were teachers themselves , well along in their thirties and forties , or even fifties  --  the girls always spoke about Louise McKay 's change of profession as if it were a Lazarus-like feat ; as if she had practically risen from the dead . People arc always so romantic about doctors , and it 's understandable , I suppose , dealing as they do with life and death . But Louise McKay ! The girls talked about her as if what she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place they emphasized her age . Forty-two ! To me at twenty-six that did n't of course seem young . Still , it was silly to go on about her as if she were a Grandma Moses of medicine  --  and as if medicine itself were not , quite simply , nothing more than doctoring people ; a saying , " This ails you , " and , " I think this pill will help you . " They spoke of doctoring as if it were as hazardous as piloting a jet plane . And they spoke of Louise McKay 's size , " That tiny , tiny thing , " as if she 'd been a six-year-old , praising her for her age and her youth at one and the same time . Her size , they said , made it seem as if the child-examiningdoll game were reversed ; as if doll took out stethoscope and examined child ; she was that tiny and dainty , they said , that long-lashed and pink-checked . They exclaimed over her clothes , too . They were delightful in themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her profession and her person . She was a scientist and might have been expected to wear something manly and practical  --  or something dowdy . She did neither . They 'd all been to her for their physical examinations  --  somehow I 'd never been scheduled for that  --  and could give a complete inventory of her chic wardrobe . I myself saw her only once before I called on her professionally in December . I did n't see many people , as a matter of fact , at Oakland State , in any capacity , except professional . T RUE , I was studying . Not that the work was difficult  --  or interesting either . " History of Education , " " Principles of Secondary Education , " " Classroom Management , " " Curriculum Development . " But the books were better than the people . Had I lived out there on mythree-legged sofa with children and nature too long ? Or was there something really wrong with the people in teachers ' colleges ? Anyway , I had no friends and the nearer I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I wanted something  --  miserably , achingly , wretchedly I wanted something . Whether or not this longing , this sense of something lost , had anything to do with the illness that came upon me toward the end of December I do n't know , I attributed this illness at first to the raw damp bay weather after my lifetime in the warmth and dryness of the inland foothills ; I thought that my lack of routine , after days of orderly teaching , might be responsible , and , finally , after I had adopted a routine and had stayed indoors out of the mists and fogs and the discomfort . persisted I told myself that everyone as he grew older lost some of his early exuberant health . I was no longer in my first youth and this , " when my health began to fail " ? I thought of it in that way rather than as having any specific ailment  --  accounted for my miseries . I had always been impatient with the shufflings and snufflings , the caution on stairs and at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better if they tried . Now I began to understand that they could n't do better and that they probably were trying . I was trying . I could n't do better . I panted on the hills and puffed on the library steps . leaned against hand rails , I hawked and spat and harrumphed like any oldster past his prime . I did what I could to regain the well-being of my youth . I took long walks to get hack my lost wind , ate sparingly , plunged under tingling showers . By the end of December I felt so miserable I decided to see Dr. McKay at the infirmary . So many new things had been discovered about glands and vitamins , about toxins and anti-toxins that one pill a day was possibly all that stood between me and perfect health . I had the feeling , as people do who have always been well , that a doctor commands a kind of magic  --  can heal with a glance ; even Dr. - McKay , this little ex-librarian , a doll of a woman with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cast a spell of health upon me . That was the first time I 'd ever seen Louise McKay , close . My first thought was , she looks every inch her age . She had dark hair considerably grayed , there were lines about her eyes , and her throat muscles were somewhat slack . My second thought was , Why does n't she admit it ? I was dressed more like a middle-aged woman than she . Of course , since she had on a white surgeon 's coat , all that could be seen of her " personal attire " was the three or four inches of brown tweed skirt beneath it . But she wore red , very high-heeled shell pumps . Her hair was set in a modified page boy , ends turned under in a soft roll with a thick rather tangledy fringe across her forehead . It was a somewhat advanced hair style for that year  --  certainly for a middle-aged doctor . Her eyebrows , which were thick and dark , had been obviously shaped by plucking and her finger nails were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had considerable color in her face for a dark-haired woman and she sat at a desk with flowers and pictures on it  --  not family pictures but little prints of ? famous paintings . She said , looking at her appointment calendar which had my name on it , " Miss McCullars ? " I said , " Yes . " Then she said , " I see we have something in common . " She meant our Scotch names of course , but out of some contrariness which I find hard to explain now I pretended not to understand so that she had to explain her little joke to me . But then it was n't very funny . She discovered , in looking through her files , that I had n't had the usual physical examination on entering college . " Why not ? " she asked . " I did n't get a notice to come , " I said , " so I just skipped it . " " It would 've helped , " she told me , ' ' to have that record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble ? " " It 's probably nothing . I 'm probably just the campus hypochondriac " " That role 's already filled . " I did n't feel well even then , though the stimulation of the talk and of seeing the famous Dr. McKay did make me forget some of my miseries . So I began that afternoon what I always continued in her office  --  an impersonation of high-spirited , head-tossing health . I do n't know why . It was n't a planned or analyzed action . It just happened that the minute I opened her office door I began to act the part of a person bursting with vitality and health . There I was , practically dying on my feet as it was later proved , but hiding the fact by every device I could command . What did I think I was doing ? The omit is I was n't thinking at all . ? " I must say you do n't look sick , " she admitted . Then she began to ask me about my medical history . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Was there some specific question you wanted to ask inc . Some problem ? " So she thought I was one of those girls ? Or one of her worshippers just come in to marvel . " I do n't feel well . " " What specifically ? " " Oh  --  aches and pains . " " Where ? " . " Oh  --  here , there , and everywhere . " " We 'll run a few tests and I 'll examine you . The nurse will help you get undressed . " When it was over she said , " Is your temperature ordinarily a little high ? " " I do n't know . I never take it . " " You have a couple of degrees now . " " Above or below normal ? " A little of her school-librarian manner came out . " Are you trying to be funny ? " I was n't in the least . " A fever is always above normal . " " What does it mean to have a fever ? " " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tooth ? A tonsil ? " " Yes , it could be . I want to see you tomorrow at ten . " I remember my visit next morning very well . The acacia trees were in bloom and Dr. McKay 's office was filled with their dusty honey-bee scent . Dr. McKay was still in street clothes  --  a blouse , white , high-necked , but frothy with lace and semi-transparent so that you saw more lace beneath . As if she were determined to have everything , I thought : age and youth , practicality and ornamentation , science and femininity . You hero of the campus , I thought , ironically , But she rebuked us schoolteachers by the way she dressed and held herself  --  and lived , I expected ; she really did . And I , I rebuked her in turn , for our hurt honor . " How do you feel this morning ? " she asked . What did she think to uncover in me ? A cry baby and complainer , she standing there in her lovely clothes and I in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told her , " I feel fine . " I 0 W I felt , was her business was n't it , not mine to tell ? to discover , If 1 knew exactly how I felt , and why , what would 've been the use of seeing a doctor ? Besides , once again in her office I was stimulated by her presence so that my miseries when not there seemed quite possibly something 1 had imagined . " I wanted to check your temperature this morning , " she told me . She sat me down on a white stool , put a thermometer in my mouth , then , while we waited , asked me questions which she thought I could answer with a nod of the head . " You like teaching ? You want to go on with it ? You have made friends here ? " She was surprised when she took the thermometer from my mouth . After looking at it thoughtfully she shook it down and said , " Morning temperature , too . " " You did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . " " Why not ? " . I suspected you had " In the kind of infection a morning temperature is n't usual . " I did n't ask what infection she suspected . I had come to her office willing to be thumped , X-rayed , tested in any way she thought best . I was willing to give her samples of sputum or urine , to cough when told to cough , say ahhh or hold my breath while she counted ten . Whatever she told Inc to do I would do . But she had turned doctor , not I. If she was a doctor not a librarian now was her chance to prove it . Here I was with my fever , come willingly to her office . Let her tell me its cause . For the next month , Dr. McKay lived , so far as I was concerned , the life of a medical detective trying to find the villain behind the temperature . The trouble was the villain 's habits differed from day to day . It was as if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now one , now another behind him . One day much ternperature , the next . day none . Dr. McKay eliminated villain after villain : malaria , tonsillitis , rheumatic fever , infected teeth . And while she found disease after disease which I did not have I grew steadily worse . By May about the only time I ever felt well was while I was in Dr. McKay 's office . Entering it was like going on to a stage . However near I might have been to collapse before that oak door opened , once inside it I was able to play with perfect ease my role of health . I was unable , actually , to do anything else . I assumed health when I entered her office as they say Dickens , unable to stand without support , assumed health when he walked out before an audience . It was nothing I planned . I could n't by an act of will have feigned exuberance and wellbeing , gone to her office day after day consciously to play the role of Miss Good Health of 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - minute I crossed that threshhold , something electric  --  and ironic . I stood , sat . stooped , reclined , breathed soft , breathed hard , answered questions , flexed my muscles , exposed my reflexes for Dr. McKay with vigor and pleasure  --  and irony . Especially irony . I was sick , sick , falling apart , crumbling , dying on my feet , and I knew it . And this woman , this campus hero whose province it was to know it , was ignorant of the fact . I did n't know what ailed me and was n't supposed to . She was . It was her business to know . N THE beginning , tuberculosis had been in- cluded among the other suspected diseases . But the non-tubercular fever pattern , the absence of positive sputum , the identical sounds of the lungs when percussed all had persuaded Dr. McKay that the trouble lay elsewhere . I did not speculate at all about my sickness . I had never been sick before , nor even , for that matter , known a sick person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leprosy and when Dr. McKay began once again to suspect tuberculosis I was co-operative and untroubled . She was going to give me what she called " a patch test . " Whether this is still used I do n't know . The test then consisted of the introduction of a small number of tuherrle bacilli to a patch of scraped skin . If , after a day or two , there was no " positive " reaction , no inflammation of the skin , one was thought to have no tubercular infection . On the day Dr. McKay began this test she used the word tuberculosis for the first time . I had experienced when I entered her office that afternoon my usual heightening of well-being , what amounted to a real gaiety . " So you still do n't give up ? " I asked when she announced her plan for the new test . " Still wo n't admit that what you have on your hands is a hypochondriac ? " It was a beautiful afternoon in late May . School was almost over for the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunshine and the blossoming hawthorn , their faces lifted to the light , Cubberly and Thorudyke and Dewey given the go-by for an hour or two . Some of this end-of-the-year , lovely-day quiet came into my interview with Dr. McKay . Though it had started with my usual high-spirited banter , I stopped that . It seemed inappropriate . I experienced my usual unusual well-being but there was added to it that strange , quiet , listening tenderness which marks the attainment of a pinnacle of some kind . Dr. McKay stood before her window , her surgeon 's jacket off  --  I was her last patient for the day  --  in her usual frothy blouse , very snow-white against the rose-red of the hawthorn trees . She turned away from the window and said to me , " You are n't a hypochondriac . " She shook her head . " I do n't know . " Then she explained the patch-test to me . " Tuberculosis ? " I asked . " And no hectic flush , no graveyard cough , no skin and hones ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone had changed , tender , tender , humorous , and fondling ; the battle  --  if there had been one  --  over ; and the issue , whatever it was , settled . " In spite of all that , this test ? " " In spite of all that , " she said . She did the scraping deftly . I watched her hands and while I doubt that there is any such thing as a " surgeon 's hands , " Dr. McKay 's did n't look like a librarian 's , either , marked by fifteen years of mucilage pots , library stamps , and ten-cent fines . I could smell her perfume and note at close range the degree to which she defied time and the expected categories . " Come back Monday at the same time , " she told me when she had finished . " What do you expect Monday ? " I asked . " I 'm no prophet , " she answered . " If I were She did n't finish her sentence . We parted like comrades who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what she felt or thought  --  that she had really discovered , at last , the cause of my illness , perhaps . What I felt is difficult to describe . Certainly my feelings were not those of the usual patient threatened with tuberculosis . Instead 1 experienced a tranquillity I had n't known for a long time . I felt like a lover and a winner , triumphant but tranquil . I knew there would be no positive reaction to the skin test . Beyond that I did n't think . I was quite right about the reaction . Dr. McKay was completely professional Monday afternoon ; buttoned up in her white jacket , stethoscope hanging about her neck . I entered her office feeling well , but strange . My veins seemed bursting with blood or triumph . I looked out of the window and remembered where I had been a year ago . Breathing was difficult , but in the past months I had learned to live without breathing . I wore a special dress that afternoon because I thought the occasion special . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white men's-shining Madras and had a deep scooped neckline , bordered with a ruffle . " How do you feel ? " Dr. McKay asked as she always did , when I entered . " Out of this- world , " -I told her . " Do n't joke , " she said . " I was n't . It 's the truth . I feel wonderful . " " Let 's have a look at the arm . " " You wo n't find anything . " " How do you know ? Did you peek ? " " No , I did n't but you wo n't find anything . " " I 'll have a look anyway . " There was nothing , just as I 'd known . Not a streak of pink even . Nothing but the marks of the adhesive tape to distinguish one arm from the other . Dr. McKay looked and looked . She touched the skin and pinched it . " Okay , " she said , " you win . " " What do you mean ' I win ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you ? " " Of course not . " " I told you all along I was a hypochondriac . " " Okay , Miss McCullars , " she said again , " you win . " She sat down at her desk and wrote something on my record sheet .. " What 's the final verdict ? " I asked . She handed the sheet to me . What she had written was " TB patch-test negative . Fluctuating temperature due to neurotic causes . " ' So I wo n't need to come back ? " " No . " " Nor worry about my lungs ? " " No . " T HEN with precise timing , as if that were the cue for which for almost six months I had been waiting , I had , there in Dr. McKay 's office , my first hemorrhage . A hemorrhage from the lungs is always frightening and this was a very bad one and my first , They got me to the infirmary at once , but there behind me in Dr. McKay 's office was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I was not allowed to speak for twenty-four hours and my thought , once the hemorrhaging had stopped , was contained in two words which ran through my mind , over and over again . " I 've won . I 've won . " What had I won ? Well , for one thing I 'd won my release from going on with my work for that Secondary Credential . All that could be forgotten and forgotten also the need to leave Liberty at an . I could go back there , hack to my stranded sofa and the school library and the mountains , blue over the green barley . When at the end of twenty-four hours I was permitted to whisper , Dr. Stegner , the head physician at Oakland State , came to see inc . " When did you first see Dr. McKay ? " he asked , " In December . " " What course of treatment did she prescribe ? " " Not any . She did n't know what was wrong with the .

She should have known that in cases of far advanced tuberculosis , and that was what I had , the already deeply infected system pays no attention to the introduction of one or two more bacilli . All of its forces are massed elsewhere  --  there are no guards left to repulse border attacks of unimportant skirmishers . But by this time my mother had arrived , alert , knowledgeable , and energetic . " My poor little girl , " she said , " this woman doctor has killed you . " I was n't dead yet , but as I heard the talk around me I began to understand that in another year or two I might very well be so . And listening to my mother 's talk I began to agree with her . Dr. McKay had robbed me not only of health but of a promising career  --  I had been poised upon the edge of something unusual . I was training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now all was denied me and for this denial I could blame Dr. McKay . I did . She had cut me down in mid-career through her ignorance .

My mother said it was her duty ; that she owed the steps she was taking to some other poor girl who Wright suffer as I had through Dr. McKay 's medical incompetence . I thought it was a matter for her to decide and besides I was far too ill to have or want any say in such decisions . I was sent , as soon as I was able to be moved , to a sanitarium near my home in Southern California . I had been there four months when I saw Dr. McKay again . At the beginning of the visiting hour on the first Saturday in October the nurse on duty came to my room . " Dr. McKay to see you , " she said . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that I would have refused if I 'd had the chance  --  for Dr. McKay followed the nurse into the room and sat down by my bed . She had changed a good deal ; she appeared little , nondescript , and mousy . She had stopped shaping her eyebrows and painting her nails . I suppose I had changed too . With the loss of my fever I had lost also all my show of exuberance and life . I lay there in the hospital bed looking , I knew , as sick as I really was . We stared at each other without words for a time . Then I said , to say something , for she continued silent , " How are things at Oakland State this year ? " " I 'm not at Oakland State . I was fired . " I had n't known it-1 was surprised and dismayed but for a heart beat  --  in a heart beat  --  I experienced a flash of that old outrageous exultation I had known in her office . I was , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender in victory . Though what my victory was , I sick and she fired , I could n't have told . " I 'm sorry , " I said . I was . It is a pitiful thing to be out of work . " Do n't tie , " she said . " I am not lying . " I told her . S.M did n't contradict me . " Why did you do it ? " she asked me . " Do what ? " I said , at first really puzzled . Then I remembered . my mother 's threats . " I had nothing to do with it . Even If I 'd wanted to , I was too sick . You know that . I had no idea you were n't in Oakland this year . " " I do n't mean my firing  --  directly . I mean that long masquenide . I mean that willingness to kill yourself , if necessary , to punish me . I tell you a doctor of fifty years ' experience would 've been fooled by you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted nothing but good for yrni . Why did you do it ? Why ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " What had I ever done to you ? Lost there in that dark library , dreaming of being a doctor , saving my money and finally escaping . How had I harmed or threatened you , that you should he willing to risk your life to punish me ? " Dr. McKay had risen and was walking about the room , her voice , for one so small , surprisingly loud and commanding . I was afraid a nurse would come to ask her to be quiet . Yet I hesitated myself to remind her to speak more quietly . " Well , " she said , " you have put yourself in a prison , a fine narrow prison . Elected it of your own free will . And that 's all right for you , if you wanted a prison . But you had no rig-ht to elect it for me too . That was murderous . Really murderous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself and tried to ask questions which would divert her mind from the past . " Where are you practicing , now ? " I asked . She stopped her pacing and stood over me . " I am no longer in medicine , " she said . " I 'm the librarian in the high school at Beaumont . " " That 's not where you were before ? " " No , its much smaller and hotter . ' ' " It 's only thirty miles  --  as the crow flies  --  from Liberty where 1 used to teach . I 'm going back there as soon as I 'm well . It was a mistake to leave it . " She said nothing . " I really love Liberty , " I said , " and teaching . The big fields of barley , the mountains . There was an old sofa on the schoolyard where I used to sit . It was like a throne . I thought for a while I wanted to get away from there and try something else . But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is get back . " " I wish you could have discovered that before you came to Oakland . " I ignored this . " Do n't you love books ? " " I had better love books , " she said , and left the room . S I. T happened I 've never seen her again , though I get these cards . I did n't go back to Liberty four years later  --  when I was able again to teach . I got this other school but somehow the magic I had felt earlier with the children , I felt no longer . An outdated little schoolroom with the windows placed high so that neither teacher nor pupils could see out : a dusty schoolyard ; and brackish water . The children I teach now look so much like their predecessors that I have the illusion of living in a dream , of being on a treadmill teaching the same child the same lesson through eternity . Outside on the school grounds my erstwhile throne , the sofa , does not exist . The mountains of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the valley . Just across the mountains are Beaumont and Dr. McKay ; and I am sometimes heartened , standing on the packed earth of the schoolyard in the winter dusk , as she suggested , to think of her reshelving her books , closing the drawer of her line-till , at the same hour . We ca n't all escape ; some of us must stay home and do the homely tasks , however much we may have dreamed of painting or doctoring . " You have company , " I tell myself , looking toward her across the mountains . Then I get into my car to drive into town where my mother has all this loveliness waiting for me ; a composition , once again , which really includes me.
