The Korean war reached its grimmest and most dangerous stage . Early in the week , there was some hope in the fact that the North Koreans seemed to be in a desperate hurry . Their dead piled up in heaps before U.S. machine guns that jammed from their own heat . The North Koreans kept on coming ; the Americans fought to keep their own pace , when they were driven back , to orderly retirement . It was a furious assault , and soundly based on the lessons of military history ; the North Koreans were trying to turn a stubbornly fought retreat into a rout , seize the Pusan beachhead area , destroy the U.N . forces . <P> If this was their primary aim , they had - up to this week-signally not succeeded . But the threat was there and would be there until U.S. reinforcements ( which began to land in Korea this week ) were in position . Knowing the threat , and sick &; tired of retreat , Lieut . General Walton Walker called his division commanders together , gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or die where they stood . <P> Afterward , Walker said to newsmen : " We will not give up an inch of ground that is not already lost . . . There 's no thought in the mind of anybody in this Army-even though we might be so disposed-that there can possibly be a Dunkirk . It would be impossible to get out . " <P> It was hard to take this as anything more than a tough old soldier 's morale-stiffening bracer for worse ordeals yet to come . At the time Walker spoke , the line was a sprawling 200-mile loop with the Reds a long way from Pusan on the east coast , too close for comfort on the south . Walker just did not have enough men to stand fast on such a line . On flat terrain a division is normally expected to hold no more than six miles of front ; in rugged Korea , where routes of advance are channeled , a division might protect as much as ten miles . <P> This week the 2nd Infantry Division , under security wraps since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Korea and fanned rapidly out to help U.S. defenses . Next day advance units of the 1st Marines also landed . <P> At most , for the next week , Walker could count on five or six U.S. divisions . These , with South Korean help , might hold a 100-mile front guarding Pusan-hold it in the sense of resisting pressure anywhere and sealing off any penetration - but not much more .
