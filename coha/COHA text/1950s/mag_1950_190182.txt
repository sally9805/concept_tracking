As Brazil 's longtime , stern-fatherly dictator , little , pear-shaped Getulio Vargas sponsored social legislation for Brazil 's workers . It was a good pitch , and it built up a large following who ecstatically called themselves " queremistas " ( literally , " wanters " -a telescoped version of the slogan : " We want Getulio ! " ) . The queremistas felt a personal relationship with their " papa of the poor . " <P> In 1945 a military coup ended Vargas ' 15-year regime , and the old man withdrew in good order to his ranch near the Uruguayan frontier at Itu . There he got into cowboy breeches and boots , and ostensibly retired from politics . Even after Sao Paulo 's bumptious Governor Adhemar de Barros named him for a presidential comeback ( TIME , June 26 ) , Getulio sat on quietly at Itu . As election day ( Oct. 3 ) got closer , the hottest Brazilian political question was whether Getulio still had his old magic , and whether he cared to practice it . Last week Brazilians found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Sao Paulo airport when he flew in from Itu , with Adhemar at his side . " He 's our little father , " cackled a toothless old woman . It took 20 minutes for the police to get Getulio to a car and on his way to the chartreuse-and-blue Palacio dos Campos Eliseos , where Sao Paulo 's great and near-great waited . ( Amid the music and toasts , Adhemar had a happy thought for the future : " He 'll stay in the presidency five years , and then it will be my turn . " ) <P> That night 80,000 queremistas jammed the Vale of Anhangaba , a grassy park amid Sao Paulo 's skyscrapers . " Workers of Brazil ! " boomed Getulio . There was a sigh from the crowd , and then a roar : " Getulio ! Getulio ! " He spoke for an hour , recited his " conquests " for Brazilian workers . If elected , said Getulio , he would back more social legislation . He would provide free land for the poor . He bore malice toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
