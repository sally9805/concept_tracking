Young Danny had an abscessed ear , and to ease the pain a doctor in St. Joseph , Missouri gave him morphine . Danny had been an insecure , troubled child longer than he could remember-both his mother &; father died before he was five . At 16 , Danny knew nothing about psychology , but he knew that the " shot " gave him a lift . From a peddler he got morphine regularly for six months ; then he lost his contact and could get no more . He became weak , nauseated , sweaty , shaky and depressed . Danny was sent to a state hospital . <P> " No Such Thing as a Cure . " Danny learned a lot in the hospital . Veteran gowsters taught him how to get a ration of white stuff . When he got out , Danny did not go home . He bummed around the country , doing odd jobs , lying , stealing , forging prescriptions-anything for a bang . Time &; again he was picked up and convicted , usually to serve his sentence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lexington , Ky . " They can withdraw you , " says Danny , " but there is no such thing as a cure . You just have to stay away from the stuff . " <P> Between terms , when Danny seemed to be away from the habit , he got married . Before the first baby was a year old , Danny was shot up again . When his wife left him he tried to commit suicide . And so back to Lexington . <P> Up to this point Danny 's story had a deadly familiar ring . Every year , thousands of teen-agers take the first step to narcotic addiction-usually by smoking a reefer ( a cigarette containing marijuana ) because they do n't want to be called " chicken . " Dope peddlers have been pushing their wares through high schools and street gangs . Now estimates of the number of addicts range anywhere from 50,000 to 300,000 . <P> Eleven out of 80 . Last week , Danny stood up in a Y.M.C.A. auditorium in Manhattan and told what had happened to him during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other victims . Danny had started listening to members of Alcoholics Anonymous . " It seemed religious , " he says , " and like most addicts I did n't care anything about God . It might work for those drunks but not for us . But after a while I began to feel that this group had the answer . " Danny studied the A.A. code , saw how it could be applied to discharged dope victims , and founded Narcotics Anonymous . <P> Now , on the first anniversary of Narcotics Anonymous , Danny could report on about 80 addicts who had tried mutual-aid , group therapy . Six had stayed drugfree for a year or more , five more have been free for a shorter time . Ten are known to have slipped back into the habit ; so , probably , have most of the 60 who can not be traced . <P> Numerically , it was a small beginning . But the group in Manhattan , ( and others being formed in Chicago , Los Angeles and Vancouver ) offered new hope to men who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar P.H.S. hospital at Fort Worth , only to fall into the habit* again . Says Danny , whose downfall began with an earache 25 years ago : " I 've been a burden to the Government most of my life . Now I can repay my debt . " <P> * The states and cities have no such treatment centers . Parents of teen-age addicts demonstrated before New York 's City Hall last month , urged the city government to set up a center .
