EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON ( 318 pp. ) - Ellsworth Barnard-Macmillan ( $4.75 ) . <P> Six months after her son 's birth in December 1869 , Mrs. Robinson of Head Tide , Me. had not got around to naming the baby , her third . Distressed by this , a lady from Arlington , Mass , suggested picking a name from a hat . Out of the hat came a slip marked " Edwin . " Well pleased , Mother Robinson tacked on " Arlington " in honor of the lady from Massachusetts , and Edwin Arlington Robinson was tagged with the first of many labels . <P> " Failure " was one of the tags he applied to himself for a long time . " Poet " was another , but Edwin Arlington Robinson was 53 before the U.S. recognized that he was a major one . <P> Duffer at Harvard . Robinson 's father was reluctant to let him go to college , because one of Edwin 's older brothers had gone to college to study medicine , and had become , by 29 , an addict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave grudging consent for the boy to attend classes at Harvard , though lack of credits made him a " special student . " <P> Robinson was happy at Harvard , if a bit of a social duffer . Women terrified him ( he was to remain a bachelor all his life ) , and he felt that dancing lowered a man 's " natural dignity . " Painfully shy , he preferred to " smoke a pipe and talk of Matthew Arnold . " <P> A year after his father died , Robinson had to leave Harvard and go back to Maine . But he could not keep his mind on his chores around the house ; he was devoured by the " itch for authorship . " At 27 he scraped together $52 and privately published his first book of poems . Critics were polite , the public was indifferent . At 30 Robinson tried again . He took a small family inheritance and moved to New York . He was soon living on a diet of beans , apples and rejection slips . When he had enough rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher . One house stalled him off for a year . The truth was that a member of the firm had mislaid the manuscript in a brothel . <P> Discovered by T.R. Literary friends banded together to get the book published , but it made no bigger dent than the first one . Despondent , Robinson began hitting the bottle and living on loans and handouts from his friends . In 1903 , when New York City was building its first subway , he took a job as time-checker . The first day , the nearsighted poet fell into an excavation , but he stuck with the job , ten hours a day at $2 a day for nine months . At night he drowned his frustration in cheap whisky . To a friend he wrote : " I was a tragedy in the beginning , and it is hardly probable that I shall ever be anything else . What manner of cave I shall select for a time is of no real importance .

His young son Kermit had sent him the revamped edition of Robinson 's first book , and the excited T.R. prodded Scribner 's into reissuing it . In his review in the Outlook , T.R. foreshadowed many a Robinson admirer since by admitting : " I am not sure I understand Luke Havergal ; but I am entirely sure I like it . "
