For two suspense-filled days last week , tellers sweated beneath the gimlet gaze of party watchers to tally the results of Italy 's national elections . In the deluge of 28 million ballots-representing a remarkable 93.7% of the electorate-rested a nation 's choice between parliamentary democracy or chaos . The decision : democracy , in a perilously close race . <P> The winner emerged a weakened but not a discouraged champion . In 1948 Premier Alcide de Gasperi 's Christian Democrats and their center allies won 62% of the vote and a big majority in the Chamber of Deputies . This time they won a narrow edge in the Senate , but , though the leading party , failed by 57,000 votes to get a clear popular majority in the Chamber of Deputies . Had those comparatively few votes swung his way , De Gasperi 's hard-fought electoral-reform law would have given him a bonus of about 80 seats . As it was proportional representation gave him a 16-seat Chamber majority-enough to govern warily but not boldly . <P> Technically it was a victory for De Gasperi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of economic gains and political stability under De Gasperi , Italians had the opportunity to vote for democrats or totalitarians of left or right . Democracy got only 49.8% of the votes . <P> The Left gained 1,400,000 votes and 36 more Chamber seats over 1948 , now represents more than a third ( 35.3% ) of the Italian electorate . <P> Disturbing statistic : of 2,700,000 youths from 21 to 25 voting for the first time , 1,200,000 voted for the totalitarian left , less than a million for the democratic center . Palmiro Togliatti 's Communists and Pietro Nenni 's fellow-traveling Socialists had been expected only to hold their own . In the last days of the campaign , a U.S. Senate committee hearing 4,000 miles away gave the leftists effective ammunition for crumbling one of the pillars of De Gasperi 's campaign-his ability to keep U.S. aid flowing to Italy . Communist newspapers and orators recited quotes from the testimony of a brass-tongued U.S. manufacturer named Frederick C. Crawford , head of Thompson Products , Inc. ( jet engine parts ) , who had just come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate : " . . . Discontinue all aid , . because aid will no longer help Italy basically . " Crawford 's ill-timed remarks got little play in the U.S. ; they were big news in Italy-the Communists saw to that . Another formidable contributor to the left 's success was its calculated good conduct during the campaign . The usual Red rule of riot and rowdiness was suspended to convince wavering Italians that Communists were really men of peace &; good will . <P> The Right , only a minor brother in 1948 , won more than 2,000,000 votes from De Gasperi 's center . With their appeal for a return to the tawdry glories of Mussolini , the neo-Fascists won 29 Chamber seats . Biggest gainers were the Monarchists , led by Naples ' wealthy , shipowning Mayor Achille Lauro , whose big promises and free handouts of spaghetti and clothes won 7% of the votes and 40 seats . <P> <P> The line-up in the Chamber : <P> Christian Democrats &; allies ... 303 <P> Communists and Red Socialists ... 218 <P> Monarchists ... 40 <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
