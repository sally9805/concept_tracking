On a chilly fall day at Shannon Airport five years ago , San Francisco Chronicle Columnist Stan ( " Postcards " ) Delaplane stepped up to a bar for a bracer . From the other side , he was handed a drink he had never tasted before . Delaplane inquired and got-complete with an Irishman 's flair for a tale-Bartender Joe Sheridan 's explanation of the origin of the drink . <P> Back in San Francisco Columnist Delaplane remembered the drink and the story . In his column , he wrote : " ' T was in the old days the flying boats were landing at Foynes-about ' 38 I should say ; the passengers would come in by launch , shivering and shaking fit to die with cold . ' Surely , ' said Joe Sheridan , ' we must invent a stirrup cup for the poor souls , and them not able to put their shivering hands in their pockets for a shilling to pay unless we warm them . What is more warming , ' said Joe , ' than Irish whisky , smooth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their poor shaking hands we will fill the glass with coffee black as Cromwell 's heart , We will top it with a floating inch of Irish cream . ' " The result : Irish coffee . <P> " What 's Happening ? " The memory of the drink was not enough for Columnist Delaplane . One night at San Francisco 's Buena Vista bar , he showed the bartender how to make Irish coffee. * The drink that Columnist Delaplane mixed ( and reported in his column ) , packed a wallop felt far from San Francisco . <P> A few weeks after Delaplane 's demonstration came a startled cable from Ire land to a San Francisco liquor importer : WHAT 'S HAPPENING ? The answer : Dela plane had touched off a craze for Irish coffee . In San Francisco 's Buena Vista bar alone , consumption of Irish whisky leaped from two cases a year to 1,000 cases , an average of 700 Irish coffees a day . Visitors from some 40-odd cities where Delaplane 's column runs turned up in droves to sample the magic dew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports of Irish whisky to the U.S. increased 40% last year , to 10,000 cases . In Manhattan , bistros from Pat Moriarty 's Chop House ( price : 85 ) to the 21 Club ( price : $1.75 ) have begun ladling out Irish coffee . <P> TV Star Jack Webb built an entire Dragnet around Irish coffee . From Ireland came Count Cyril McCormack , John 's son , sales director of John Locke &; Co . Irish distillery , to see what was going on at the Buena Vista . From the Buena Vista , Bartender Jack Koeppler made a pilgrimage to Ireland and was guest of honor at a luncheon tendered by Deputy Prime Minister William Norton . " I might have been Saint Patrick himself , come to throw the snakes out , " says Washington-born German-descended Bartender Koeppler.
