txt All social , athletic and club activities in the city 's public high schools face total suspension for the rest of this term as a result of an overwhelming vote yesterday of the High School ' Teachers Association 's board of representatives to continue its extra-Curricular work stoppage . Meeting at a two-and-a-half hour session of heated debate in the Astor Hotel , the representatives voted 136 to 18 to continue the stoppage that has been in effect for seven weeks as a result of the city administration 's failure to grant the teachers a $600 a year- salary increase . The association is said to have about 5,500 members . Earlier this week , the Teachers Guild , A. F. L. , and the Teachers Union , United Public Workers , took similar stands . The actions of the three groups , which among them are believed to represent virtually all of the city 's 10,000 academic and vocational high school teachers , appeared yesterday to mean the failure of a recent " peace offer " by the Board of Education and the Superintendent of Schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Dwyer , offered to set up a fact-finding committee to study the question of salary increases on condition that the teachers resume the extra-curricular activities , which are conducted on a voluntary basis . Although the high school group rejected the proposal to end the stoppage , it did approve yesterday by a vote of 101 to 48 the establishment of a fact-finding committee that would be acceptable. /o the association . By voice vote it also adopted resolutions calling upon the proposed committee to make its report by June 28 , and stipulating that salary increases be made effective July 1 , when the 1950-51 school salary schedules go into effect . One of the resolutions speci- fied that the increases be granted to all present high school personnel . Stick to $600 Demand The association had indicated in the past that it would accept nothing less than a $600 a year increase and yesterday 's meeting showed no sign that the teachers would be willing to modify their position . On Thursday . the Board of Education adopted its 1950-51 salary schedules , which included $250 a. year increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 , and $150 for all the remaining 26,000 teachers in the city system . Under the current schedule , salaries start at $2,500 a year and go to $5,125 in sixteen annual increments . An additional $200 is granted to holders of the master 's degree . Scattered cries of " sell-out " and derisive laughter were heard at yesterday 's meeting after William Saunders , the association 's legislative representative , disclosed that he had a recent conference with the Mayor and that Mr. O'Dwyer had said that he was sympathetic with the teachers ' salary demands . Mr. Saunders declared that Superintendent of Schools William Jansen " also agrees with our case , " but that the school head did not see any possibility of an increase of more than $300 this year and perhaps another $300 next year . This met with shouts of " No , no " from many of the representatives . An address by Mrs. Katherine Johnson , past president of the association , urging the representatives to accept the school officials ' recent offer also went unheeded . Mrs. Johnson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting ended , warned the group that teachers would lose the support of parents and " everyone who counts " unless the extracurricular stoppage was ended . A statement from another woman teacher supporting Mrs. Johnson 's position on the ground that " we are not labor  --  we are a profession " brought a reply from a man that he did not know " if we are a profession or not , but we are getting coolie wages . " His sentiment seemed to be shared by most of those present and it was ' on this note that the resolutions were voted . Teachers Union Protests Meanwhile , the Teachers Union , which on Thursday was barred by the Board of Education from all official dealings with the city school system , held a mass meeting last night in Carnegie Hall to protest that action as well as the suspension of eight teachers , all union members , who had refused to tell if they were members of the Communist party . Dr. John J. De Boer , ProfeAsor of Education at the University of Illinois , declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from reprisal in the largest city in America , they can be safe now'iere . " " The real patriots in America today , " he said , " are those who would preserve the precious tradition of the freedom of thought and association , not those who , under the guise of a star-spangled political orthodoxy , would suppress such freedoms . " Other speakers included Abraham Lederman , president of the union , and Mrs. Celia Lewis Zitron , its secretary , both of whom were among the eight suspended teachers who are now facing departmental trials , and Mrs. Rose Russell , the union 's legislative representative . 75 Locals to Back 15 . P. W. Earlier , the United Labor Committee to Defeat Taft-Hartley announced that seventy-five local unions would be banded together to defend the United Public Workers in its difficulties with the Board of Education and the Department of Welfare . The announcement came after a closed meeting in the U. P. W. 's headquarters at 210 West Fiftieth Street , and disclosed that the cooperating locals would include independents as well as units of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations . James Durkin , national president of the United Office and Professional Workers of America , who presided at the meeting , termed the Board of Education 's action against the Teachers Union as " the crudest and most flagrant disregard of the sentiment of the teachers and their right to belong to a union of their own choice . " He added that 25,000 persons would be urged to demonstrate at City Hall on June 14 from 5 to 7 P. M. in protest against " the attack of Mayor O'Dwyer and city officials " on the union .
