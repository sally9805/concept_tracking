( See Cover ) <P> Finland braced itself this week for an invasion . Planes and ships , loaded to capacity , were already disembarking the advance guard of an expected 40,000 foreign visitors to the Olympic Games at Finland 's capital . Helsinki 's main boulevard , the Mannerheimintie , was lined with store windows displaying the five-colored Olympic rings . In the 10 local newspapers , news of the imminent games almost crowded out the G.O.P. convention in Chicago and the war in Korea . Some householders were demanding , and getting , sky-high prices for bed &; board . Helsinki 's restaurants hurriedly recruited an extra 2,500 helpers , who were subjected to a brief course in the pronunciation of French wines and liqueurs . <P> In the Olympic village at Kpyl ( where all but the women 's contingents , the Russian team and their satellites were quartered ) , clouds of Finnish autograph hunters buzzed around the visiting athletes like hungry mosquitoes : " Sign pliss . Your name , pliss . " Next to the big U.S. team ( 350 men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grey slacks and gabardine hats , the squad that attracted the most attention was the closemouthed Russian team , some 400 strong , which was constantly convoyed by 300 stony-faced " officials . " Making their first Olympic appearance since the Czarist days of 1912 ( when they did n't win a single gold medal ) , the Russians had apparently abandoned their idea of shuttling the Red athletes by airlift in &; out of Helsinki each day . Instead , they were immured in a separate " Little Iron Curtain " village , six miles from the Olympic Stadium . But they were plainly on their best behavior . Located next to the U.S. boathouse , Russian oarsmen jovially insisted on lending the Americans a scull . <P> Olympic Truce . How good were the Russians ? Nobody knew . But the broad-backed Russian women , who claim seven world records , were expected to dominate the women 's track &; field events . Standing virtually alone against them was the amazing Netherlands housewife , Fanny Blankers-Koen , who won four gold medals at the 1948 London games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game that even the Russians admit the U.S. invented . Olympic fans hope that the Russian basketball team , European champions in 1951 , will meet the U.S. in the final . <P> As Baron Erik von Frenckell , Helsinki 's mayor , proclaimed this week the traditional " Olympic truce " ( a throwback to the B.C. days when the Greeks called off their local wars to celebrate the games ) , there were a few inevitable rhubarbs . Both Nationalist and Red China , along with East Germany , suddenly and belatedly demanded admission for their teams . Bulgaria , which drew Russia in a first-round soccer match , complained bitterly when a soccer " unknown , " The Netherlands West Indies , drew a first-round bye. * <P> <P> <P> But the 1952 Olympics would also mark the end of some past enmities . Both Japan and West Germany were competing again in the Olympics for the first time since World War II . Germany 's Olympic trials had already produced a sensation when Werner Lueg , a 20-year-old West-phalian , equaled the world record for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clocking of 3:43.
