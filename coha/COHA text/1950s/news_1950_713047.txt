txt Letters to The Times India 's Stand on Korea Sentiments Well Known Second , it is correct that Prime Minister Nehru 's sentiments both with regard to the Soviet Union and the United States are very well known ; they are that the Prime Minister of India considers the U. S. S. R. a dictatorship and that he thinks that under the Soviet system " individual freedom ceases to exist , " that he considers the United States of America a great democracy which is destined , " in cooperation with other democratic and libertyloving nations , " to make " a mighty contribution toward world peace and prosperity . " Then again , your editorial writer says , " Pandit Nehru is anti-Communist in India but wants to be friendly and neutral toward communism abroad . " Nehru is not " friendly " to communism either in India or abroad . Communism does not respect means to the end . Nehru is a follower of Gandhi . And Gandhi taught India one great lesson : Always respect the means to the end . With regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government of India are rightly getting sick and tired of the usage of the word " neutrality , " continuously applied to their stand in the present state of affairs between the Soviet Union and the Western democracies . The word " neutrality " has been pinned on to India and it is high time that it was unpinned . India is not " neutral . " India wants to judge each situation on its merits , She wants to have the independence of judgment and action . India does not want to be led by the nose . India , as Nehru has said , is in a " pivotal " position and could not remain " neutral " even if she so desired . India and Nehru could not remain neutral between good and evil , or between democracy and totalitarianism . Oversimplified Question At this stage , I am sure the question is likely to be asked that if that is so , why does n't India join America ? a democracy  --  against Russia  --  a totalitarian state ? That would be oversimplification of the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his visit to New York last year , Nehru said to me , " I am not a dictator * * * . India is a democracy . * * * I must carry my people with me . " The last sentence , " I must carry my people with me " tells the whole story . It spells out the problem . And that problem is that the vast majority of the people of India are suspicious of America  --  not that America has done anything , but because of the 200 years of British rule in India . Let us not forget or overlook a simple , a very simple , fact : The Americans speak the same language as the British do , the Americans look like the British  --  and people of India have had such a bad taste of the British . Memories are still fresh . The same Nehru who is now the Prime Minister of India was rotting in a British jail until May , 1945 ? five years ago . I know Nehru has no traces of bitterness left in him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and India , like all other countries , is full of plain and ordinary people . Thus the memories and suspicions ? of the " foreign rule " still linger on . New alliances , even with good " foreigners , " cause raising of the eyebrows and create doubts and suspicions . While in the United States last year , speaking before the United States Congress , Nehru said , " Where freedom is menaced or justice threatened , or where aggression takes ? place , we can not be and shall not be neutral . " Aggression has taken place in Korea . Nehru has lived up to his words . J. J. SINGH , President India League of America . New York . July 8. 1850 parison , the citizens of the great Ern. pire State might complain of their disproportionate representation in the United States Senate . Since the population of Hawaii is considerably over one-half million , we can readily rule out any objection to her statehood on that score at least . To be sure , the disparity between that figure and the 92,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection , Nevada at the time of admission into the Union had a population of considerably less than that of Alaska today . One could readily agree with the suggestion of Mr. Griffiths that " the act of admission should provide for the subsequent splitting into two or more states under some specified conditions , at least in so far as Alaska would be concerned . " In view of the probably continued slow growth of Alaska 's population , it appears unlikely that it will ever be divided lilt ? more than two parts , which , as in the case of the Dakotas , could be designated as North and South Alaska . WILLIAM C. FRY . Providence , R. I. , June 28 , 1950 . News in Dominican Republic Censorship Denied , Information Sources Said to Be Open to All To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The members of the Executive Committee of the Dominican Press Association have read with astonishment an article published in your issue of June 18 , originating with The Associated Press , entitled " Study of World Censorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican Republic is included in this article as a country in which censorship of the press exists to a marked degree . This statement is absolutely inaccurate , since in our country there is no type of censorship , restriction or obstacle to the publication of newspapers , magazines and books , or to radio broadcasts . The Dominican Press Association , which includes all newspapers and magazines published in this country , numbers among its members representatives of publications of diverse ideological tendencies . Yet our association has never found it necessary to intervene with the Government because of censorship or suppression . Our association is completely non-political and has never been solicited by the Government in any manner to render a political expression of opinion or to make demands on its membership to slant the news in the interests of the Government . In our country all sources of information are free and open to domestic as well as to foreign newspaper men . Thus it is inexplicable that The Associated Press , whose correspondents never have been denied access to Sources , much less been censored or ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dominican Republic among the cowltries which " continue censorship . " A typical illustration of how freedom of press and speech functions in the Dominican Republic is the case of the invasion of the country by a sedi. tious group on June 18 , 1949 , at Luperon . Although it was felt , with good reason , that the internal security of the nation was endangered , newspaper . men were not limited or impeded in their work at any time . Moreover , all radio broadcasts of the enetny , tending to create confusion in the pub . lie mind through false news during the course of the violence , were listened to in public places and in the homes . Thus it is evident that The Associi ated Press has committed an error to include the name of the Dominican Re . public in its list of countries where press censorship exists . The Dominican Press Association will appreciate pub . lication of this letter , as an act of fair . ness , to give us the same opportunity as was accorded The Associated Press in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . RAMON MARRERO ARISTY , President . Ciudad Trujillo , June 21 , 1950 . Watering Station for Horses TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read with interest the letter signed Alice Manchester , President Greenwich Village Humane League , regarding the need of horses for water in the summer time . We are entirely in accord with her letter and for the information of the readers of THE NEW YORK *TIMES we call attention to the watering station we have maintained for several years at Fifty-ninth Street and First Avenue , where a capable and- humane man is in attendance throughout the hot weather . STELLA HUNTER , Managing Director , The Humane So , ciety of New York . New York , July 5 , 1950 . Nehru 's Position Given , Attitude of People Explained To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I must confess my great disappointment at the ungracious tone of your editorial " India 's Decision , " which appeared in your paper of June 30 . After acknowledging the fact that India 's decision to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , will be received throughout the democratic world with profound satisfaction , you state that " there were reasons for concern before this decision was taken . India after all , had not participated in the crucial Security Council vote on the United States resolution , and the sentiments of Prime Minister Nehru concerning the Soviet Union and the United States were only too well known . " First , India did not vote in the Security Council meeting of June 27 only because , due to atmospheric difficulties , India 's permanent delegate , Sir B. N. Rau , Chairman of the Security Council meeting that evening , was unable to contact New Delhi over the telephone . To read anything else into India 's nonparticipation that night is neither factual nor fair . Statehood for Alaska and Hawaii TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW Yon TIMES : The proposal of William H. Griffiths in a recent issue of THE TIMES to create a forty-ninth state ? by combining Alaska and Hawaii ? as an alternative to the creation of two new states bearing those names is not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years a correspondent of The Providence Journal-Bulletin broached the same idea , suggesting " Pacifica " as the name for the state , whereas Mr. Griffiths suggests " State of Pacific . " The chief argument advanced by Mr. Griffiths is that " many people doubtless feel that the aggregate development and population of these two areas do not warrant the powers of four Senators .
