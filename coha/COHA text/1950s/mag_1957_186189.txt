Not all babies have the patience to hold off their wails till birth . Throughout history some restless infants were reported to have cried in the womb , but until relatively modern times doctors and midwives often thought it best not to publicize the fact lest they be accused of witchcraft . Last week in Britain 's Lancet , a doctor described a latter-day occurrence of the phenomenon , known as vagitus uterinus ( from the Latin vagire , to squall ) . <P> One of three attending doctors at Victoria Cottage Hospital in Sidmouth , England assisted a young mother in a difficult labor by passing his hand into the uterus to bring down a leg . During this maneuver , reports Dr. P.M.G. Russell , the three physicians heard " a clear , remote cry very like a baby crying in the next room , but close below our heads . " When a nurse returned to the room , disappointed at having missed the event , the infant obliged with another cry so loud that a doctor put his ear on the mother 's abdomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb . The baby ( a boy ) was delivered safely . <P> There is some danger that such early-crying babies will drown in the womb 's fluid , says Dr. Russell , but this risk is much smaller than the danger of birth trauma that may be caused by attempts to hasten delivery . Considering the long rehearsal and preparation for birth that infants undergo , says Dr. Russell , the surprising fact is that more babies do not begin to wail in the womb .
