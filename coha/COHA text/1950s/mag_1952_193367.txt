" I have not been corrupt , " insisted one honest Shanghai druggist . " I do n't care how long you investigate . You can shoot me if you like , but I am not going to confess . " It did him no good . The " masses present , " said Shanghai 's Communist Liberation Daily , merely became angry ; they demanded his arrest anyway . " Thus was one more stubborn tiger sniffed out and exterminated . " <P> Earsplitting Indictment . Tiger , in China 's current Communist jargon , means corrupt capitalist . But last week , as Red China 's tiger hunt ( TIME , March 17 ) screamed into new heights of shrill persecution , the quarry seemed less like vicious beasts of the jungle than treed and terrified house-cats . Chinese Communism has developed a new weapon to rout out it 's bourgeois enemies , a weapon unthought of by less imaginative dictatorships : trial by sound-truck . Like baying hounds at the foot of a tree , Communism 's sound-trucks last week planted themselves in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to public attention in ear-splitting indictment . Panicked merchants , businessmen and petty public servants raced from their hiding places by the thousand to seek doubtful sanctuary in public confession or to join the hue and cry , and hunt with the hunters . <P> One Shanghai shop assistant last week tried for a while to protect his employer .

Through wars , revolutions and even the Japanese occupation , Chang had prospered , planting his profits in Shanghai real estate and running his business on traditionally paternalistic lines . His seven employees had all been with him since their teens , learning the business thoroughly . After proper education at Communist hands , it made them useful informers .
