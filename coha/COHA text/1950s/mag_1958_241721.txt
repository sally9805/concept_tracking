In the spacious Celebration Hall of Cairo University last week 500 delegates from more than 40 countries rallied under a huge banner showing two hands , one light and one dark , clasped around a torch that lit up the outlines of Asia and Africa . A milling throng of students waved a banner that read DOWN WITH THE EISENHOWER DOCTRINE ; from the gallery , schoolgirls shouted : " No bases-no pacts - no H-bomb ! " <P> Opening the proceedings , Brigadier Anwar el Sadat , Deputy Speaker of the Egyptian National Assembly , rejoiced at prolix length in the new freedom of lands " where once Western wild beasts roamed . " Getting down to the real business of the meeting , an Indian delegate attacked the NATO summit meeting as " a clear indication of the design of the imperialist powers to interfere in Afro-Asian affairs . " Briskly following up that lead , Japan 's Professor Kaoru Yasui warned that the aim of Britain and the U.S. was " to explode atom and hydrogen bombs over the heads of the colored race . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the West was the Afro-Asian Peoples ' Solidarity Conference . Its delegates , sadly enough , were in many cases people of substance and standing in their native lands . The Indian delegation was led by bulky , 71-year-old Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru , a respected social worker and cousin-in-law to India 's Prime Minister . The 45-man Japanese contingent was headed by Tokutaro Kitamura , a prominent banker and Liberal-Democratic member of Japan 's Diet . Among the delegates from the Sudan was Foreign Minister Mohammed Ahmed Mahgoub . <P> No Time for Turkomans . The conference 's origins lay not in Cairo but in India , where 2 years ago a pro-Communist Ihdian M.P . named Anup Singh organized the " Asian Solidarity Committee " to influence the first Afro-Asian conference at Bandung ( TIME , May 2 , 1955 ) . Last year Singh approached Nasser , suggested a conference in Cairo as a suitable sequel to Bandung . It was a play on words . The delegates to the Bandung conference had been official representatives of their nations , many of them heads of their governments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Unofficially , the moving spirits among them represented world Communism and its sympathizers . <P> Singh &; Co. had succeeded in excluding or scaring off irrepressibly anti-Communist Asians . The Philippines refused to send a delegation , no South Koreans were invited . Two Formosans who asked for admission as observers were turned down , as were two Turkoman refugees from the U.S.S.R. But all the Communist nations of Asia were represented in force . So , too , was the Soviet Union , which had dusted off for the occasion its claim to be as much an Asian as a European power .
