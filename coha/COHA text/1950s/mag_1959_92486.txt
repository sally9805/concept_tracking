HRs // Baltimore 0.79 // Pittsburgh 0.83 // NATIONAL LEAGUE // Bone-weary after playing five games in four days ( and losing four of them ) , the San Francisco Giants staggered into Los Angeles on Friday to meet the well-rested Dodgers , their once-comfortable lead shaved to two games . As it turned out the Giants were playing possum . They landed on Dodger Ace Don Drysdale for five runs in the first two innings , coasted in behind the shutout pitching of Sam Jones . It was perhaps the National League 's most important night of the year . Failure of the Los Angeles Dodgers to knock off the Giants in their series opener was the only blight on an otherwise perfect week . Sandy Koufax pitched a splendid game and Johnny Podres a good one against the Phils . When Drysdale collapsed on Friday ( see page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the series resumed on Sunday ( there was an off day Saturday as the pro footballers took over the Coliseum ) the Dodgers were ready again . They beat the Giants 7-6 with two runs in the ninth inning , capitalizing on two errors by San Francisco 's new whiz kid , Willie McCovey . The Milwaukee Braves , with a chance to make up some ground , dropped four out of seven instead . Their big hitters finally broke the home run famine with nine in four days ( three each by Aaron and Adcock ) , but only old faithfuls Spahn and Burdette could pitch well enough to win . Almost forgotten after their disastrous slump in late July , the Pittsburgh Pirates came roaring back into contention with a 15-4 record on the long home stand , treating league leaders and tail-enders alike . Bob Friend won his fourth straight with masterful control ; Vernon Law ( 15-7 ) looked more and more like one of the league 's best ; Smoky Burgess swung a big bat . But the spurt was really triggered by the hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to .300 , surprised almost everybody but himself . " All I needed , " said the Rock , " was a chance to play regularly . " Slumping badly , the Cincinnati Reds managed to extract one victory when Rookie Jim O'Toole pitched a five-hit shutout , struck out 10 Cubs . Explained Manager Fred Hutchinson : " He just plain threw hell out of the ball . " Only Tony Taylor 's hitting ( .390 in last 19 games ) kept the Chicago Cubs from complete collapse as the pitching staff came apart . Ken Boyer was named first St. Louis Cardinal captain since Schoendienst left , promptly fired up the club by extending hitting streak to 19 games . He had ample help from Joe Cunningham , who closed in on Henry Aaron in the batting race , celebrated his 28th birthday with four hits . The Philadelphia Phillies continued to do things no major league team should do , caused Manager Eddie Sawyer to moan : " We make mistakes some of my minor league teams did n't make .

Chi 62-67 , StL 61-72 , Phil 54-79 // AMERICAN LEAGUE // The pennant race was over for six of the eight teams , and all eyes were on Cleveland where the two leaders ran head-on into each other ( see page 31 ) . The Chicago White Sox , choice of most observers because of their poise and remarkable speed and defense , rose to the occasion . With Turk Lown and Gerry Staley brilliant in relief of the weakened pitching staff , the Sox warmed up with three victories over the also-rans , then lit into Cleveland as if the whole season depended on this one series . The Cleveland Indians , riding the crest of an eight-game winning streak which had cut Chicago 's lead at one point to one game , lost their momentum in a hurry . Big hitters ( Colavito , Francona and Power ) failed to come through , and Indian pitchers , who had been toying with noncontenders , could n't get the usually light-hitting Sox out when it counted . Elsewhere , there was a dog fight for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The New York Yankees discovered that their best pitcher was Art Ditmar ( 2.98 ERA ) ; the rest of the high-priced staff ( Ford , Turley , Larsen , etc. ) was miserable . The Detroit Tigers had a so-so week despite their cast of stars ( Frank Lary , first American Leaguer to win 17 games ; Harvey Kuenn , .351 , and Al Kaline , .333 , one-two in the batting race ; Jim Bunning , league leader with 156 strikeouts ; Eddie Yost , a 17-homer , 100-runs-scored leadoff man ) . The Baltimore Orioles did an about-face , came up with good hitting instead of bad , bad pitching instead of good , found the new combination was worse than before , fell from third place to fifth . Continued improvement of the Boston Red Sox was due to hitting from unexpected sources ( Gary Geiger , Pumpsie Green , Dick Gernert ) and a pitching lift supplied by Jerry Casale and Bill Monbouquette . The Kansas City Athletics ' hopes for a first-division berth were kept alive by the .300 hitting of Bill Tuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a big comeback by Bob Cerv ( 26 hits in 65 trips , 16-game hitting streak , club lead in RBIs and home runs ) . The Washington Senators really looked like the old Washington Senators when even the home runs stopped . They produced only three in 11 games , one of which was Harmon Killebrew 's No. 38. // Standings : Chi 80-49 , Clev 75-55 , Det 65-65 , NY 64-66 , Bait 61-66 , Bos 61-69 , KC 59-70 , Wash 52-77// Boxed statistics through Saturday , August 29
