" What the Democratic Party needs , " goes a new saying of Washington coinage , " is a silent Butler . " The reference is to Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Butler , whose month-long butting battles with his party 's leadership in Congress ( TIME , July 20 ) has left the unhappy taste of ashes on many a Democratic regular 's tongue . Last week Hoosier Butler 's noisy rampage against what he feels is a too-moderate course by Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and House Speaker Sam Rayburn took a new turn . Paul Butler phoned Sam Rayburn for an appointment , then jogged up to the Capitol and spent an hour in earnest conversation with Rayburn and Johnson . There was little doubt that his action was in the nature of a peace pilgrimage that included a single serving of crow for a strangely silent Paul Butler . <P> Chairman Butler 's effort to mend things came after a flood of vengeful rumors ( e.g. , that he was trying to steal the presidential nomination ) and a new outbreak of demands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuked Butler for washing party linen in public , and West Coast Democrats were still shooting angry sparks because Butler had deleted praise for congressional Democratic leadership from a letter that California 's Governor Pat Brown had sent in accepting membership on the liberal-hued Democratic Advisory Council . <P> Presumably , Paul Butler munched these specifics along with his crow during his meeting with Rayburn and Johnson , but when newsmen poured into Mr. Sam 's office to look at the bones , everything was tidy and all was sweet harmony . " We agreed , " said Rayburn , " that none of the three of us is trying to be divisive . There was no loud talk , no violent disagreement , no fightin ' and scratchin ' . " Rayburn added that he takes no stock in demands for Butler 's resignation , and that he and Johnson assured Butler that they are true to the Democratic Party 's legislative ideals , " and let the chips and vetoes fall where they may . " And as Paul Butler and smiling Lyndon Johnson nodded agreement , Texan Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we will call him when we have something to tell him , and when he wants to talk with us , he will call us.
