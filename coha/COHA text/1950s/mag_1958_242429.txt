The new German invasion of Europe was at flood tide last week . Only this time , instead of carrying guns , the Germans clutched fistfuls of lire , francs , guilders , dinars , schillings . Some 5,000,000 of them are pouring south and west in an eager tourist flight from the greyer skies and industrial soot of their prosperous native land . " It is the fresh air and sunshine that we like best , " gushed buxom , blonde Use Schultz on the beach at Ostia . " It is so wonderful to feel the sun scorching until it hurts . " In Italy the Germans outnumber American tourists , though they do not outspend them . They are Europe 's No. 1 travelers outside their own borders . <P> Germans this year will spend an estimated $400 million on their European travels . About 30% of them are students who go by bicycle , motorcycle or hitchhike , and often camp out . Another 60% are the middleclass , ranging from teachers to small businessmen , who travel by car , railroad or bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining 10% are the wealthy , the Ruhr industrialists and Frankfurt bankers , who make their rounds with expensive movie cameras , stay in the palace hotels , demand the best and are willing to pay for it . They are even more visible than Americans . The French Riviera , Spain 's Costa Brava and the Balearic Islands no longer satisfy the German wanderlust . Travel bureaus now offer all-inclusive air tours to Rhodes , the Canary Islands , Sicily , the Soviet Union and even a special round trip to Communist China . French and Italian tourist bureaus advertise regularly in German newspapers . <P> In this vacation summer , nearly all the scars of war and memory seem to have faded . Occasionally a Frenchman will take malicious delight in giving a German the wrong directions , or a Dutchman will leave a caf when it fills up with tourists in Lederhosen and Tyrolean hats . In Yugoslavia the Germans are welcome , if only because they assist Yugoslavia 's acutely short consumer-goods market by selling their belongings as they go along .

Of course , " he added , " by this time , they 're practically naked . " <P> The German magazine Bunte Illustrierte recently reported that in France " scarcely any signs of resentment remain , " that in Yugoslavia the tourist " even meets with much kindness , " that in Italy he will be greeted enthusiastically-but should watch his luggage . <P> It is better everywhere , suggests Bunte Illustrierte , never to talk about the war . But , surprisingly , reports Bunte Illustrierte , it is in neutral Sweden that the Germans " generally meet with mistrust . " The old , often-repeated tale of German tourists shocking their hosts by saying they had " come to love " a place while serving as occupiers during the war , is no longer widespread . Tourist marks , like tourist dollars , are much too valued .                   @ @
