Just before his 67th birthday , a bearded , scholarly-looking man suffering from leukoplakia appeared at the clinic of Vienna Rhinologist Marcus Hajek . The patient had a group of hard , smooth white spots on the inside of the jaw ; expecting a trivial operation , he had not mentioned the visit to his family . But the operation went badly-the growth proved cancerous . In response to an alarming phone call , the patient 's wife and daughter rushed to the clinic , found him seated on a kitchen chair with blood all over his clothes . He was too ill to go home . <P> There was no free room or even bed at the clinic , but a bed was improvised in a room already occupied by a cretinous dwarf . While his family was out at lunch , the patient suffered a hemorrhage . He could not call out , but the friendly dwarf noticed his condition and rushed for help . After desperate efforts , the bleeding was stanched . Thus , writes Britain 's Dr. Ernest Jones , a hitherto unhonored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freud . <P> Medical History . Much of the third and final volume of Analyst Jones 's painstakingly researched , lovingly written biography* is taken up with an extraordinary account of Freud 's illness and its effects on his last years . The effects , never before described in such detail , were painful , profound and sometimes bizarre . <P> After the first operation , daughter Anna broke hospital rules and spent the night at her father 's bedside , thus beginning a 16-year vigil during which , often for months at a time , she was always within call . Freud himself was not told that examination of the removed tissues revealed cancer , although more surgery was soon necessary for " an unmistakably malignant ulcer in the hard palate which invaded ... the upper part of the lower jaw and even the cheek . " First , a carotid artery was tied off , and glands beneath the upper jawbone ( some of them already suspiciously enlarged ) were removed . In the second stage of the operation , after slitting the lip and cheek wide open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right side , which threw the nasal cavity and mouth into one . " These frightful operations were performed under local anesthesia . " <P> To shut off the mouth from the nasal cavity and make speech and eating possible , Freud had to wear a " huge prosthesis , a sort of magnified denture or obturator . ' ' This instrument , says Jones , was a horror that Freud and family nicknamed " the monster . " It was painful and difficult to get in or out . In one nightmare scene , neither Freud nor the hovering Anna nor a physician could get it into his mouth , and the surgeon who devised the monster had to be called . When it fitted tightly enough to fulfill its purpose , it caused recurring sores . When it was comfortably loose , Freud sat with his thumb to his face , holding the monster in place .
