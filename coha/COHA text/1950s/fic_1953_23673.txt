The Pen Friend A Story by Wilmer Hamilton Drawings by Tom Knoth I T WAS growing dusk as I sat at my desk , and just as I thought I could not see to write any more Ettie came in with my tea . She laid down the tray on a little table beside me and went . over to the window to draw the curtains . " I 'm afraid we must have the light , " I said , " but not the curtains . I love to look at that sky . " " Yes , sir ! " She was standing motionless before the window , one hand still on the curtain . This meant that she had something she wanted to say : usually she came in and out of my study as silently as a mouse . " It seems a long time since that Thursday ? " I knew she was thinking about the friend . It did indeed seem a long time June , and the bleak rain-sodden landscape at which she was gazing had nothing in common with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to face me . " He 's doing very well , " she said with pride . " I had a letter this morning . " " Did you ? " I was interested . " Yes , and he 's passed the little examination ? so that he can begin teaching , that is ; and the big one will be next summer . He says he 's ever so happy . " " I am very glad to know that , " I said with truth . For a long moment we both thought about him , and then Ettic said , " Thank you , sir ! " and ran noiselessly out of the room , switching on the light as she went . I drank the tea , and ate the buttered toast she had brought me , and as I did so I was seized by a strange impulse : I would put aside the work upon which I was engaged with so much concentration , and write instead the story of the pen friend . I reflected that there were several titles I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course it could have but the one title  --  The Pen Friend . In order that the true inwardness of the matter be appreciated , I must confess that I am old . I have lived a great deal in antiquity and in many ways Athens ( both old and new ) is more familiar to me than London , and the mental processes of the ancients easier ( and often more pleasant ) to follow than those of most moderns . During the last war I was extraordinarily fortunate . in that I happened to possess certain knowledge and certain capacities which proved of use to British Intelligence : I therefore became a troglodyte in my country 's service , working with great secrecy arid complete abandonment to the business in hand , in various underground fastnesses . When in 1946 I became demobilized , that is to say when I came up from underground for good and stepped into the pale autumn sunshine , I found my freedom strange and a little heady . I walked , I remember , through St. James 's Park and was enchanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had aged unduly : six years is of course a long time , especially when those years are war-years . " You 're suffering from reaction , " said my sister , Laetitia . " It 's all that work ' underground , and not taking your leaves properly . Besides , you 're getting on , you know , and you always were a dear old fossil . Have you realized that you will be . sixty-five next birth-day ? " I had not realized it . " What you want , " she went on , " is a large rambling cottage in a small village  --  Sussex , I think  --  with a good garden . Not too far from the British Museum and the Records Office . You will want a spare room or two for people to come and stay , and , of course , you must have someone living in the house to look after you , and a woman from the village to come in every morning and do ' the rough . ' I 'll find it all for you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against every probability . First , she found the rambling cottage with the " good " garden . There is room to think in my study , and room to walk in the garden : there is spaciousness and simplicity , and a pleasing untidiness in all . The woman to do " the rough " presented herself , but Laetitia found Ettie . I read the letter saying Ettie had been " found " with misgiving . Was it possible that a girl like this would settle down in a bachelor establishment such as mine , where young people would seldom come , except perhaps at Christmas-time ? ' Would she take to the austere daily presence in the kitchen : would that presence tolerate her ? Could she put up with me ? I hoped that Laetitia had told her that I was old , dull , taciturn  --  fussy perhaps ; that I could not bear to be distracted , far less disturbed ; and that sometimes I hardly spoke for weeks on end . Did she know that . my visitors , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? Again , I hoped so . We eyed each other warily at our first interview , Ettie and I ; then both decided to trust their all to Laetitia . We did well . The pen friend was already in existence , but it was quite three months before I came to know about him . One kept finding things out about Ettie ; at least Laetitia did , for she is a person in whom it is pleasant to confide . " Do you know , " my sister told me excitedly when she came down soon after Ettie 's arrival , " her name is Hetty , not Ettie  --  short for Henrietta . I only discovered it this morning when she left me a note about the carpenter coming to do those shelves . " " Well , it 's too late to tell me now , " I retorted gloomily . " Surely , you do n't expect me to do anything about it when I have been calling her Ettie for three weeks ? " It was many weeks later that Laetitia said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has this pen friend  --  so much easier than the usual young man  --  boy friend , I should say . The endless walking out can be done by post  --  so economical , too . " " A pen friend ? " I queried . " Where did she get him ? How does one , I mean ? " Laetitia was prim . " She saw an advertisement in a church magazine  --  St. Saviour 's , Pimlico . It said he was lonely and a Christian , and would someone write to him : so she did . " " Good Lord ! What do they write about ? " " I don't. know , " admitted Laetitia , " hut they write ' regular . ' " " But . who is he ? And why did you never tell me about him ? " " I did , when I was here for that Point-toPoint , but . you were n't listening . Anyway , I know more now . He is twenty-one and an orphan . He never knew his mother and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool . He was born there , and he has a job there now . " " Why does he say he 's a Christian ? It 's like that woman  --  Mrs. . . . you know  --  the woman we found wandering round . Hadrian 's Villa , who insisted on showing you a. certificate saying she was sane ! " I replied , in mild protest . " You and I do n't go about telling people we are Christians . " " Oh , I dare say he had to put that to get the advertisement into a church magazine , " said Lactitia comfortably . " How we laughed about that woman ! I forget her name too . " T IIE months passed happily : both the cottage and Ettie were a great success Together they provided a wholly un-deserved refuge in a distraught world . Who could have guessed that this girl , barely twenty-one , would achieve the miracle of contentment ? The presence in the kitchen had softened perceptibly , revealing unexpected lore in the arts of housewifery in general and fruit-bottling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in imparting to Ettie : my sister did the rest . I was able to invite the most pernickety of fellow-fossils for a meal or a night , or a six-weeks ' stay . Laetitia 's own visits became longer and more frequent . The pen friend also prospered . We came to know a great deal about him . His father , it seemed , had had a small tobacconist 's shop in a poor quarter of Liverpool . When this was demolished by a bomb and its owner killed , during the worst raid the city ever had , the son sustained only a leg injury ( as a result of which one leg would always be shorter than the other ) , He had been sent to an institution of sorts on the Welsh coast to recuperate , where he had suffered great loneliness . In fact , he had always been lonely , according to Ettie , " being an only child , as it were . " He must have been fourteen or fifteen at that time , I suppose . Then , at the darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young French priest who was snatching a week 's holiday from his Church Settlement in the Liverpool Docks . He offered the boy not only friendship but invaluable assistance : in short , at the end of the week , when the priest returned to the Settlement he took the boy with him . The Fathers were kindness itself and an arrangement was made whereby he should work for them , receiving in return his board and lodging and systematic education  --  lie had , of course , been to school up to the time his father had been killed . The education devised by the good Fathers included night school , so that in due course he was able to obtain a position in a shipping firm in Liverpool . All went well until the summer of 1945 when he must have been eighteen or nineteen , and then tragedy overtook him . The young French priest contracted cerebro-spinal meningitis , on the very eve of the summer holiday that the two had planned to spend walking together , and died within a few days . The boy was naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fathers , he received a week 's extension of his holiday from the office , and went to London to stay in one of the religious houses known to them . He had never visited the capital and it was evidently thought that a complete change of scene would be a good thing . It did not prove to be so : the boy now found the religious atmosphere stifling ; he hated London ; his loneliness became intolerable . He wanted only to return to work . In the common-room of the presbytery  --  or whatever  --  where he spent his last evening in London , his hand fell on the magazine of St. Saviour 's Church , Pimlico . He turned over the pages idly until he saw a column headed PEN FRIENDS . Lonely people like himself could , it seemed , describe their situation in a few words , and the editor of the magazine ( who was also the Vicar of the Church ) would insert the lines free of charge in the next number . He snatched up a pen and a scrap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would like to write to lonely girl . Christian . He added his name and his Liverpool address , begged an envelope and a stamp , and posted the letter there and then . This was the advertisement Ettie had seen  --  quite by chance , in the sitting-room of her then employer who lived in the parish of St. Saviour 's , Pimlico . She had answered it with dispatch  --  and the pen friend was hers ! " How long does it go on ? " I asked my sister one day in early spring , when we were inspecting the crocuses in the garden . " What happens next ? " The only cloud ( no larger than a man 's hand ! ) in my own personal patch of sky was the secret fear that the pen friend might turn into the boy friend with great suddenness , and whisk Ettie off to Liverpool . Laetitia considered . " I suppose they meet , " she hazarded . " It does not seem to have occurred to either of them to exchange photographs ! I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but wait . It could be so much better if she married Percy , but she 's so completely wrapped up in the pen friend that it makes her unapproachable , somehow . " Percy is the gardener . He was a " Desert Rat " and has a fine war record . I supposed him to be about thirty  --  possibly too old for Et tic . I said this to my sister . " Rubbish ! " she retorted . So the pen friend remained ever with us  --  part of the family , as it were . I remember , I went into my club in London one day , to be greeted by an old colleague , a Fellow of All Souls . " How 's the pen friend ? " he boomed in his penetrating baritone . When I told Laetitia , she laughed . " If only she were n't so pretty ! " " Is she pretty ? " 1 asked.AND so it went on for another year . May came in again , that loveliest of all months in the garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace outside the study . Having set it down she lingered : this was so unusual that . I knew something portentous was coming . time ? " " May I speak to you , sir  --  some help you , " Why not now ? How can I Ettie ? " coming to London next " Oh , sir ! He 's month and wants me to meet him . " It was the first time she had ever spoken to me about the pen friend : hitherto , all the news had been saved up for Laetitia. felt promoted  --  from employer to friend . " That 's very exciting , " I said lamely . " You 'd go , if you was me ? " " Most certainly . " There was a long pause . " You see , I 'm afraid he 'll be above me  --  I sha n't be good enough . " " ' Courage is an obligation  --  perhaps the only obligation , ' " I quoted She was relieved . " It 's fated , too , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular for over three years now , and this is ' it . ' " " This is either the end of something , or the beginning of something , " I agreed . " The saute thing can not go on . " She took my meaning . " Oh , thank you , sir ! That 's it . Well , it 's the first week in June , he 's coming , and I could take my ' day ' ? that 'll he the Thursday . ' ' " Will it ? " I said absently . " You see , sir , he 's educated  --  you would n't know . His letters are lovely , and he knows Latin  --  having been with the Holy Fathers when he was younger . I wondered . . . . " I wondered too . I wondered just how much Latin the pen friend knew . I looked at this graceful slip of a girl  --  the pale intelligent face , the big gray eyes that seemed always to catch the light of the sun  --  or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? it must be admitted  --  unruly hair ? Would he know enough to call her his " golden girl " ? Almost certainly he would not . And he was probably an appalling prig , anyway . " Do n't worry , Ettie . Run along and write and tell him you 'll come on the Thursday . " She went . Of course , Laetitia was " thrilled " ? as they say . She put her forthcoming visit forward a week in order to assist in preparing suitable raiment for the wonderful occasion .. " Weil , what 's she been saying to you ? " demanded my sister , as I drove her home from the station on arrival . " Very little . They are to meet under the dock at Victoria Station at ten minutes to eleven in the morning . He will then take her somewhere  --  lie has not said where  --  in the afternoon , and put her on the 7:21 train back here . Oh , and she 's to wear a white rose pinned to her dress , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing those white Banksias are just coming out . " " Of all the ridiculous things , " snorted Laetitia . " Why should she wear it ? He should wear something , so that . if she does not . like the look of him she can escape . Why did n't you tell her ? " I had no excuse . The days- passed slowly . A simple gray linen dress took shape under my sister 's watchful eye , stitched on her sewing machine : a yellow straw hat arrived out of the blue . So that when " the Thursday " came at last , Ettie attired in these , looked  --  in Peter Cheyney 's phrase ? " good enough to cat ! " There was a slight heat haze when she set off for the early train : it promised to he a perfect June day . Laetitia arid I had our evening meal early that night , so that everything might be tidied up before Ettie 's return . We felt that it would not be fitting that so great a day should end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would come into the study and tell us about it . The sun had set in a turquoise and saffron sky of exceptional beauty , and it was almost dark when we heard the bus grind to a standstill outside our gate , and a moment later a step on the flagged path which Ied to the front door . But the step was not at all like Ettie 's : it was slow and faltering . I went and opened the door for her but she did not come in at once . She stood quite still , her head drooping a little . She looked ? stricken . Laetitia Followed me out of the study and took a step forward . It was as though her look of gentle inquiry touched off a spring , for Ettie suddenly sprang forward and fled past us and up the stairs , like a frightened animal . " What can it be ? " whispered Laetitia anxiously when we were back in the study . " Do you think ' he can be married ? " It seemed hardly likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . And then a dreadful sound reached us , violating the peace of the night  --  the sound of heart-broken sobbing . We let it go on for a little , and then my sister disappeared in search of aspirin . Soon after that there was a silence , and Iaetitia came back . " She 's wearied out , poor little soul . She 's been under a great strain , but I ca n't imagine what it can have been . She says that everything is all right , but she is so tired , and her feet are blistered with walking . She has gone to bed . Oh , dear ! What can it be ? " We agreed that we must not question her in the morning , but just wait and . hope she would tell us . She did not tell us  --  then . The Morning brought calm  --  that strange , clear calm that sometimes follows storm and disaster ; thoughts lay strewn on the surface of all our Minds like wreckage on the sea . Ettie was composed and aloof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupation with detail that was rather painful to watch . They had walked in the park , she said , and then had been to " Madam Two-swords . " Yes , it had been very hot all the time . I could not have believed Laetitia capable of so restrained and sensitive a perception . Nothing was said but confidence remained unimpaired and absolute . M sl " SISTER stayed on for a few days and then had to return to London . When the time came , I took her to the station for an early train , and when I got back the house seemed empty and forlorn without her . The June sunshine had given way to cloudy skies and soft incessant rain . One saw the color in the garden as though through a coarse veiling . When Ettie came to fetch away my tea tray , she lingered . " It 's lonely without Madam , " she said . " She is good . " I felt that the huge raindrops falling on the terrace outside might be matched with something of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Suppose , Ettie , " I suggested , " you were to sit down over there for a minute and tell me what happened on Thursday . Just begin at the beginning : what happened when you arrived at Victoria station ? " I do not often order . her to do anything : I have no need . Also , it was obvious that her feelings were too poignant and . too insistent , to be denied expression much longer . She hardly demurred , and sat down on a corner of an old sea-chest I have , her hands folded in her lap . " Well , I arrived early  --  the train did , so I went and tidied up a bit . It was nearly ' ten-to ' when I got back to the clock . " " Yes ? " " There was about , but no corner by ourselves . The tea was nice . We did n't say much , except as how it was going to he a lovely day , and that it was getting hot already . It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very tall . And then he said , would I like to walk in Hyde Park , and after that we could have a bite of something and go to Madam Two-swords , and had I ever been ? And I said , no , I never had . " So he asked for his check and we went out . We walked from the station up to Hyde Park ? Grosvenor Gardens , do n't they call it , or is it Grosvenor Place ? " " I am never quite sure , myself , " I admitted guiltily . " Anyhow , we walked up there and into the park . And them we walked all round it twice , Kensington Gardens and all , and never in the shade . Oh , it was hot , sir , and I got so tired at last that I said , could we sit down  --  by die Marble Arch this was , and he said , yes , we could . We sat on chairs where you pay , not on a free seat , though I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did n't either . He just looked at me  --  friendly-like  --  once or twice , and smiled . " " And then ? " " Oh , and then we went into the Edgcware Road and found a Milk Bar  --  help-yourself , it was  --  and he got sausages and mash , with a hot raisin-pudding to follow . " " That must have been rather heating ? " " It was and it was n't  --  that is , I did not notice it much , I was too hot already for one thing . We did n't stay long , as it was n't a very nice place . " I believed her . " After that , we walked to Madam Two-swords , and Oh , sir , it is a long way ! All in the sun . But nothing to when you get there ! ' Ave you been ? Its ' arrowing , all of it , and them ' orrors . . . . " She shuddered ' uncontrollably . Ettie usually has magnificent control of her aitches ( except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got away when young , good luck to it ! ) : only in moments of great emotion recollected in tranquillity , do they escape her . As to Madame Tussaud 's abiding memorial , I could sympathize entirely ; I could still re-member my - own fright when I was taken there as a child . " And inside  --  the ' eat  --  like an oven it was , and with those faces looking at you from every side . Even he got hot then  --  fair glistening with sweat , he was . " I glanced at her sharply . She was blushing ? the deep ugly color slowly spreading over her face and neck . It was a blush of-. shame  --  shame at the remembrance of her own reaction to some fear or horror . I had seen such a blush before , on an innocent young face in the war  --  and hated it . And then the truth suddenly flashed upon me . How could I have been so dim-witted , I wondered . . . . But Ettie was going on . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out and walked to Baker Street , to a little restrone in aside alley that he knew , where we could sit down and have a cup of tea . It was cool inside , and you could walk through to the back where there was a table by an open window . The lady was nice too : she knew the Holy Fathers in Liverpool , having done for them at some time , so she was nice . And the window looked on to a yard , and there was a rose tree in a pot there that you could see from the table . She , the lady , said no one would interrupt us as it was a slack time . " I sighed with relief . Ettie took me up . " Yes , indeed , sir , I was glad . It was then he talked . . . for the first time. : ' There was a long pause now : the worst was over . EGG 1:11E , " I said , " I am right in thinking your pen friend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ettie 's turn to be relieved  --  I had guessed . She nodded . " And not only that , sir . He was n't just yellow , or chocolate , he was  --  he was . .. . " " He was a Negro , was he not ? " Again she nodded  --  swallowed , and went on . " And he wore a very light suit  --  bright , I mean  --  a real ' royal ' it was . Everyone looked . " " I know . " " Well , as I was saying , he talked for the first time . " She hurried on . " He said he knew he had n't ought to have done it  --  put in an ad saying he 'd like a pen friend , he meant . It was very wrong of him but it was the loneliness that made him . He told me about the French Father who died  --  how he was a holy angel to him and taught him how to live  --  those were his words , sir , ' taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most people would n't be your friend if you were  --  well , black  --  only the ones you did n't want . Yougot quite used to it so that you did n't mind usually , but if anything went wrong , like the French Father dying , it was rather bad . It would be if you come to think of it , sir , would n't it ? " " It would indeed , " I agreed gravely . " So he thought if he could find a pen friend , it would n't matter his being different  --  they need never know , and he could be himself , like he 'd been with the French Father . So he got me , through the advertisement . He said it had made all the difference  --  writing regular to someone . He said a man needed someone to put first in his thought . Those were his very words again , sir , ' someone to put first in your thought. ? She twined her fingers together in her lap and then looked up at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought afterward : it was a beautiful way of saying it , was n't it , sir ? " Again , 1 could only agree with her . " Then he told me he 'd been studying all these years , night school and the like , and with the Fathers once a week , all along of an idea the French Father had had , of how he might go to a college in America , just for  --  Negroes . " " Not Tuskegee ? " I queried . It was a shot in the dark . " Why , yes , sir , that 's it  --  that was the name . Fancy your knowing it ! " " It is fatuous , but there are many others . " " Well , the French Father had thought he could be a teacher there , among his own people . There are a lot of them in America  --  nearly fifteen million . But there 's injustice and loneliness , even then . It 's not nearly as bad as it used to be once , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they are his people , it seemed right that he shotild be the person to do it . He got quite excited telling me , sir . He said people did not know how grand the work was , nor how it was getting on . " Then two months ago it was all settled , and he 's going . The Fathers arranged it in memory of the French Father who died . Is n't it lovely ? He can go there , and finish learning himself , and then perhaps he can go to being a professor one day , at the college . He talked like he writes , sir . You go on listening . " I nodded . " Then he said that for a long time now he 'd felt he was n't acting straight with me . He said I would n't have written as I did if I 'd known , would 1 ? 1 looked him straight in the face then and told him the truth  --  I could n't lie to him , could I , sir ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smiled , kind of to himself . " So he 'd asked me to meet him , though he knew what it meant , just so that he could remember what I looked like when he went to America , and did n't know anyone . He gave me his pledge that he would never try and see me again , and of course , he would n't expect me to be his pen friend any more . He asked me to forgive him . " " And what did you say , Ettie ? " " I said . . " She was defiant now . " I said that as far as I could see there was nothing to forgive , and that as to being his pen friend , I was that , was n't I , and I could n't see why we should n't write any more  --  only I thought just sometimes , not regular . And he said that was nice of me . That was all he said , sir , but I shall always remember the friendly way he smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes in America . He said there was a time about eighty years ago , when most Negroes could hardly read or write , and today very few could n't . Oh it was queer , sir , so queer listening to him ! I kept pinching myself to make sure it was really me . You 'd never have dreamed it , would you ? And then he told me all about a great Negro who worked at the college he 's going to  --  I have the name here on a bit of paper where he wrote it for me  --  George Washington Carver , he was . There 's a book about him  --  he knew all about plants . He wanted me to read it . " " I have read it , and it is a very remarkable book . Would you like me to get it for you , Ettie ? " " Oh , could you , sir ? And then when I write I could mention things in it . " Our attention became momentarily distracted by a sound outside in the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been working most of the day , out of the rain . " There 's no harm in having a pen friend , is there , sir ? Not if you do n't write regular , only sometimes ? It 's different to other things ? separate , I mean . You 've no call to give up your pen friend , have you , sir ? " Would Percy understand , I wondered . He had seen a good deal of carnage and not a little suffering . I thought Ettie 's plea for her pen friend would melt the stoniest heart . I felt I might be quoted , so I considered my reply carefully . Memories came and went : cynicisms presented themselves , only to be discarded . I searched all literature , it seemed , for a precedent , and found none . " Nor I said at last . " And I did all right , do you think , sir ? I tried very hard not to let him see . . .. " This one was easier . " You behaved like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased : " Oh , no , sir ! " " And . now I think you should go and give Percy his tea . " A brief , " Thank you , sir ! " and she li ! as gone . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ,
