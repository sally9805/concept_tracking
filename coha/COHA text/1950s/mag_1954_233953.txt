To the thousands of Chinese students and refugees now living in the U.S. , the mansion in Manhattan 's East 60s called China House is more than a meeting place and a touch of home . For the last 2 years , the China Institute in America has also been running a placement bureau , has so far been able to find jobs of various kinds for more than 700 expatriate Chinese . But last week the institute sadly reported that its task has only begun . Of the 6,000-odd refugees , hundreds are aging intellectuals whose plight is desperate and whose talents are going to waste . <P> Over the years , only a fraction of the older ones have been able to find work in their own fields . Today , 111 U.S. colleges and universities have Chinese teachers , and the Army Language School at Monterey , Calif , employs 76 . The engineers and doctors usually get jobs , and so do most of the scientists . But the lawyers , diplomats , economists , executives and government officials are in fields that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over again , most eke out a living at menial jobs . <P> Last week the institute 's placement department announced a plan by which the U.S. can make use of at least some of this wasted talent . It hopes to raise enough money to place and support 30 intellectuals a year at small colleges that might otherwise be unable to afford the luxury of a foreign professor . So far , 59 colleges have written in to say they would welcome the idea . Meanwhile , the institute 's list remains a roster of tragedy : a onetime embassy charge d'affaires who now works as a clerk in a garment district storehouse , a political scientist whose only U.S. job has been as a cashier in a tenth-rate restaurant , a banker who is now a janitor , and two former ambassadors , one of whom scrapes along as an assistant librarian . The other : " unemployed . "
