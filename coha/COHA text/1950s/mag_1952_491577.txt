Z6 Jerry Nusbaum and an Arab friend . Jerry 's businesses in Casablanca include import and export , long-haul trucking , mining and house building . He employs more than 160 people , most of them Arabs . I WANT to run this convoy from Casablanca to Dakar and across the Sahara to Atar , Mauritania , " Jerry said to me . " Five big trucks , carrying spare parts , Diesel oil , water , food : for the drivers , and plenty of cargo . A special escort plane keeping radio communication with me here in Casa , ready to drop repair equipment. , medical supplies  --  anything that might be needed during the fifteen-day desert crossing . Two round trips a month . A tough job , but it should gross over $50,000 a year . " " When will you start ? " " Do n't know yet . We 've got to cross French military territory , and the French keep talking about ' security . ' We could get plenty of goods to the people in French West and Equatorial Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French do n't see it that way . " Jerry shrugged . " Oh , never mind . Someday I 'll do it . " Jerry is just the man to do it too . Jerome S. Nusbaum is an energetic , dark-haired fellow with a spark-plug personality that has not been stymied by nine years in the hot , humid climate of Casablanca . Jerry was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on February 15 , 1916 . He speaks French and Arabic , knows the country well and has friends everywhere , which is important in French Morocco , where he is up against French bureaucracy , Arabic lethargy and strong American competition . Jerry does n't mind the competition . The crowded , noisy streets of downtown Casa are filled with the disconnected sounds of Africa , but inside the one-story , white-stucco building on Rue Georges Mercie bearing the sign J. S. NUSBAUM , IMPORT ? EXPORT ? TRANSPORTS TOUTES DIRECTIONS American . free enterprise is the theme song . Jerry came here as a first lieutenant in the United States Air Forces Air Transport Command after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 8 , 1942 . He had entered the Army before Pearl Harbor , in March , 1941 , as a private in the artillery . He was sent to the Air Forces ' OCS in Miami and in 1942 went to Central Africa and Egypt . He came to Casa on a temporary assignment as intelligence expert . Like many other Americans , Jerry became fascinated by the organized bedlam of Casa , which was then the Allies ' biggest supply base in North Africa . Millions of tons were being unloaded in the harbor , ships docked by the hour , cranes rattled , loud-speakers blared orders and trucks drove off . Now the Arabs are Big Operators Too Ti ' was a fine demonstration of the American 1 genius for logistics . The Americans showed the sleepy " Ayrabs " how to do things in a big way . The people of Morocco liked what they saw of America . They would crowd around the busy , efficient men in their fast-moving vehicles . They would stare at the displays of American goods behind the large glass windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American goods swept the city and its hinterland . American cigarettes , ice cream , soft . drinks , chocolate , candy , popcorn , breakfast foods and stockings were in demand . Anything went , as long as it was American . Jerry and his fellow soldiers , in turn , liked what they saw of Morocco . A sunny , wide-open country , comparing in size , climate and topography with the state of California . Almost 10,000,000 people , increasing at the rate of 170,000 a year  --  a terrific new market for American goods . " I was willing to bet on Casa , " Jerry says now . " When the war was over , I stayed on . " Jerry 's bet paid off . In 1907 Casa was a laiy fishing port with 10,000 inhabitants . Today it has a population of 600,000 and is still growing . Its perpetually congested port now handles more than 6,000,000 tons a year . A new breakwater , dry dock and a transversal jetty are under construction , facilities for handling general cargo are being improved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three miles of docks , fifty electric cranes , warehouses with 75,000 square meters of floor space . Employment in Moroccan industries went up from 7000 people in 1924 to 340,000 last year . Bank deposits have soared from 31,786,000,000 francs on December 31 , 1946 , to 93,617,000,000 on March 31 , 1951 . All over Casa , eighteen-story-high buildings , North Africa 's only skyscrapers , are under construction . Steel is expensive here and most building is done by reinforced concrete poured into molds . Even buildings in the blueprint stage have already rented all future space , at rates not much below rentals in American metropolitan areas . Much of the expansion has been financed by French flight capital , which is said to have come in at a yearly rate of more than $30,000,000 . Jerry had only a few thousand dollars when he started out here in business at war 's end . He did n't speak the local languages then , had no connections and knew little about the market . He had gone to school in Pittsburgh and had worked there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a job with the Government Printing Office in Washington . But his lack of local experience was matched by an abundance of confidence . Taking advantage of his veteran 's priorities he bought up the contents of an entire United States Army field where surplus and salvage goods were stored . " I moved my tiny office into a shack right at the edge of the Army field and started to sell America , " he now remembers . Jerry and the other boys ? more than a hundred of them  --  moved in at the right moment . Morocco needed everything : tea , sugar , fats , oils , foodstuffs , machinery , agricultural equipment , nylons , refrigerators , automobiles , cheap cottons . Prior to the second World War , Morocco had imported most consumer goods from France , which , since the Treaty of Fez in 1912 , holds a protectorate over the sultan 's Empire Cherifien . There had been no native Moroccan industries , and local raw materials had to be sent to Algeria and France to be processed . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Morocco . And French importers in Casa had no dollars to buy American goods , since foreign currency was being allocated to them only for goods " indispensable to the Moroccan economy . " On the other hand , the American traders had dollars from back home or could get them in nearby Tangier , which has a free , unrestricted-currency market . The standard of living of the Moslems  --  Arabs and Berbers ? is low and most of the imported goods had to be cheap . American mass-production methods were able to supply the much-needed low-priced goods . It was a great time . All over Casa neon lights began to advertise American brands . Americans set up bottling plants for American soft drinks , sold American candies , introduced American ice cream , opened salesrooms with fluorescent lights , displaying household appliances that fascinated the veiled Moorish ladies . By the time his surplus-goods business tapered off , in 1946 , Jerry Nusbaum had gathered more money , valuable experience , new friends and his current downtown office , and he began to import : sugar from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India , and later from Germany ; tires from America ; mining machinery and electrical equipment from America ; coffee from Brazil ; tea from China , and cheese from Holland . These goods still account for most of Jerry 's import business . Ten-Ton Trucks With Family Names ! J ERRY 'S export business has never amounted to much . " I send some fats to the soapmakers in Tangier and export hides and minerals to the States , " he says . " Trade here has mostly been a one-way road . Besides imports , there is a lot of local trade . I act as a sort of broker , but I do n't take commissions . I buy and sell outright ? anything from carbide and grains to goats ' hair and building materials . I have my own warehouse and store a lot of stuff there , always hoping that prices will go up . " By 1947 , with his import and export business well under way , Jerry began to look out for other green pastures . When he was offered a surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew nothing about trucking . But Karl Humphries , a fellow veteran who had brought in from America three secondhand busses and was successfully running a bus line between Casa , Marrakech and Agadir , advised him to go into the trucking business . Jerry decided that there was a future in long-distance hauling . He got a couple of French drivers . When they did n't work out , he hired Arabs . Everybody said he was crazy . Did n't he know that the Arabs would ruin the equipment , that they were lousy drivers and had no split-second co-ordination ? Today Jerry owns five ten-ton trucks , named after members of his family  --  everything must have a name in Casa  --  and driven by Messrs . Cherki , Mahmoud , Brahim , et al . Jerry trained them himself . UnPHOTOGRAPHY BT EUGENE KAMMER 11 ? N like local French employers , he does n't just tell the Arabs what he wants done , but explains to them why he wants to have it done . As a result , Jerry thinks that his Ara/Ca:take better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months some of them were promoted , according to Jerry 's private rank system , from " greasers " to " second mechanics " to " first mechanics " to " drivers . " Each truck is manned by a driver and a mechanic . " I do n't pay them a monthly salary , " Jerry told me . " Instead the two men on each truck share ten per cent of all gross receipts for the hauling done by their vehicle . Since a truck grosses an average of 1,400,000 francs a month , the two men share some $400 between them . The average truck driver 's salary here is 30,000 francs . You can see why my men like their jobs . They have to be good though . Where they drive , they wo n't find service stations and garages . They must be able to change pistons , weld radiators and perform practically any other repair job . Sometimes they run out of parts in the middle of nowhere , and I have to send the stuff after them . On the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qwq merchants and goes to their luxurious houses for Arab dinners  --  pigeon pie , boiled , broiled and roast chicken , roast sheep with raisins , fruit , various cakes and tea . On the whole , business in Casa is pretty much like back home in America . " There is a healthy , competitive struggle , " Jerry says . " Some Americans in Casa are doing better and others are doing worse , although the folks back home seem to think that we all make millions overnight . Quite a few boys came out here after the war and thought they could make a killing . Somehow these get-rich-quick schemes did n't work out . The fast operators went back home even faster and broker . Only the guys with stamina and know-how stay on . " - Jerry and the other Americans in Casa sometimes talk , in wistful voices , of the good old days " when everything as free . " According to Article 14 of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship which one James R. Leib , " agent of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 16 , 1836 , with the Sultan of Morocco , " the commerce with the United States shall be on the same footing as is the commerce with Spain , or as that with the most favored nation for the time being ; and their citizens shall be respected and esteemed , and have full liberty to pass and repass our country and seaports , whenever they please and without interruption . " This treaty , ratified by Congress on January 28 , 1837 , is still in force . American citizens , residing temporarily or permanently in Morocco , are still subject only to the United States consular court in Casablanca . John H. Madonne , the American consul general , is the court 's presiding judge ; one of the consulate 's officers , who happens to be a member of the bar of California , is the prosecutor . Mr. Madonne 's two " assessors " ? associate justices who act as a combination of judges and jury  --  are picked by lot from a list of forty reputable United States citizens living in Casa which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An American may be " assessor " one day and defendant the next . If the three judges agree , there is no appeal ; otherwise ? and in all cases involving capital offenses  --  an appeal is directed to the American legation in Tangier . The court follows the laws of the District of Columbia , which creates occasional loopholes , since D.C. laws could n't have foreseen disputes involving Moroccan traffic regulations or French currency rules . The privileged commercial status of the Americans in Morocco as members of " the most favored nation , " and the good old days ended abruptly on December 30 , 1948 , when the protectorate government announced that the era of free trade was over and a rigid system of import controls was established . Up to then , all imports had 128 February 13. 1952 been free . Henceforth imports would be subject to licensing . There would be two types of import . licenses : ( 1 ) for imports " with official allocation of foreign exchange " ? this includes goods bought with ECA credits and shipments from soft-currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocation of exchange , " among them coffee , green tea  --  the Moslems ' national ter* drink  --  milk , sugar , capital equip- ? ment  --  especially machinery and spare parts , trucks , generators  --  cement , ferrous and nonferrous metals , heavy tires and lubricants . On January 13 , 1950 , the French , after some prodding from Washington , reluctantly added pharmaceutical products , tires for passenger cars , raw cotton , raw jute , cigarettes and raw material for soft drinks to the list of goods for which licenses would be granted without official allocation of foreign exchange  --  goods so important to the Moroccan economy that they could n't be kept out . The French alleged that they had to set up all the new restrictions at the request of ECA , which had asked them to stabilize the franc . The effect of the decrees brought . drastic changes for the American businessmen in Morocco . The need for American goods was as great as ever , but many of the goods were now unobtainable . The State Department gave its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , voting for the Connally amendment to the 1950 ECA appropriation , said that ECA funds must not go to a country which itself , or in its dependent areas , has violated a treaty with the United States , " except for balance-of-payments reason . " The French contended that the restrictions were necessary to protect French currency from a further dollar drain and thus did n't fall under the Connally amendment . Then Congress voted for the Hickenloo per amendment , according to which no European country might , receive any aid if a dependent had violated a treaty with the United States for any reason . Thereupon the French took the matter to the International Court of Justice at The Hague , which has n't handed down its decision yet . The American businessmen in Casa claim that the State Department should n't have agreed to the French decrees , since an international treaty can not be abrogated by executive action . When I asked Jerry about the effects of the restrictions , he said , " No doubt ? we could import a lot more than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still some vestiges of favoritism for local sons , but the French are as fair as can be expected , considering that we are foreigners . Since the beginning of the Inter-European Payment Plan the pressure has eased . The French have been fair in granting foreign exchange . Imports from the dollar zone are still restricted , hut , then , those restrictions concern everybody . We Americans here are still lucky . We 're getting justice before an American court . The local courts are often staffed with appointees instead of jurists . You never know what 's going to happen there . Sometimes it is justice vendue ( justice sold ) rather than justice undue ( justice rendered ) . " Of the 100 veterans who started out in business here at the same time as Jerry , only a few are still around : Karl Humphries , the bus-line operator ; Lawrence Craig from New York , importing ; Bob Harper from St. Louis , trucking and importing ; Jack Bohana , New York , a lawyer ; and some others . amE ; Many members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the present restrictions , an American businessman in Morocco still has certain advantages over a businessman in the States . For one thing , he pays Moroccan income taxes , which are much lower than American taxes . He is exempt from social-security payments on his employees ' salaries . Labor IS cheaper . An unskilled laborer gets a dollar a day ; a good secretary can be hired for $60 a month . In his home an American can afford the luxury of servants . Jerry lives with his wife Viviane , a pretty Jewish-Moroccan girl from Casa whom be had met and married here In 1944 , and their three children  --  Jimmy , six ; Betty , three ; and nine-month-old Franklin Serge ; all Casablanca-born ? in a modern villa at Pierre Simonet Avenue . Jimmy speaks English with his father , French with his mother and Arabic with the servants . The house cost Jerry 6,000,000 francs in 1946 , or $25,000 , since the dollar was then worth 240 francs . The Nusbaums have three servants ; an excellent Arab chef , who gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paid twelve dollars a month . But the cost of living has gone up 30 per cent in the past year , and on the whole living in Casa is not much cheaper than in the States , I went out to Jerry 's house one afternoon recently . Some streets in the neighborhood were not yet finished and had no sidewalks , reminding me of the newer sections of Los Angeles . There was the same jumble of half-finished homes , weedy lots , wet plaster , real-estate signs and new walls . Most houses were built in modern , functional style ; no one in this Moorish city builds Moorish-style houses as they do in Los Angeles . Jerry 's house is American all right , from the screens on the windows to the ice-water bottle in the refrigerator . " We live as American here as the folks at home , " Jerry said to me . He sounded a little touchy . " You get more conscious out here of what America means to you than if you live there and take it all for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said I understood perfectly . " All that silly talk of our having outgrown America ! " he said angrily . " Gosh , I have n't even been to Paris , yet it 's only four hours by plane . Back home they go to all sorts of foreign-style restaurants . Here we do n't eat couscous and other exotic dishes . We 're happy with hamburger and strawberry jam . In 1947 I took my wife home and we stayed a few weeks with the family in Pittsburgh and New York . They urged me to stay . They said I had been away too long , become ' cosmopolitan . ' That 's the bunk ! " Jerry 's house has become an unofficial community center for many Americans in Casa  --  veterans , businessmen , consular employees , Air Force people . The talk is mostly of civic activities and charity work . In spite of his diversified business interests , Jerry finds time for charity work . His idea of a perfect middle age is to retire early from business and devote his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of Casablanca 's American Legion poet , and founder , president and dynamo of The American Community of Morocco , a charitable organization , whose 100 members raise among themselves more than $12,000 a year . The funds serve to aid stranded Americans and local people who have no other recourse , to repatriate people , to purchase locally unavailable medicines in the States , to pay hospital bills and to distribute at Christmastime toys and candy among 6000 Arab and French orphans in Casa . In 1950 Jerry and some of his friends contributed $5000 toward the upkeep of the American school in Tangier . This school  --  the only one in Morocco which iS open to children without regard to race and religion ? now has seventy-two pupils : American , Arab , British , ezecb , French , Greek , Hungarian , Jew- ish , Latvian , Maltese , South African and Spanish boys and girls who pay five dollars a month , or nothing if they ca n't afford it , and are getting a real American education . The school is located in a rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by private contributions from Americans in Tangier , Casablanca and in the States , who raised $16,000 . Later the Cord Foundation paid the rent , the United ? tates Information Service took care of the teachers ' salaries , and private contributions made up for the test of the overhead . ? On my last day in Casa , Jerry took nie to the Societe Musulmane de Bienfaisance , Casablanca 's only Arabic orPhanage . Its president , is Hadj Hamad i FI Mokri , the pasha of Rabat , who supervises the orphanage , with the help of twelve Arab directors . The orphanage , a converted stable , houses 600 children aged from three months to twenty years and gets every year about $90,000 out of the protectorate 's budget . But since it costs now at least $100,000 a year to run the place , the rest must be paid by private contributions . Some Arab merchants donate foodstuffs , but there is little social consciousness among the Arabs , and the orphanage has had a hard time getting along . In 1950 Jerry heard about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function at the orphanage , Which is strictly an Arab affair , he and his American friends went into action . They raised money and bought several hundred pairs of shoes and medical supplies in the States , which they donated to the orphanage . Jerry talked to the local representative of the American Joint Distribution Committee , Who came through with 400 pounds of Powdered milk , several cases of powdered eggs , cheese and butter . " It was the first time that the kids tasted cheese and butter , " Jerry said . 129 " Usually they live on soup , vegetables , bread , and get a little meat three times a week . Of course , if we tried to help all the destitute kids in this town , we would need ten times more space and money . " The Arab kids at the orphanage looked cleaner and better fed than most children roaming the streets of the medina ? the native town  --  where they sleep on the ground and steal a little food . They greeted Jerry enthusiastically and crowded around his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Pennsylvania license plate above the regular Morocco plate . Many of the kids wore gym shoes and sweaters , and looked very much like American kids . There were clean bedrooms , the smell of disinfectants , a mesa hall without the customary swarms of flies . M. Abdelaziz Bennani , the treasurer and administrator , proudly showed us the white-walled dispensary with a new X-ray apparatus , and a supply of American drugs for which he warmly thanked Jerry . " Need anything else ? " Jerry asked him , matter-of-factly . Monsieur Bennani looked embarrassed . " The kids have learned to take a shower every day . The American soap was a great help . Now I wonder if we could get some toothbrushes . " " We 'll get you 600 toothbrushes in a few weeks , " Jerry said . " Though the kids will hate me for that . And for the eighteenth of November you 'll get some toys from the American Community . " They celebrate " Christmas " on November eighteenth , the anniversary of the sultan 's accession to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in his car . " Nice kids , " he said . " I 'm glad we can help them a little . " I said , " Are you going to stay here for good ? " " This country has a terrific future , " he said thoughtfully . " Enormous resources , cheap labor , a great port , an expanding economy . An American looking for commercial advantage over his competitors only because of his nationality will fail . A businessman has to be one . I would like to stay here until my kids are ready for high school . But then comes the time when I want them to grow up where they belong in America . "
