Every week , some things happen in the U.S. that seem peculiarly American-or at least more likely to happen in the U.S. than elsewhere . Some that happened last week : <P> Oklahoma . A tall , talented gentleman by the name of F. Bam Morrison descended on Wetumka ( pop . 2,500 ) to prepare for the coming of " Bonn 's United Circus Shows . " He got the Boy Scouts to sponsor it . The Meadors Hotel saved 20 rooms , a grocery ordered 100 Ibs. of frankfurters , the Coca-Cola Co. dozens of cases of pop . A truckload of hay was deposited on the circus grounds to feed the elephants . F. Bam Morrison sold $250 worth of advertising for the circus program ; while he was working at it , the hotel donated his room , the Wide-A-Wake Cafe his board . For treating him , two doctors got free passes to the show . Then Morrison left town , and Bohn 's United Circus never showed . But Wetumka decided to have a celebration , anyway . It declared a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 Ibs. of hot dogs from booths in the middle of Main Street . Said the grocer who bought them : " That guy sure could talk . " <P> New York . A Manhattan judge decided that since one Alan Herbert lives in " an expensive environment , " and his divorced wife is a " lady of superior breeding , " the ex-husband must provide for the college education of his two daughters ; everyone in their set takes college education " as a matter of course . " <P> New Jersey . At Pennsville , N.J. , some 26 finalists prepared to jam large pink lumps of bubble gum into their mouths and see-for the prize of a U.S. Savings Bond-who can blow the biggest bubble . They have two minutes to do it in , plus an initial ten seconds to get the chew started . The " world championship " contest was designed to help promote the bubble gum industry , a $20 million a year business . Philadelphia alone exports each week 25 tons of gum to Japan , the Philippines , Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the G.I. <P> Florida . About 8,500 citizens hopped aboard when the Jacksonville Coach Co. offered free bus rides for Sunday churchgoers . Bus Magnate Wiley Moore was not sure that they all went to church-but " if anyone wants to get on the bus and say he is going to church and then not go , that will be on his conscience .
