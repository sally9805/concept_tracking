Oil is not the only treasure that lies beneath the timeless sands of the Middle East . Temples , churches , palaces and whole cities wait for the digging ; the finds of the past decade-at Harran and Arzawa in Turkey and Dura Europos in Syria-indicate how much more is to come . This week the government of Israel was opening to tourists the latest major discovery : the remains of one of the earliest Christian churches in the world . <P> Four years ago , the German Jews in the red-roofed little settlement called Shavei Zion , on the rocky Mediterranean coast between Acre and Lebanon , decided to build a coastal road to link their village with other communities . A bulldozer was at work slicing away the sand dunes when one day its driver noticed that he was grazing what seemed to be scorched pavement with jewel-encrusted slabs . Archaeologist Moshe Prausnitz , British-trained senior inspector of Israel 's Department of Antiquities , arrived on the scene , found a loose layer of burned mosaic floor , and under that two layers of superb mosaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with interruptions caused by war with Egypt and lack of funds . Archaeologist Prausnitz. 34. has uncovered the floor of a large church , part of what used to be a busy port town , probably called Nea Come in the days of Emperor Constantine . Christians broke their journey there on the road from Tyre to Caesarea . <P> In addition to the black , white and red mosaic , there are wall frescoes , lamps , chancel rails and a whole system of locks . Prausnitz dates the church in the 4th century . One clue : the liberal use of the cross on the floor mosaics , a practice that the church prohibited A.D. 427 on the ground that the feet of worshipers profaned the sacred symbol . A second indication is the floor plan-a long rectangle in the manner of 4th century Roman temples . Definite dating must wait upon other scholars and future excavations . <P> What had happened to this once great church that may have echoed to Christian prayers when Augustine was Bishop of Hippo ? Prausnitz theorizes that it was probably sacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Syria . Then the winds blew , and the sand swept over the bright mosaic .
