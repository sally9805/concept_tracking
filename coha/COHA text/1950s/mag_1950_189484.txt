Freshman Senator Paul Douglas stood virtually alone . For two weeks he had been hacking at the $1.5 billion rivers and harbors bill , trying to eliminate a list of projects which he thought were " flagrant examples of pork . " Bravely he argued that the country could get along without spending $7,500 to make bathing pleasanter at Palm Beach ; $21,000 to improve navigation for the crabbers of Twitch Cove , Md. ; $34,500 to improve yachting at Stonington harbor , Conn . He thought that $1.3 million for dredging the Detroit River would benefit no one but the Detroit Edison Co. , and that $36.9 million to improve the Ouachita River in Arkansas and Louisiana was not justified . In all , he listed $840 million of projects from Prouts Neck , Me. to Westport Slough , Ore. - many of them not even requested by the Administration-which he thought could be lopped off . <P> His colleagues stared at him in stony-eyed silence , then , rushing to the mutual defense of each other 's pork , shouted down the idea . <P> But Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even bigger targets , and last week his mild , cheerful Midwest voice sounded again across the Senate floor . <P> " Build Us ... O My Congress . " " There is a delusion , " he said , " which causes America to sink large quantities of money into our American rivers , and that is the toot of a steamboat whistle . Somehow it is believed that if we can only have a steamboat whistle tooting through the heart of the corn belt there will be enormous riches . . . " He was attacking the feasibility of authorizing $250 million more for the celebrated Pick-Sloan development on the Missouri River . Said Fair Dealer Douglas : " I think it is a very serious question whether the United States of America needs a nine-foot channel from Sioux City to Kansas City . " <P> Congress had already authorized $360 million for the project . Actually , the exuberant Army Corps of Engineers had gone beyond that authorization to make contracts which would cost the Government $757 million . " The motto of the Army engineers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more costly dams and more costly levees , O my Congress . ' " He thought it was time to call a halt until Congress could study the whole vast Missouri River project , " which , if carried through , will be a monument to the mistakes and errors of man . " He had studied the project carefully , he said . He doubted that there would even be enough water from the Dakotas to fill the channels and irrigation ditches which the Army engineers were busily scooping out . Whether Douglas was right or wrong , the Senate apparently did not care . Alert to the demands of their constituents , the Senators turned that amendment down . <P> " My Last Amendment . " Patiently , as the day wore on , Douglas tried to knock out $200 million for flood control on the lower Mississippi River , $100 million of projects in the Ohio River Basin , $89 million for the Arkansas River Basin . Except for Delaware 's John Williams and Virginia 's inveterate economizer , Harry Byrd , he had almost no support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
