Investors in the New York stock market have long been hampered by the lack of an accurate barometer to tell how the majority of stocks are doing . Present published daily averages are computed on the basis of a small , hopefully representative sampling of stocks that often does not show the action of the market as a whole ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) . This week Standard &; Poor 's announced a weighted index of 500 stocks representing 90% of the total value of all stocks listed on the exchange . Said Standard &; Poor 's President Charles A. Schmutz : " It will be the most complete and technically accurate measure of the market ever devised . " The new index will be carried hourly on the tickers of the American Stock Exchange , Commodity News Services and Cotton Ticker , be available to all clients of Standard &; Poor 's statistical service . <P> It will be computed by the same method used to arrive at Standard &; Poor 's pres ent daily and weekly indexes ( the daily will be discontinued ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is multiplied by the number of shares outstanding , to get the issue 's current value , then compared to a total market value in a base year . <P> True Average . A big advantage of the new index is that it will give the investor a true idea of the average price of a single share of stock-a figure that has been lost in the inflated statistics of almost all market averages . On Dec. 31 , for instance , Standard &; Poor 's daily industrial index closed at 498.9 and the Dow-Jones industrial average at 499.47 , yet the New York Stock Exchange reported that the average value of one share of stock on that date was only $49.12 , or about one-tenth as much . <P> To remedy this discrepancy . Standard &; Poor 's will compile its total on a base of 10 instead of the present 100 , junk the present 1935-39 base years in favor of a 1941-43 base , when the average price of a single stock was $10 . Thus , the new index will start off with a figure very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its fluctuations will accurately reflect the price fluctuations in the market as a whole . <P> Electronic Brain . Standard &; Poor 's system ( cost to date : $50,000 ) is the result of a year 's experimentation with an electronic computer that keeps tabs on the market . The transactions on the exchange 's ticker tape are duplicated on a special tape that is fed into the machine . The brain rejects all extraneous information carried on the exchange tape , such as news bulletins , picks the latest quoted price for each stock , multiplies it by the number of shares outstanding ( a figure previously fed into its memory drum ) . <P> The computer has even learned to adjust to the ticker 's habit of dropping digits when it falls behind the trading pace on the floor , can recognize and signal mistakes in quotations in a matter of seconds . The system is so swift that it would be possible to average all the 1,500 shares listed on the exchange , on an hourly basis . But Standard &; Poor 's feels that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stocks not in the index are little traded , have little effect on the market .
