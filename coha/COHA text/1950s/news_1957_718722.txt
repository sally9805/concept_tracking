Group Holds Session on Levies By JOHN D. MORRIS Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , April 10 ? . Democratic leaders in Congress laid tentative plans today ' for passage of a general tax reduc. tion bill later this session . Speaker Sam Rayburn , in announcing the development , indicated prospects looked good for a cut , probably effective next Jan. 1 . He reported that a bill , yet to be devised but giving preference to the country 's 60,000,000 individual income taxpayers , would get the green light if two conditions were met . First , he said , a Treasury estimate to be thade Monday must indicate " sufficient " Federal revenues and second ? Congress must cut President Eisenhower 's record $71,800,000,000 budget enough to justify tax relief . Asked if he thought there was a " good chance " of meeting these requirements , the Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strategy Conference Held Mr .. Rayburn talked to reporters after a tax strategy conference with Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts , the Democratic floor leader , and Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee . The committee has first jurisdiction over all tax bills . The Senate was not represented at the meeting . However , the question has been discussed with ' Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , : the Senate Democratic leader . It can be assumed that the general strategy meets his , approval . ' We 're not going to be irresponsible and jump out and introduce a great big tax hill  --  at the moment , " Speaker Rayburn said . " We are not going to do an irresponsible , thing . " We are going to see what April 15 will bring in the way of tax revenue and we are going to see how much the budget is cut . " There was no decision on how much of a budget cut would be required , the Speaker reported . Also left for later determination was the type and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayburn said various proposals for individual income tax reductions were discussed . These included a $100 increase in per // sonal exemptions , now $600 each for taxpayers and dependents ; a straight $20 reduction for each taxpayer and dependent ; percentage reductions across the board , and a 10 per cent rate instead of the present 20 per cent on the first $1,000 of taxable income . He voiced belief that any Democratic , tax bill would give priority to individual income taxpayers . He added , however , that he was not ruling out cuts in corporation and excise taxes as well . Excise taxes are imposts levied on the manufacture , sale or consumption of commodities within the country . Bans Cut Before January He made it clear that any reAuctions approved this year would not take effect before next January . Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee held -a separate caucus today but did not disclose any decisions . Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , the House Re'publican ' leader , said recently that it would be " irresponsible " to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent Republican policy at present . But Representative Richard M. Simpson . of Pennsylvania , a high-ranking Republican member of the tax-writing committee , announced plans a week ago to introduce a bill for immediate cuts in individual and corporation taxes . He was reported to have appealed to today 's caucus for backing but without avail . The plans laid by Democrats today reflected , belief that President Eisehower would surely recommend next January that Congress cut taxes and a desire to beat him to the punch . The meeting with Mr. Rayburn was the upshot of informal talks that have been going on for several weeks as a byproduct of the current economy drive in Congress . Big Money Bills Ahead So far , the House has cut President Eisenhower 's requests for new appropriations by slightly more than $1,000,000 , - 000 , with some of the biggest money bills yet to be handled . However , a large part of the cuts involve obligations fixed by law , and the funds may have to be restored later , if . Congressional estimates of these requirements prove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /asked the Senate Appropriations Committee today to restore about a third of , the House-approved cuts in ap- , 1 propriations requested for his department . He said he would not oppose the other reductions . The House allotted $591,387 , - 060 for Commerce Department operations in the coming fiscal year . This was $212,402,940 below the President 's request . Mr. Weeks asked for restoration of $78,892,940 ? more than $74,000,000 of it to the Civil Aeronautics Administration .
