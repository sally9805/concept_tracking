The crowd at Manhattan 's National Horse Show last week had something special to watch . Along with the traditional pomp and splendor , the show offered such a competitive match as had not been seen at the National for years . The big event : the international jumping , with teams from Mexico , France , Ireland , Canada and the U.S. The chief competitors : Mexico 's famed Brigadier General Humberto Mariles , 1948 Olympic champion , and France 's brilliant Pierre d'Oriola , this year 's Olympic winner . As it turned out , Mariles and D'Oriola had their duel-but it was for secondary honors . The surprise star of the show , breaking a longtime Mexican monopoly : young ( 27 ) Billy Steinkraus of Westport , Conn. , far &; away the most glittering amateur rider to come up in the U.S. for years . <P> General Mariles led off with the advantage of years of experience over the tight jumping courses at Madison Square Garden ; but Mariles no longer had his fabled Arete , the one-eyed jumper who carried him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died after an operation . D'Oriola , accustomed to the longer European jumping courses and hardly at home in the Garden , nonetheless was superbly mounted on his big chestnut Olympic horse , Ali Baba . Steinkraus was teamed up with an amazingly old ( 19 ) brown gelding named Democrat , a retired cavalry horse from the old Army Remount Service at Fort Riley , Kans. and a jumper of legendary prowess at many another U.S. horse show . <P> Up &; Over . From the first day , Steinkraus was a show stopper ; he won both opening international events , afternoon and evening , thus doubling the number of winners the whole U.S. team scored a year ago . Riding the skittish , younger ( 9 ) Hollandia , a horse that , Steinkraus says , " always thinks he 's in the third race at Belmont , " Billy slipped to a third place in the next event . Back on old reliable Democrat the next day , and traveling the course faultlessly , Steinkraus led the U.S. to a leg on the team title . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trophy ( General Mariles defending ) , Billy brought forth such a burst of applause from the 10,000 fans that the announcer had to shush them to avoid frightening the horses . Astride Hollandia , the slight-built ( 5 ft. 10 in. , 150 Ibs . ) Steinkraus had his hands full , knocked down two of the eight obstacles . " It takes more strength than I 've got to handle him , " Steinkraus said . But no other rider and horse did any better over the tightly spaced course . <P> Riding last on Democrat for the final go-'round of the course , Steinkraus needed a faultless ride to win . The crowd held its breath as the rider and his old campaigner approached the final obstacle . It was a 5-ft. - high white rail , where almost every other contestant had come a cropper . Up &; over went Democrat , cleanly , bringing down a storm of applause . Later , grinning modestly , Billy explained his success by quoting an old jumping axiom : " The horse makes the rider .
