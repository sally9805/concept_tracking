THE VICTORIAN CHAISE LOMGUE ( 119 pp. ) - Marghanlfa Laski-Houqhton Mifflin ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> British book reviewers are immune to the virus of British understatement . When Marghanita Laski 's The Victorian Chaise Longue was published in London six months ago , the Manchester Guadian hailed it as showing " almost ferocious power . " Said Time and Tide : " Miss Laski stacked every card against herself to make her final really-grand slam more miraculous . " <P> Her British fans notwithstanding , Author Laski ( a niece of the Labor Party 's late Grey Eminence . Harold Laski ) bids and makes no slams in The Victorian Chaise Longue , only a. quiet rubber game . She deals out a tidy horror story with a psychological flavoring of Jekyll &; Hyde . <P> Melanie Langdon is the adoring , child-like wife of a rising lawyer in present-day London , the doting mother of an infant son and a happy patient who has just been told that the worst is over in her seven-month siege of TB . Pleasantly contemplating a happy future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished trophy from an antique-buying safari . She wakes up neither in her drawing room nor in her century nor in her own body . <P> Devilish Fantasies . She is still on the same chaise longue. but the year is 1864 , the drawing room is stuffy , cluttered , sealed against a breath of air . In this world , she finds , her name is Milly Baines , she is a total invalid , and she has a priggish , self-righteous sister who hates her . When she tells a visiting pastor that she is a woman of the future who does n't belong in 1864 , he denounces her claims as devilish fantasies . <P> She begins to think that she has perhaps been sent back to the 19th century on a curative mission , to teach the healing values of fresh air and sunshine , but the doctor who attends her will not hear of such madness . Meanwhile , old parallels crop up between her life as Melly and her life as Milly . <P> The Final Secret . She is much reminded of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneels at her side , she instinctively knows that he once made love to her on the chaise longue . A more terrible parallel occurs when she starts spitting blood into her handkerchief and realizes that as Milly , she will die of TB . <P> As she tightens the suspense screws on her plot , Author Laski also adds a shocker or two , e.g. , poor Milly outrages her Victorian surroundings by bearing an illegitimate child . The final secret of whether Melanie ever makes her way back to the 20th century is a matter Author Laski deserves to share directly with her readers .
