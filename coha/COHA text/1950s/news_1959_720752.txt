txt The fun and games part of the Khrushchev tour is now happily over . The visitor behaved like a sturdy traveling salesman for his line of goods . Wayside hosts usually succeeded in being reasonably courteous to the stranger without exposing themselves too dangerously to the charge of being soft on communism . But what really counts in this trip is what happens when the visitor and President Eisenhower meet in strictest private , and talk with a degree of candor which is impossible for either in public . The opportunities for useful discussion are greater when these two meet together than between any other two Men in the'World. * A * That the opportunities are great does not mean that much will necessarily come of the meetiiig . This is an unusual kind of meeting . History offers only two remotely comparable events  --  the meeting between King Henry VIII of . England and Francis I of . France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold and the meeting on the raft at Tilsit between the Czar of Russia and Emperor Napoleon of France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did little else . The second produced a temporary truce which ended as soon as it served Napoleon 's interests to end it . Those earlier meetings are comparable to this in one respect . In all three cases the protagonists are relatively equal in the amount of power at their command at the time of the meeting  --  and are also the most powerful men of their times . Kings Francis and Henry were both heads of state and heads of govern-in en t . The Czar and Napoleon were the same , and so too , in effect , are the President and Mr. Khrushchev . Technically Mr. Khrushchev is not head of state . In fact , he is . A A A Neither the President nor Mr. Khrushchev is completely free to do everything he might conceivably like to do . The President has cleared his meeting with his allies and will be most careful to do nothing to injure the Western alliance . Mr. Khrushchev will visit Peking immediately after Washington and will be equally careful to avoid damage to his own power system which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public statements in Peking have made it clear that the government there is quite as anxious about what might happen at Camp David as ever Berlin , Paris , or London were before ? they were reassured by the President 's preliminary visits to Western capitals . The two leaders now can speak candidly but are limited severely in the range of possible arrangements or agreements . There is really only one area in which both enjoy almost complete freedom to talk and even negotiate with each other . They are the only two men in the world who have the power to make either nuclear war or nuclear peace . True , Britain also has nuclear weapons , and France may acquire them soon . But Britain and France are both too vulnerable to such weapons to be capable of a deliberate choice to use them . Unless or until the nuclear weapons picture changes radically , the President and Fuel for Thought Mr. Khrushchev are the only ones who could negotiate usefully with each other on such matters . Also they enjoy a mutual interest in preventing , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A A A It would be of first importance to everyone if the two could agree that testing of such weapons would not be resumed in their respective countries . Mr. Khrushchev might offer as his part of the bargain to refrain from helping Communist China to develop a nuclear industry . The talks are expected to range over broader areas of arms limitation and control , but about all that could be done usefully would be exposure by Mr. Khrushchev of the concessions he might be prepared to make in detailed negotiations further down the road . The West can not go much further itself , unless the Soviets are prepared to offer substantial concessions on inspection and control systems . Berlin is a major topic . This could not be a decisive discussion , but it could clear the way for useful further negotiation if each could successfully convince the other of readiness to refrain from interference with the existing conditions in Berlin . A A Probably the most practical subject on the agenda is what Mr. Khrushchev might concede at a summit conference . The President has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . Mr. Khrushchev alone can give him those reasons .
