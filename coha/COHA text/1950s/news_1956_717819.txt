txt Letters to The Times Conditions in Bolivia Recent Statements Against Existing Government Are Denied To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Recently The New York Times commented editorially about Bolivian affairs . This was followed by a letter to The Times , printed on April 3 , by Gaston Arduz Eguia , former Government official , which criticized the editorial and attacked the existing Bolivian Government in intemperate terms . Leaving aside Senor Arduz ' adjectives and invectives , I would like to reply to some of the statements . Senor Arduz says that Bolivia 's failure to attract new foreign capital " over the past twenty years " falls on the M. N. R. ( the party now in power ) . He cites as a case in point the expropriation of properties belonging to Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1937 . He says the legend about the fabulous Patino fortune is typical of M. N. R. " vicious propaganda . " He adds that the agrarian problem in Bolivia was not a matter of land redistribution , but of capital and technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the present time a committed member of the Communist party . Your correspondent remarks that " although censure does not carry legal weight , it does have considerable moral influence . " In years past this has certainly been the case , for the association has ably supported the process or scholarly inquiry and the responsibility of the instructor to be faithful to the findings of his own study . But what " moral influence " will an action ' carry which is premised on the notion that an instructor should be defended in his academic position even though he deliberately subjects himself to the discipline of a party ideology that is shaped and reshaped to meet the demands of the Kremlin . I am convinced that the moral judgment of the educational community will not be with the Association of University Professors on this basic issue , but rather with those who insist that integrity in ? inquiry and communication . is an indispensable trait of a teacher in a democratic society . JOHN L. CHILDS , Professor Emeritus , Teachers College , Columbia University . Princeton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Properties Let us ' take these charges in order . Senor Arduz ' attempt to blame the M. N. R. for the failure , over a twenty-year period , of private capital to invest in Bolivia is absurd . The fact that he cites the expropriation Of the Standard Oil properties in 1937 is ridiculous on its face . The M. N. R. did not exist in 1937 , not being formed until 1940 . The Government which expropriated the Standard Oil properties was controlled by the Patinos , the Aramayos and Hochschilds , the well-known tin barons . I am astonished that Senor Arduz calls stories of the huge Patino fortune propaganda . This is like denying that George Washington was the first President of the United States . The query : " If the tin ' barons ' amassed such enormous profits , why does Bolivia now have to be supported by the United States ? " is naive . The tin barons did not use their money , to ' develop the rich natural resources of their country . They took most of it abroad and used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims at land reform in Bolivia are superficial . It is true that Bolivia needs capital and technical skills for the full development of agriculture . Yet how can modern agriculture exist alongside the feudal system which prevailed in Bolivia prior to the redistribution of land in 1953 ? The workers were serfs and were tied to the land in a status of semislavery . Under such a system Bolivia could never have a modern and efficient agricultural system . I do not believe it necessary to answer some of Senor Arduz ' generalities such as " banishment of thousands of citizens , " " terrorizing of the people , " " brutal despotism , " etc . But it is interesting to note that the Government of President Paz Estensso ? o recently gave amnesty to all political prisoners so they may take part in the forthcoming political elections this year . Senor Arduz was a member of the Government in 1951 . Not only was there no amnesty for political prisoners that year , but after the M. N. R. won the election , Senor Arduz ' Government refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record Since 1952 the record of the Government - of President Paz Estenssoro is clear . It has been consistently anti-Communist ; it has taken a series of significant steps , including a new and liberal oil code , in an effort to stimulate foreign investment . Only recently the Gulf Oil Company , one of the largest in the world , reached an understanding with the Bolivian Government for oil development . It does not stand to reason that the Gulf Oil Company would enter Bolivia if the situation which Senor Arduz describes exists . Senor . Arduz blames the inflation in Bolivia on actions of the Government . Does he not know that a decline in the price of tin , with which the M. N. R. was in no way connected , is one of the prime factors in the inflationary process ? Does he also not know that money which the Government has had to spend to develop long neglected resources is another factor ? A few years ago representatives of the tin barons told representatives of the R. F. C. that tin could not be mined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1952 has been well below $1 a pound . In view of this circumstance , it would be interesting for Senor Arduz to explain how the tin barons could have made Bolivia stable and prosnerous while mining tin at a loss . CIRO HUMBOLDT , ..

Censure of Colleges Criticized To THE Earroa OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a member for many years of the American Association of University Professors I have followed with deep interest the excellent accounts your paper has given of the annual meeting . After years of uncertainty the association has reached conclusions based on the issue of communism . It has voted to censure seven universities and colleges , including the University of California and Ohio State University . Its action is apparently based on the assumption that a college should not dismiss an School Aid in New Jersey Program Adopted Viewed as Step Forward in School Finance Pakistan 's Iron Resources To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his letter printed in your column on April 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron resources . Surveys by two German concerns , Krupps and Demage , discovered rich iron ore in Attock , Kalabagh area- of- Mianwali district and- also in ' the .

When the Russian Foreign- Minister offered to set up . a steel mill he must have had in mind the announcement by the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation to build a $300,000,000 iron - and steel mill . The Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation was going to get a loan from the World Bank and it had also asked for the participation of private foreign enterprise in this Project .

DOROTHY R. HOWARD . To THE EDITOR OF THE Nsw YORK TIME/ : ' The New Jersey Legislature has just passed and Governor Meyner signed a group of measures that provides a substantial program of annual state support foe public school buildings and capital ' expense . This . program is a large step forward in public school finance , not only because it provides funds for much-needed schools , but also because the unique formula of distribution is sound in principle . This is no stop-gap measure , but rather a plan that encourages capital budgets and long-term planning . Originally suggested by James Arnold of the New Jersey State Tax Policy Commission , the formula distributes the support on the basis of long-term needs for local , school housing and local capacity to pay . Poorer districts get up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while wealthier districts get progressively less , or-no state support at all . . The program formula tiseitequalized property values ' to determine capacity to pay , it . sequins ' basic local participation to qualify for . state support , it provides machinery to allow the local district to invest its capital funds as a reserve against future needs , and it should help poorer districts get better interest rates because of the substantial state support for its capital program . In your April 1 issue . your correspondent reports from Trenton that this plan distributes 61 per . cent to eight North Jersey counties . We might add ' that these counties include several of the fastest growing counties , and that the eight : counties include 70 per cent of the state 's pupil enrollments . . ? ' These proposals became law with the full approval of the State Association of School Boards and the other groups interested in public - education , and we feel that they should be of real interest to all who are faced with the critical need of expanding our public school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House conference .
