In the Washington Daily News : <P> <P> SIR WINSTON JOINS NOBELITY <P> <P> Censorship by Contract <P> Several months before his latest book was published . Sexologist Alfred C. Kinsey gave newsmen a " conditional " peek at it . One of Dr. Kinsey 's conditions : all newsmen had to sign a contract binding them to submit their stories in advance to Kinsey for " factual correction . " Since only those who signed could see the book , most newsmen went along with the contract . But last week Kinsey tried to convert his " condition " into a principle . <P> In Indianapolis , where he was to lecture before the Central Neuropsychiatric Association , Kinsey announced that no reporter would get in unless he signed another contract agreeing to submit his story to Kinsey to " correct factual errors . " The press promptly objected . " Perhaps . " said Washington Post Managing Editor J. Russell Wiggins , who is also chairman of the Freedom of Information Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors , " the newspapers should agree not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into newspaper editing . " Added the National Association of Science Writers in a wire to Kinsey : " Your current demand raises an issue of censorship . No self-respecting newsman can cover your address under the terms you lay down . " No newsman did until Kinsey , facing a unanimous press boycott , changed his mind and let reporters cover his lecture as they do any other meeting , without any censorship .
