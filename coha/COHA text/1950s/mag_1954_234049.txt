When Sigmund Freud shocked the world by declaring that sexuality begins in the cradle and is a vital force in a child 's life before ever he reaches puberty , critics soon found a flaw . Freud , they pointed out , had not reached this conclusion so much by observing children as by working backward from the stories told him by sick adults . <P> Last week Sexologist Alfred C. Kinsey told a Manhattan audience that his investigators have by now studied " several hundred " children under five , and have amassed the scientific evidence that Freud lacked . Their findings , he said , " fully confirm Freud 's views " on the sexual basis of children 's behavior . <P> Kinsey in his " female volume " ( TIME , Aug. 24 ) had already reported his belief that the infant 's response to loving attention and physical contact is sexual in character . But this time he went further . By the age of two or three , he said , attitudes that will affect patterns of adult sexual behavior are already formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyously accepts parental cuddling , and " cuddles back " spontaneously , is likely to carry this attitude into adulthood and enter into marriage without unhealthy restraint , Dr. Kinsey contended . The diffident , withdrawn child is more likely to become a tense and possibly frigid marriage partner . <P> Dr. Kinsey protested that he can not tell parents what sex education to give their children , or even when they should begin it . But , he added , " if the child is more than three or four months old , the parents have already lost valuable time and opportunities . "
