" All our misery , " said a defense lawyer in a tense Poznan courtroom last week , " stems from the fact that we have not told the truth for many years and that now we must tell it . " Then , as the court handed down a series of lenient sentences ( 18 months to 6 years , and some suspensions ) on young men charged with the heinous crime of fighting against the Communist authority , all Poland began to feel that the time might soon come when the truth about Poland would be told . Said an old Communist , blighted by years of purgings : " This is the beginning of a renaissance of justice in Poland . " <P> This was the frame of mind which the Polish Communists had deliberately set out to create when they decreed free and fair trials , unprecedented in a Communist country , for the rioters of Poznan . <P> Party on Trial . But the trial had got out of hand as accused and witnesses , conscious of their wide audience , poured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typical was the testimony last week of a witness who told how , on the fateful day of the workers ' riots , he had heard shouts of " Away with the dictatorship " and " Away with the occupation , " and had seen people destroying court records , judges ' robes and golden chains of legal office . " Why is there so little respect for justice in our country ? " this witness asked . <P> By a subtle alchemy of words , it was no longer the young men but the Communist Party on trial . This was made even clearer when the prosecution described the young men as " criminal elements who had dirtied the workers ' demonstration . " " It is not the accused who have fine cars to go on mountain holidays and nice apartments , " retorted a defense lawyer . " The accused are certainly closer to the working class than those i.e. , the Communist elite who hide behind their golden curtains . " <P> No one was surprised when the government halted the public spectacle last week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served their purpose by giving expression to two momentous conflicts that are now going on in Poland . One is the already old and durable struggle between the Polish people and their oppressors . The other is a new and ferocious conflict among the Polish Communists themselves . <P> A section of the Polish Communist Party is committed to a course of liberating Poland , not from Communism but from the brand of Communist satellitism thrust on Poland by the Russians . These " liberal " Communists are young and few in number outside Warsaw , though for the moment they wield a dominating influence in the regime . They are handicapped , first by the fact that Stalin 's purging of the Polish party has left them few competent leaders , and secondly by the fact that the Polish people are in no mood to make a distinction between " good " and " bad " Communists . The Poznan trial was an effort to establish what the " liberal " Communists believe to be a valid distinction .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
