A New Phenomenon of the Boom <P> THE rocketing increase in consumer credit has brought new life to an old business : debt counseling . Hundreds of consultants ( also called poolers , liquidators , lumpers , managers , proraters ) have sprung up around the nation and , in radio and newspaper ads , sing a soothing song : " Cheer up ! No matter how much you owe or how many creditors you have-we will take over , arrange everything so that a single regular payment you can afford takes care of everything . " Some imply that they will lend the debtor enough money to pay off his debts . But all the counselors do is collect money from the debtor , put him on a budget , try to get his creditors to agree to a repayment schedule , and use the debtor 's money to pay off . For this service fees run from 10% to 50% of the total debt . After a survey of debt adjusters in 40 cities , the National Better Business Bureau reported that in 28 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Actually , debt adjusting has usually been more of a racket than a service . <P> For example , Silver Shield System , Inc. opened its doors in New York 20 months ago , was soon handling $7,000,000 annually , had plans for expanding nationwide . Fortnight ago New York State Attorney General Jacob Javits capped a year of investigation by charging that Silver Shield had engaged in " false and misleading advertising , " and " commingled " clients ' money with its own . Far from balancing anyone else 's budget , it could not even balance its own ; it had a deficit of $100,000 . As Javits moved for an injunction against the company for fraudulent practices , Silver Shield , a Delaware corporation , announced that it would " go out of business in New York , " but will continue in other states . Same week , the New York and Georgia state legislatures approved bills to outlaw all proraters , thus following the lead of Massachusetts , Maine , and Pennsylvania . ( Two more - Minnesota and Wisconsin-have tough regulatory laws . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with little or no regulation . The commonest abuse is the consultant 's practice of extracting the fee from the first payments , thus leaving the debtor still more in hock . For example , a New Yorker gave the budgeteer $35 a week for three weeks for payments on his $2,000 debt . He then discovered that $80 of the $105 had been diverted to the budgeteer , only $25 to creditors . There are other sharp practices . The Federal Grand Jury in Chicago last year indicted a debt-pool outfit which assessed customers a $75 " survey charge , " then sent them next door to a loan company to borrow the $75 . Another Chicago pooler would collect his fee , make a few payments , then recommend that his client go into bankruptcy , steering him to a fee-splitting lawyer . In Seattle a truck driver who got behind in his payments to the prorater found that the agency had changed hats . It began working as a collection agency for his creditors , and garnisheed his wages . Clients who wake up , discover that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphian taken for $500 appealed to the local Legal Aid Society only to find 70 complainants before him . Nothing could be done . Said he : " It cost me $500 to find out I could handle my debts better than the debt lumpers could . "
