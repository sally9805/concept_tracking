txt Much of this week 's news has been concerned with the current rise in the price being paid by borrowers for cash , and with the widespread effects this trend is having on all financial values . The week started with increases in the interest rates on government-backed mortgages for the construction of new homes . There followed in quick succession a rise in the yield on the U. S. Treasury 's weekly issue of 91-day bills to the highest level in 20 years ; a decline in the Treasury 's newest bonds-30-year 31A s  --  to one-half point below par ; and rejection by Southern Bell Telephone Co. of all bids for its proposed offering of bonds . If Southern Bell had accepted the best bid on its issue . the 3.79% annual cost to the company would have been highest within the American Telephone &; Telegraph System since the mid-'thirties . One side-effect of the rising cost of money was a decline in the Canadian dollar to just slightly more than 100 cents In U. S. currency . Last August the Canadian unit was worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who remember when foreign exchange rates the world over used to be affected by movements of capital seeking the highest available returns . The Canadian dollar is going down in part because Canadian borrowers do n't find the U. S. market as attractive as when interest rates were lower . However , there is no chance that such capital movements will be resumed today in any amounts sufficient to affect money rates ! here noticeably . In today 's world the countries whose currencies are free enough to permit such transfers of funds are very small in number and small In economic size . Wider potential effects of rising money rates in this country include what they may do to values and prices of common stocks and to new construction plans of both corporations and individuals . In the case of the home loan market the first effect predicted by mortgage men is that more money will be available for government-backed mortgages , which until now have not yielded as much as other mortgages . However , obviously , the increased monthly payments which home owners will now have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to the writer finds that his interest and amortization on a new home will run $84 a month instead of $78. and he now thinks he wo n't buy the house . Utilities contemplating the construction of new electric plants take the cost of money particularly seriously because the price for their product is fixed , unlike that of manufacturers of industrial goods . Yields on common stocks have declined in the last two years while yields on fixed interest securities have gone up . One index shows common stock yields down from an average of 6.29% in 1951 to around 5.25% currently , while long-term U. S. government bonds have moved from 2.57% to 2.94% , municipals from 2% to 2.61% and high grade corporate bonds from 2.86% to 3.18% . Perhaps these contrary trends reflect an abnormal disparity in 1951 which is now being corrected . If so , the rising yields on bonds are going to have an increasing impact on those of stocks . These are only some of the reasons why pressure is mounting on the Federal Reserve Board to do something to ease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Frankly , fear is being expressed in some quarters  --  mostly political so far  --  that unless the Board reverses its policy quickly it will bring on a depression . On this score Board Chairman Martin was quite explicit in a speech made in Boston Wednesday . " M hen an economy . " he said , " is running at peak production and employment , as ( the U. S. economy ) is now , creating more money will not create more things to buy  --  it can only bid up the plices of available supplies . " In other words , he is still more afraid of inflation than of deflation . The implication , clearly , is that the Board will act if it sees deflation setting in . Nor in the foregoing remarks bar the possibility that the Board might give the Treasury some help in its financing operations later this year . Not only will the latter have some $24 billion of maturities to meet in the remainder of 1953 , but the deficit for which it will have to find new cash may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board will certainly watch the market closely during such financing onerations , ready to step in if it sees the need . However , from a longer term point of view the question is not what the Federal Reserve Board is going to do but where the interestrate cycle stands . In testimony before the House Banking Committee early in the week Mr. Martin warned the Representatives how limited are the powers of his Board . The most it can do , he said , is to " lean against the breeze . To blame the Federal Reserve Board for a depression or give it credit for a boom would be a complete misrepresentation of monetary policy . " The same thing is probably true to a great extent of the level of money rates , although the financial history of the last twenty years had tended to mask the facts . During those years . monetary policy sought low rates , and rates were actually low . However , this surcession of events is not an absolute proof of cause and effect . All it proves is that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extremely long one . The cost of money was low around the turn of the century . From 1901 to 192 ( 1 the yield on high grade railroad bonds rime from 8.14% to 5.49% . Yields remained high through most of the ' twenties and then began to fall , reaching their lows In 1948 . Regardless of Federal Reserve action , all true money yields -- on governments , municipals and corporates  --  have been going up since then , Vet the Reserve Board stopped supporting government bonds only two years ago , early In 1951 . Nor Is it correct to assume , as many do , that the Board is currently putting pressure on the money market to force rising yields . All it is doing Is letting the market tighten itself . With only seven yearn passed since Its 1948 low , a money-rate cycle which can last 25 years should hardly be expected to reverse itself soon , except for a temporary upturn countering the main trend . ?                  @ @ @
