txt The Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy announced today the creation of a citizens ' panel to help speed peaceful uses of the atom . The eight-member panel will have a broad scope . It will meas-1 ure the impact of peaceful appli- , cations of atomic power on all , phases of United States life . It also may recommend legislative and policy actions - to guide , peaceful atomic development . Robert , editor and , publisher of The Santa Fe Nevi Mexican , will be chairman of the panel- of scientists , industri alists and civic leaders . He is a former Assistant Secretary of the Interior . During World War II he served as a lieutenant in the Navy 's Bureau of Ordnance . Senator Clinton P. Anderson , 1 committee chairman , said that : the study by the panel would be in " no way competitive with . the Atomic Energy Commission . " It was not set up to " probe or investigate the A. E.

Need of Study Stressed During recent public hearings on atomic development , members of the Joint Committee raised critical questions on whether the A. E. C. wag proceeding rapidly enough under the 1954 atomic law that opened the door to private enterprise in peacetime atomic efforts . Senator Anderson ' said that the hearings had " convinced me at least that a continuing study was needed . " He said he hoped that the panel study might erase " rough spots " in A. E. C. activities in the peacetime field . He expected that Lewis L. Strauss , the commission chairman , would be the panel 's first witness . Mr. said he believed it would be Weeks before the panel could meet . The group is charged with reporting to the Joint Committee by Jan. 31 , 1956 .

He expected some studies to be made abroad but mainly by staff members . Mr. Strauss promised the " fullest cooperation " of the A. E. C. in the survey . The selection of the panel , he said , " will surely be construed abroad as further evidence of support for President Eisenhower 's ' atoms for peace ' plan . " The panel 's work , he said , " should be no less useful . " Mr. Strauss called it a " logical sequence " to study by a similar group that dug into military aspects of atomic energy last year at the Joint Committee 's direction . Senator Anderson mentioned electric power as the first aspect in a study of peaceful uses of the atom . " Immediate development of low-cost atomic-powered generators can avert dislocations which otherwise may endanger the national welfare . " he said .
