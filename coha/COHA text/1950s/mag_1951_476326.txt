DowsING is so fantastic that the devout might regard it as a miracle and the scientist as a lie . It is neither . I am writing about it because the quarrel between Kenneth Roberts and his skeptical critics over his startling book , Henry Gross and His Dowsing Rod , suggests the boxing ring rather than the forum . The matter is too momentous to be relegated to trial by combat ; and while I can not admire the unscientific reluctance of some of his critics to examine and verify his facts , I do not wonder at their skepticism . The body of belief which Galileo affronted by his suggestion that the planets moved about the sun , not about the earth , was not more deeply intrenched than our present scientific conviction that no event takes place which can not be explained by a known and measurable " force . " For those who have not read the story of Henry Gross , Kenneth Roberts has given us a pugnacious but meticulously documented report of the development of a " dowser " ( a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a forked stick ) from moderate ability to bewildering and versatile genius . The writing of this book required more than a year ; and during this very active period Kenneth lived so close to the amazing events he was observing and recording that he failed to realize how uncanny and how virtually incredible they would appear in print . I warned him of this rather early in his project , at the same time that I congratulated him on his courage in risking doubt and perhaps ridicule ; for it is the same courage that led him , many years ago , to abandon a very profitable career as a writer of humorous travelogues and to live for years on a shoestring while he developed , with infinite pains , the talent which has made him eminent as a writer of historical novels . His newest venture , like his shift from easy income to the hazards of novel-writing , grows out of a tormenting New England conscience . He feels that Henry Gross has discovered a wholly new approach to the national water-shortage problem , and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Gross is more important than anything else he might attempt to write . I WAS brought up in a city . When a water problem arises in a city , one does n't hunt about for the best dowser ; one phones the plumber . But when I was ten years old my father bought a country place near Cleveland , and the handyman who looked after our garden told me he knew an old fellow who could find underground water by holding a forked hazel stick in his hands , butt upward , and walking about . If he walked over an underground stream the butt twisted downward . At that time we were studying Gayley 's Classic Myths in school . I felt that Mr. Gayley had nothing on our handyman , but I did not say so , for I used to be polite . Until I went to college I heard nothing more abi rut dowsing . In one of my anthropology courses it was listed among the common folk beliefs of widely different culture groups ; but it invited no more credulity than the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Professor Keller pointed out , a rain dance might bring corns . A decade later ( in the nineteen-twenties ) I was startled to hear that Mr. Arthur Baldwin , an able and much respected citizen of Cleveland , had discovered that he could dowse and had used his talent to locate water for his country home east of the city . He disliked demonstrating this ability , partly because he did not enjoy the too familiar greeting of people who had heard of it but not seen it : " Well , Pop , I hear you 're a water-witch , hawhawl " ? and partly because of the disconcerting sensation of the forked stick twisting in his hands . It made him feel uncanny and extremely uncomfortable . I did not see him " dowse " ; but the persons concerned , including Mr. Baldwin , were so sound that it was impossible not to believe that something very odd had actually occurred . I thought ( perhaps rightly ) that some unfamiliar psychological process was involved , and I assumed ( perhaps wrongly ) that it expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this later . In 1944 we moved to our Vermont farm in the hills west of Bellows Falls . It became our permanent home , and the problem of an adequate water supply was soon urgent . The family who had owned the house for 132 years depended for their water upon a small spring up the hill . Six hundrd feet of lead pipe carried spring water to a copper-lined wooden tank above the kitchen . It was supposed to be a never-failing spring ; and this may have been true , for the devastating droughts which have so alarmed New England and other parts of the country were yet to come . We built a 1,000-gallon concrete tank just below the level of the spring , sent the old lead pipe to be made into anti-Japanese propaganda , and replaced it with new and larger pipe , through which we led the water to the house- under thirty-five pounds ' pressure from the new reservoir . Thishappened in 1944 , the first year of the drought ; but the autumn rains came early , and we did not realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 , was the second year of insufficient rain . Some wells in our neighborhood ran dry and people began to worry . We found that we were drawing water from our reservoir faster than it was flowing in . Fortunately we had a reserve supply in an old well near the kitchen , which had not been used for many years . We installed a small gasoline pump at this well and forced water , twice daily , into our existing water system . We felt very clever indeed , until we discovered one day that we had pumped the well dry and that the reservoir was nearly empty . The autumn rains came at last . The summers of 1946 and 1947 were even more precarious , and when the summer of 1948 arrived , we knew we had to do something . It is pleasant to retire to the cou ? try , but we could n't think of anybody who would care to retire to a dry water hole , except perhaps a gila monster and his cross wife . A neighbor who was helping us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You probably do n't believe in dowsing , " he said , " and I 'm not sure I believe in it myself ; but I know an old feller named Tom Tollman who . . . " It could do no harm , and we were curious to see a dowser at work . We sought out Mr. Tollman , a bit of a hermit who lives not far from us , and he readily agreed to help us out . We brought him to the farm . II A T THIS time our son Brooks was home from his university on a weekend visit . He has been exposed to science ; and though he has inherited politeness from his father , it was evident that he took a dim view of our dowsing experiment . He consented to walk up the hill with us ? his mother and Mr. Tollman and me ? but his jaw was set , and he took no part in our discussion . We explained to Mr. Tollman that if we were to open up a new water supply , we wanted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that we could continue to use our gravity system . He cut a forked twig from an apple tree ? " It do n't have to be hazel ; any green wood will do " ? and explored the region around the spring and the reservoir . He held the fork like an inverted " Y , " lightly grasped by the ends and lightly pressed against his chest , with his palms up and his thumbs turned outward . Several times we saw the butt of his fork bend downward . He would then release it , raise it again to operating position , check and recheck as he moved about . He located the vein which fed the spring . West of the reservoir and a few feet higher he found another vein , flowing at right angles to the first . He thought the two veins probably joined down the hill . He showed us the place where he " felt the strongest pull " from the new vein , and we drove a stake to mark this point for future digging . Then he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I figure about one person in thirteen can dowse , " he said ; " you 'd be surprised how many people can do it and never know it . " I held the fork as he instructed me ? not too tightly ? and walked across the new vein . Not a twitch from the rod . Nothing . My wife tried it . Nothing . Young Brooks took it , adjusted it to his chest with something like a truculent sneer , and marched toward the vein . As he reached the vein he stopped short , his face a picture of incredulity and horror . " I 'll be goddamned ! " he yelled , regrettably . The fork had come alive in his hands , and the butt pointed straight down . He experimented several times . When he approached the vein the fork always dipped . When he tried to restrain it by pinching the ends with his thumbs , the slender fibers twisted like rope as the butt forced its way outward and down . He spent the rest of the afternoon investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at several places , one of them in the middle of the hay field which occupies a terrace above our garden . Mr. Tollman was not surprised , but his mother and I were shocked . Our egg had hatched into a cuckoo . W E DID not know then that there is an enormous difference in the abilities of different dowsers ; that many and perhaps most dowsers , including Mr. Toll-man , can not distinguish between mere seepage and the flow of water through a definite vein or channel and do not know how to estimate the depth of water below the surface . We employed two diggers to excavate a hole at the point where Mr. Tollman had " felt the strongest pull . " They encountered moisture at about five feet , and the soil became swampy at a little greater depth . Further digging produced nothing that could be called a flow . Next morning an inch or two of water had collected at the bottom of the hole . We went for advice to David Stearns , our village plumber . David shuffled around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you believe in dowsing or not , but you 've had a lot of trouble with your water supply , and I 've just been wondering . . . " We told him about Mr. Tallman . " It may not seem worth while , " said David , " but I know a man in Grafton named Leon Fisher , who has found water for a lot of people . You might get him to check Tom Tollman . " And so we went to Mr. Fisher . He did n't think he ought to charge us anything ; it was n't his trade , and did n't involve any work ? but he 'd be glad to help us out . He began by checking the vein which fed our spring , and traced it to where it flowed under the spring in the general direction of the reservoir . " You might get more water by deepening the spring , " he told us , " but I think you 'd do better to dig a new spring a little further down the vein . Make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Tollman ( and young Brooks ) had located with their rods . " There 's water here , " he said , " but I get the strongest pull about fifteen feet north of where you 've dug that hole . I 'd dig right here . " We dug where he said to dig , and encountered a much stronger flow than we had found at the first digging . We dug a new spring at the point he - had indicated . We filled up the first hole , completed the second by walling it up inside with field stones , and piped the new water supply into the concrete reservoir as a badly needed supplement to the newly re-located spring . I ATE that summer the new well ran dry . So did the re-located spring . So did l the ancient well behind the kitchen . So did the brook . Like thousands of other New England farmers , we hauled water in milk cans from somebody else 's never-failing spring . ( There are such springs . ) Rain fell in November . We limped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread of fire . The newspapers reported the plague of forest fires , of course , but they did not report the countless little personal tragedies of homes burning for lack of available water while their owners stood helplessly watching the tall flames . Our plumber brought us a third dowser , Mr. H. E. Wells of Walpole , New Hampshire , who had earned considerable respect for his success in finding water during the past five years of cumulative drought . Mr. Wells was not an amateur , like Tollman and Fisher ; he was a professional well-driller and owned an expensive drilling rig . Mr. Wells cut a forked stick and went to work . Our previous dowsers , he said , had entirely missed the main flow , although they had found seepage from a fairly large vein . He indicated the location of this vein , nearly forty feet from the new well and a few feet up the side of a slope . He told us ? and this is extremely important in view of what we learned later from Henry Gross ? that the vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge , several hundred feet from where we stood and at a much higher level . Since a hilltop provides almost no drainage area for rainfall , this seemed highly improbable ; but we refrained from comment . We asked him what lie would charge to drill a well and pipe the water into our present gravity system . He thought it would come to about $1,100 ? and if he did n't produce the water he would not charge us for drilling . This was beyond our means . We hoarded water , and at last the autumn rains came . T T THIS point we had come to believe , because of young Brooks 's experience with the rod , that " dowsing " was an actual phenomenon , quite inexplicable but as real as ham and eggs ; but we had no way of realizing that dowsers differ as widely in the range and accuracy of their " aware-ness " as an Apache medicine man differs from a skilled diagnostician with the laboratory facilities of a great modern hospital at his elbow . And of course we failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement that the vein we were probing had its origin near the top of the ridge , and that it came from deep in the earth ? from what Henry Gross calls a " dome " or " pipe . " We did not connect this in our minds with what a neighbor had told us of a nearby hilltop well which had been ruined by overeagerness . A dowser had found and marked the spot ; a well was dug and water was found at a depth of about twenty feet . A gasoline pump indicated ( by pumping the well dry several times and letting it fill again ) that water flowed in at the rate of about six gallons a minute . With the mistaken zeal which has ruined so many springs and wells , the owner decided to open up the underlying rock with dynamite in the hope of securing a larger flow . The dynamite shattered the rock ; the water found a new deeper channel somewhere out of reach , and was lost . Note that this was a hilltop , and note that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to vary with the seasons either in temperature or in rate of flow ? have their origin in the high places , where the area of nearby rainfall can not account for more than an insignificant fraction of their flow . I shall come back to this later . D URING these years of water-worry I had corresponded from time to time with my friend Kenneth Roberts . I knew of his preliminary experience with dowsers , which had startled him by violating some of the geological theories he had learned under Professor Ralph Tarr at Cornell . Kenneth knew of my troubles . Late in 1949 he wrote me from Bermuda to learn whether my water problem was solved . I told him it was n't solved , not by a jugful ; and I suggested that our hillside farm apparently provided too little rain-catching area to furnish us with a year-round supply of water . Though I did not know it then , he and Henry Gross were in Bermuda for an extraordinary reason . He had ransacked the libraries of Europe and America for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? translated , where necessary ? into Henry 's hands . " Read this and see what you can do . " Henry , an intelligent man , was fascinated by this material , which had never been gathered together before . He experimented with this method and that , learning how to interpret the often puzzling behavior of his rod ; and his powers developed from the marvelous to the utterly fantastic . The " awareness " which enabled Henry to say with confidence : " Dig here ; you will strike a vein of flowing water ? not seepage nor mere moisture ? at 111/4 feet " was startling enough ; but to this talent he had added a wholly new element : a telepathic awareness of the underground water situation in places several miles distant . Henry 's " awarenesses , " if this be the suitable word , were followed up by trips to the actual locations , where the rod confirmed them ; wells were dug and water was found ? at the depth and in the volume predicted from miles away . For the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry Gross 's attitude toward his own powers then , as when I came later to know him , was one of deep humility coupled with keen curiosity . It was an uncomfortable experience , but , by gorry , he was going to see it through . Henry 's " awareness " seemed as confident and as accurate at twelve miles as at two miles . What about a hundred miles ? Five hundred miles ? Out of this speculation had come Henry 's map-dowsing of the supposedly waterless island of Bermuda , eight hundred miles from the Roberts home in Maine , and the subsequent finding of abundant fresh water at points where Henry had said ? in Maine ? that water would be encountered . For the details of this episode ? a painful story of triumph over lethargy and disbelief ? the reader is again referred to the book . I knew nothing of this ; and so I was utterly unprepared for the letter which Kenneth wrote me from Bermuda on December 12 , 1949 . On . a hunch that if Henry could dowse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bermuda , he had handed my discouraged letter to Henry with the remark : " See what this guy has on his farm . " Henry queried his rod , and Kenneth wrote : Your dry wells showed that you used the wrong dowsers . Henry Gross , for example , says that you have two veins on your farm ; on October 1 , when you were having a drought , they came together at a depth of 15 feet . Consequently these veins will flow during the most severedroughts . No. 1 vein on October 1 flowed 21/4 gallons a minute ; No. 2 on October 1 flowed 41A gallons a minute . Neither of your wells was on either vein . One of your wells is 18 feet from your No. 1 vein at the nearest point . From the center of your kitchen it 's 132 feet to the place where the veins come together . The veins rise from between northwest and west , and flow between east and southeast . 430 feet from kitchen , veins originate in a dome . Five veins flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . . . . I think we can find some way to run over to Saxtons River after I get back in the spring . Keep Henry 's long-distance dope on your place , and we 'll pinpoint his findings on the spot . I felt wretched about this . It suggested that Kenneth was indulging in an elaborate joke , in not too good taste , or that something had happened to his mind . Neither he nor Henry had ever visited my farm ; they had no topographic map of the region , and no clue to the place beyond my mention of " a hillside farm . " I was a little startled by " The veins rise from between northwest and west , and flow between east and southeast , " for this was exactly in accord with our local topography ; but I was more sad than startled . I wrote a nice sort of " Well , well , well ! " letter . Kenneth replied at once . He had meant what he said , and would bring Henry over next spring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our farm on June 3 , 1950 , is briefly reported in Henry Gross and His Dowsing Rod . Certain procedural details , however , may be interesting . I had prepared a letter-size topographic map of the farm , and this I carried with me on a clip-board , marking it with crosses at the points where we drove stakes at Henry 's direction , and entering Henry 's figures about each vein : depth to top of vein ; depth to bottom ; width of vein ; and flow of water in gallons per minute . Henry quickly located " veins No. 1 and No. 2 " which he had reported from Bermuda , traced their courses for a short distance east and west , and located the point where they " joined at a depth of 15 feet . " Just below this junction my son Jack attempted to bore down to water with a post-hole auger . At a depth of 51/4 feet he encountered such a concentration of loose field stones that he could dig no farther . Henry traced the vein farther down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow path , to a point where he said the vein lay only 30 inches below the surface . Here the digging was easy . At exactly 30 inches ( yardstick ) the auger struck gravel , and clear water swirled into the hole , rising rapidly to a level 17 inches below the surface . Describing this in his book , Kenneth omitted an interesting detail . The Bermuda diagnosis included this statement : " One of the veins flows within 18 feet of your old well . " When Henry located the two veins north of the house and indicated their courses , we stood about 35 feet from this well . I followed " upstream " what Henry indicated as the course of the nearer vein and drove a stake at the point where it came closest to the old well . Later I measured the distance with a steel tape . It was 18 feet . But Henry did not see the well at all . It was covered at ground level with a stone slab , and the slab was completely hidden by waist-high grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these combined veins was at an awkward spot for the village fire department to reach in winter . The Bermuda diagnosis had included the statement : " Five veins flow out of this dome . " Our last dowser had also suggested a dome near the crest of the ridge west of the house , and my wife remembered that young Brooks , practising his newly-discovered " gift , " believed he had located water in the hayfield which occupied a terrace just above our garden . There was a persistent damp area in this field . So Henry was asked , almost as an afterthought , to investigate . He was keenly interested . Henry stood at the south end of our house , lifted his forked stick ( sugar maple ) into the operating position I have described , faced southward down our road , and questioned the rod mentally . " Is there a vein in this direction ? " The rod bent forward and down . This meant " Yes . " Passivity would have meant " No . " He released his grip , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nearest point in the vein ? " ? and he rotated his body slowly to the right , from south toward west . Almost immediately it dipped . " There , huh ? " He faced this direction and raised the rod . " How far from here is the nearest point ? Is it twenty yards ? " The rod dipped Yes . " Is it forty yards ? " No response . " Is it thirty yards ? " The rod dipped Yes . " Is it thirtyfive yards ? " ( In artillery parlance , Henry was bracketing his target by shooting over , then under , until he found the range . ) The rod dipped Yes . " . He paced it off , holding his rod just above his chest . At thirty-five paces , plus a few inches , the rod dipped . " Center of the vein , " said Henry . Note that the rod did not begin to bend downward as he approached the vein , nor did it dip as he reached the edge of the vein ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drove a stake . Standing beside the stake , Henry queried his rod about the depth and width of the vein while I wrote down the answers . He used the same " bracketing " method in finding the answer to each question . As with certain modern electronic computing machines , his questions must apparently be so framed as to permit a yes-or-no answer . This is an attractive analogy , but I have no way of knowing whether its validity extends beyond superficial resemblance ? an interesting problem , perhaps , for Professor Norbert Wiener , who finds psychological resemblances between the human mind and the machines he designs . According to Henry 's rod this vein had considerably more flow than the combined veins we had tapped with a post-hole auger . It was close to the road , so that the fire department could reach a new well at this point . The vein was about 111/2 feet wide . Water would be reached at a depth of 7 feet , and the bottom of the vein at a further depth of 41/2 feet ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures on my map beside the cross indicating where we had driven the stake . IV Two months later we opened this vein . On August 9 , 1950 , Fred Carmen of Alstead , New Hampshire , arrived with his power shovel and bulldozer . I wanted a big hole , which would extend considerably beyond the sides of what Henry had indicated as the width of the vein ; for if Henry 's figures were to be conclusively checked , it would be necessary to expose the entire cross section and measure it . I asked Mr. Carmen , of course , whether he " believed in dowsing . " " I sure do , " he said . He told me that he had dug thirteen wells for H. E. Wells , the dowser . ( Wells owns a drilling rig , but he employs Carmen where digging rather than drilling is indicated . Power digging is enormously faster than hand digging , and is usually much cheaper . ) Mr. Wells , he told me , had been exactly right thirteen times out of thirteen . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vein under the weight of heavy power equipment , he knew precisely what hazards were involved . He maneuvered his big machine into position with utmost caution and delicacy . It was a power shovel of the type called a " back-hoe , " which chops down vertically and draws the excavated material back toward the body of the machine before lifting it and throwing it aside . I had my field notes of June 3 , and I stood by with a fifty-foot steel tape . We attacked the " upstream " face of the vein across its width and about two feet beyond it on each side , exposing it quickly in bites of nearly a cubic yard each . Moisture and seepage were encountered at 5 feet ; water spurted from the cut at 7 feet and thereafter ; and the bottom of the vein , consisting of tough , impermeable " hardpan , " was reached at 1 1 IA feet . The vein itself , entirely surrounded and enclosed by this hardpan , consisted of a matrix of slightly porous sand /11/4 feet wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow vertical seams of coarser material through which the water flowed freely . I measured the width between the outer edges of the outermost seams . Henry Gross had been correct to the inch . The mathematical probability that Henry could have guessed correctly at the exact location of this vein , and arrived at its exact dimensions by chance , is of the same order as the probability that a monkey with a typewriter could ( all cheating barred ) type an article identical with this one by the accidental pounding of keys over a period of a hundred years . In the language of the monkey-lovingest layman , the chances are pretty slim . W HATEVER it is that tells Henry Gross about underground water can not be attributed to any of the forces we know about at present . All the familiar " radiant " forces which act from a distance ? light , heat , magnetism , radio , gravitation ? share one unvarying characteristic : their intensity diminishes with the square of the distance from which they act . But whatever it is that affects Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by distance at all . And in several other respects ? in its failure to report his approach to water until he is over the center of the vein , for example . and particularly in its answering of questions ? it defies any principles familiar to us . Furthermore , his insistence upon " domes " suggests something new to geology . Last November Dr. William W. Rubey of the United States Geological Survey ventured a theory that a small but significant fraction of the water reaching the oceans may not be rain water at all , but water which is constantly being given off by the deeper rocks of the earth 's crust . In the vast course of the earth 's history the accumulation of such waters must have been enormous ? enough , perhaps , to account for most of the present oceans . From such a theory as this one might perhaps speculate that this water may be forced upward at favorable places by pressures in the earth 's crust , to emerge in hilltop springs and " domes . " But at present Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not propose to argue such matters . To me what happens is a mystery . My purpose is simply to testify that I have seen it happen . I hope that this account of a personal experience may lead my readers , especially scientific-minded readers , to make shamefaced experiments in dowsing to discover if they possess this baffling faculty . Two of my dowsers believed that one person in twelve or thirteen could locate water with a forked stick . Henry Gross believes that one person in ten has the knack to some degree . Certainly a great many persons can dowse but do not know it ; certainly the discovery that dowsing is an unexpectedly common talent should give a huge impetus to scientific acceptance and investigation ? and to training , for this is evidently possible ; and certainly the uncanny feeling of a forked stick when it comes to life in one 's hands is worth a year of magazine articles .
