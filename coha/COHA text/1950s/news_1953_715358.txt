txt This atomic city may have surprised the rest of the nation this week by turning down local self-government in favor of continued federal control over the community , but it did n't surprise itself . Most of the 31,000 residents seem to like the dictatorship they live under . The " dictator " is the atomic energy commission , which owns . Oak Ridge lock , stock , and barrel . . The AEC administers this fifth largest of Tennessee 's cities as a sort of gigantic " company town . " It owns the city 's 8,600 homes and apartments and decides to whom it will rent them . It leases commercial buildings to business men , and it leases land to others who want to build commercial structures and operate businesses in . them . $1,335,000 to Run a Year The AEC also thru a private , nonprofit concern , performs all the functions that in most American cities are controled by the municipal government and a few others , too . It runs the police and fire departments , attends to the pub ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishes building zoning rules , and paves the streets and maintains all public structures . It sells coal the principal fuel for heating and runs 11 schools one high school , one junior high , and nine elementary . It costs the AEC approximately $3,700,000 a year to run the city of Oak Ridge . However , rents and other forms of income brought the cost to the federal government in the fiscal year ended last June 30 down to $1,335,000 . The citizens every two years elect a seven member town coun cii , but this group has no author ' ity . It can advise the AEC as to the wishes of the electorate , but the AEC can , and sometimes does , ignore this advice . Built as Secret Roost However , the commission is a ' benevolent dictator , and a decidedly reluctant one . It is in the business of municipal government only because it inherited Oak Ridge from the army and now ca n't let go . The city was built in World War II as a secret roost for the . workers needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AEC took it over in 1947 , along ? with all the other facilities on the atomic reservation of approximately 59,000 acres . Until 1949 the entire reservation , including the city of Oak Ridge , was closed to the public . Only essential personnel and their families were permitted to enter the city . In 1949 the atom plants were fenced off in a 34,762 acre tract which the AEC calls the " controled area . " This means you ca n't get into it unless you have necessary business there . Almost no one except employes gets in . The 24,000 other acres of the total reservation , including the city itself , then were opened to the public . The citizens of Oak Ridge did n't care much for that either . They had grown accustomed to the protective arm of the federal government ; they had come to like the benefits and ignore the restrictions and loss of liberty involved in their secluded way of life . A public ribbon cutting ceremony was arranged to mark the " opening of the gates "  --  a literal term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to demonstrate their opposition to the idea . Parent-Teacher association and other civic meetings discussed the opening in angry terms . Trying to Get Out of Business The AEC representative today recalled that he saw a woman , a college graduate , stand up at a PTA meeting , break into tears , and demand to know how her two teen-age children could possibly make their way safely between home and school . She envisioned an invasion of gun-toting city hoodlums , drunken drivers , and other criminal menaces . Many residents objected to the opening simply on the ground that they would have to lock their doors ? something previously unheard of in Oak Ridge . But the AEC went ahead with the opening of the gates . Many Oak Ridgers now look back fondly on the " good old days " when the city was closed to outsiders . And they still do n't lock their doors . The opening of the gates was the first step in the AEC 's long range program , the aim of which is to get the commission out of the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission hopes to sell all the homes and businesses in the city to private owners , turn the local government over to the people , and quietly concentrate on split ' ting atoms . Gordon Dean , commission chairman , remarked recently that the atomic cities there are others at other atomic facilities , but none as large as Oak Ridge " take 10 per cent of our budget and cause 90 per cent of our trouble . " He did not intend the figures to be accurate , but merely to reflect the AEC attitude toward its job of running Oak , Ridge . Director and Two Aids The commission 's management of the city of Oak Ridge is in the hands of Frederick W. Ford , whose title is director of the office of community affairs . City Man , ager Fred C. Peitzsch , who directs municipal departments , and Chief of Commercial Services Russell Field Jr. , who is the AEC 's landlord and also operates the local bus service and utilities , both work under Ford . Ford , a humorously inclined New Englander with broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My job here is to work myself out of a job . " It 's not easy , because Oak Ridgers are reluctant to take on the responsibility of governing themselves . They demonstrated their reluctance last Tuesday , voting 4,584 to 1,120 against municipal incorporation in an advisory referendum . But Ford thinks they can be persuaded , eventually . He also admits that should Oak Ridge fail to rise to the traditional level of American community responsibility its failure may be the sign of an American political decay of ominous proportions .
