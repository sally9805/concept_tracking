Her throttles wide open , the Star of the East , a DC-4 of Pan American World Airways ' Cuban affiliate Aviacion Cubana , roared northeastward out of Bermuda 's Kindley Field before dawn one day last week . Just after the takeoff , one of the four engines of the Madrid-to-Havana plane faltered . " I was just going to run to the front of the cabin and warn the passengers when we hit the water , " Steward Orlando Lopez Suarez later recalled . " The tail broke off ... I found a rubber dinghy , but it was punctured and would not inflate . . . then the plane sank and I guess the other people sank because they had their seat belts fastened .
