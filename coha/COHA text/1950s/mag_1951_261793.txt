BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> Five bearded men , in rags that had once been uniforms , staggered into the French outpost town of Tienyen 35 miles from Moncay on the Chinese border one day last week . They were Foreign Legionnaires , former Wehrmacht soldiers , who had been captured by Ho Chi Minh 's Communists in the worst days of French reversals last September . Told by Communists that the whole Red River delta , except the port of Haiphong , was in Communist hands , the Legionnaires had escaped , made tracks for Haiphong . They were astonished to find the French still in Tienyen , more astonished when the French told them about the action profonde which had regained the lost ground and changed the entire psychology of the French army and its supporters . When a Legionnaire asked how it happened , the answer was brief : General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny . <P> A TIME correspondent in Hanoi last week described the vital change that has come over the French : <P> SIX weeks ago , the French were dizzily off balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the war as already lost . Vietnamese were changing Viet Nam piasters into Ho Chi Minh 's currency . The whole population seemed agreed that Hanoi would be in Ho 's hands by year 's end . <P> No Flight . Then De Lattre moved in . He made a thorough housecleaning of the desultory , limp French military and civilian setup . Typical De Lattre gesture : stepping aboard his plane , he noticed that two members of the crew wore luxuriant beards . Said he : " Soldiers are clean-shaven . We take off in ten minutes . " Ten minutes later , a clean-shaven crew took off with De Lattre aboard . <P> He personally coached staff officers in new methods , scrapped the old French system of small outlying strong points for a modern system of strong elements dug in depth . He brought in new ships , planes and equipment ( including some U.S. B-26s , Hellcat fighters and 30 Sherman tanks ) , new troops and a full signal company for his headquarters ' use . <P> He canceled the order evacuating French women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in Hanoi . Unlike the generals who preceded him , he spends most of his time there . He went out to the units in the field , made short , tough , sentimental speeches , said that he was proud to be a French soldier among French soldiers and that he would not tolerate the shame to France of being licked . I saw Legionnaires shed tears at these speeches . <P> No Defeatism . Then De Lattre threw in his brief , spectacular counterattack ( TIME , Jan. 15 ) . The attack cut off Viet Minh access to the Bay of Tonking and thus to sea communication with Communist Hainan , where a Chinese Communist fleet is reported ready with arms and food for Ho . Today Hanoi is a thronging , roaring place again . There is a feverish movement of troops and a feeling that something vital is happening . The city is geared to war , not to dreary defeatism . <P> The Vietnamese have been particularly sensitive to De Lattre 's influence . Said a Vietnamese spokesman last week : " This man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately get the independence that seemed a short time ago only across the road . " But De Lattre has guaranteed Viet Nam independence . And the Vietnamese are willing to wait .
