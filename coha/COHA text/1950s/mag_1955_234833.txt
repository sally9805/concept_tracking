A GHOST AT NOON ( 247 pp. ) - Alberto Moravia-Farrar , Straus ( 3.50 ) . <P> When a man who is desperately in love with his wife discovers that she despises him , he naturally tries to do something about it . Riccardo did something about it : he talked and talked . Why , he asked Emilia , do you despise me ? What have I done ? Ca n't we talk it over ? Riccardo also thought and thought . Is it my character She hates ? Does she think I 'm using her to get on in my work ? Have I fallen from grace because I go on being a scriptwriter when I really want to be a playwright ? Shall I give up my job ? Riccardo thought and then talked some more . <P> Poor , tortured Riccardo is the Hamlet-like hero-victim of Italian Novelist Alberto ( Conjugal Love ) Moravia 's latest novel , A Ghost at Noon . To give his lovely but simple wife the comfortable life she wants , Riccardo has put aside his ambition to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has even bought a car and is in debt . But his first script is a success , Producer Battista has given him a new and more important one to do , and the drab days in a furnished room in Rome seem well behind . It is typical of Author Moravia that conjugal hell lies just a step away from marital contentment . For at about this point Emilia takes to sleeping alone , begins to be less indifferent to the vulgar producer , and makes it plain that Riccardo bores her . The rest of A Ghost is a battle between the sexes fought out on the battlegrounds of character and personality , areas in which Moravia is one of the world 's living masters . <P> Working on the script of a supercolossal production of Homer 's Odyssey , Riccardo compares Emilia with Penelope , himself with Ulysses , resorts to nagging his wife and to endless intellectual soliloquies instead of being the forceful man Emilia wants him to be . In the end he takes to daydreaming that Emilia has come back to him , loses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader as for Riccardo . <P> A Ghost at Noon is far from being Moravia 's best book . It is all too spelled-out , and Riccardo is so uninteresting that Emilia 's contempt is inevitable . A fine short-story writer , Moravia could have improved A Ghost vastly by scrapping half of it . But even as it stands , this is a penetrating look at embattled personalities , a marital case history that the great Stendhal would have savored with pleasure .
