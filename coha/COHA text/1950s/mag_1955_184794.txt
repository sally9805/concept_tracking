THE REVELATIONS OF DR . MODESTO ( 256 pp. ) - Alan Harrington-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> If Hal Hingham were a philosopher instead of a life-insurance salesman , he might sum himself up by saying : " I dread , therefore I am . " The realest thing about young Hal , a tenth-rate agent for Arcadia Life , is the queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach when he faces his boss , his girl , or anyone else . As he somnambulates through life with a nagging sense of being out of step , people bump into him as if he were invisible , and prospects look out the window when he wants them to sign on the dotted line . Snaps his girl friend Rose : " You do n't even look as if you were going anywhere . " <P> Then , leafing idly through a magazine one evening , Hal is speared by a finger pointing at him from one of the ads : <P> " STOP ! WHY ARE YOU UNHAPPY ? FAIL URE ? TRY CENTRALISM ! . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ' from other people . It makes you Absolutely Normal-in a matter of hours . . . Gives you a STRANGE POWER over others , for no one can help loving you . " The ad is signed in towering capitals : DR . MODESTO . <P> Moderation Plus Mediocrity . The " revelations " of Dr. Modesto arrive in a large white envelope stamped " CENTRALISM is FOR YOU , " and form the core of this uneven but intriguing first novel by Alan Harrington . The doctrine of " Centralism " and what it does to Hal Hingham gives Author Harrington , a Manhattan public-relations man , a slingshot with which to launch provocative pebbles at the panjandrums of selfhelp , the positive thinkers , the conformists , and the problems of 20th-century " adjustment . " <P> Dr. Modesto breaks down Centralism into 30 rules , but its heart is " Do n't Be Yourself " ( " Since your self grates on others , and makes you miserable , get rid of it " ) . The happy man is the one " Just Like Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' one must " live centrally , " even moving to the center of town . <P> Modestotality further demands : 1 ) " Think centrally , which is to say , believe in nothing , but give your loyalty to any popular cause in the vicinity . " 2 ) " Work centrally . . . You should not rise to the top . Get ahead , but moderately . " 3 ) " Play centrally . Never be a champion . . . You will know the joys of coming in second when the chips are down . " The reward for all this : " The ecstasy of mediocrity . " <P> O. Henry Plus Riesman . Centralism works wonders for Hal Hingham . He moves out of his roach-ridden boardinghouse and into a smart hotel ; he gets waiters to seat him where he wishes ; he sweeps a startled Rose into bed with her clothes on after a three-year kissless courtship . And in one day on the road , he sells enough insurance to become one of Arcadia 's top-ranking salesmen and nearly violate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
