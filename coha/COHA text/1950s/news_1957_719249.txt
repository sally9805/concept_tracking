txt Most people are more or less confused about the current activities of the stock market , but we bet the most confused of all are the Russians . While Khrushchev was bellowing about United States plans to drive Turkey into war with Syria , with plain intimations of a global holocaust to follow , the market was dropping to its lowest points in a couple of years . Yesterday , when it seemed less likely that Khrushchev or his Soviet stooges actually intended to start shooting , the market was shooting up . This does not conform at all to the Communist understanding of the workings of " monopoly capitalism . " According to the Communists , the " monopolists , " who of course control the Government along with everything else , are always plotting war in their greed for profits . Ergo the market should go up on war talk and down on peace talk . Actually nothing can be that simple which involves the individual decisions of millions of Americans . But a war scare , among other things like a President 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . This has little to do with profits but a great deal to do with people 's uncertainty . An outbreak of war may tend to have the opposite effect at first , since it represents a certainty of the moment , but after the pattern of wartime economic mobilization becomes visible the market may well go down again . So we do n't blame the Kremlin for being mystified . And we offer this gratuitous comfort to American investors ? whatever may have happened to their paper profits lately , they can at least reflect that they are sure confusing the enemy .
