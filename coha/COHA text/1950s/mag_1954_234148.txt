Britain 's sensational newspapers , which often display a lamentable ignorance in their coverage of the U.S. ( TIME , Feb. 2 , 1953 ) , last week went one better . They showed the same sort of ignorance of the customs and temperament of the people of the Commonwealth in their coverage of Queen Elizabeth 's good-will tour of Australia and New Zealand . In reporting on the warm , enthusiastic reception Australians gave the Queen and her party , some of the papers went overboard . After the Australian minister in charge of the royal tour cautioned the crowds not to throw small flags into the royal car and to show " Australian sportsmanship and fair play , " some London papers ' treated the warning with scare headlines . GO <P> EASY ! YOU MAY HARM THE QUEEN , <P> CROWDS TOLD , screamed the London Daily Mirror , biggest daily in the world ( circ. 4,132,700 ) . PLEASE AUSTRALIA , YOU <P> MUST LOOK AFTER THE QUEEN , headlined News of the World , biggest weekly newspaper in the world ( 8,230,158 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Australia with the force of a well-thrown boomerang . <P> Furphies &; Training . As a result , in New Zealand , London newsmen traveling with the Queen were greeted by crowds yelling : " Go home , you pommy a newcomer from England liars . " Last week in Australia , under the headline CUT IT OUT CHUMS ! , the Sydney Daily Telegraph ( circ. 310,000 ) jeered at Fleet Streeters for reporting that the Queen 's safety was in danger because of the crowds and the rigors of her tour . Said the Telegraph : " England can disregard these furphies Australian slang for wild rumors . The only danger seems to be that the hustling correspondents have had to do may cause them overfatigue due to faulty training . But the Queen , who has been trained for the job , obviously does n't feel the same strain as apparently besets English journalists puffing in her wake . " <P> The London Economist lent its weight to the Australians ' complaint in an article titled " Aboriginals in Fleet Street . " " The Queen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither royalty nor antipodean affection can be blamed . The fault lies with certain London daily newspapers . . . Several correspondents covering the tour have expressed the hope that they could return at leisure and really learn something . It might pay their employers to help them to do so . " <P> <P> Grass Skirts &; Trees . When the Queen was in New Zealand , many a British newsman reported on the country with the open-mouthed naivete of a well-heeled dowager touring the slums . One reporter smugly confessed that she had always thought the Maoris , the civilized descendants of New Zealand 's aboriginal tribes , lived in trees . Even the sober London Daily Telegraph said that the Maoris ' dances " were rather like a fancy dress ball in a Turkish bath . " Most London papers gleefully ridiculed the Maoris for dressing up in the costumes of their ancestors .
