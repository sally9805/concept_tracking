Algeria 's Moslems have a saying : " When it is very hot in Tunisia or Morocco , it is warm in Algeria . " The violence that has erupted so often in Tunisia and Morocco has caused only tremors in Algeria . But last week , for the first time in nine years , it was very hot in Algeria . <P> Paris was shocked ; unlike Tunisia and Morocco ( " protectorates " in name , but actually colonies ) , Algeria is part of metropolitan France , and its people , Arab and Frenchman alike , are French citizens . Algeria 's three departments have as much standing in the French Assembly as any departments between the Pyrenees and the Rhine . <P> The rattle of guns started in Algeria one morning , an hour after midnight , and seemed to be directed from a single central source : <P> At Ouillis ( near Oran ) a guard surprised a group of armed men who were trying to wreck a power transformer . <P> They shot him dead . <P> A young Frenchman named Laurent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police station in Cassaigne for protection . At the station entrance , a shot from the shadows drilled him through the head . <P> In the mountain district of Aures , terrorists stopped a car containing a kaid ( rural chieftain ) who was also a French army captain , and a young French husband and wife who were teachers . They clubbed the kaid to a pulp , then killed the Frenchman , then stabbed and raped the young woman , who survived and was rescued . <P> Terrorists closed in on Arris , the administrative center of Aures , poured in repeated volleys of rifle fire . All the inhabitants of Foum-Toub were evacuated , to prevent slaughter or capture by the bandits . <P> Pursuit in the Hills . When the bloody day ended , eight Frenchmen and pro-French natives were dead , more than 30 wounded . Paris Le Monde lamented : " All this happened as if an invisible hand were looking for a way to destroy Franco-North African solidarity at the exact moment when we were about ready to strengthen it . " Premier Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , had just served notice , in one of his fireside chats , that his government was going ahead with plans to let French Africa " have her large part in the social and economic expansion of the entire French Union . " <P> At the urging of Governor General Roger Leonard , Paris dispatched 1,600 paratroopers and 1,400 security troops to reinforce the 10,000 soldiers already in Algeria . French armored columns pursued the terrorists up deep ravines in the mountains , with fighter planes for cover . In the cities , known nationalist hangouts were raided , more than 175 suspects jailed . Even some homes of North Africans living in Marseille and Lyon were searched . <P> " The Only Negotiation . . . " French officials blamed the outbreak on three sinister influences acting in concert : 1 ) Tunisian fellaghas ( bandits ) , hard-pressed in their own country , who had crossed the Algerian border ; 2 ) the inflammatory Cairo radio ; 3 ) the extremist nationalist Algerian movement known as the MTLD ( Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exile at Les Sables-d'Olonne , France , but reported in contact with Algerian underground leaders , and suspected of being the hand that set off last week 's synchronized violence .
