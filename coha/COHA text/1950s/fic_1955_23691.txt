A Point of Law A Story by Morris L. Ernst Drawings by Lillian Freedgood ? s ix of us crowded around the small , stained table . The air in the room was thick and the noise of the chatter was insistent . The six of us had one thing which bound us together  --  we were lonely . Each midnight we would meet at this midtown speakeasy for two or three hours . Any place rather than home . Not that we did n't have agreeable homes . It takes years of odd chances for a group like ours to form . The talk was seldom exciting . The laughs were few . No one was ever really gay . Such intimacy as there was seemed superficial , though the warmth we felt toward each other was real . It was a kind of relationship that stuck because no one of us would dream of asking a favor of any other . A request was something like the old man ordering you around when you were a kid . It meant domination or tyranny . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone said something about the Baer-Carnera fight . Al shunted it to the subject of showing off . Phil picked up Maxie 's yawn and the arrogance of the way he thumbed his nose at chance . Mary said you could n't yawn when you wanted to . It was a reflex . No , it was a suggestion . I wondered what they would find our twentieth-century folklore to be . Did n't folklore end with the discovery of printing ? Lou thought it was still there , buried under tons of tabloids . Hope the newspaper reporters get what they are after in the way of wages without a strike . " They wo n't , " said Phil . They do n't want it enough to win it . " " No one wants anything enough , " said Ed. " / do n't want to go home , and I do n't want to stay . " There 's not much use wanting , " Ed continued . " We 're living in a glut . Here I spend all day at the bank adding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault less than ten hours ago . Millions of dollars that the vaults did n't care about and that millions of people wanted . " Someone said that dirt was misplaced earth and Ed picked the remark up to show that nearly everything was dirty because everything was misplaced . Wheat was n't meant for warehouses , but for stomachs . Cotton was n't meant for rotting in the fields , but for clothes . No one ever had just the right amount of anything  --  they always had too much or too little . 0 NE more round of brandies . We drank little brandy ponies , not beer like the young boys in the back room or whisky concoctions like the wisecracking literary crowd at the rattan table in the other corner . " Do n't glut your brandy , " Phil said . He was the only wise one of the bunch . He knew what all this cockeyed world was about . " Not much , " he used to say . " Just cockeyed . It ca n't mean anything until we get over that damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one gets what he deserves . Everyone deserves much more of everything than he has . The hungry deserve food , the rich deserve thrills and excitement , the humble deserve fortitude , the old maids deserve lovers . There 's plenty to go around , A POINT even of lovers . We just have to learn to be ruthless . " Ed looked at . Phil and you could see he envied him . Ed was a soft , sensitive man . He and Mary had tried for one whole spring to trample people . But they had none of the underfoot power that pushed Phil up to what everyone thought was success . Ed kept harping on die gluts of life . " Maybe time is the biggest surplus . Killing time is the only way to kill the glut of lifc . " T SUGGESTED there was a limit to that idea because the worthy legislature of the Em- pire State had declared in solemn words that to attempt suicide was a crime . " You see , " I said , " you have a legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and illegal if you fail in the attempt . " " There 's no need of such a law , " said Ed . " When people are tired of life  --  really glutted with it , they just go off and die . And other people keep on living long after the doctors have said Finis . The rule works both ways . Everyone dies when he 's through . book at your transatlantic fliers . Most of them have died . They wanted to . At least they cared so little about living that they took longer odds than any of us would take . " " Nonsense , " said Al . " You might want to live and the next thing you know , or do n't know , you are run down right at Fifth Avenue by a brand-new taxicab . " Ed was n't convinced . " How could we know if when you were hit by the cab you had n't been mooning or dreaming or behaving in some careless way ? I do n't mean careless about crossing streets . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble with his theory for , if the taxi hit a drunk , surely the Lord took care of children and drunks . Ed was still in doubt . He picked up Mary 's half-empty Camel package . gulped down the last few sips in her brandy glass , grabbed her hand , and said , " Go to it , Gluts . We 're off for home . See you Thursday . " We all liked Ed . For that matter , we liked each other . But that did n't stop us from reaching for the meanest and most improbable explanations for any of our failures or lonelinesses . Before Ed and Mary had gone out through the second door , Phil had started in on them . " What a lucky couple they are . They got the perfect break when that kid of theirs died . If it had happened to them sooner  --  or later  --  it would have killed them . People do n't learn From books or talk or law or even experience . The only hope is a blow , a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of " There 's not much use wanting . . . " life . Mine all came during adolescence , and they are n't worth a damn that way . They hit into mush , not bone and muscle . " Mario came around : " Last rounds . Have n't you got homes ? It 's after three . Drink ' em up . " I never did go back to Mario 's . That corner suddenly became too alive for me because our talk that night was tied to life , and talk is only safe if it is remote and unreal . What I wanted was safety  --  safety from what I never quite knew . 8 Y THE time I got home the phone was ringing . " Mary , what the hell ? Hit ? Hurt ? I 'll be right over . " I grabbed a cab and got to Ed and Mary 's neat respectable three-room apartment in no time . As I came in the door Mary looked stunned and calm . " I guess he really meant it , Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died and he felt the glut . It all happened so suddenly , I guess that 's why I ca n't cry . And it was a taxi . I do n't know whether it was new or not . " Words were no use . I grabbed Mary 's two hands , pulled her toward me , sat her on the couch . There we sat for minutes while softly , occasionally , I patted her shoulder . She looked ahead at a wall on which I have no doubt thousands of pictures appeared . It is n't the drowning who get a kaleidoscopic view of past events . It 's the ones who do n't drown , who are left behind , who gather in a pied fashion all the little pictures that make up a history . The first glance of the eye , the sheepish look when the pay was cut , the envy when another suitor stepped in , the tears when the doctor said the baby could n't live , the walking trip in Vermont , the hatred of cousin May who loaned that never-repaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator boy from the apartment house and the doctor who lived downstairs had put Ed on the bed . Mary smiled as she looked at the two beds , because , she whispered to me , they had put Ed on her bed and not his own . As if that could mean something , because , when things like birth and marriage and death happen , they seem to give everything else a special and intended meaning . Ed did n't look happy . He looked just as he had when he described people starving in the middle of millions of dollars . Maybe when the cab hit him he was saying , " Too damn many cabs and thousands of people have to walk to work . " T HE doctor was writing with a gold pencil on a neat little pad . On the top of each sheet one of those forbidding R 's with a line across appeared . The doctor was making an inventory , a stock taking . Name , age , occupation , time , place , cause . That 's the hurdle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wet pavement . A tired Ed . A few brandies . An urge to keep Mary from slipping . A taxi-driver in a hurry . Cause of the hurry leads into many more paths . Maybe the driver had been riding the street for twelve hours . Maybe he had a Mary at home . Maybe he had had a brandy or even just a beer . Maybe he was dreaming or trying to figure out for the thousandth time how little he hadearned during his long hours of hacking . Can one forget so easily about everything within reach when one tries to figure out 40 per cent of $8.60 plus $1.65 in tips , less that sandwich at lunch time and the two beers ? The doctor obviously was n't interested in anything that did n't show on a meter . Blood pressure and temperature are real to doctors because they show up in numbers . " How many drinks ? " he asked . He did n't know how to acid or balance drinks against wishes or dreams . Mary did n't seem concerned . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what people could say . George , the elevator boy , was n't white and calm and Anglo-Saxon . He was afraid of death , he had liked Ed , and , you could see , he wanted to do something about it . He waited respectfully for the doctor to finish his minute scribbling . Then , with zeal , he told about the cab that had swerved in toward the curb . " No sir , the taxi did n't run right off . He helped me pick up Mr. Ed . We laid him on the long stone bench in the lobby . " And then with a pride that overwhelmed death or pain he nearly shouted , " I got his number . " ARY looked my way . She seemed to want an ending without a man hunt . The doctor just put down the number . I confess my law training started my mind off with the taxi-driver 's number as a springboard . Tort action . Worthless against one of the poverty-stricken driver-owner cabs . Hope it was one of the big fleets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A teetotaler on the jury will heat Mary . What can we do with that hit-and-run law ? Maybe that driver did run away too soon . No use jailing him just because I do n't happen to know his wife . Funny if he should he married to a girl named Mary . Maybe they just had a baby who died . Maybe he wants to live . Has Mary got any money to live on ? Ed did n't leave a nickel , I 'm sure , unless he had some insurance . Mary stopped the excited George , the mathematical doctor , and myself from stepping out further into our only possible roles in the scene . " Wo n't you all go ? There are too many people here . Ed and I had a swell start being alone and hardly talking to each other . I want to go over all that once more . Do n't worry about me . " A POINT George said , " Good night , Mrs. Wells . I 'm in the hall if you want me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good night . I closed the door without a word . W HEN people die they leave what is called affairs , which someone has to look after . Mary did n't call me in , or retain me , as we say . I just took charge , and soon found out that for the law there were no affairs , only an affair . Board of health , police department , hack-drivers ' bureaus , district attorneys , and judges were all put into motion . A cab had hit Ed Wells . Society blew its trumpet call  --  something had to be done . A thing called justice had to be dug up out of it all . What appeared on the police blotter was clear . Aleck Sambino , age 47 , married , no children , residence 618 East Moon Street , good reputation , only two prior convictions and both for passing traffic lights , six years working for Ed Maloney 's small fleet , driving the same cab the last three years , formerly a carpenter 's assistant , sober , arrested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator boy . Declared he saw a drunken man and lady crossing the street . Man darted or reeled in front of the cab . Aleck thought no harm had been done . Just a bump . But he got scared and ran , after helping take the gent inside the apartment house . Mrs. Sambino was worried about her husband because when he got in at about four o'clock that morning he woke her up , a thing she did n't like and that did n't happen often . He told her he had waked her because he wanted her to know he had had some swell luck . Over twenty dollars . She remembered it very well because on the day before Aleck had been afraid to report to the boss that he had taken in only four dollars all day long ; so lie had driven through the park for six miles with his flag down as if he had picked up a fare . That 's how scared lie was of the boss and of losing his job . But Mrs. Sambino did n't understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saucer of milk out for the cat . Not until the cops came and arrested Aleck had he told her anything about that drunken man falling on the curb . The affair was ready . to come to court . Aleck might pay for his carelessness and particularly for hitting and running . Is n't it funny , I thought , how the lawmakers try to stop people from running away from the scenes where they have caused suffering . It 's lucky they try it only with automobile accidents . Emotional runovers lead to much speedier runoffs , but those ca n't be stopped . If Aleck were sent away his wife would be on the town  --  on the ever-increasing charity list . Aleck had some sensible defenses . He did n't mean to do it . He did n't know he had killed a man . He did n't know Ed . He was awful sorry for Mrs. Wells . And if all that was n't enough , then he could swear Ed had been drinking , and it was Ed 's fault , not Aleck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A s I went over Aleck 's story I did n't dare tell Mary that what happened in less than a minute might mean not only the end of Ed , but the jailing of Aleck and the misery of Aleck 's wife . Probably even Aleck 's cat would feel t he blow of Aleck 's cab a2ainst Ed 's body . But there was a further complication . Ed had left a ten-thousand-dollar insurance policy : " To Mary if she survives me , and if she predeceases me then to my heirs at law . " Ed was insured in a mutual company  --  one of those huge gatherings of capital and insurance policies where a few big shots run the entire works and once a year write to the policyholders : " Dear Member of Your Insurance Company . We want to tell you about the progress You have made in Your company during the last season . " All that " your " stuff fools people , even though it is just as remote and unreal as if they talked about your moon and your stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something to them . That was my job , for the agent calmly told me that Mary could n't get a cent under Ed 's policy if Ed was drunk at the time of the accident . " You see , " he explained , " Mr. Wells bought one of those cheaper policies which excluded " He ? vas careless with life . . . " any benefit in case of death while intoxicated . " All this big thing called justice might come down to a question of whether Ed took that last sip of brandy out of Mary 's glass before he left Mario 's , ages ago last Tuesday morning . A little brandy misplaced might put Aleck in jail or let him go free . And the samesips might mean misery and want for Aleck 's wife , or for Mary . Mary could make good use of the $10,000 ? and Aleck 's wife needed him for his $40 a week . 01 course , I had to tell Mary about the insurance company , and Aleck and Aleck 's wife and cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without seeming to hear they understand . " You mean , " she said , " who should get the money , Aleck 's wife or me . " " No , " . I said , " there 's no insurance money coming to Aleck 's wife . " She smiled , " Oh you lawyers , you one-track men . If Aleck goes to jail then his wife is out money , is n't she ? What difference does it make if it 's ten thousand in one hunk to me or forty dollars a week for the five years that Aleck may be up the river ? " " No difference , " I agreed . " Why ca n't we both have it ? " suggested Mary . It was just as if a poet had written the way out of the nation 's economic mess . " Why ca n't I get the insurance so that I can look around for a job , take my time , get my breath , and at the same time Aleck he allowed to drive his taxi in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose a part of a cent apiece . " 1 EXPLAINED that there was no way of taking a vote of all the policyholders ; that if they knew Mary they certainly would make the contribution gladly or at least they would n't care enough about the penny to vote against it . Then with one more line of poetry she hinted that maybe that was the function of a real judge  --  he should cast the ballot for the policyholders . He could look over Aleck and his wife and the cat , and Mary . and let everyone leave the courtroom in what people called happiness . This whimsy of Mary 's gave me my clue . At first I thought that if Mary never saw Aleck 's wife she might be willing to fight for the insurance money . It 's always fairly easy to rob a distant , invisible stranger . But I knew Mary , glimpsing Aleck and his wife in the courtroom on the day of Aleck 's trial , would never take care of herself . She did n't care enough about living and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least her clothes would surely have hung badly if they were purchased with Aleck 's loss of freedom . Then Mary pointed out to me one possible solution . T HE case of " People against Sambino " was called midst the shuffle of many feet in the magistrates ' court . The doctor took the stand . He was acting as if he was tou busy to tome to court and testify but I could see that not so deep down , he was having a fine time being oracular and pompous . No , he could n't he sure that Ed was drunk . The smell of the breath is n't a sure test . judge . No , not even a man 's walk can be used with certainty . No autopsy had been taken . Phil and Al and Lou told their simple stories of the two or three brandies  --  taken with no visible effect . But Ed had been hit by something before he landed at Mario 's that night , they all agreed . No one of them told the judge about the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of want . Aleck took the stand . I watched Mary as Aleck described Ed as frightfully unsteady on his legs , rolling , reeling , helped by his wife . Aleck was fighting to keep out of jail . He wanted to drive his hack tomorrow and tomorrow and many tomorrows . George added little to the evidence . You could see that to be a witness was important in his life , and he was only too anxious to put Aleck behind the bars . If the judge had talked to him privately , I am sure George would have revealed at least part of his motive , " Of course I 'm for my tenants . " At this stage of the case the judge could have guessed either way . Ed was drunk , Aleck gets off . Ed was not drunk , Aleck goes to jail . Originally I had planned to let nature take its course , but not to let Mary testify no matter what happened . However , when she had pointed to a potential way out for everyone , I made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After George had tried to beat Aleck and win Mary her 510,000 , I asked the judge to call Mary to the stand . I ca n't remember my questions nor Mary 's answers , because my part in the examination was unimportant . Mary told her story starting at the end and working backward . We all realized that that is the easiest way to explain the acts of human beings . If you tell of facts marching forward there always seem to be any number of forks orchokes and no single choice ever seems inevitable . If you start at death and move backward in time there seems to be only one path , because we have been trained to think of death as an ineluctable event at the end of a single road . " Ed wanted to die in front of Aleck 's cab at that very moment , " Mary stated . " Any cab would have answered his purpose .

Mary looked at me and said , " I think the judge decided wisely for all the policyholders , even though I should have confessed my own failure  --  I was n't able to get Ed to really want to live .
