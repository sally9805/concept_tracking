He said his physicians had told him he was making an " excellent recovery . " " I certainly feel that way , " he added . Mr. Dulles said it was esSen- ' tial that peace-loving nations strive for a " just and durable " peace in the Middle East through a general settlement of basic problems there . Such a settlement would include the fixing of permanent boundries between Israel and the Arab states and the resettlement of about 900 , - 000 Arab refugees , he said .

" Though emphasizing the need for a general Middle East settlement , Mr. Dulles did not say whether the United States would work to keep United Nations forces in the Suez Canal area long enough to encourage negotiations to settle existing differences .

" STATEMENT BY DULLES The text of Mr. Dulles ' statement follows : The doctors tell me that I am making an excellent recovery , and I certainly feel that way . I am deeply grateful for their expert surgery and the fine nursing care given me at Walter Reed Hospital . After a couple of weeks of sunshine at Key West I expect to be back at work . I am also grateful for the many prayers for me and messages for me from all over the world . I am proud of ' the way in which the State Department is functioning during my absence . Its problems are particularly difficult ; but they are being met in a superb manner by the loyal and dedicated effort of all workers , at all levels , under the fine leadership of the Acting Secretary of State , Mr. Hoover . As regards the Near East , ? we are , I think , on the right track . If the countries concerned show respect , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed through the General Assembly of the United Nations , that will give reason for hope for further progress toward stabl , peace in that troubled part of the world . It would , however , be a great mistake to believe that stability and tranquility can be permanently established merely by emergency measures to stop the fighting . It is necessary to attack the basic problems of the area . The many nations which want peace must also be prepared to struggle for the conditions necessary for a just and durable peace . In contrast to the positive influence of the United Nations in the Near East stands the conduct of the Soviet rulers . In defiance of United /Nations resolutions , they engaged in war against Hungary , with promiscuous slaughter . In relation to Near East affairs , they have tried to substitute themselves for the United Nations instead of acting as a cooperative member . The free nations can not relax their vigilance in the face of such arrogance and such vi6lations of basic principle . Dulles Arrives in Key West KEY WEST , Fla ..
