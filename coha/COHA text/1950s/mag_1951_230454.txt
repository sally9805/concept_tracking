In a dozen years of riding rescue trucks , Eugene W. Fields , battalion chief in Omaha 's fire department , tried to guard against every emergency . His trucks became hospitals on wheels with baby-delivery kits , oxygen masks , resuscitators , inhalators , iron lungs , ether masks , surgical gowns and sterile sheets . But Fields , a onetime Navy fire-fighting instructor , still fretted over occasional cases in which he had seen people choke to death while his crews probed blindly for something in the throat . <P> Then Fields read a magazine article about the laryngoscope , a device like a shoehorn with a built-in light for looking down people 's windpipes . This was for him . Lest he be accused of " practicing medicine " without a license , Fields got advance approval from the Omaha-Douglas County Medical Society . He and his crews took a hospital course in use of the laryngoscope , and Fields talked an insurance company into donating two of the $65 gadgets . <P> Squad Captain Charles F. Walther of the South Omaha truck waited three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it last week when a young ( 22 ) father , Ralph Nielsen , called the fire department for help : his baby was choking to death . In five minutes , Walther and his squad dashed up to the Nielsens ' house , found baby Thomas , aged five months , blue in the face . His pulse and breathing had stopped . There was not a minute to lose . <P> <P> Walther fixed an inhalator tube to the baby 's nose , slipped the laryngoscope down behind the tongue root , lifted the " clapper valve " ( epiglottis ) and looked in . Clearly visible was a one-inch celluloid ball ( from a rattle ) , filling the windpipe . Alligator forceps thrust down the channel of the surgical shoehorn brought the ball out in 30 seconds , and Baby Thomas gasped . Soon he was breathing regularly again .
