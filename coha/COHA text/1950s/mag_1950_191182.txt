The multifaceted wit of the late George Bernard Shaw often did more to conceal than reveal his deep convictions . But last week a paragraph from his will made it clear where the author of Saint Joan , Heartbreak House and Back to Methuselah stood on the question of religion : <P> " My religious convictions and scientific views can not at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution . I desire that no public monument or work of art or inscription or sermon or ritual service commemorating me shall suggest that I accepted the tenets peculiar to any established church or denomination nor take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice . "
