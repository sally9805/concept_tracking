After World War II , Ferdinando Innocefoti set out to put Italians on two wheels . From his plant near Milan , he began to roll two-passenger Lambretta motor scooters off the line for Italians looking for zippy but cheap ( then $240 , 100 miles per gallon ) transportation . Now the world 's No. 2 scooter producer ( 170,000 a year , behind Italy 's Vespa ) , Ferdinando Innocenti has raised his sights to four wheels . Occasion : a deal to produce a Lambretta version of West Germany 's four-passenger , four-wheel Goggomobil . <P> The deal was an open challenge from Innocenti , a portly , 66-year-old onetime plumber 's helper , to Italy 's midget-car giant , Fiat . It was Innocenti 's second big challenge to Fiat . The first he won handily . He maneuvered Fiat out of its share of a joint Fiat-Innocenti contract to build a $342 million Venezuelan mine-to-mill steel complex on the Orinoco River to exploit a nearby mountain of high-grade ( up to 60% ) ore . Innocenti left Italy a year ago , planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more he looked the better he liked what he saw ; after five months he told the Venezuelan government that he could do a better job without Fiat , had a reported $30 million ready to go to work . Fiat agreed to yield its share of the contract to Innocenti in return for a 2% commission on Innocenti 's net profit . Last week 100 Innocenti engineers were at work on the millsite in Venezuela , and the scooterman 's machine-tool plant was busy producing steel sheet-rolling equipment . <P> Innocenti began mastering the intricacies of such quick-opening plays in 1935 , when , still a plumber , he invented and patented a gadget for bolting vertical and horizontal sections of pipe together to form scaffolding . He made his first joints himself , soon had enough cash and orders to persuade bankers to back a factory . His factory turned out miles of pipe and thousands of joints for scaffolds , pontoon bridges , temporary grandstands . In World War II he switched from pipe to artillery shell production . At war 's end he decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the just-launched Piaggio &; Co. ' s Vespa ( TIME , June 16 , 1952 ) . Last year Innocenti Corp . grossed $43 million from scooters , 6,000 of them exported to the U.S. , earned another $19 million from pipes and machine-tools . <P> Innocenti 's tubing will form the framework of the new Lambretta GoggomobiL He will have to dress it up for the Italian market , since Italians demand more flair in body style than the functional-minded Germans . But he still hopes to charge only $500 for his Lambretta Goggo , half the price of the cheapest Fiat .
