The skit was certainly no broader in its assault on humor than many another on Arthur Godfrey &; His Friends ( Wed . 8 p.m. , CBS-TV ) . Dressed as whitewings , Godfrey , Crooner Morton Downey and Hollywood Comic Jack Carson appeared on the screen pushing street cleaners ' brooms . Said Godfrey : " Well , we 've dished a lot of it out . Let 's clean some of it up . " <P> On this occasion , Godfrey 's usually good timing was off-base as well as off-color . Just the day before , speaking at the University of Oklahoma , Wayne Coy , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , had said : " When a comedian gets so big that his network can no longer handle him . then we have a case of the tail wagging the dog . The boy who used to express himself with chalk on a wall is now provided with a television screen . . . This type of comedian is stilt peddling livery stable humor . " <P> In New York , the protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , testy Walter Damm , manager of the Milwaukee Journal 's station WTMJ-TV , said : " Godfrey 's remarks . . . were the most obnoxious and filthy ever inflicted on a television audience . . . Unless his remarks and gestures conform to decency in the future , the Journal Co. will refuse to carry him further . " Variety headlined , CBS OUT ON A GODFREY LIMB , and warned that industry-wide censorship might result . Urging Godfrey to " pipe down a little , " New York Herald Tribune Columnist John Crosby wrote : " I hate to align myself with the forces of prudery , but I ca n't quite see myself coming out four-square for scatology . " <P> At week 's end , Godfrey had flown off to the rural quiet of his Virginia farm , where he complained that " the audience often thinks something is dirty that I do n't mean to be dirty . "
