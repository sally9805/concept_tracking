In running for Congress in California , Jimmy Roosevelt had to overcome almost as many problems as a soap-opera heroine . To begin with , he had to make a political comeback ; in 1950 he had been beaten by more than 1,000,000 votes by Earl Warren for governor . This time he 1 ) faced nine candidates , 2 ) was repudiated by Democratic National Chairman Steve Mitchell , and 3 ) was , of course , dogged everywhere by his famed signed letter in which he confessed to adultery with nine women . <P> Instead of risking large , outdoor audiences - and hecklers - Jimmy wisely decided to put on a parlor campaign in Los Angeles ' 26th District , - and apply the Roosevelt personality indoors at close range . He asked good Democrats to open their homes to him and they did , five or six times daily . At cozy meetings , attended largely by neighborhood housewives , Jimmy drank coffee and served up charm along with his political pitch . He knew what the assembled ladies would be thinking about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and suggest that everyone would like to hear Jimmy 's side of the story . Then Jimmy would explain gently that his wife had blackmailed him into signing an untrue confession . If pressed , he would add : " To me , public life is a profession . If you were going to seek medical advice , you would n't ask the doctor about his private life . You would simply pick the best doctor . " Last week his Kaffeeklatsch-and-candor campaign paid off with a 6-to-1 victory in the Democratic primary . Jimmy is almost sure to win in November , unless , as often happens in soap operas , the problems pile up again .
