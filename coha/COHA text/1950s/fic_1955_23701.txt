I went back to the huge office block with its glass , glass , glass , and its dazzling marble floor and its pieces of modern carving in alcoves and niches like statues in a Catholic church . I was the assistant accountant ( an aging assistant accountant ) and the very vastness of the place made promotion seem next to impossible . To be raised from the ground floor I would have to be a piece of sculpture myself . In little uncomfortable offices in the city people die and people move on : old gentlemen look up from steel boxes and take a Dickensian interest in younger men . Here , in the great operational room with the calculators ticking and the tape machines clicking and the soundless typewriters padding , you felt there was no chance for a man who had n't passed staff college . I had n't time to sit clown before a loudspeaker said , " Mr. Bertram wanted in Room 10 . ' ' ( That was rue . ) " Who lives in Room 10 ? " I asked . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth floor . " ( He spoke with awe as though he were referring to the peak of l3verest  --  the eighth floor was as far as the London County Council regulations allowed us to build toward Heaven . ) " Who lives in Room 10 ? " I asked the liftman again . " Do n't you know , " he said sourly . " How long have you been here ? " " Five years . " We began to mount . He said , " You ought to know who lives in Room 10 . " " But I do n't . " " Five years and you do n't know that . " " Be a good chap and tell me , " " Here you are . Eighth floor , turn left . " As I got out , he said gloomily , " Not know Room ID ! " He relented as he shot the gates . " Who do you think ? The Gom , of course . " Then I began to walk very slowly indeed . I have no belief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible when you have reached forty and are conspicuously unsuccessful not sometimes to half-believe in a malign providence . I had never met the Gom : I had only seen him twice ; there was HO reason so far as I could tell why I should ever see him again . He was elderly ; he would die first , I would contribute grudgingly to a memorial . But to be summoned from the ground floor to the eighth shook inc . I wondered what terrible mistake could justify a reprimand in Room 10 ; it seemed to be quite possible that our wedding now would never take place at St. Luke 's , nor our fortnight at Bournemouth . In a way I was right . 3 T HE GOM was called the Gain by those who disliked him and by all those too far removed from him for any feeling at all . He was like the weather  --  unpredictable . When a new tape machine was installed , or new calculators replaced the old reliable familiar ones , you said , " The Gom , 1 suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Christmas little typewritten notes came round , addressed personally to each member of the staff ( it must have given the typing pool a day 's work , but the signature below the seasonal greeting , Herbert Dreuther , was rubber stamped ) . I was always a little surprised that the letter was not signed Guru . At that season of bonuses and cigars , unpredictable in amount , you sometimes heard him called by his full name , the Grand Old Man . Anti there was something grand about him with his mane of white hair , his musician 's head . Where other men collected pictures to escape death duties , he collected for pleasure . For a month at a time he would disappear in his yacht with a cargo of writers and actresses and oddments  --  a hypnotist , a man who had invented a new rose or discovered something about the endocrine glands . We on the ground floor , of course , would never have missed him ; we should have known nothing about it if we had not read an account in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yacht front port to port . They associated yachts with scandal but there would never be any scandal on Dreuther 's boat . He hated unpleasantness outside office hours . I knew a Little more than most from my position : diesel oil was included with wine under the general heading of Entertainment . At one time that caused trouble with Mixon . My chief told me about it . Walter Blixon was the other power at No. 45 . Ile held about as many shares as Dreuther , but he was not proportionally consulted . He was small , spotty , undistinguished , and consumed with jealousy . He could have had a yacht himself , but nobody would have sailed with him . When he objected to the diesel oil , Dreuther magnanimously gave way and then proceeded to knock all private gasoline from the firm 's account . As he lived in London he employed the firm 's car , but Blixon had a house in Hampshire . What Dreuther courteously called a compromise was reached  --  things were to remain as they were . When Blixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a momentary advantage until the rumor was said to have reached him that Dreuther had refused one in the same Honors List . One thing was certainly true  --  at a dinner party , to which Blixon and my chief had been invited , Dreuther was heard to oppose a knighthood for a certain artist . " Impossible . He could n't accept it . An O.M . ( or possibly a C.H. ) are the only honors that remain respectable . " ( It made matters worse that Blixon had never heard of the C.H. ) But Mixon bided his time . One more packet of shares would give him control and we used to believe that his chief prayer at night ( he was a churchwarden in Hampshire ) was that these shares would reach the market while Dreuther was at sea . 4 W I T H despair in my heart I knocked on the door of No. 10 and entered , but even in my despair 1 memorized details  --  they would want to know them on the ground floor . The room was not like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English classics and it showed Dreu titer 's astuteness that Trollope was there and not Dickens , Stevenson and not Scott , thus giving an appearance of personal taste . There was an unimportant Renoir anti a lovely little Boudin on the far wall , and one noticed at once that there was a sofa but not a desk . The few visible files were stacked on a Regency table , and Blixon and my chief and a stranger sat uncomfortably on the edge of easy chairs . Dreuther was almost out of sight  --  he lay practically on his spine in the largest and deepest chair , holding some papers above his head and scowling at them through the thickest glasses I have ever seen on a human face . " It is fantastic and it can not he true , " he was saying in his deep guttural voice . " / do n't see the importance . . . . " Mixon said . Dreuther took off his glasses and gazed across the room at me . " Who are you ? " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief accountant said . " What is he doing here ? " " You asked me to send for him . " " I remember , " Dreuther said . " But that was half an hour ago . " " I was out at lunch , sir . " " Lunch ? " Dreuther asked as though it were a new word . " It was during the lunch hour , Mr. Dreuther , " the chief accountant said . " And they go out for lunch ? " " Yes , Mr. Dreuther . " " All of them ? " " Most of them , 1 think . " " How very interesting . I did not know . Do you go out to lunch , Sir Walter ? " " Of course I do , Dreuther . Now , for goodness sake , ca n't we leave this in the hands of Mr. Arnold and Mr. Bertram . The whole discrepancy only amounts to seven pounds fifteen and four-pence . I 'm hungry , Dreuther . " " It 's not the amount that matters , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great business . We can not leave our responsibilities to others . The shareholders .. , " " You are talking highfalutin rubbish , Dreuther . The shareholders are you and I .. . . " " And the Other , Sir Walter . Surely you never forget the Other . Mr. Bertrand , please sit down and look at these accounts . Did they pass through your hands ? " With relief I saw that they belonged to a small subsidiary company with which I did not deal . " I have nothing to do with General Enterprises , sir . " " Never mind . You may know something about figures  --  it is obvious that no one else does . Please see if you notice anything wrong . " The worst was obviously over . Dreuther had exposed an error and he did not really worry about a solution . " Have a cigar , Sir Walter . You see you can not do without me yet . " He lit his own cigar . " You have found the problem , Mr. Bertrand ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take your time , Mr. Bertrand . " " If you do n't mind , Dreuther , I have a table at the Berkeley ... . " " Of course , Sir Walter , if you are so hungry .. I can deal with this matter . " " Coming , Naismith ? " The stranger rose , made a kind of bob at Dreuther , and sidled after Blixon . " And you , Arnold , you have had no lunch ? " " It really does n't matter , Mr. Dreuther . " " You must pardon me . It had never crossed my mind .. this  --  lunch hour  --  you call it ? " " Really it does n't ... " " Mr. Bertrand has had lunch . He and I will worry out this problem between us . Will you tell Miss Bullen that I am ready for my glass of milk ? Would you like a glass of milk , Mr. Bertrand ? " " No , thank you , sir , " I found myself alone with the Gom . I felt exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth floor , on a mountain top , like one of those Old Testament characters to whom a King commanded , " Prophesy . " " Where do you lunch , Mr. Bertrand ? " " At the Volunteer . " " Is that a good restaurant ? " " It 's a public house , sir . " " They serve meals ? " " Snacks . " " How very interesting . " He fell silent and I began all over again to add , . carry , subtract . I H was for a time puzzled . Human beings are capable of the most simple errors , the failing to carry a figure on , but we had all the best machines and a machine should be incapable .. . . " I feel at sea , Mr. Bertrand , " Dreuther said . " I confess , sir , I um a little too . " " Oh , I did n't mean in that way , not in that way at all . There is no hurry . We will put all that right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter leaves my room I have a sense of calm , peace . I thiipc of my yacht . " The cigar smoke blew between us . " Luxe , calme , et volupti , " he said . " I ca n't find any ordre or beaut ? in these figures , sir . " " You read Baudelaire , Mr. Bertrand ? " " Yes . " " He is my favorite poet . " " I prefer Racine , sir . But I expect that is the mathematician in me . " " Do n't depend too much on his classicism . There are moments in Racine , Mr. Bertrand , when  --  the abyss opens . " I was aware of being watched while I started checking all over again . Then came the verdict . " How very interesting . " But now at last I was really absorbed . I have never been able to understand the layman 's indifference to figures . The veriest fool vaguely appreciates the poetry of the solar system ? " the army of unalterable law " ? and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain figures moving upwards , crossing over , one digit running the whole length of every column , emerging , like some elaborate drill at the Trooping the Color . I was following one small figure now , dodging in pursuit . " What calculating machines do General Enterprises use , sir ? " " You must ask Miss Bulien . " " I 'm certain it 's the Revolg . We gave them up five years ago . In old age they have a tendency to slip , but only when the 2 and the 7 are in relationship , and then not always , and then only in subtraction not addition . Now , here sir , if you 'll look , the combination happens four times , but only once has the slip occurred . . . " Please do n't explain to me , Mr. Bertrand . It would be useless . " " There 's nothing wrong except mechanically . Put these figures through one of our machines . And scrap the Revo1g ( they 've served Tong enough ) . " I sat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the equal of any man . It had really been a very neat piece of detection . So simple when you knew , but everyone before me had accepted the perfection of the machine and no machine is perfect ; in every join , rivet , screw lies original sin . I tried to explain that to Dreuther , but I was out of breath . " How very interesting , Mr. Bertrand . I 'm glad we have solved the problem while Sir Walter is satisfying /tis carnal desires . Are you sure you wo n't have a glass of milk ? " " No , thank you , sir . I must be getting back to the ground floor . " " No hurry . You look tired , Mr. Bertrand . When did you last have a holiday ? " " My annual leave 's just coming round , sir . As a matter of fact I 'm taking the opportunity to get married . " " Really . How interesting . Have you received your clock ? " " Clock ? " " I believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bertrand ? " - " Well ... the second . " " Ah , the second stands much more chance . " The Coin had certainly a way with him . He made you talk , confide , he gave an effect of being really interested  --  and I think he always was , for a moment . He was a prisoner in his room , and small Facts of the outer world came to him with the shock of novelty ; he entertained them as an imprisoned man entertains a mouse or treasures a leaf blown through the bars . I said , " We are going to Bournemouth for our honeymoon . " " Ah , that I do not think is a good idea . That is too classical . You should take the young woman to the south  --  the bay of Rio de Janeiro . . . . " " Ent afraid I could n't afford it , sir . ' ' " The sun would do you good , Mr. Bertrand . You are pale . I would suggest South Africa , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyway . . . " " I have it , Mr. Bertrand . You and your beautiful young wife will come on my yacht . All my guests leave me at Nice and Monte Carlo . I will pick you up then on the 30th . We will sail down the coast of Italy , the Bay of Naples , Capri , Ischia . " " I 'm afraid , sir , it 's a hit difficult . I 'm very , very grateful , but you see we are getting married on the 30th . " " Where ? " " St. Luke 's , Maida Hill . " " St. Luke 's ! You are being too classical again , my friend . We must not be too classical with a beautiful young wife . I assume she is young , Mr. Bertrand ? " " Yes . " " And beautiful . " " I think so , sir . " " Then you must be married at Monte Carlo . Before the mayor . With myself as witness . On the 50th . At night we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or Bournemouth . " " But surely , sir , there would he legal difficulties . . . But he had already rung for Miss Bullen . I think he would have made a great actor ; he already saw himself in the part of a Haroun who could raise a man from obscurity and make him the ruler over provinces . I have an idea too that he thought it would make Blixon jealous . It was the same attitude which he had taken to the knighthood . Blixon was probably planning to procure the Prime Minister to dinner . This would show how little Dreuther valued rank . It would take the salt out of any social success Blixon might have . Miss Bullen appeared with a second glass of milk . " Miss Bullen , please arrange with our Nice office to have Mr. Bertrand married in Montt Carlo on the 30th at 4:00 P.M. " " On the 50th , sir ? " " There may be residence qualifications  --  they must settle those . They can include him on their staff for at least six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . You had better speak on the telephone to M. Tissand , but do n't bother inc about it . I want to hear no more of it . Oh , and tell Sir Walter Blixon that we have found an error in the Revolg machines . They have got to he changed at once . He had better consult Mr. Bertrand who will advise him . I want to hear no more of that either . The muddle has given us a most exhausting morning . Well , Mr. Bertrand , until the 50th then . Bring a set of Racine with you . Leave the rest to Miss Sullen . Everything is settled . " So he believed , of course , but there was still Cary . . 5 T HE NEXT day was a Saturday . I met Cary at the Volunteer and walked all the way home with her : it was one of those spring afternoons when you can smell the country in a London street ; tree smells and flower smells blew up into Oxford Street from Hyde Park , the Green Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " I wish we could go a long , long way to somewhere very hot and very gayand very --  " I had to pull her back or she would have been under a bus . I was always saving her from busses and taxis  --  sometimes I wondered how she kept alive when I was n't there . " Well , " I said , " we can , " and while we waited for the traffic lights to change I told her . I do n't know why I expected such serious opposition ; perhaps it was partly because she had been so set on a church wedding , the choir and the cake and all the nonsense . " Think , " I said , " to he married in Monte Carlo instead of Maida Hill . The sea down below and the yacht waiting . . . . " As I had never been there , the details rather petered out . She said , " There 's sea at Bournemouth too . Or so I 've heard . " " The Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We wo n't share a cabin with him , " I said , " and I do n't suppose the hotel in Bournemouth will be quite empty . " " Darling , I did want to be married at St. Luke 's .

" " It would be rather fun if it did n't count , and then we could marry at St. Luke 's when we came back . " " That would be living in sin . " " I 'd love to live in sin . " " You could , " I said , " any time . This afternoon . " " Oh , I do n't count London , " she said . " That would be just making love . Living in sin is  --  oh , striped umbrellas and 80 in the shade and grapes ? and a fearfully gay bathing suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 thought all was well then , but she caught sight of one of those pointed spires sticking up over the plane trees a square ahead . " We 've sent out all the invitations . What will Aunt Marion say ? " ( She had lived with Aunt Marion ever since her parents were killed in the blitz . ) " Just tell her the truth . She 'd much rather get picture-postcards from Italy than from Bournemouth . " " It will hurt the Vicar 's feelings . " " Only to the extent of a fiver . " " Nobody will really believe we are married . " She added a moment later ( she was nothing if not honest ) , " That will be fun . " Then the pendulum swung again and she went thoughtfully on , " You are only hiring your clothes . But my dress is being made . " " There 's time to turn it into an evening dress . After all , that 's what it would have become anyway . " The church loomed in sight : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than St. Luke 's . It was gray and flinty and soot-stained , with reddish steps to the street the color of clay and a text on a board that said , " Conte to Me all ye who are heavy laden , " as much as to say , " Abandon Hope .

This might be happening to us . " A lot of girls in long mauve dresses with lacy Dutch caps came out and lined the steps : they looked with fear at the nursemaids and the matrons and one or two giggled nervously  --  you could hardly blame them . Two photographers set up cameras to cover the entrance , an arch which seemed to be decorated with stone clover leaves , and then the victims emerged followed by a rabble of relatives . " It 's terrible , " Cary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and me . " " Well , you have n't an incipient goiter and I 'm ? well , damn it , I do n't blush and I know where to put my hands .

" Rice is still short , but I 'm certain Aunt Marion can pull strings with the grocer . " " She 'd never do such a thing . " " You can trust no one at.a wedding . It brings out a strange atavistic cruelty . Now that they are not allowed to bed the bride , they try to damage the bridegroom . Look , " I said , clutching Cary 's arm . A small boy , encouraged by one of the somber matrons , had stolen up to the door of the car and , just as the bridegroom stooped to climb in , he launched at close range a handful of rice full in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only spare a cupful , " I said , " you are told to wait until you can see the whites of your enemy 's eyes .

" " You forget the highways and hedges . It 's a Christian tradition . That boy was n't a relation . Trust me . I know . I 've been married in church myself . " " You were married in church ? You never told me , " she said , " In that case I 'd much rather be married in a town hall . You have n't been married in a town hall too , have you ?

Thus on second and second hundredth thought You call me : that 's the one way it never was at the horse 's knee , asking for luck , and the great lounge of the Monte Carlo hotel spread emptily around us , and I said , " That 's that .

" We had decided not in case we found ourselves able to go to Le Touquet for a week in the winter . " You are an accountant , " Cary said . " You ought to know all about systems . " " Systems are damned expensive , " I said . I had discovered that we had a suite already booked for us by Miss Mien and I had no idea what it would cost . Our passports were still under different names , so I suppose it was reasonable that we should have two rooms , but the sitting-room seemed unnecessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding .

All I had in my mind that night was the wonder whether we would sleep together . We never had . It was that kind of marriage . I had tried the other kind , and now I would have waited months if I could gain in that way all the rest of the years . But tonight I did n't want to wait any longer .

Had the problem in my mind never occurred to her , or had she already made up her mind so certainly that the problem did n't exist ? Was she assuming I knew the reason ? I had thought when they showed us our rooms I would discover , but all she had said with enormous glee was , " Darling . What extravagance . " I took the credit from Miss Buller ' . " It 's only for one night . Then we 'll be on the boat . " There was one huge double room and one very small single room and a medium-sized sitting-room in between : all three had balconies .

After we had shown our passports and got our tickets we entered what they call the cuisine , where the small stakes are laid . " This is where I belong , " Cary said and nothing was less true . The old veterans sat around the tables with their charts and their pads and their pencils , making notes of every number . They looked , some of them , like opium smokers , dehydrated .

Do you know  --  watch him , I believe that 's the first food he 's had today . " I was on edge with wanting her , and I flared suddenly up ; foolishly , for she would never have looked twice at him otherwise . So it is we prepare our own dooms . I said , " You would n't call me mean if he were n't young and good-looking . " " Darling , " she said with astonishment , " I was only ? " and then her mouth hardened .

We went up in the lift in a dead silence and marched down the corridor and into th- ? sitting-room . " You can have the large room , " she said . " No , you can .

" " Oh , all right , " she said and went into it and shut the door without saying good night I began to get angry with her as well as myself ? " A fine first night of marriage , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered we were n't married yet , and everything seemed silly and wasteful . I put on my dressing-gown and went out on to my balcony . The front of the Casino was floodlit : it looked a cross between a Balkan palace and a super-cinema with the absurd statuary sitting on the edge of the green roof looking down at the big portico and the commissionaires ; everything stuck out in the white light as though projected in 3D . In the harbor the yachts were all lit up , and a rocket burst in the air over the hill of Monaco . It was so stupidly romantic I could have wept . " Fireworks , darling , " a voice said and there was Cary on her balcony with all the stretch of the sitting-room between us . " Fireworks , " she said , " is n't that just our luck ? " so I new all was right again . " Cary , " I said  --  we had to raise our voices to carry . " I 'm so sorry . ... " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't he surprised . " " Do you see the lights in the harbor ? " " Yes . " " Do you think Mr. Dreuther 's arrived ? " " I expect he 'll sail in at the last moment tomorrow . " " Could we get married without him ? I mean he 's a witness , is n't he , and his engine might have broken down or he might have been wrecked at sea or there might be a storm or something . " " I think we could manage without him . " " You do think it 's arranged all right , do n't you ? " " Oh yes , Miss Bullen 's done it all . Four o'clock tomorrow . " " I 'm getting hoarse , are you , from shouting ? Come on to the next balcony , darling . " I went into the sitting-room and out on to the balcony there . She said , " I suppose we 'll all have to have lunch together  --  you and me and your Gom ? " ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be rather fun , would n't it , if he were a bit late . I like this hotel . " " We 'd have just enough money for two days , I suppose . " " We could always run up terrible hills , " she said , and then added , " but it would n't be so much fun really as living in sin , I suppose . I wonder if that young man 's in debt . " " I wish you 'd forget him . " " Oh , I 'm not a bit interested in him , darling . I do n't like young men . I expect I 've got a father fixation . " " Damn it , Cary , " I said , " I 'm not old enough to be your father . " " Oh yes , you are , " she said , " puberty begins at fourteen . " " Then in fifteen and a half years from tonight you may be a grandmother . " " Tonight ? " she said nervously , and then fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " There 's your eatherine wheel . " She turned and looked palely at it . " What are you thinking , Cary ? " " It 's so strange , " she said , " we are going to be together now for years and years and years . Darling , do you think we 'll have enough to talk about ? " " We need n't only talk . " " Darling , I 'm serious . Have we got anything in common ? I 'm terribly bad at mathematics . And I do n't understand poetry . You do . " " You do n't need to . ? You are the poetry . " " No , but really  --  I 'm serious . " " We have n't dried up yet , and we 've been doing nothing else but talk . " " It would be so terrible , " she said , " if we became a couple . You know what I mean . You with your paper . Me with my knitting . " " You do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or listening to the radio . Or watching television . We 'll never have a television , will we ? " " Never . " The rockets were dying down : there was a long pause : I looked away from the lights in the harbor . She was squatted on the floor of the balcony , her head against the side , and she was fast asleep . When I leaned over I could touch her hair . She woke at once . " Oh , how silly . I was dozing . " " It 's bed time . " " Oh . I 'm not a hit tired really . " " You said you were . " " It 's the fresh air . It 's so nice in the fresh air . " " Then come on my balcony . " " Yes , I could , could n't I , " she said dubiously . " We do n't need both balconies . " " No . " " Come round , " " I 'll climb over . " " No . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue , " she said , " I 'm here . " They must have thought us crazy when they came to do the rooms  --  three beds for two people and not one of them had been slept in .
