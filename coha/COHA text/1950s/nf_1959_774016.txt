For my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , saith the Lord . For as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts . ( Isaiah 55:6-9. ) 7 King Benjamin also reminds us of our limitations in knowing the Creator : Believe in God ; believe that he is , and that he created all things , both in heaven and in earth ; believe that he has all wisdom , and all power , both in heaven and in earth ; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend . ( Mosiah 4:9 ) 7 In the closing chapters of the book of Job , the Lord answers Job out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted man 's puny knowledge is when com pared with that of the Creator . To sense the full strength of the divine rebuke , one must be acquainted with the entire book and then read carefully chapters 38 to 42 . Only the introduction to this passage is quoted here : Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind , and said , Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ? Gird up now thy loins like a man ; for I will demand of thee , and answer thou me . Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ? declare , if thou hast understanding . Who hath laid the measures thereof , if thou knowest ? or who hath stretched the line upon it ? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened ? or who laid the corner stone thereof ; When the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ? Or who shut up the sea with doors , when it brake forth , as if it had issued out of the womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thick darkness a swaddling band for it , And brake up for it my decreed place , and set bars and doors , And said , Hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : . and here shall thy proud waves be stayed ? ( Job 38:1-11. ) 7 // The student should not be discouraged with man 's limited knowledge . Reality as a whole is a wonderfully intricate , complex , beautiful , mysterious , orderly , and yet an awesome thing to contemplate . How could man , from his limited position , comprehend the whole of it ? Man 's ignorance need not , however , deter him . From the beginning of his life on earth he has been looking , listening , feeling , praying , searching , and reflecting in an effort to know reality . His efforts have been fraught both with success and with failure . Both truth and error have been his reward . Man is confident that he has found some true knowledge and that more can be known . And , though error remains an unwelcome guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as light dispels darkness . The student can be encouraged by the gains already made . In every major field of learning , advances in knowledge have come to us . Think how much more infinitely rich life has been made by the labors of a single individual working in his respective field : by Plato , Isaiah , Shakespeare , Pasteur , Franklin , Newton . Copernicus , and many others . Of science , philosophy , art , and scripture we possess far more than any mind can grasp . Instead of fretting over the unknown , we need to appropriate more of the already known into our lives and , at the same time , eagerly search for more knowledge . There is still another exciting thing about man 's limited knowledge of reality ; so much is yet to be discovered . The search for knowledge is great adventure consistent with man 's need as a child of the great Creator to be creative . The quest for knowledge , the activity of learning , is as satisfying to the mind as is the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reaping the harvest ; writing a book is often more rewarding than the reading of it . Growing things live and bear fruit . Reality is of such magnitude that it will take an eternity of progression to formulate propositions relating to it which are // comprehensive and true . A little child rests secure in the simple faith that his parents have all the answers , but the mature adult rejoices in the privilege of seeking the answers and of bringing new things into being by the power of his hands , his mind , and his heart . WHY SEEK KNOWLEDGE ? One final question : Since we can not comprehend the whole of reality , why seek knowledge at all ? As already indicated above , curiosity is natural to man . Searching for knowledge satisfies his spiritual nature . " Man shall not live by bread alone . " ( Matt. 4:4 . ) He is more than the brute creation . As evidenced in history , he is not content merely to eat , sleep , and reproduce . He is not satisfied to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nature drives him to know the truth of things . Moreover , man does not live apart from reality , but in reality . He is intimately related to nature , to his fellow human beings , and to Deity . His flesh is of the earth , renewed and sustained by her fruits . His personality finds fulfilment only through association with his fellow beings who give to him love , a sense of personal worth , and help to satisfy his other basic needs . Nor can a man 's soul rest in peace until he finds some meaning and purpose in the whole of his existence . As Kant said , " Two things fill my soul with awe ; the starry heavens above and the moral law within me . " Man must relate himself to the world outside himself and to the mystery of his own being . Jesus said , " And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . " ( John 8:32 . ) Ignorance of reality is confusing , frightening , and frustrating . Knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his choices . To enjoy health , we must know and obey the laws of health ; to enjoy happiness in marriage , we must learn and follow the laws of good human relations , chief // of which is love ; to fulfil our full possibilities in God 's universe , we must come to know him and to obey his laws . How can we know reality ; that is , how can we build a true conception of it ? // WAYS OF KNOWING THE TRUTH The nature of truth and reality were discussed in the last chapter . It was admitted that man 's knowledge of reality was but partial , limited , and not without error ; and the need to continue to search for a greater and more accurate understanding of reality was pointed out . Truth was defined as the fruit of consistent and sound thinking ? a property of judgments or propositions . What man seeks , then , is a tested and reliable body of knowledge that can be called the truth about reality . The next logical question is : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the truth and to be sure one has found it . The student is often confused because he observes men in science , in philosophy , and in religion using different methods in their search for an understand ing of reality . In chapters to follow the method and spirit of science , philosophy , art and religion will be described . In this chapter consideration will be given to different ways men have of searching for reality ; ways that are available to scientists , philosophers , poets , and students of religion alike . One gains knowledge in four ways : ( 1 ) by accepting it on the authority of someone else , ( 2 ) by thinking , ( 3 ) by experiencing , ( 4 ) and by feeling which may be called intuition , mysticism , inspiration , or revelation. ? Each of these four ways of finding the truth will be considered and evaluated here with special attention being given to how these avenues to truth can be used in religion . I. AumoxrrrY Any individual 's knowledge is extremely limited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as that of Aristotle or Herbert Spencer , could survey the entire field of human knowledge and draw conclusions . But with the great accumulation of knowledge which has been derived through specialization , no single person can grasp anywhere near all of the learning available to mankind . For this reason , man is compelled to rely upon the experience of others for some of his information . Each of us turns to the doctor , dentist , lawyer , teacher , mechanic , roofer , bishop , and many other persons for guidance in particular problems . And the student of chemistry , for example , does not begin from scratch , relying on his own experience . The teacher , the text , reference book and magazine articles containing the experience and judgment of centuries become sources of authority for him . To bypass such a vast accumulation of knowledge would be folly indeed . Likewise , in religion we have preserved for us the sayings of Moses , Amos , Paul , Alma , Joseph Smith , and the Christ . These were not persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living in real-life situations , claiming wisdom from God . They too deserve a hearing . How reliable is authority as a source of truth ? Can one believe every text he reads or every lecture and sermon he hears ? The obvious answer is " No " ! Authority is necessary , but accepting things simply on the authority of someone else is fraught with dangers and difficulties . Authority , whether secular or religious , as a sure criterion of truth , has many weaknesses . Some of them are indicated , as follows : ( 1 ) Men are not infallible . In every walk of life they have been known to err . In science new discoveries are made which deny or modify the " truths " of yesterday . Textbooks are among the first books to be outdated ; therefore , constant revision is necessary . The reading of a textbook of fifty years ago in physics , nutrition , or mater26 RELIGION AND THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH nal care provokes smiles from us today . The writer recalls spending a long evening in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vienna . Among his many books there was a noticeable absence of textbooks . When asked the reason for this , he replied : " Textbooks are the first books to go out of date . I prefer the classics . " This experience is not mentioned to discredit texts . Usually they contain the most up-to-date information available . Much that is in them today will be valid tomorrow . However , it is folly to read the printed page uncritically , for it lends itself to the imprint of truth and error , fact and propaganda , sense and nonsense with equal facility . ( 2 ) Authorities , even on the same subject , often contradict one another . A classic example of this is found in the story of Joseph Smith 's search for truth in religion . Men of different affiliations shouted at him : " Lo , here ! " and " Lo , there ! " So great was the disagreement among the preachers in his community that he despaired of coming to any conclusion as to who was right and who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities available to him disagreed . When this happens , one must find the answer in other more basic sources of truth , which is what the Prophet did . ( 3 ) Truth accepted on authority of others is often geared to the past and does not lend itself to correction and enlargement by the experience of those who come on the scene at a later date . For example , the sciences underlying the practice of medicine were held back for centuries because doctors revered the conclusions of Galen , a Roman physician of the second century A.D. , instead of testing his conclusions by their own experience and thinking . Likewise , all manner of superstition and immorality have been passed on from generation to generation in the name of religious authority , including // human sacrifice , the burning of witches , and slavery . Religion , as well as science , needs a principle of growth such as is afforded in the doctrine of continuous revelation . Through gving prophets , religion can be kept fresh and clear like water in an ever-flowing stream fed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) People who accept the truth simply on the authority of others are prone to shift full responsibility to such authority for their own thought and behavior . In civil affairs some prefer to follow a dictator blindly rather than to assume the responsibilities of citizenship imposed by a democracy . In the classroom some students prefer to parrot back the words of professor or textbook rather than to do their own original and creative thinking . In religion some people prefer to follow blindly their leaders , who they believe will guarantee their salvation . Blind , submissive followers in any field , be it in government , science , or religion , lack the ability to discriminate between truth and error , good and evil , and between the weightier and lesser matters of the law . They hardly have a soul to call their own . This kind of discipleship is not befitting a Latter-day Saint . He believes in giving loyalty and respect to political and religious authority ; but at the same time , as a child of God endowed with free agency and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful and whole-souled disciple of Jesus Christ . He will follow those who have earned the right to be his leaders . And he will follow them with understanding and conviction , not with blindness or indifference . ( 5 ) Finally , it should be clearly seen that authority is not a way of discovering the truth , but is a method of transmitting knowledge gained in other ways . And no one has the right to be authoritative in any field of knowledge ? in science , philosophy , or religion ? who has not earned that right by having gained knowledge and insight through reason , experience , or revelation . Therefore , men // who merit their position as authorities among men have acquired their knowledge and truth through such fundamental avenues to truth as thought , experience , or revelation . The scientist has observed , experimented , and thought ; and he invites the student to do likewise . The great poet has gained his insight through study , experience , feeling , and perhaps inspiration . Even the true prophet has arrived at truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation from the Most High ; and he bids us to seek the truth and confirmation of it in like manner . Jesus Christ , in whom we place supreme trust as a revelator of religious and moral truth , did not ask his followers to accept his word simply on authority . He appealed both to experience and revelation when he answered those who had asked , " How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? " ... My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me . If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself . ( John 7:16-17 . ) He also warned us to test authorities by their fruits . Beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves . Ye shall know them by their fruits . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire . Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them . ( Matt. 7:15-20 . ) This we can not do without thinking , observing and living . In no walk of life is it wise to follow authority blindly except , of course , in our infancy and early childhood , or in emergencies such as on the battlefield . Each person , as he matures , must find the truth for himself . He must learn to carry his own lantern ; his own testimony will // guide him , not that of another . We shall always need authorities to guide us , but we must learn to test their right to lead us . This we can do through thought , experience , and revelation . Each of these fundamental avenues to truth will now be considered : II . REASON In man 's search for truth , the mind plays a leading and continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of which increases in his early years . School is an adventure in learning , in acquiring the tools of thought : reading , writing , arithmetic and spelling . Throughout childhood there is a gradual growth in knowledge , in logical thinking , in judgment . With increasing intellectual maturity , comes wisdom ? the ability to apply knowledge to good ends . The mind is an excellent tool in the search for truth . The universe is responsive to man 's thinking . Despite its mystery and unfathomable character , it appears to be quite orderly and law-abiding . Man is able to calculate the movements of heavenly bodies , analyze the content of the soil , measure in advance the pressure of water against a dam , and in countless other ways reckon with the world . That the universe should lend itself to study by the human mind seems natural to the person of religious faith . For God is recognized by him as its Creator . And in Latter-day Saint terminology , " . . . the glory of God is intelligence . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection of his rational nature , as the following scriptures illustrate : The Lord by wisdom bath founded the earth ; by understanding bath he established the heavens . By his knowledge the depths // are broken up , and the clouds drop down the dew . ( Proverbs 3:19 , 20 . ) The earth rolls upon her wings , and the sun giveth his light by day , and the moon giveth her light by night , and the stars also give their light , as they roll upon their wings in their glory , in the midst of the power of God . Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms , that ye may understand ? Behold , all these are kingdoms , and any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power . ( D. &C.; 88:45-47 . ) Man , as a child of God , was created in the image of his Heavenly Father , the glory of whose intelligence is reflected in the beauty and orderliness of the universe . Why should man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust his own mind and use it earnestly as one avenue by which he can know the truth about reality ? just how does the mind aid us in our search for truth ? Many theories have been presented and many books written on this subject , but no simple or universally accepted answer has been found . In a brief and oversimplified manner , a few ways will be suggested here , by which the use of reason may help us know the truth . The Greek philosopher Plato ( 427-347 B.C. ) believed that the most important , universal and real knowledge we have is innate : that is , that we bring ideas with us into the world . Our experience here ? our seeing , hearing , tasting , and other sensory experience ? simply awakens in the mind the realization of these eternal ideas which lie dormant there . Not many thinkers today agree with Plato 's thought , but they continue to regard it with respect . The mind has the ability to weave the separate experiences of life into larger and more unified views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited a large yard in which was located a variety of lumber , wire , machinery , cement and tool sheds laid out without any apparent // order or design . Two years later he returned to find a beautiful high school building standing in the same place . Order and creation had come out of near chaos . A similar transformation takes place continuously in the mind of man . Each day it is bombarded with numerous ideas , impressions , perceptions and feelings from within and without . These enter the mind in an unorganized and miscellaneous fashion ; but the human mind has the ability to bring a measure of order out of the chaos by establishing meaningful relationships among phenomena which it experiences . This is done by relating particular things to universals , to fundamental principles . Again , an illustration may help : An architect said in a lecture , " There are three basic principles which guide us in all architectural work : soundness , utility , and delight or beauty . It matters not what part of the house one is planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be sound in structure , functional in floor plan , and aesthetically pleasing . " These three simple fundamental principles give meaning and purpose to the thousands of details with which the architect works . The search for fundamental principles is equally important in any branch of learning . If we would know the truth in religion , we must search for fundamentals . For example , we must always remember that God is both just and merciful , a loving Father interested in all men . Again we must remember that all men are his children , free and responsible , and are here to develop their potentialities as children of God ? that they might find joy . The mind can help us to know the truth in religion too by its wonderful capacity to relate particular and separate ideas and experiences to larger and more universal principles . In one 's thinking related ideas should be consistent with each other . In the field of religion one can not believe both in free agency and predestination . These beliefs are mutually exclusive , for if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this course has not been completely charted by God in advance . Likewise , if God had determined man 's destiny before he was created , how could man be free to determine his own fate ? In whatever field we are searching for the truth , reason can demand of us an inner consistency of thought . The truth is not self-contradictory , and the mind should be disciplined to demand consistency of itself . However , reason alone is not a sufficient guide to truth . For , as Goethe said , " Human life divided by reason leaves a remainder . " Through reason alone one can not choose a mate , find God or determine all things of greatest value . III . EXPERIENCE One of the most trustworthy avenues to truth lies along the path of experience . Each of us has a rich amount of it , for it is common to all . In the affairs of everyday life , we learn to trust experience . If we have had economic dealings with a person over and over again , we know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to grips with certain processes of nature again and again , we learn how to cope with them . We learn sweetness by taste , softness by touch , colors by sight , and joy and sorrow , love and hate directly in life-situations . There is no substitute for experience , and without it we can not know the truth . Science , in its search for truth , depends heavily on experience . In science we begin with the facts , with things we can see , hear , weigh , measure , observe , calculate or describe . We are not content to draw conclusions out of our heads without having previously tested our theories experimentally . The wisdom of this scientific procedure was illustrated dramatically by Galileo . Prior to his day , men had believed that the heavier an object the faster it would fall to the earth . This assumption // seemed reasonable . It is said that Galileo found reason to doubt this ancient tradition and that to discover the truth he experimented . Climbing to the top of a leaning tower at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight simultaneously . They reached ground at the time and thus experience demonstrated an unsuspected fact . Science is a systematic , objective , rational and verifiable way of gaining experience , of learning the facts and then applying reason to interpret their meaning . Reason and experience , going hand-in-hand , have produced a large body of scientific knowledge ? verifiable facts united in meaningful theories , many of which have culminated in basic laws . Thus far , two types of experience have been described : that on which science is based and that which is common to all of us in everyday life . These two types of experience differ somewhat in character . Scientific experience , more technically called empiricism , is the fruit of systematic observation and controlled experimentation . This kind of experience may be repeated and tested by any competent observer working under the same circumstances as his predecessor in the field . Non-scientific experience is just as real and may also be a valid source of knowledge ; but it is often either more general or more unique and , therefore , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second type plays an important role in religion . Many religious principles can be practiced and experienced repeatedly in everyday life . The validity of religion does not rest on faith alone . We feel and observe the effects of selfishness , greed , lust and hate ; we also observe and feel the opposite effects of unselfishness , generosity , purity of heart and love . Faith , repentance and forgiveness are not abstract principles but are real parts of life . Prayer and worship are religious experiences for those who participate in them with faith . // Many things of a religious character are known by direct acquaintance . Therefore , experience , like reason , is also highly significant in religion . IV . INTUITION , MYSTICISM , REVELATION Mysticism , intuition and revelation are age-old methods of knowing the truth which are less commonly understood and appreciated in our modern Western civilization than they are in the Orient and were in antiquity . Reason and experience have tended to crowd them out and to pale their former light . But these various expressions of feeling are particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This feeling approach to truth is thought of in various ways depending on whether one is thinking in everyday , philosophical or religious terms . The most common name for it is intuition . By this is meant that man can know reality directly , intimately , and without recourse to abstract thinking or contact through the senses . The intuitionist points out that when one reflects about reality in terms of electrons , protons , genes , vitamins , energy and force , he is already a big step removed from it . The process of thought has created a world of symbols about reality which is not reality itself . The intuitionist also points out that the senses are not always trustworthy reporters of the reality about us . Emerson said , " The senses interfere everywhere and mix their own structure with all they report . " Sometimes a person is color blind both literally and figuratively . The intuitionist believes that one can know reality sometimes best by feeling , by direct apprehension of nature , people , and God . Reason and sensory experience are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another field in which intuition plays a large role is art . The artist experiences and interprets reality largely through the medium of feeling . This explains why then ' // is so much individuality in art and so little unanimity in contrast with science , which is based more on thought . The sensitive , imaginative , creative insight of the artist , while related to thought and based on experience , seems to transcend them both in its apprehension and representation of reality . Great artists have learned to express feeling and to trust it as a meaningful approach to truth . The following excerpts from two poets illustrates this : Truth is beauty ; beauty is truth ; That is all we know and all We need to know . A thing of beauty is a joy forever ; its loveliness increases ; it will never pass into nothingness ; but still will keep a bower quiet for us , and a sleep full of sweet dreams , and health , and quiet breathing . ? , JOHN KEATS The road I prefer is the one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most smiling sky . The feeling of the beautiful leads me on . Who is sure of having found a better guide ? - ANATOLE FRANCE Despite the great emphasis on reason and experience in science , intuition also plays a part even in this field . Scientists have testified that some of their most profound insights have come to them , not in the labored process of logical thought , but as unexpected , unpremeditated " hunches " ? possibly as flashes from the imagination , the subconscious mind , or even from God . They too recognize intuition as a source of knowledge . Mysticism , though a synonym for intuition , is used in a more technical and restricted sense . In mystic ra RELIGION AND THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH ture a person feels himself one with God . He neither sees nor hears God . Nor does he apprehend him through any of the senses . To the mystic , God is not an object of thought . The mystic simply feels one with God or with his Holy Spirit in somewhat the same way that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is no longer aware of anything else . The mystic experience is something that can not be described meaningfully to one who has not known it personally . Mysticism would have no more meaning to such a person than an expression of romantic love would have to a person who had never experienced romantic feeling . Feelings must be experienced to have meaning . Perhaps the best way to suggest the meaning of mysticism would be to quote a few lines of mystic character from Browning and a statement from William James : Wholly distrust thy knowledge then , and trust As wholly love allied to ignorance . There lies thy truth and safety .. . consider well ! Were knowledge all thy faculty , then God Must be ignored : love gains him by first leap ? ROBERT BROWNING , Reverie This overcoming of all the usual barriers between the individual and the Absolute is the great mystic achievement . In mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and are aware of our oneness . This is the everlasting and triumphant mystical tradition , hardly altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Neoplatonism , in Sufism , in Christian mysticism , in Whitmanism , we find the same recurring note so that there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think and which brings it about that the mystical classics have , as has been said , neither birthday nor native land . Perpetually telling of the unity of man with God , their speech antedates languages and they do not grow old . ' ' William James , quoted by E. M. Ilulme , ibid. , p. 49. // Revelation ? communication from God to man ? is another avenue to truth , to a correct knowledge of reality . This principle of religion will be discussed at length in the section on doctrine . It is mentioned here because of its relationship to these basic avenues to truth . Revelation includes all three avenues to truth : reason , experience , and feeling . A prophet is not without experience in human life , for he lives among men and with himself . He is not insensitive to good and evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Questions and problems come to his mind . He thinks , reflects , and searches for answers . Then ? and this step is distinctive in the life of a prophet ? he turns to God in humility and faith . When the answer comes , it is usually not in an audible tone , but through " the still small voice " of the Comforter . This Comforter ? the Spirit of Truth ? clarifies the mind of the prophet and causes his bosom to burn within him , so that he feels with perfect certitude that he knows the will of God . Then he declares it to man . This assurance of the reality of God 's power and word in revelation is illustrated in the words of Amos and Micah . To the king 's high priest , who wished to hear no more of the prophetic condemnation of this shepherd from Judea , Amos answered : . . . And said to Amaziah , I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son ; but I was a herdman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as I followed the flock , and the Lord said unto me , Go , prophesy unto my people Israel . Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord . ( Amos 7:14-16 . ) Micah discredits the divine source of knowledge which the popular prophets of his day purported to have , and then declares his assurance of his own call : Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err , that bite with their teeth , and cry , Peace ; and he that putteth not into their mouths , they even prepare war against him . // Therefore night shall be unto you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , that ye shall not divine ; and the sun shall go down over the prophets , and the day shall be dark over them . Then shall the seers be ashamed , and the diviners confounded : yea , they shall all cover their lips , for there is no answer of God . But truly I am full of power by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of might , to declare unto Jacob his transgression , and to Israel his sin . ( Micah 3:5-8 . ) Revelation , like intuition , is a private communication . How can we decide between the claims of Micah and the popular prophets whom he condemned ? Their respective teachings must be tested by reason , by experience , and by the witness of Deity to us . In fact , all knowledgeclaims based on intuition or revelation need to be tested by reason , by experience , and by other revelations which we have come to trust . And they need also to be tested by our own intuition and by confirmation of the Spirit to us . SUMMARY No single avenue of knowledge has given us the whole truth about life . No single approach to truth can stand alone . We need them all to supplement one another and to verify one another as much as it is possible for them to do . Knowledge , which appeals to our minds , warms our hearts , is verified in experience and is attested to by trustworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truth which we seek . // FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE God 's view of reality we do not know ; his knowledge of things we can not imagine . But of one thing we can be sure . His view is not man 's view . For as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts . ( Isaiah 55:9 . ) If the reader will bear in mind the tremendous difference in outlook between God 's view of reality and man 's , and yet will grant the writer the privilege of exercising his imagination on the subject , he would like to emphasize one basic difference between God 's view and man 's . And though , like job of old , he be accused of darkening " counsel by words without kowledge , " still he would insist upon this essential difference between the divine and the human view of things . The Creator , unlike man , must see reality as one with all of its parts and aspects meaningfully related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Lord expressed it to Moses : The heavens , they are many , and they can not be numbered unto man ; but they are numbered unto me , for they are mine . ( Moses 1:37 . ) And his knowledge of reality , which is defined here as truth , is not narrow , specialized and one-sided like man 's . The Creator does not see as man sees . He is not artist , scientist , philosopher , or religionist . He may , however , well be all of these things in one , and more . This is suggested in the following scripture : // All kingdoms have a law given ; And there are many kingdoms ; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom ; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space , either a greater or a lesser kingdom . And unto every kingdom is given a law ; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions . All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth embraceth truth ; virtue loveth virtue ; light cleaveth unto light ; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own ; justice continueth its course and claimeth its own ; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and governeth and executeth all things . He comprehendeth all things , and all things are before him , and all things are round about him ; and he is above all things , and in all things , and is through all things , and is round about all things ; and all things are by him , and of him , even God , forever and ever . And again , verily I say unto you , he hath given a law unto all things , by which they move in their times and their seasons . And their courses are fixed , even the courses of the heavens and the earth , which comprehend the earth and all the planets . And they give light to each other in their times and in their seasons , in their minutes , in their hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , in their years ? all these are one year with God , but not with man . The earth rolls upon her wings , and the sun giveth his light by day , and the moon giveth her light by night , and the stars also give their light , as they roll upon their wings in their glory , in the midst of the power of God . ( D. &; C. 88:36-45. ) l MAN 'S VIEW LIMITED Man can not attain a whole view of things . His perspective is narrow , limited , and restricted . And to obtain any kind of penetrating view he must become a specialist , or even a specialist within a specialty . This fact is easily illustrated . Do we have , for example , a science of man ? Even to study life scientifically with success , we have been compelled to break science down into hundreds of individual parts or scientific views of life . 1Note also 139th Psalm ; Job 38-41 ; Moses 1 ; Isaiah 40 ff. ; Acts 17 ; D. &; C. 88 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind to comprehend all available scientific truth about man 's life . Nor can a single human mind be fully informed on even one scientific approach to the study of man . Our necessarily limited view is not too tragic if we learn to admit it , and if we are humble enough to listen to the views of other specialists . The tragedy begins when a person with a single view tries to explain the whole of reality from such a narrow base . It is unfortunate too when one thinks his limited view is the whole view ; or when he thinks that because he is authoritative in one field , he is in all fields . A person , in his blindness , sometimes quite innocently identifies his own view with the whole truth . This is humorously and aptly illustrated in the following poem : The Blind Men and the Elephant It was six men of Indostan , To learning much inclined , Who went to see the Elephant ( Though all of them were blind ) , That each by observation Might satisfy his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall Against his broad and sturdy side , At once began to bawl : " God bless me ! but the Elephant Is very like a wall ! " The Second , feeling of the tusk , Cried , " Ho ! what have we here So very round and smooth and sharp ? To me ' t is mighty clear This wonder of an Elephant Is very like a spear ! " The Third approached the animal , And happening to take The squirming trunk within his hands , Thus boldly up and spake : " I see , " quoth he , " the Elephant Is very like a snake ! " The Fourth reached out his eager hand , And felt about the knee , " What most this wondrous beast is like , Is mighty plain , " quoth he ; " ' T is clear enough the Elephant Is very like a tree ! " The Fifth , who chanced to touch an ear , Said : " E'en the blindest man Can tell what this resembles most ; Deny the fact who can , This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Sixth no sooner had begun About the beast to grope , Than , seizing on the swinging tail That fell within his scope . " I see , " quoth he , " the Elephant Is very like a rope ! " FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE And so these men of Indostan Disputed loud and long , Each in his own opinion Exceeding stiff and strong , Though each was partly in the right , And all were in the wrong . - JOHN GODFREY SAXE An anonymous Idaho schoolteacher expressed this same thought in another analogy . He said that our view of life is like looking at the landscape through knotholes in the barn . Figure Each knothole gives a different view . If a man looks through only one , he may think the world is nothing more than the sky , a haystack , a pond , a meadow , or a grove of trees . MANY VIEWS In the course of history , man has discovered many " knotholes in the barn . " Not only has he found more " knotholes , " but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF TRUTH microscope and telescope , has disciplined his mind with logic and the scientific method , and has had his heart and imagination quickened by poet and prophet . From the beginning of history , man has always looked at life through three " knotholes " : ( 1 ) the everyday view , in which he has known other people , nature , hunger , thirst , love and hate , hope and fear , birth and death ; ( 2 ) the aesthetic view , which he has expressed in song and dance , in storytelling and painting , in sculpture and architecture ; and ( 3 ) the religious view , for there has never been a culture without religion , without a search for the meaning of life and the worship of some higher power . But the understanding which man gained through these three views did not satisfy his soul , and he invented philosophy in India and Greece . Even this did not suffice , so philosophy gave birth to the sciences . The coming of these newer views of life did not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? even philosophers and scientists themselves ? continue to live the everyday human life . They laugh and weep , work and play , make war and cry for peace . The arts are still with us , with ever new and sometimes deeper meanings . The Gothic cathedral , the pipe organ , the symphony , and the opera are comparatively recent productions in man 's aesthetic life . Religion too is a large part of our lives . Men continue to pray , to live by faith , and to serve their neighbors . Modern man has inherited all the insights gained through the ages . When the Prophet Elijah stood on Mount Carmel in the ninth century , B.C. , he could say , " How long halt ye between two opinions ? if the Lord be God , follow him : but if Baal , then follow him . " ( I Kings 18:21 . ) There were only two choices in that day , and Elijah had stated them . No wonder " the people answered him not a word . " But today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position to be confused or enriched by his multiple choice . He deed not , // however , choose between religion and science , religion and philosophy , religion and art for he may enjoy them all in good measure . He can be grateful that Jesus and such men as Socrates , DaVinci , Beethoven , Pasteur , and even an unlearned , unsophisticated neighbor , have preceded him to sharpen his insight through their respective views of life . A few ideas which may help the student enjoy and profit by his manifold views of life will now be considered . EACH VIEW IS DIFFERENT Reality is what it is , but each human approach to it is not only partial , but different . To illustrate , permit another analogy . Consider the Salt Lake Valley . The valley is what it is , we assume , and one might think that it looks the same to every man . But men approach it through devious ways : through mountain passes , through broad valleys , and through the air . The view varies greatly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first look at the valley from the point of the mountain to the south is not the same as one 's look from the avenues to the north . Figure // Just as one may view the Salt Lake Valley from several different approaches , so may one look at the whole of reality in at least five different ways . Within each of these larger views there are , of course , many specialized views , as was illustrated in relation to science . There is considerable variation of method and purpose even within the arts , within the sciences , among philosophers , in religion , and in everyday life . And yet the specialties within each major field have much in common . The student will do well to learn that each of these five major approaches to life and truth differs from the other four in method , purpose , language , and results . To expect the same description of reality from five such different fields is like expecting photographs taken from five approaches to the Salt Lake Valley to be identical . Still another illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist , climbed by the Boy Scout and drilled by the geologist . To the poet it may be a symbol of steadfastness but to the prophet , a witness of God 's everlasting power . The mountain remains the same , but man 's interest in it determines his view of it , his feeling for it , and his description of it . Is it not interesting that the same thing ? in this case a mountain ? can provoke so much diversity of thought and feeling in man ? Such is the richness of our human existence . The difference among these several views of reality is readily illustrated when a person looks at one and the same object , first from a scientific and then from an aesthetic point of view . The scientist , looking at DaVinci 's Last Supper , studies the texture of the canvas , analyzes the chemical content of the pigment , or calculates the market price of the painting . These aspects of the work of art are real but entirely incidental to the quality of the painting which stimulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // One is happy to let art be art and science be science . There are times when a person may wish to enjoy pigment daubed and stroked on a canvas aesthetically , caring not a whit about its economic value or its chemical content . On another occasion , when planning to paint a house , one is greatly interested in the cost and the lasting quality of paint . The same bit of reality ? paint , in this instance ? can be viewed from both scientific and artistic viewpoints to satisfy our several human needs . Art and science do not tear one 's soul apart . No one need feel that he must choose between them . They are at peace in the cultured person 's life . Each has its distinctive role to play , complementary to the other . One can be loyal to both of these approaches to reality . SCIENCE AND RELIGION Science and religion , on the other hand , have been at war with each other in the minds of men for centuries and have not as yet made peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two approaches to truth to be irreconcilable . The reason for this is not far to seek . The student who has grown up in a religious home , who has attended his church meetings , and has learned the Bible stories , can not help being disturbed when he is confronted with the method and facts of science which also deal with human history , but in a different way than he has learned in church . The student 's feeling is loyal to religion while his mind is responsive to science . The two views of life appear to be different . What is he to do ? Much of the conflict between science and religion disappears when one clarifies the nature , method , values , and limitations of each field . Science and religion likely are as different from one another as are science and art . It is when one expects them both to speak the same language and to draw exactly the same conclusions about // life that serious conflict arises . If the scientist , in the name of science , talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is trespassing on the territory of religion and philosophy where he has no legitimate right to be . If the student of religion , on the other hand , interprets the scriptures as textbooks in astronomy , physics , geology , and biology , he is trespassing in the field of science and is using the scriptures in a way that was not intended by their authors . There was a day when Christians derived their full view of life and of the universe from the Bible . This was natural , since it was accepted by them as the word of God , often as the complete and final word on all subjects . Men read into it all the details of creation and of history , and found in it their hygiene , medicine , and other related subjects . Then there came a day when men began to think , to calculate , and to observe nature . Copernicus established the fact that the sun and not the earth was the center of the solar system . Since his ideas conflicted with the current view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were published shortly after his death , to his everlasting fame . Science was defeated and the church triumphed for a day . But now that same church and practically all Christian churches go along with the ideas of modern astronomy . Church men realize that the authors of the Bible were not concerned with giving us a scientific view of the heavenly bodies . The church never should have become entangled in any particular view of astronomy . Prophets and psalmists of old refer to the heavens not to describe them in scientific language , but rather to glorify and worship God and to inspire trust and devotion in the hearts of men . This is readily seen in the following : The Lord by wisdom bath founded the earth ; by understanding hath he established the heavens . By his knowledge the depths // are broken up , and the clouds drop down the dew . ( Proverbs 3:19 , 20 . ) This passage is scientific in spirit and feeling , for it describes the universe as a cosmos , the fruit of the Creator 's knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the divine creation in this passage ? Not for scientific purposes ? to describe and measure heaven and earth ? but for religious purposes , to persuade men to follow the wisdom of God that they might live with peace of mind . This is made clear in the verses which follow : My son , let not them depart from thine eyes : keep sound wisdom and discretion : So shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace to thy neck . Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely , and thy foot shall not stumble . When thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and thy sleep shall be sweet . Be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh . For the Lord shall be thy confidence , and shall keep thy foot from being taken . ( Proverbs 3:21-26 . ) THE PURPOSE OF SCRIPTURE The primary purpose of all scripture is religious , not philosophical , not scientific , not even historical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Hebrew men of religion , in a non-scientific language , in a pre-scientific age , and for an unscientific people . It was written to inspire men " to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy God , " in the words of Micah. ( 6:6-8 . ) In the language of Jesus , everything in the Law and the Prophets ? the Old Testament of his day ? depended on the love of God and the love of men . To read and interpret the Bible as a textbook in a particular science leads to conflict and confusion ; to interpret it for what it was really intended and for what it is ? a great record of religious aspiration and instruction ? is to he Loth interested and inspired . // Here is an illustration of the difference between reading the scriptures with a scientific outlook and reading them with a religious interest : In Genesis 2:18-25 , is given the account of the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam . This story has been the butt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt or to smile at the unnatural description of the creation of woman . When this account is read as biology , anatomy , or surgery , it raises questions . It is not that the Creator could not have made Eve in that way had he wished . No man can say what God can or can not do . But this account is unnatural and entirely foreign to man 's experience . When the same story is read with a religious interest , it is found to be rich in thought and wisdom , containing several valuable teachings : ( 1 ) " It is not good that man should be alone . " Here is a truth that has been verified both in science and in human experience . Man needs , above all things , to love and to be loved . He can not develop into a human personality alone . ( 2 ) " Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh . " This statement not only gives divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice that a couple should , upon marriage , leave their own folks , establish an independent household , and be loyal to each other . Many divorces have resulted from not following this principle . Viewed from a technical , scientific point of view , this story leaves us unsatisfied ; viewed from a religious and social point of view , its teaching is wonderfully inspiring and helpful to men and women of all ages . While the Bible does not say definitely that its whole interest is religious , this fact is illustrated on every page . Even in the creation story itself the chief emphasis in practically every verse is religious , declaring that God brought to pass each phase of creation and saw that it was good . And the Book of Mormon not only reveals its // religious emphasis throughout , but also explicitly states the religious intent of its authors . Note carefully the following passages : And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of all the things of my father , for they can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I may write of the things of God . For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , and be saved . Wherefore , I shall give commandment unto my seed , that they shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men . ( 1 Nephi 6:3-6 . ) And he gave me , Jacob , a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious ; that I should not touch , save it were lightly , con cerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi . For he said that the history of his people should be en-graven upon his other plates , and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed , from generation to generation . And if there were preaching which was sacred , or revelation which was great , or prophesying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these plates , and touch upon them as much as it were possible , for Christ 's sake , and for the sake of our people . For because of faith and great anxiety , it truly has been made manifest unto us concerning our people what things should happen unto them . And we also had many revelations , and the spirit of much prophecy ; wherefore , we knew of Christ and his kingdom , which should come . Wherefore we labored diligently among our people , that we might persuade them to come unto Christ , and partake of the goodness of God , that they might enter into his rest , lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in , as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the wilderness . Wherefore , we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God , to provoke him to anger , but that all men would believe in Christ , and view his death , and suffer his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I , Jacob , take it upon me to fulfil the command ment of my brother Nephi . ( Jacob 1:2-8. ) 2 // SUMMARY So important is the relationship of science , philosophy and religion in the minds of thoughtful college students that the next few chapters will be devoted to discussing in some detail the method and province of each of these fields . In this chapter the purpose has been to show that man has developed several important and fruitful approaches to truth , each one different in nature from the others , each one pointing to part of the truth but not to all of it . Recalling the analogy of the " knotholes in the barn , " the student is strongly urged to look through more than one " knothole . " And , to recall another analogy , the student needs more than one view of the Salt Lake Valley and should let each view complement the others . In this general approach to the subject of science and religion , the writer does not wish to be misleading . There will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest thought to both fields . Now and then one may have to choose between the two fields . However , much of the conflict is unnecessary and can be resolved ( 1 ) if the student will let art be art , science be science , philosophy be philosophy , and religion be religion ; if he will not confuse their roles in life but will let each serve life in its own way ; ( 2 ) if he will follow the wisdom of Aristotle 's thought , " It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it " ( or rejecting it , one might add ) ; ( 3 ) and if he will ? be he student of science , philosophy , or religion ? learn humility and remain teachable through the various avenues of learning which the Creator has made available to men . The eager , youthful student is impatient in his desire to have all the answers . The veteran scholar learns that all the answers have not come in as yet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Even within his own specialty of science or religion , he must wait . Why not , then , be patient also where there appears to be conflict between the findings of science and religion until we are better informed ? // THE PROVINCE OF SCIENCE Nothing has revolutionized modern living as much as the development of experimental science . In some countries man 's life expectancy has doubled within one century . Today a laboring man 's wife in America enjoys more household conveniences than Queen Elizabeth of England knew when she governed about one-fourth of the world and her navy ruled the seven seas . In terms of travel time and convenience , Tokyo is closer to Salt Lake City today than Fort Bridger , Wyoming , was in 1847 . Experimental science , as a dominant force and influence in culture , is a modern phenomenon , highly developed first in Europe , and later also in America . Ancient cultures produced world religions such as Taoism , Confucianism , Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism , Zoroastrian ism , Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers whose brilliance of mind has remained unexcelled . Modern art is different in some forms , but this does not necessarily indicate any progress over ancient art . Greek tragedy , the book of Job , the Twenty-Third Psalm , The New Testament , the Hindu classic of Bhagavad Gita and Lao-tze 's Tao-Teh-King are as rich in thought and beauty as any recent literary work . But no ancient culture appears to have developed experimental science to a marked degree . There were men who might be called scientists . Aristotle observed , classified and drew conclusions about phenomena in diverse fields both of the natural and social sciences . Hippocrates , that remarkable Greek physician , was surprisingly scientific in attitude and spirit . Archimedes and other ancients developed mathematics and astronomy , but they made only beginnings in exTim // perimentation ? a process fundamental to all the sciences . These ancient thinkers , particularly Hippocrates and Aristotle , were astute observers and logical and systematic thinkers . But they failed to develop one of the most characteristic features of science as we know it today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both discovery and verification . Great names in experimental science begin usually with Roger Bacon ( 1214-1294 ) of England and gradually increase in number , beginning with the sixteenth century . And the life 's work of any important one of them is a fascinating story . Many of us living today are so satisfied to enjoy the pleasures and comforts created by science , such as the automobile , television , motion pictures , and refrigerators , that we fail to participate either personally or vicariously in the scientific process or spirit . What sort of child is science , to which Western civilization has given birth ? What is its nature and method ? Is it good or evil in the life of man , or is it a mixed blessing ? What can the sciences do for us and in what areas of living are they inadequate ? Surely , the student who takes courses in so many individual sciences needs to be reflective about science as a whole and should better comprehend its function in the life of man . To contribute to this understanding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the word science is placed on the blackboard and students are invited to name words they associate with it , the result is usually something like this : mathematics experimentation description verification measure objectivity analysis fact conclusion hypothesis method theory // classification law observation principle reason evidence equation cause and effect formula truth study laboratory These words are radically different from the list one would obtain were he to write art , music , painting , literature , or religion on the board . The words in the above list suggest the rather unique province of science . Science is man 's rational , methodical , objective and experimental effort to establish cause and effect relationships among phenomena in life and in the universe . Science is a search for a knowledge of reality which can be stated in propositions that can be verified as being true or false . To the onlooker , science seems to be a body of knowledge , a catalogue of skills , an encyclopedia of products which the layman can use for his convenience and comfort . But to the scientist , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a search for knowledge , a point of view , an attitude of mind , a way of study and research . The above statement does not imply that the scientist is simply a technician , and that science is nothing more than an experimental method . Far from it , for the scientist thinks while he experiments , and is always structuring his hypotheses with the best logic available to him . His ideal is to establish a set of principles , consistent with each other and based on observable facts , which will explain the nature of that part of reality lying within the domain of his science . And what are the characteristics of this scientific approach ? It is not emotional , but dispassionate ? calculating , methodical , and exacting . This is not to say that the scientist himself is void of love and hate , of great desire to benefit mankind , or even to achieve vain glory or power . It is not to say that the scientist is not imaginaTHE // Live and creative . It is simply to say that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice , bias , and emotion which might color his work . His sole aim is to understand reality , to see things as they are , to see the facts in their true relationship to one another . The scientist , in the famous words of William James , is tough minded . He is not tender minded , looking for the lovely and desirable things of life , interpreting everything in his favor , ignoring the distasteful and unpleasant , seeing life through rose-colored glasses . The scientist is willing to go where his rational and impartial path leads him . He simply wishes to know what is . Whether what he finds is beautiful or ugly , good or bad , desirable or undesirable is of human interest but is no part of science itself . First , the scientist believes , man must know what is . This is the province of science . Later on , in the name of art , philosophy , religion , or humanity one can decide what to do about the reality he finds . Among the words listed above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every student should know its meaning . The antonym for objective is subjective , which means personal . The subjective world lies within oneself and includes one 's feelings , desires , wishes , hopes , longings ? one 's whole private world , which is quite incommunicable to others . On the other hand , objective means that attention is centered on the object outside of the observing mind . When we think objectively , our whole interest lies in the object that we wish to describe , measure , and observe as an entity in and of itself . We try to set aside all likes and dislikes , all prejudices , all emotional coloring to behold the object " in the white light of objectivity . " The difference between an objective and a subjective approach to the same phenomenon can be readily imagined in the following common occurrence : A patient goes to his doctor with a problem ? a pain in the abdomen . The doctor examines the patient in order to observe the // facts pertinent to the pain . Then the physician postulates several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indigestion , an ulcer , or emotional tension . He then searches for new facts as they relate to each hypothesis until , if possible , one hypothesis is verified and the pain explained . But the patient , who has the pain , is likely incapable of such objectivity . He is uncomfortable , concerned , and worried . His reaction to pain is subjective and personal . The doctor , although sympathetic and concerned as a fellow human being , as a practicing scientist , must ignore his own feelings and wishes in this situation . His only and whole scientific purpose is to ascertain a cause and effect relationship . The pain is the effect . The doctor searches for the cause in a methodical , rational , objective , and experimental manner . Such is the method and approach of science to man 's problems , and in basic procedure varies perhaps little from problem to problem and from science to science . THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SCIENCE This scientific attitude and method has made important contributions to our living . With no attempt to be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for us will be indicated here , to help us appreciate the role of science in our total living . It will be readily observed that some of the contributions listed may also become limitations in the hands of unethical human beings . Science is a mixed blessing in the sense that it has increased men 's power both to build and to destroy . Only the positive aspects will be treated first ; afterwards the limitations of science will be examined . ( 1 ) Science has eliminated much fear . Less than one hundred years ago a pioneer mother lost all five of her children with diphtheria within three weeks . Consider her fears and those of the other mothers in the commuTHE // nityl Today , thanks to science , we inoculate our children against diphtheria and are free from fear in relation to this particular disease and to many others . Generally speaking , we are afraid of the unknown , of intellectual and spiritual darkness . As science discovers cause and effect relationships among the forces of life , fear usually diminishes , for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reckon . ( 2 ) Science has eliminated much superstition . In ancient times , Israel was warned to have nothing to do with the irrational , superstitious approaches to reality practiced by surrounding peoples . When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations . There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , or that useth divination , or an observer of times , or an enchanter , or a witch , Or a charmer , or a consulter with familiar spirits , or a wizard , or a necromancer . For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord : and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee . ( Deut. 18:9-13 . ) The people of Israel were commanded to learn the laws of God and to obey them , and to establish their lives on a rational foundation . Science , by discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena , has come greatly to the aid of this ancient admonition . Science , wherever successful , enables us to learn and obey the laws of life . This practice eliminates the irrational approaches to living which are grounded in superstition and which are so prevalent in cultures without science . ( 3 ) Science has increased enormously man 's resources ? power and wealth ? which he can use , if he will , to achieve ideal ends . In our most scientifically advanced civilization , agricultural surpluses , not starvation , is a problem ; and most people are concerned about eating too much food rather than too little . Thanks to scientific // progress , hospitals , medical and dental care , and many comforts and conveniences are available to the average man in abundance . ( 4 ) Science has eliminated much drudgery and has given man considerable leisure beyond the time needed to gain the necessities of life . There are men still living who , as children , worked twelve hours a day , six days a week to help support their families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve to twenty cows by hand , night and morning , and who plowed with a team and pitched hay with a fork . Today men work forty hours a week , and by 1960 some expect to be working but four days a week . This gain in leisure has not all been the fruit of science . Social and political forces have also contributed to it , but science has made possible the reduced working hours associated with a high standard of living . ( 5 ) Within a single century , science has doubled our life expectancy and gives promise of extending it still further . What greater gift on earth could be given us than longer life , particularly when accompanied with less pain and suffering ? ( 6 ) Science has in many ways made a rich contribution to man 's intellectual and spiritual life . It has , for many who participate in scientific thinking , opened their minds to the wonders of life and the universe . To this end telescope , microscope , and other scientific inventions have helped . And once these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the astounding development which lies immediately ahead . The scientist refuses to be bound by prejudices from the past or by the limitations of his present knowledge . Every day is a new day , a day of hope and anticipation ? a day when the cause of cancer may be found or when human nature may be better understood . Through science , man has increased his love of learning . This is a value in itself . This pastime can he more // rewarding and as refreshing as eating , drinking , swim ming , or watching a horse race . Why should n't it be , if man is a rational being and a child of Him whose glory is intelligence ? Knowledge itself is good , like food , cloth ing , cars , and houses . In fact , it is one of the spiritual values of life stored away in the mind " where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal . " ( Matt. 6:20 . ) Like mercy , it is twice blest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes . " ' Science has given man reason to be humble ? to re-pent of error , to realize his small place ( spatially and temporally speaking ) in the universe , and to stand in awe of the Creator , if he is a believer . Through science , many students have come to a deeper faith , one that has satis fied their minds as well as their hearts . Science has helped man to place value on his earth-existence . While science alone leaves him wondering about the meaning of his existence here , it has certainly helped him to enjoy his stay . No longer is earth-life simply a means to an end , a prelude to the heavenly bliss that is to be . It has value in itself . And today , whether one is a believer or a non-believer in immortality , he seems to be in no hurry to cross the veil . But sweet , sweet is this human life , So sweet , I fain would breathe it still . ? WILLIAM COREY The knowledge and fruits of science have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is no fault of sci ence but rather of men . Knowledge is amoral and , there-fore , can be used to save life or to destroy it . Science could be an even greater blessing to mankind if we had the wisdom and high morality always to use it for the good of mankind . // THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE As fruitful for good as science is , it can not be man 's only approach to reality . Nor can it satisfy all of man 's needs . In terms of giving us a complete view of life and of helping us to enjoy life to the fullest , science has its shortcomings . These limitations , which will be suggested below , are not those imposed upon science by a defender of the faith . They are , rather , limitations inherent in the nature of science itself , and are generally so recognized by scientists themselves . ( 1 ) Science is not the only fruitful approach to reality . As indicated in the last chapter , and as will be pointed out in succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday living also are sources of deep satisfaction . Our modern scientific civilization has no monopoly on aesthetic feeling , on romatic and family love , on the enjoyment of nature , on the peace of mind that comes from integrity or love of neighbor . Even a scientist does not count all of his blessings the fruit of science . He too may love to eat , listen to music , read poetry , visit with friends , feel rain , plant flowers , hope for immortality , worship God , and help his neighbor. ( 2 ) Scientific knowledge is always approximate , partial , relative , limited , and tentative . This is not entirely a limitation , for it is a credit to the genuine scientist that he is quick to repent of error ; that he is never satisfied with knowledge gained , but hungers and thirsts for more . He practices " eternal progression " within his own field .

Of the six basic principles which at the end of the nineteenth century acted as the police officers to keep the physical world running in orderly fashion , there is not one the universal validity of which has not been questioned by serious and competent physicists , while most of them have been definitely proved to be subject to exceptions.2 Physicists , at the turn of the last century , were con fident that they were near to a full understanding of the physical universe .

As already indicated in chapter 2 , en-titled The Search for Truth , in no field of study do we have complete and absolute knowledge . . Philosophers too are bound by the knowledge and perspective of their day . In the field of religion , prophets humbly aware of their lack of understanding and wisdom have sought to transcend these human limitations . This , we believe , true prophets have been able to do . Those of us who believe in revelation can accept religious truths with certitude , with full assurance . This , of course , does not mean that the man of religious faith has a full knowledge of all things religious . To know in one 's heart by the witness of the Spirit that God lives does not mean that one knows all there is to know about God . To accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God , does not mean that a person understands his mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single teach64 RELIGION AND THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH ing of the Savior such as faith , repentance , love , or meek ness . Even in religion , God speaks to men " . . . in their weakness , after the manner of their language that they might come to understanding . " ( D. &; C. 1:24 . ) Therefore , Wo be unto him that shall say : We have received the word of God , and we need no more of the word of God , for we have enough ! For behold , thus saith the Lord God : I will give unto the children of men line upon line , precept upon precept , here a little and there a little . . . ( See II Nephi 28:24-31 . ) It behooves every man ? be he scientist , philosopher , religionist , or any combination of these ? to walk with humility , and to be ever concerned to correct and im prove his present conception of life as new knowledge and revelation dictate . Scientific knowledge is subjective in the last analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this chapter enthusiastic mention has been made of the objective character of science . Scientists are objective in their effort to eliminate personal wishes and prejudices from their study , and to make their methods and findings visible and verifiable is man 's thinking about food . The science of nutrition exists in the minds of men . We call it objective because it is public information on which many minds may agree ; we call it subjective because it is not reality , but is man 's thinking about food . ' Science can not be the only and complete source of our philosophy of life . There are extremely significant aspects of living in which the experimental sciences can-not and do not purport to satisfy our needs . Science does not satisfy us in the realm of value ; it does not teach us the things of greatest worth or ultimate value . In simple // language , science can tell us how to go places , but not where to go . " Science , " wrote Max Weber , one of Ger many 's greatest sociologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not give an answer to the only important question to us : What should we do ? How shall we live ? " 4 His point will be illustrated in several ways . Cooley , one of America 's most original and creative thinkers in sociology , is quite in agreement with Max Weber . He writes : The most science can do is to discover the most efficient way to reach a desired result ; it can never judge as to the ultimate worth of the desired end.5 Ultimately science can only provide the tools ; it is our world view that must determine what the tools are used for . So the final question beyond the power of sociology or any social discipline to answer , confronts every serious-minded man and woman today : What kind of a society are we trying to build ? 6 Science then deals with facts , with what is , was and will be under given conditions . But life is more than fact . Man is also a person of values and ideals . He lives in a world of facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefers some things to others . He will sometimes even sacrifice his life for honor . He is a person of ideals , of aspiration . Not only does he act , but he evaluates his action . If man dealt only in terms of facts , of what is true and false , science , though not wholly adequate , would likely be his best and only tool . But since man must also decide what he ought to do , how he ought to live , what is right and wrong , good and bad , beautiful and ugly , he must turn to other disciplines of life . This dual aspect of man 's life ? his need to understand and to evaluate ? is discussed by Wheelwright , a philoso66 RELIGION AND THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH pher , who points out the inadequacy of science to deal with value-judgments or with normative propositions : Descriptive propositions are statements about fact , and are theoretically verifiable by any competent observer as either true , false , or having a certain degree of probability . Normative prop ositions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimately vary for different individuals . Some of the most serious fallacies in ethical ( and we might add , scientific ) ' reasoning arise from confusing the two types . Neither psychoanalysis nor anthropology is able to answer the questions of ethics . Values and facts are independent types of meaning , and their relationship should not be oversimplified. $ ... Ethics is an inevitable supplement to the study of psy chology , as in the long run it is to all sciences . What is it that makes psychology such a fascinating and important study ? The fact that it gives us knowledge of human nature . If it gives us a knowledge of human nature in the concrete , as much everyday conversation and honest literature tend to do , then the study of psychology carries with it an insight into moral values . If , on the other hand , the psychology is strictly " scientific , " timing and tab ulating men 's responses to stimuli , dealing with only that which can be verified and measured , then it is not directly connected with ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , namely : What is the good of all such technical , laboratory investigations ? One psychologist , of the behavoristic school ( John B. Watson , The Ways of Behaviorism , p. 20 ) , replies : " Having solved these problems , we hope to reach such pro ficiency in our science that we can build any man , starting at birth , into any kind of social or a-social being upon order . " Well , maybe . But in any case , granted that the Behaviorist 's dream of power may some day be realized and that this wonderful ability to transform men will be in his possession , the question arises , what use will he make of it ? How ought men to be reconditioned ? Toward becoming more intelligent or toward becoming more efficient think ing machines , more complaisant to the interests of those who hold power ? The question which thus arises inevitably is a question of value , a moral question.9 // ( 5 ) Since science can not define ultimate values for us , it also is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions of life . Whether or not to marry a certain person , whether to become a doctor or a teacher , whether to have no children or eight in the family , whether or not to go on a mission , whether to live in the city or the country are questions that can not be answered scientifically . The sciences can help indirectly by giving us the facts , by helping us to see more clearly the consequences of each choice available to us . And this is important information which should not be ignored in making our decisions . But the final decision , which includes more than facts , is made on intuition based on our sense of values , on our world view as a whole . This can be illustrated by relating the problem of a certain student faced with an important decision : The boy stated the situation in these words : " I am in love with a girl who has a bad heart . The doctor says that having a child would probably take her life . And even without running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span of life is uncertain . I have known this girl as my sweetheart since high school days . Her heart trouble has become worse . If I do n't marry her it is likely that no one will . I have taken out other girls since returning from my mission , but I still love her and none other . Should I marry her ? " As a sympathetic listener , but an impartial counselor , what could one answer this student with such an important decision to make ? All that could be done in the name of biology , sociology , and economics ? in the name of reason and experience ? was to help him see the factors involved , help him to understand the reality of the situation . The joys of fatherhood were pointed out to him , as well as the added economic , physical , and psychological burden of a wife greatly impaired in health . He was reminded that most people are able to find another person // to love when they have been disappointed in a previous possible marriage . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final decision was his . He had to weigh these things against his feeling of love for the girl and hers for him . His decision must be , in the final analysis , sub jective and personal . Science could help him only to make his choice with a fuller realization of its consequences . His final choice then was not a scientific one . ' ? SUMMARY Science , by helping us to establish cause and effect relationships and thereby enabling us to better under-stand reality , is a helpful and useful tool . But when con sidered to be the only source of an adequate philosophy of life , it is found wanting . The sciences provide an indis pensable avenue to truth and an aid to living , and they should be studied with critical but open-minded consid eration being given to their conclusions . Moreover , the method and spirit of science can be effective not only within the sciences themselves , but in everyday life and , to a helpful degree , in philosophy , the arts and religion . In some important phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sources of learning and living can do so . A brief consideration of philosophy will follow . // THE PROVINCE OF PHILOSOPHY Religion and philosophy have subject matter in common . Both are concerned with the ultimate nature of the universe and the meaning of human life . Both have much to say about ethics and morality ? concerning how we should live with our fellow men . Indeed , in some ways , philosophy and religion stand in a much closer relationship to each other than do science and religion . Despite their common interests , however , philosophy and religion are quite different in method , attitude , vocabulary , and purpose . All of this is confusing to the uninitiated student , particularly when disagreements arise , as they always do when men philosophize . Therefore , at the risk of being too technical for the student who has not studied philosophy and too superficial for the serious student in this field , an attempt will be made to discuss the nature , method , contributions , and limitations of this field of study , with particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY The word philosophy is used in two ways . In popular , non-technical language one speaks of a person 's philosophy of life . This simply means his view of things , his outlook on life . The Germans call it weltanschauung , or one 's look at the world . Nearly every adult has his weltanschauung , an everyday way of contemplating the world . In this chapter , however , the word philosophy is used in a far more technical and exacting way . Philosophy is a rigorous intellectual discipline , an approach to truth studied principally at universities . Philosophy , as a systematic discipline , was developed first by the ancient Greeks ; by men // such as Democritus , Socrates , Plato , Aristotle , Epicurus , Plotinus , and others . During the Middle Ages philosophical studies continued , but not generally in the independent spirit of ancient Greece . Philosophy became largely a tool , often used with brilliance of mind , by which theologians sought to explain and defend their faith . With the Frenchman , Rene Descartes ( 1596-1650 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology and has remained such ever since . Nearly all countries have contributed men to the ranks of eminent philosophers . In France there are Descartes and Bergson ; in Holland there is Spinoza ; in Germany there is a long list , including Leibniz , Kant , and Hegel ; in England there are a large number , including Berkeley , Locke , Hulme , and Whitehead ; in America there are , for example , two original and influential thinkers in the persons of William James and John Dewey . Philosophy is the kind of thinking in which these men have participated . In what have they been engaged ? How do philosophers search for truth ? A philosopher is literally " a lover of wisdom , " a man who , above all else , pursues the life of reason . His is a " disinterested interest in truth . " Like the scientist , most philosophers also strive to be objective in their view of reality . In the language of William James , the philosopher is also tough-minded in his logical analysis , probably even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider and include all facets of human experience . Some , such as Plotinus , Bergson , and William James , have been mystical and intuitive in their search for the total meaning of things . Philosophy , even as science , is essentially a rational approach to reality , but it differs from science both in its purpose and its method . The scientist is a specialist working in a corner , tracing down the facts with precision tools . The philosopher , in contrast , is a man of vision , of broader perspective , taking a more panoramic view of life . // The philosopher " tries to see life steadily and to see it whole . " Plato described his labors in this way : " A man who is to make anything of his life , who means to capture the truth of things , must be the spectator of all time and all existence . " The philosopher tries to find a meaning in the totality of human knowledge and experience . There-fore , he presupposes science , art , religion , and everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may also include intuition , mysticism , aesthetic experience , and faith in his kit of tools . FIELDS OF PHILOSOPHY Though the philosopher is seeking a steady view of the whole of reality , he finds it necessary and convenient to divide his subject matter into several large divisions , each of which will be described briefly . ' The oldest and most distinctive subdivision of philos ophy is called metaphysics . This is a Greek word which means literally beyond physics . The metaphysician deals with questions beyond the reach of the physicist . The philosopher wants to know of what the ultimate nature of reality consists . If one thinks beyond the world of appearances , beyond the things known through the five senses , what is the universe ? Is it mind or matter or both ? Is it the product of blind forces or the fruit of a // great intelligence ? Is human personality an eternal entity or simply a passing , mortal organization of matter ? Con cerning the philosopher 's interest in these difficult ques tions , Henry Adams wrote : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insoluble problems . " 2 Metaphysics deals with hard ques tions and comes up with difficult answers , which , to the uninitiated , fit the description given by Henry Adams . However , to the philosopher , metaphysical theories may have the orderly and even aesthetic quality of a master-piece in mosaic even when he disagrees with them . A second branch of philosophy is called epistemology , or theory of knowledge . Both the scientist and the man on the street assume that things are what they think them to be . To them a chair is a chair , and nature is nature . But the epistemologist is not satisfied with this simple , common-sense point of view . He asks questions such as : Does that chair exist by itself or only as a thought in my mind ? How can one know reality ? Can the impressions of one 's senses be trusted ? Then , in this critical frame of mind , the epistemologist proceeds to examine carefully the ways of knowing that are available to man . In a critical , systematic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalism , empiricism , and intuition includ ing mysticism . Some philosophers have been rationalists , accrediting to the mind the ability to know important aspects of reality a priori , or before experience , and with-out scientific facts . Others have been empiricists , believ ing that one learns only through sensory experience . Many combine rationalism and empiricism and put their trust in these two working hand-in-hand . Some few philosophers have had respect for mysticism , placing trust in intuition or in a direct and immediate acquaintance with reality . // Closely related to epistlnology is logic . The discipline of logic was given great impetus by Aristotle . Traditionally its purpose has been to examine how one thinks and to prescribe some principles and rules of correct , consistent thinking . Under the impact of contemporary philosophy ( analysis ) its character has changed markedly . Logic is one of the most tangible , specific , and applied branches of philosophy . A fourth major field of philosophy deals with value . This branch has two divisions : moral and aesthetic . The philiosopher , recogninzing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attempts to find a reasonable basis for this evaluation . He wants to know why one calls some things good and some things evil . He asks : What is good ? What is evil ? Why is something good at one time and bad at another ? Are moral practices just a matter of convention , or is there a rational basis for calling some things good and other things bad ? The theory of right and wrong in human behavior is called ethics ; the behavior itself is called morality . The philosopher also tries to bring reason to bear on aesthetic experience . Why are people often thrilled when they listen to music , read poetry , or look at an object of art ? What is this emotion called aesthetic feeling and wherein does it differ from other emotions , such as romanfie or brotherly love ? What makes a work of art beautiful or ugly ? The major subdivisions of philosophy have been mentioned : metaphysics , epistemology , logic , ethics , and aesthetics . A teacher of philosophy does not confine himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , in the philosophy of democracy , history , or religion . What is the difference between a course in history and a course in the philosophy of history ? The historian is concerned with concrete facts and with establishing cause and effect relationships among them . He might ask : // What specific situations and happenings caused World War I or World War II ? The philosopher of history , on the other hand , takes a much broader view . His eye is on the totality of events . He asks such questions as these : Is human history in general a meaningless , futile story or is it controlled by the will of God , as portrayed in Amos , Isaiah , and Jeremiah ? Is the course of history determined by economic forces , or by more ideal factors , or by both ? Augustine , Rousseau , Hegel , Marx , and Spengler are among the most famous philosophers of history . Likewise , a course in the philosophy of religion is quite different from the study and practice of religion itself . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical angle . They are thinking about religion , examining religious concepts critically , logically , and comparatively . Students should realize that a course in the philosophy of religion is not religion itself . Religion is faith , worship , love , fellowship ? the experiencing and practicing of these things . The philosophy of religion is a critical , rational examination of religious experience . But religion itself , to use an analogy , is like being in love ; whereas the philosophy of religion is like an outsider looking on , asking : What is love ? Why do people fall in love ? Is love a good or bad thing to experience ? THE METHOD OF PHILOSOPHY Thus far in this chapter the writer has tried to define the philosopher 's basic purpose , that of gaining a rational and whole view of life in the universe ; and has described briefly the subdivisions of philosophy . The philosophical method will now be characterized . The philosopher is individualistic . Each philosopher has , to quite a degree , his own method , his own point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another on many important points of view . Their views are extremely diversified in metaphysics , episTHE // temology , ethics , aesthetics , and in their philosophies of history . In contrast , scientists working in the same field usually use similar , if not identical , methods and gain a fund of knowledge in common . The reason for this individuality among the philosophers lies in the speculative nature of the subject , dealing as philosophy must do , with difficult and abstract subject matter . Rational and plausible proofs are given for various theories in metaphysics , epistemology , ethics , and aesthetics ; but none of these theories can be established with finality . Philosophy is comprehensive , taking into account all facts available and all human experience . There is no question or problem which does not come under its scrutiny . It patrols the whole domain of life . Each science deals with a small segment of reality or with one phase of the whole . Art is essentially an intuitive approach , ignoring rational and practical motives . Religion is concerned with questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions which plague the philosopher . Philosophy alone tries to be universal and all-inclusive in its view of life . One philosopher has compared the scientists with members of an orchestra , and the philosopher with the conductor of the orchestra , who tries to keep them all playing in tune and is conscious of the total effect . The philosopher is critical in his thinking . While the first principle of most religions is faith , the starting point in much philosophy is to doubt that things are as they appear to be in the everyday , uncritical way of looking at them . He seeks to penetrate deeper than the common-sense view of reality . Compared to the philosopher , even the scientist is a man of faith , for the latter assumes the validity of the principle of cause and effect and the reality of the external world ; and he trusts his senses to give him information about the world . The philosopher , in contrast , is critical of the assumptions of science and the postulates of religious faith . It is no wonder // that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy misunderstand each other when they talk about the same subject matter . Historical philosophy is synoptic in character , trying to see all things in one view , understanding facts and principles always in relation to other things and in a manner consistent with each other . Science is more analytical , taking things apart and resolving them into their separate elements . Philosophy has generally been interested in the whole view and insists upon consistency within this view . Analytic philosophy , as already indicated , represents a departure from this synoptic type of thinking . The study of philosophy is not every man 's " meat . " Some people are not interested in abstract , critical thinking . They prefer the more concrete world of science , the soul-stirring realm of aesthetic feeling or the more positive and affirmative approach to life found in religion . Those who pursue philosophy will find both satisfactions and dissatisfactions . Some of each will be indicated here , but first its contributions and satisfactions will be discussed . THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY Philosophy cultivates fields of possible knowledge which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns himself with problems concerning the nature of the universe and the meaning of life for which there are no simple nor certain answers . And while he can not prove with certainty that the world is only matter , only mind or both , he does come up with some interesting possibilities , guesses or visions regarding the nature of reality . This is stimulating and satisfying , in a way , to persons of intellectual curiosity . Philosophers have given to the world possible rational views of life which they have sought to establish by consistent reasoning . Philosophizing itself is a value . Man is intellectual // by nature . And to think hard , stubbornly , honestly and with a broad , sweeping view of things is in itself rewarding . Great minds , such as those of Plato , Aristotle , and Kant , have approached life philosophicially . To read their thinking is satisfying in itself . Why should a man not enjoy thinking for its own sake as he does eating , drinking , making friends , listening to music , and worshiping ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bird is impelled to fly . The study of philosophy can help a person think more clearly and more consistently . This is accomplished by using principles and rules of logic . It is helped also by practicing synoptic thinking ; that is , by relating single ideas and experiences to more general and universal principles . The philosospher stands back and tries to see the whole . He does not get lost in detail and he tries not to be influenced by emotion and prejudice . A professor once said of his colleague , who happened to be a philosopher : , .  --  could sit in as judge on his own case and do it as impartially as any other man could . " This is the philosophic spirit . The study of philosophy may temper the emotions and cultivate a more reasonable attitude toward the tragedy and vicissitudes of life . The philosopher is not prone to put himself in the center of things and to expect men , nature , and God to live for his comfort and convenience . He sees himself , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as being subject to the laws of nature , as being one of God 's children , and not as having been singled out for preference . Some philosophers , even without the faith which sustains people in religion , have attained heroic and serene attitudes in the face of the tragedy of life which they have acknowledged . Lucretius , the Roman philosophical poet , and the Stoics of ancient Greece are illustrations of the triumph of reason over fear and despair . Plato 's Apology and his Crito , which retell how // serenely Socrates accepted death even though falsely condemned , are classic examples of philosophic composure . The philosopher is a needed critic of persons working in more specialized fields of learning and activity . The scientist , for example , is inclined to make assumptions and to draw conclusions which are unwarranted from a larger , philosophical viewpoint . The sciences are children of philosophy ? prodigal sons , so to speak ? who left the parental roof to seek more specific knowledge . They still need their old mother , philosophy , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Here is an illustration : Some decades ago scientists and philosophers met in round-table discussion . A physicist described the orderly movements of protons and electrons in the world and concluded that there is no room for indeterminism or free will in the universe . A philosopher who was present said , " How do you know that the protons and elections do not choose to behave in an orderly way ? " Another day , in the same seminar , a psychologist remarked that since mental functions are impaired whenever the brain is severely damaged , the mind is identical with the brain . The philosopher replied , " There is no swimming without water , but does this mean that water is the whole explanation of swimming ? " The philosopher sees things in a larger relationship than the specialist , and his broader view is needed . Philosophers have contributed some excellent reflections on life 's values . Some of their statements are wholly consistent with the teachings of the prophets and the finest insights of the poets . Note , for example , these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Golden Rule . The result of reasoned argument , they have their own peculiar value and strength : Act so as to use humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of another , always as an end , never as merely a means . Act in conformity with that maxim , and that maxim only , which you can at the same time will to be a universal law . // SOME LIMITATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY Philosophy , like science , has its limitations in a person 's life , particularly if other sources of thinking and living are neglected . Philosophy can do important things for a person , but it can not do all . Like each other field of knowledge , it too has limitations . Philosophy alone can no more satisfy the whole man than can science , art or religion when functioning to the exclusion of the others . Because of its highly abstract , rational character , philosophy is , to many people , the least accessible of the fields of knowledge . Nearly every man can know the satisfactions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the rain , holding the hand of a trusting child , eating a treeripened peach , or conversing with a friend . People without great intellectual ability or abstract reasoning power can enjoy a sunset or a symphony . All men can participate either in science or in the fruits of science . Religion is available both to the child and to the old man , and both to sinner and saint ; it is needed alike by the proud and by the lowly . But philosophy is for the few . This in no sense depreciates its value to him who philosophizes , for the value of anything is not to be measured by the number of people who participate in it . The philosopher , as many are coming to see , finds himself in a dilemma . As finite man , he is trying to comprehend the infinite . Earth-dweller that he is , he would comprehend from his own resources the entire universe . A child of his time , he would view things with the eyes of eternity . But his task is too large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic and an imaginative creator of the possibilities of life and know the satisfaction of thinking ; in his great desire to understand the whole of life , he is doomed to failure . Other men , working in less pretentious fields and with less presumption , may find the kind of satisfaction that comes from completion , from fulfilment or from faith .
