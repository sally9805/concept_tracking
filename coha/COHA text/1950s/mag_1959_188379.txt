Russia proved surprisingly cordial to Richard Nixon ( see below ) , but Poland provided the most eye-bugging welcome an international traveler ever got . <P> Fearful that the Kremlin might take offense if Warsaw crowds treated Nixon too much more warmly than they recently treated Khrushchev ( TIME , July 27 et seq . ) , Poland 's Communist government had carefully kept quiet the time and place of the Vice President 's arrival , and the Warsaw press said nothing about the route his party would follow into Warsaw . As further insurance , Polish Communists decreed that only 500 people would be allowed onto Babice Airport to meet him . <P> None of this careful planning bothered Warsaw 's freedom-minded people . While Nixon in his brief arrival speech was drawing smiles from Polish officials with a tactful mention of Vice Admiral Hyman Rickover 's Polish birthplace , Makowa Village , and recalling that two Polish glass blowers had been among the first settlers at Jamestown , Va. , the excluded crowds waved and shouted beyond the airport gates .

And as Dick and Pat Nixon stood on the steps waving , the roaring chorus rose again : " Bravo , Americans ! " <P> If ever a people voted with their throats , their eyes , their smiling faces , the residents of Communist Poland showed their preference this day .
