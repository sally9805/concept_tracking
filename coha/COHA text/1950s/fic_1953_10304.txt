" I need one . I ca n't believe Lily is gone , that she --  " " There 's a bottle of burgundy , Acton . Mind fetching it from that cabinet ? " Yes , fetch it . Handle it . Touch it . He did . " Some interesting first editions there , Acton . Feel this binding , Feel of it . " " I did n't come to see books , I --  " He had touched the books and the library table and touched the burgundy bottle and burgundy glasses . Now , squatting on the floor beside Huxley 's cold body with the polishing handkerchief in his fingers , motionless , he stared at the house , the walls , the furniture about him , his eyes widening , his f mouth dropping , stunned by what he realized and what he saw . He shut his eyes , dropped his head , crushed the handkerchief between his hands , wadding it , biting his lips with his teeth , pullingin on himself . The fingerprints were everywhere , everywhere ! " Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , eh ? With your fingers , eh ? I 'm terribly tired . You understand ? " A pair of gloves . Before he did one more thing , before he polished another area , he must have a pair of gloves , or he might unintentionally , after cleaning a surface , redistribute his identity . He put his hands in his pockets . He walked through the house to the hall umbrella stand , the hatrack . Huxley 's overcoat . He pulled out the overcoat pockets . No gloves.  |p61hinted  he might need gloves before the night was finished ) , so now he had to sweat for his sin of omission . Somewhere in the house there must be at least one pair of gloves . He would have to hurry ; there was every chance that someone might visit Huxley , even at this hour . Rich friends drinking themselves in and out the door , laughing , shouting , coming and going without so much as hello-good-by . He would have until six in the morning , at the outside , when Huxley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the airport and Mexico City ... . Acton hurried about upstairs opening drawers , using the handkerchiefas blotter . He untidied seventy or eighty drawers in six rooms , left them with their tongues , so to speak , hanging out , ran on to new ones . He felt naked , unable to do anything until he found gloves . He might scour the entire house with the handkerchief , buffing every possible surface where fingerprints might lie , then accidentally bump a wall here or there , thus sealing his own fate with one microscopic , whorling symbol ! It would be putting his stamp of approval on the murder , that 's what it would be ! Like those waxen seals in the old days when they rattled papyrus , flourished ink , dusted all with sand to dry the ink , and pressed their signet rings in hot crimson tallow at the bottom . So it would be if he left one , mind you , one fingerprint upon the scene ! His approval of the murder did not extend as far as affixing said seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful , he told himself . At the bottom of the eighty-fifth drawer he found gloves . " Oh , my Lord , my Lord ! " He slumped against the bureau , sighing . He tried the gloves on , held them up , proudly flexed them , buttoned them . They were soft , gray , thick , impregnable . He could ( lo all sorts of tricks with hands now and leave no trace . He thumbed his nose in the bedroom mirror , sucking his teeth . " NO ! " cried Huxley . What a wicked plan it had been.  |p62Huxley  had fallen to the floor , purposely ! Oh , what a wickedly clever man ! Down onto the hardwood floor had dropped Huxley , with Acton after him . They had rolled and tussled and clawed at the floor , printing and printing it with their frantic fingertips ! Huxley had slipped away a few feet , Acton crawling after to lay hands on his neck and squeeze until the life came out like pasta from a tube ! Gloved , William Acton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laboriously began the task of swabbing every wildly infested inch of it . Inch by inch , inch by inch , he polished and polished until he could almost see his intent , sweating face in it . Then he came to a table and polished the leg of it , on up its solid body and along the knobs and over the top . He came to a bowl of wax fruit , burnished the filigree silver , plucked out the wax fruit and wiped them clean , leaving the fruit at the bottom unpolished . " I 'm sure I did n't touch them , " he said . After rubbing the table he came to a picture frame hung over it . " I 'm certain I did n't touch that , " he said . He stood looking at it . He glanced at all the doors in the room . Which doors had he used tonight ? He could n't remember . Polish all of them , then . He started on the doorknobs , shined them all up , and then he curried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he went to all the furniture in the room and wiped the chair arms . " That chair you 're sitting in , Acton , is an old Louis XIV piece . Feel that material , " said Huxley . " I did n't come to talk furniture , Huxley ! I came about Lily . " " Oh , come off it , you 're not that serious about her . She does n't love you , you know . She 's told me she 'll go with me to Mexico City tomorrow . " " You and your money and your damned furniture ! "  | " It 's nice furniture , Acton ; be a good guest and feel of it . " Fingerprints can be found on fabric . " Huxley ! " William Acton stared at the body . " Did you guess I was going to kill you ? Did your subconscious suspect , just as my subconscious suspected ? And did your subconscious tell you to make me run about the house handling , touching , fondling books , dishes , doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He washed the chairs dryly with the clenched handkerchief . ' L'hen he remembered the body  --  he had n't dry-washed it . He went to it and turned it now this way , now that , and burnished every surface of it . I-k even shined the shoes , charging nothing . While shining the shoes his face took on a little tremor of worry , and after a moment he got up and walked over to that table . He took out and polished the wax fruit at the bottom of the bowl . " Better , " he whispered , and went back to the body . But as he crouched over the body his eyelids twitched and his jaw moved from side to side and he debated , then he got up and walked once more to the table . He polished the picture frame . While polishing the picture frame he discovered -- The wall . " That , " he said , " is silly . " " Oh ! " cried Huxley , fending him off . He gave Acton a shove as they struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ran toward Huxley again . He strangled Huxley . Huxley died . Acton turned steadfastly from the wall , with equilibrium and decision . The harsh words and the action faded in his mind ; he hid t liem away . He glanced at the four walls . " Ridiculous ! " he said . From the corners of his eyes he saw something on one wall . " I refuse to pay attention , " he said to distract himself . " Thep64next room , now ! I 'll be methodical . Let 's see  --  altogether we were in the hall , the library , this room , and the dining room and the kitchen . " There was a spot on the wall behind him . Well , was n't there ? He turned angrily . " All right , all right , just to be sure , " and he went over and could n't find any spot . Oh , a little one , yes , right  --  there . He dabbed it . It was n't a fingerprint anyhow . He finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he looked at the wall and the way it went over to his right and over to his left and how it went down to his feet and up over his head and he said softly , " No . " He looked up and down and over and across and he said quietly , " That would be too much . " How many square feet ? " I do n't give a good damn , " he said . But unknown to his eyes , his gloved fingers moved in a little rubbing rhythm on the wall . He peered at his hand and the wallpaper . He looked over his shoulder at the other room . " I must go in there and polish the essentials , " he told himself , but his hand remained , as if to hold the wall , or himself , up . His face hardened . Without a word he began to scrub the wall , up and down , back and forth , up and down , as high as he could stretch and as low as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " But you must be certain , his thought said to him . " Yes , one must be certain , " he replied . He got one wall finished , and then .. . He came to another wall . " What time is it ? " He looked at the mantel clock . An hour gone . It was five after one . The doorbell rang.  |p65Acton  froze , staring at the door , the clock , the door , the clock . Someone rapped loudly . A long moment passed . Acton did not breathe . Without new air in his body he began to fail away , to sway ; his head roared a silence of cold waves thundering onto heavy rocks . " Hey , in there ! " cried a drunken voice . " I know you 're in there , Huxley ! Open up , dammit ! This is Billy-boy , drunk as an owl , Huxley , old pal , drunker than two owls . " " Go away , " whispered Acton soundlessly , crushed against the wall . " Huxley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " cried thedrunken voice . " Yes , I 'm in here , " whispered Acton , feeling long and sprawledand clumsy on the floor , clumsy and cold and silent . " Yes . " " Hell ! " said the voice , fading away into mist . The footsteps shuffled off . " Hell . . . " Acton stood a long time feeling the red heart beat inside his shut eyes , within his head . When at last he opened his eyes he looked at the new fresh wall straight ahead of him and finally got courage to speak . " Silly , " he said . " This wall 's flawless . I wo n't touch it . Got to hurry . Got to hurry . Time , time . Only a few hours before those damn-fool friends blunder in ! " He turned away . From the corners of his eyes he saw the little webs . When his back was turned the little spiders came out of the woodwork and delicately spun their fragile little half-invisible webs . Not upon the wall at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the three walls as yet untouched . Each time he stared directly at them the spiders dropped back into the woodwork , only to spindle out as he retreated . " Those walls are all right , " he insisted in a half shout . " I wo n't touch them ! " He went to a writing desk at which Huxley had been seated earlier . He opened a drawer and took out what he was looking for.  |p66A  little magnifying glass Huxley sometimes used for reading . He took the magnifier and approached the wall uneasily . Fingerprints . " But those are n't mine ! " He laughed unsteadily . " I did n't put them there ! I 'm sure I did n't ! A servant , a butler , or a maid perhaps ! " The wall was full of them . " Look at this one here , " he said . " Long and tapered , a woman 's , I 'd bet money on it . " " Would you ? " " I would ! " " Are you certain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  yes . " " Absolutely ? " " Yes , damn it , yes ! " " Wipe it out , anyway , why do n't you ? " " There , by God ! " " Out damned spot , eh , Acton ? " " And this one , over here , " scoffed Acton . " That 's the print of a fat man . " " Are you sure ? " " Do n't start that again ! " he snapped , and rubbed it out . He pulled off a glove and held his hand up , trembling , in the glary light . " Look at it , you idiot ! See how the whorls go ? See ? " " That proves nothing ! " " Oh , all right ! " Raging , he swept the wall up and down , back and forth , with gloved hands , sweating , grunting , swearing , bending , rising , and getting redder of face.  |p67He  took off his coat , put it on a chair . " Two o'clock , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . He walked over to the bowl and took out the wax fruit and polished the ones at the bottom and put them back , and polished the picture frame . He gazed up at the chandelier . His fingers twitched at his sides . His mouth slipped open and the tongue moved along his lips and he looked at the chandelier and looked away and looked back at the chandelier and looked at Huxley 's body and then at the crystal chandelier with its long pearls of rainbow glass . He got a chair and brought it over under the chandelier and put one foot up on it and took it down and threw the chair , violently , laughing , into a corner . Then he ran out of the room , leaving one wall as yet unwashed . In the dining room he came to a table . " I want to show you my Gregorian cutlery , Acton , " Huxley had said . Oh , that casual , that hypnotic , voice ! " I have n't time , " Acton said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at this silver , this exquisite craftsmanship . " Acton paused over the table where the boxes of cutlery were laid out , hearing once more Huxley 's voice , remembering all the touchings and gesturings . Now Acton wiped the forks and spoons and took down all the plaques and special ceramic dishes from the wall shelf ... . " Here 's a lovely bit of ceramics by Gertrude and Otto Natzler , Acton . Are you familiar with their work ? " " It is lovely . " " Pick it up . Turn it over . See the fine thinness of the bowl , handthrownon a turntable , thin as eggshell , incredible . And the amazingvolcanic glaze ? Handle it , go ahead . I do n't mind . "  |p68Acton  sobbed unevenly . He hurled the pottery against the wall . It shattered and spread , flaking wildly , upon the floor . An instant later he was on his knees . Every piece , every shard of it , must be found . Fool , fool , fool ! he cried to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending under the table . Find every piece , idiot , not one fragment of it must be left behind . Fool , fool ! He gathered them . Are they all here ? He looked at them on the table before him . He looked under the table again and under the chairs and the service bureaus and found one more piece by match light and started to polish each little fragment as if it were a precious stone . He laid them all out neatly upon the shining polished table . " A lovely bit of ceramics , Acton . Go ahead  --  handle it . " He took out the linen and wiped it and wiped the chairs and tables and doorknobs and windowpanes and ledges and drapes and wiped the floor and found the kitchen , panting , breathing violently , and took off his vest and adjusted his gloves and wiped the glittering chromium . . . . " I want to show you my house , Acton , " said Huxley . " Come along . . . . " And he wiped all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now he had forgotten what he had touched and what he had not . Huxley and he had lingered here , in the kitchen , Huxley prideful of its array , covering his nervousness at the presence of a potential killer , perhapswanting to be near the knives if they were needed . They had idled , touched this , that , something else  --  there was no rememberingwhat or how much or how many  --  and he finished the kitchen and came through the hall into the room where Huxley lay . He cried out . He had forgotten to wash the fourth wall of the room ! And while he was gone the little spiders had popped from the fourth unwashed wall and swarmed over the already clean walls , dirtyingp69them again ! On the ceilings , from the chandelier , in the corners , on the floor , a million little whorled webs hung billowing at his scream ! Tiny , tiny little webs , no bigger than , ironically , your  --  finger ! As he watched , the webs were woven over the picture frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prints wielded the paper knife , pulled out drawers , touched the table top , touched , touched , touched everything everywhere . He polished the floor wildly , wildly . He rolled the body over and cried on it while he washed it , and got up and walked over and polished the fruit at the bottom of the bowl . Then he put a chair under the chandelier and got up and polished each little hanging fire of it , shaking it like a crystal tambourine until it tilted bellwise in the air . Then he leaped off the chair and gripped the doorknobs and got up on other chairs and swabbed the walls higher and higher and ran to the kitchen and got a broom and wiped the webs down from the ceiling and polished the bottom fruit of the bowl and washed the body and doorknobs and silverware and found the hall banister and followed the banister upstairs . Three o'clock ! Everywhere , with a fierce , mechanical intensity , clocks ticked ! There were twelve rooms downstairs and eightabove . He figured the yards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six sofas , twenty-seven tables , six radios . And under and on top and behind . He yanked furniture out away from walls and , sobbing , wiped them clean of years-old dust , and staggeredand followed the banister up , up the stairs , handling , erasing , rubbing , polishing , because if he left one little print it would reproduceand make a million more !  --  and the job would have to be done all over again and now it was four o'clock !  --  and his arms ached and his eyes were swollen and staring and he moved sluggishlyabout , on strange legs , his head down , his arms moving , swabbing and rubbing , bedroom by bedroom , closet by closet ... .  |p70They  found him at six-thirty that morning . In the attic . The entire house was polished to a brilliance . Vases shone like glass stars . Chairs were burnished . Bronzes , brasses , and coppers were all aglint . Floors sparkled . Banisters gleamed . Everything glittered . Everything shone , everything was bright ! They found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old frames and the old chairs and the old carriages and toys and music boxes and vases and cutlery and rocking horses and dusty Civil War coins . He was half through the attic when the police officer walked up behind him with a gun . " Done ! " On the way out of the house Acton polished the front doorknob with his handkerchief and slammed it in triumph !  |p71She  took the great iron spoon and the mummified frog and gave it a bash and made dust of it , and talked to the dust while she ground it in her stony fists quickly . Her beady gray bird-eyes flickered at the cabin . Each time she looked , a head in the small thin window ducked as if she 'd fired off a shotgun . " Charlie ! " cried Old Lady . " You come outa there ! I 'm fixing a lizard magic to unlock that rusty door ! You come out now and I wo n't make the earth shake or the trees go up in fire or the sun set at high noon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high turpentine trees , a tufted squirrel chittering around and aroundp72on a green-furred log , the ants moving in a fine brown line at Old Lady 's bare , blue-veined feet . " You been starving in there two clays , darn you ! " she panted , chiming the spoon against a flat rock , causing the plump gray miracle bag to swing at her waist . Sweating sour , she rose and marched at the cabin , bearing the pulverized flesh . " Come out , now ! " She flicked a pinch of powder inside the lock . " All right , I 'll come get you ! " she wheezed . She spun the knob with one walnut-colored hand , first one way , then the other . " O Lord , " she intoned , " fling this door wide ! " When nothing flung , she added yet another philter and held her breath . Her long blue untidy skirt rustled as she peered into her bag of darkness to see if she had any scaly monsters there , any charm finer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this . She heard Charlie breathing against the door . His folks had pranced off into some Ozark town early this week , leaving him , and he 'd run almost six miles to Old Lady for company  --  she was by way of being an aunt or cousin or some such , and he did n't mind her fashions . But then , two days ago , Old Lady , having gotten used to the boy around , decided to keep him for convenient company . She pricked her thin shoulder bone , drew out three blood pearls , spat wet over her right elbow , tromped on a crunch-cricket , and at the same instant clawed her left hand at Charlie , crying , " My son you are , you are my son , for all eternity ! " Charlie , bounding like a startled hare , had crashed off into the bush , heading for home . But Old Lady , skittering quick as a gingham lizard , cornered him in a dead end , and Charlie holed up in this old hermit 's cabin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , window , or knothole with amber-colored fist or trounced her ritualp73fires , explaining to him that he was certainly her son now , all right . " Charlie , you there ? " she asked , cutting holes in the door planks with her bright little slippery eyes . " I 'm all of me here , " he replied finally , very tired . Maybe he would fall out on the ground any moment . She wrestled the knob hopefully . Perhaps a pinch too much frog powder had grated the lock wrong . She always overdid or underdid her miracles , she mused angrily , never doing them just exact , Devil take it ! " Charlie , I only wants someone to night-prattle to , someone to warm hands with at the fire . Someone to fetch kindling for me mornings , and fight off the spunks that come creeping of early fogs ! I ai n't got no fetchings on you for myself , son , just for your company . " She smacked her lips . " Tell you what , Charles , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What things ? " he suspicioned . " Teach you how to buy cheap , sell high . Catch a snow weasel , cut off its head , carry it warm in your hind pocket . There ! " " Aw , " said Charlie . She made haste . " Teach you to make yourself shotproof . So if anyone bangs at you with a gun , nothing happens . " When Charlie stayed silent , she gave him the secret in a high fluttering whisper . " Dig and stitch mouse-ear roots on Friday during full moon , and wear ' em around your neck in a white silk . " " You 're crazy , " Charlie said . " Teach you how to stop blood or make animals stand frozen or make blind horses see , all them things I 'll teach you ! Teach you to cure a swelled-up cow and unbewitch a goat . Show you how to make yourself invisible ! " " Oh , " said Charlie . Old Lady 's heart beat like a Salvation tambourine . The knob turned from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are funning me . " " No , I 'm not , " exclaimed Old Lady . " Oh , Charlie , why , I 'll make you like a window , see right through you . Why , child , you 'll be surprised ! " " Real invisible ? " " Real invisible ! " " You wo n't fetch onto me if I walk out ? " " Wo n't touch a bristle of you , son . " " Well , " he drawled reluctantly , " all right . " The door opened . Charlie stood in his bare feet , head down , chin against chest . " Make me invisible , " he said . " First we got to catch us a bat , " said Old Lady . " Start lookin ' ! " She gave him some jerky beef for his hunger and watched him climb a tree . He went high up and high up and it was nice seeing him there and it was nice having him here and all about after so many years alone with nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty soon a bat with a broken wing fluttered down out of the tree . Old Lady snatched it up , beating warm and shrieking between its porcelain white teeth , and Charlie dropped down after it , hand upon clenched hand , yelling . That night , with the moon nibbling at the spiced pine cones , Old Lady extracted a long silver needle from under her wide blue dress . Gumming her excitement and secret anticipation , she sighted up the dead bat and held the cold needle steady-steady . She had long ago realized that her miracles , despite all perspirationsand salts and sulphurs , failed . But she had always dreamt that one day the miracles might start functioning , might spring up in crimson flowers and silver stars to prove that God had forgivenher for her pink body and her pink thoughts and her warm body and her warm thoughts as a young miss . But so far God hadp75made no sign and said no word , but nobody knew this except Old Lady . " Ready ? " she asked Charlie , who crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth open , making teeth . " Ready , " he whispered , shivering . " There ! " She plunged the needle deep in the bat 's right eye . " So ! " " Oh ! " screamed Charlie , wadding up his face . " Now I wrap it in gingham , and here , put it in your pocket , keep it there , bat and all . Go on ! " He pocketed the charm . " Charlie ! " she shrieked fearfully . " Charlie , where are you ? I ca n't see you , child ! " " Here ! " He jumped so the light ran in red streaks up his body . " I 'm here , Old Lady ! " He stared ; wildly at his arms , legs , chest , and toes . " I 'm here ! " Her eyes looked as if they were watching a thousand fireflies crisscrossing each other in the wild night air . " Charlie , oh , you went fast ! Quick as a hummingbird ! Oh , Charlie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! " he wailed . " Where ? " " By the fire , the fire ! And  --  and I can see myself . I 'm not invisibleat all ! " Old Lady rocked on her lean flanks . " Course you can see you ! Every invisible person knows himself . Otherwise , how could you eat , walk , or get around places ? Charlie , touch me . Touch me so I know you . " Uneasily he put out a hand . She pretended to jerk , startled , at his touch . " Ah ! " " You mean to say you ca n't find me ? " he asked . " Truly ? " " Not the least half rump of you ! "  |p76She  found a tree to stare at , and stared at it with shining eyes , careful not to glance at him . " Why , I sure did a trick that time ! " She sighed with wonder . " Whooeee . Quickest invisible I ever made ! Charlie . Charlie , how you feel ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll settle . " Then after a pause she added , " Well , what you going to do now , Charlie , since you 're invisible ? " All sorts of things shot through his brain , she could tell . Adventuresstood up and danced like hell-fire in his eyes , and his mouth , just hanging , told what it meant to be a boy who imagined himself like the mountain winds . In a cold dream he said , " I 'll run across wheat fields , climb snow mountains , steal white chickens off'n farms . I 'll kick pink pigs when they ai n't looking . I 'll pinch pretty girls ' legs when they sleep , snap their garters in schoolrooms . " Charlie looked at Old Lady , and from the shiny tips of her eyes she saw something wicked shape his face . " And other things I 'll do , I 'll do , I will , " he said . " Do n't try nothing on me , " warned Old Lady . " I 'm brittle as spring ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about your folks ? " " My folks ? " " You ca n't fetch yourself home looking like that . Scare the insideribbons out of them . Your mother 'd faint straight back like timber falling . Think they want you about the house to stumble over and your ma have to call you every three minutes , even though you 're in the room next her elbow ? " Charlie had not considered it . He sort of simmered down and whispered out a little " Gosh " and felt of his long bones carefully . " You 'll be mighty lonesome . People looking through you like a water glass , people knocking you aside because they did n't reckon you to be underfoot . And women , Charlie , women --  "  |p77He  swallowed . " What about women ? " " No woman will be giving you a second stare . And no woman wants to be kissed by a boy 's mouth they ca n't even find ! " Charlie dug his bare toe in the soil contemplatively . He pouted . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll have me some fun . I 'll just be pretty careful , is all . I 'll stay out from in front of wagons and horses and Pa . Pa shoots at the nariest sound . " Charlie blinked . " Why , with me invisible , someday Pa might just up and fill me with buckshot , thinkin ' I was a hill squirrel in the dooryard . Oh ... " Old Lady nodded at a tree . " That 's likely . " " Well , " he decided slowly , " I 'll stay invisible for tonight , and tomorrow you can fix me back all whole again , Old Lady . " " Now if that ai n't just like a critter , always wanting to be what lie ca n't be , " remarked Old Lady to a beetle on a log . " What you mean ? " said Charlie . " Why , " she explained , " it was real hard work , fixing you up . It 'll take a little time for it to wear off . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ! " he cried . " You did this to me ! Now you make me back , you make me seeable ! " " Hush , " she said . " It 'll wear off , a hand or a foot at a time . " " How 'll it look , me around the hills with just one hand show-ing ! " " Like a five-winged bird hopping on the stones and bramble . " " Or a foot showing ! " " Like a small pink rabbit jumping thicket . " " Or my head floating ! " " Like a hairy balloon at the carnival ! " " How long before I 'm whole ? " he asked . She deliberated that it might pretty well be an entire year . He groaned . He began to sob and bite his lips and make fists.  | " You magicked me , you did this , you did this thing to me . Now I wo n't be able to run home ! " She winked . " But you can stay here , child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you fat and saucy . " He flung it out : " You did this on purpose ! You mean old hag , you want to keep me here ! " He ran off through the shrubs on the instant . " Charlie , come back ! " No answer but the pattern of his feet on the soft dark turf , and his wet choking cry which passed swiftly off and away . She waited and then kindled herself a fire . " He 'll be back , " she whispered . And thinking inward on herself , she said , " And now I 'll have me my company through spring and into late summer . Then , when I 'm tired of him and want a silence , I 'll send him home . " Charlie returned noiselessly with the first gray of dawn , gliding over the rimed turf to where Old Lady sprawled like a bleached stick before the scattered ashes . He sat on some creek pebbles and stared at her . She did n't dare look at him or beyond . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anywhere about ? She could n't . He sat there , tear marks on his checks . Pretending to be just waking  --  but she had found no sleep from one end of the night to the other  --  Old Lady stood up , grunting and yawning , and turned in a circle to the dawn . " Charlie ? " Her eyes passed from pines to soil , to sky , to the far hills . She called out his name , over and over again , and she felt like staring plumb straight at him , but she stopped herself . " Charlie ? Oh , Charles ! " she called , and heard the echoes say the very same . He sat , beginning to grin a bit , suddenly , knowing he was closep79to her , yet she must feel alone . Perhaps he felt the growing of a secret power , perhaps he felt secure from the world , certainly he was pleased with his invisibility . She said aloud , " Now where can that boy be ? If he only made a noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd fry him a break-fast . " She prepared the morning victuals , irritated at his continuous quiet . She sizzled bacon on a hickory stick . " The smell of it will draw his nose , " she muttered . ' While her back was turned he swiped all the frying bacon and devoured it tastily . She whirled , crying out , " Lord ! " She eyed the clearing suspiciously . " Charlie , that you ? " Charlie wiped his mouth clean on his wrists . She trotted about the clearing , making like she was trying to locate him . Finally , with a clever thought , acting blind , she headed straight for him , groping . " Charlie , where are you ? " A lightning streak , he evaded her , bobbing , ducking . It took all her will power not to give chase ; but you ca n't chase invisible boys , so she sat down , scowling , sputtering , and tried to fry more bacon . But every fresh strip she cut he would steal bubbling off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she cried , " I know where you are ! Right there ! I hear you run ! " She pointed to one side of him , not too accurate . He ran again . " Now you 're there ! " she shouted . " There , and there ! " pointing to all the places he was in the next five minutes . " I hear you press a grass blade , knock a flower , snap a twig . I got fine shell ears , delicate as roses . They can hear the stars moving ! " Silently he galloped off among the pines , his voice trailing back , " Ca n't hear me when I 'm set on a rock . I 'll just set ! " All day he sat on an observatory rock in the clear wind , motionlessand sucking his tongue.  |p80Old  Lady gathered wood in the deep forest , feeling his eyes weaseling on her spine .

Once she dropped her kindling . She pretended it was a blue jay startled her . He made a motion as if to strangle her . She trembled a little . He made another move as if to hang her shins and spit on her cheek . These motions she bore without a lid-flicker or a mouth-twitch . He stuck out his tongue , making strange bad noises . He wiggled his loose ears so she wanted to laugh , and finally she did laugh and explained it away quickly by saying , " Sat on a salamander ! Whew , how it poked ! " By high noon the whole madness boiled to a terrible peak . For it was at that exact hour that Charlie came racing down the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Charlie ! " she almost cried . Charlie raced naked up one side of a hill and naked down the other  --  naked as day , naked as the moon , raw as the sun and a newborn chick , his feet shimmering and rushing like the wings of a low-skimming hummingbird . Old Lady 's tongue locked in her mouth . ' What could she say ? Charlie , go dress ? For shame ? Stop that ? Could she ? Oh , Charlie , Charlie , God ! Could she say that now ? Well ?  |p81U|pon  the big rock , she witnessed him dancing up and down , naked as the day of his birth , stomping bare feet , smacking his hands on his knees and sucking in and out his white stomach like blowing and deflating a circus balloon . She shut her eyes tight and prayed . After three hours of this she pleaded , " Charlie , Charlie , come here ! I got something to tell you !

" Old Lady nodded . " Here comes your ankle ! " " Gim me both my feet ! " ordered Charlie . " You got ' em . " " How about my hands ? " " I see one crawling on your knee like a daddy longlegs . " " How about the other one ? " " It 's crawling too . " " I got a body ? " " Shaping up fine . " " I 'll need my head to go home , Old Lady . " To go home , she thought wearily . " No !

" His yelling went all up the valley , and long after he had run toward home she heard his echoes , racing . Then she plucked up her kindling with a great dry weariness and started back toward her shack , sighing , talking . And Charlie followed her all the way , really invisible now , so she could n't see him , just hear him , like a pine cone dropping or a deep underground stream trickling , or a squirrel clambering a bough ; and over the fire at twilight she and Charlie sat , him so invisible , and her feedinghim bacon he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she fixed some magic and fell asleep with Charlie , made out of sticks and rags and pebbles , but still warm and her very own son , slumberingand nice in her shaking mother arms . . . and they talked about golden things in drowsy voices until dawn made the fire slowly , slowly wither out ... .  |p83In  the year A.D. 400 , the Emperor Yuan held his throne by theGreat Wall of China , and the land was green with rain , readyingitself toward the harvest , at peace , the people in his dominion neither too happy nor too sad . Early on the morning of the first day of the first week of the second month of the new year , the Emperor Yuan was sipping tea and fanning himself against a warm breeze when a servant ran across the scarlet and blue garden tiles , calling , " Oh , Emperor , Emperor , a miracle ! " " Yes , " said the Emperor , " the air is sweet this morning . " " No , no , a miracle ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good in my mouth , surely that is a miracle . " " No , no , Your Excellency. "  | " Let me guess then  --  the sun has risen and a new day is upon us . Or the sea is blue . That now is the finest of all miracles . " " Excellency , a man is flying ! " " What ? " The Emperor stopped his fan . " I saw him in the air , a man flying with wings . I heard a voice call out of the sky , and when I looked up , there he was , a dragon in the heavens with a man in its mouth , a dragon of paper and bamboo , colored like the sun and the grass . " " It is early , " said the Emperor , " and you have just wakened from a dream . " " It is early , but I have seen what I have seen ! Come , and you will see it too . " " Sit down with me here , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a strange thing , if it is true , to see a man fly . You must have time to think of it , even as I must have time to prepare myselffor the sight . " They drank tea . " Please , " said the servant at last , " or he will be gone . " The Emperor rose thoughtfully . " Now you may show me what you have seen . " They walked into a garden , across a meadow of grass , over a small bridge , through a grove of trees , and up a tiny hill . " There ! " said the servant . The Emperor looked into the sky . And in the sky , laughing so high that you could hardly hear him laugh , was a man ; and the man was clothed in bright papers and reeds to make wings and a beautiful yellow tail , and he was soaring all about like the largest bird in a universe of birds , like a new dragon in a land of ancient dragons . The man called down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I fly , I fly ! " The servant waved to him . " Yes , yes ! "  |p85The  Emperor Yuan did not move . Instead he looked at the seat ' Wall of China now taking shape out of the farthest mist in the green hills , that splendid snake of stones which writhed with majesty across the entire land . That wonderful wall which had protected them for a timeless time from enemy hordes and preservedpeace for years without number . He saw the town , nestled to itself by a river and a road and a hill , beginning to waken . " Tell me , " he said to his servant , " has anyone else seen this flyingman ? " " I am the only one , Excellency , " said the servant , smiling at the sky , waving . The Emperor watched the heavens another minute and then said , " Call him down to me . " " Ho , come down , come down ! The Emperor wishes to see you ! " called the servant , hands cupped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions while the flying man soared down the morning wind . He saw a farmer , early in his fields , watching the sky , and he noted where the farmer stood . The flying man alit with a rustle of paper and a creak of bamboo reeds . He came proudly to the Emperor , clumsy in his rig , at last bowing before the old man . " What have you done ? " demanded the Emperor . " I have flown in the sky , Your Excellency , " replied the man . " What have you done ? " said the Emperor again . " I have just told you ! " cried the flier . " You have told me nothing at all . " The Emperor reached out a thin hand to touch the pretty paper and the birdlike keel of the apparatus . It smelled cool , of the wind . " Is it not beautiful , Excellency ? " " Yes , too beautiful . " " It is the only one in the world ! " smiled the man . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world ? " " I swear it ! " " Who else knows of this ? " " No one . Not even my wife , who would think me mad with the sun . She thought I was making a kite . I rose in the night and walked to the cliffs far away . And when the morning breezes blew and the sun rose , I gathered my courage , Excellency , and leaped from the cliff . I flew ! But my wife does not know of it . " " Well for her , then , " said the Emperor . " Come along . " They walked back to the great house . The sun was full in the sky now , and the smell of the grass was refreshing . The Emperor , the servant , and the flier paused within the huge garden . The Emperor clapped his hands . " Ho , guards ! " The guards came running . " Hold this man . " The guards seized the flier . " Call the executioner , " said the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bewildered . " What have I done ? " He began to weep , so that the beautiful paper apparatus rustled . " Here is the man who has made a certain machine , " said the Emperor , " and yet asks us what he has created . He does not know himself . It is only necessary that he create , without knowing why he has done so , or what this thing will do . " The executioner came running with a sharp silver ax . He stood with his naked , large-muscled arms ready , his face covered with a serene white mask . " One moment , " said the Emperor . He turned to a nearby table upon which sat a machine that he himself had created . The Emperor took a tiny golden key from his own neck . He fitted this key to the tiny , delicate machine and wound it up . Then he set the machine going . The machine was a garden of metal and jewels . Set in motion ,  |p87birds  sang in tiny metal trees , wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of sun and shadow , fanning themselves with miniature fans , listening to the tiny emerald birds , and standing by impossibly small but tinkling fountains . " Is it not beautiful ? " said the Emperor . " If you asked me what I have done here , I could answer you well . I have made birds sing , I have made forests murmur , I have set people to walking in this woodland , enjoying the leaves and shadows and songs . That is what have done . " " But , oh , Emperor ! " pleaded the flier , on his knees , the tears pouring down his face . " I have done a similar thing ! I have found beauty . I have flown on the morning wind . I have looked down on all the sleeping houses and gardens . I have smelled the sea and and even seen it , beyond the hills , from ' my high place . And I have soared like a bird ; oh , I can not say how beautiful it is up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wind blowing me here like a feather , there like a fan , the way the sky smells in the morning ! And how free one feels ! That is beautiful , Emperor , that is beautifultoo ! " " Yes , " said the Emperor sadly , " I know it must be true . For I felt my heart move with you in the air and I wondered : What is it like ? How does it feel ? How do the distant pools look from so high ? And how my houses and servants ? Like ants ? And how the distant towns not yet awake ? " " Then spare me ! " " But there are times , " said the Emperor , more sadly still , " when one must lose a little beauty if one is to keep what little beauty one already has . I do not fear you , yourself , but I fear another man . " " What man ? " " Some other man who , seeing you , will build a thing of bright papers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evilp88face and an evil heart , and the beauty will be gone . It is this mail I fear . " " Why ? Why ? " " Who is to say that someday just such a man , in just such an apparatus of paper and reed , might not fly in the sky and drop huge stones upon the Great Wall of China ? " said the Emperor . No one moved or said a word . " Off with his head , " said the Emperor . The executioner whirled his silver ax . " Burn the kite and the inventor 's body and bury their ashes together , " said the Emperor . The servants retreated to obey . The Emperor turned to his hand-servant , who had seen the man flying . " Hold your tongue . It was all a dream , a most sorrowful and beautiful dream . And that farmer in the distant field who also saw , tell him it would pay him to consider it only a vision . If ever the word passes around , you and the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Emperor . " " No , not merciful , " said the old man . Beyond the garden wall he saw the guards burning the beautiful machine of paper and reeds that smelled of the morning wind . He saw the dark smoke climb into the sky . " No , only very much bewildered and afraid . " He saw the guards digging a tiny pit wherein to bury the ashes . " What is the life of one man against those of a million others ? I must take solace from that thought . " He took the key from its chain about his neck and once more wound up the beautiful miniature garden . He stood looking out across the land at the Great Wall , the peaceful town , the green fields , the rivers and streams . He sighed . The tiny garden whirred its hidden and delicate machinery and set itself in motion ; tiny people walked in forests , tiny foxes loped through sun-speckledp89glades in beautiful shining pelts , and among the tiny trees flew little bits of high song and bright blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that small sky . " Oh , " said the Emperor , closing his eyes , " look at the birds , look at the birds ! "  |p91Music  moved with him in the white halls . He passed an office door : " The Merry Widow Waltz . " Another door : " Afternoonof a Faun . " A third : " Kiss Me Again . " He turned into a cross corridor : " The Sword Dance " buried him in cymbals , drums , pots , pans , knives , forks , thunder , and tin lightning . All washed away as he hurried through an anteroom where a secretary sat nicely stunned by Beethoven 's Fifth . He moved himself before her eyes like a hand ; she did n't see him . His wrist radio buzzed . " Yes ? " " This is Lee , Dad . Do n't forget about my allowance . " " Yes , son , yes . I 'm busy . " " Just did n't want you to forget , Dad , " said the wrist radio.  |p92Tchaikovsky  's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed into the long halls . The psychiatrist moved in the beehive of offices , in the crosspollinationof themes , Stravinsky mating with Bach , Haydn unsuccessfullyrepulsing Rachmaninoff , Schubert slain by Duke Ellington . He nodded to the humming secretaries and the whistling doctors fresh to their morning work . At his office he checked a few papers with his stenographer , who sang under her breath , then phoned the police captain upstairs . A few minutes later a red light blinked , a voice said from the ceiling : " Prisoner delivered to Interview Chamber Nine . " He unlocked the chamber door , stepped in , heard the door lock behind him . " Go away , " said the prisoner , smiling . The psychiatrist was shocked by that smile . A very sunny , pleasant warm thing , a thing that shed bright light upon the room . Dawn among the dark hills . High noon at midnight , that smile . The blue eyes sparkled serenely above that display of self-assured dentistry . " I 'm here to help you , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had hesitated the moment he entered . He glanced around . The prisoner laughed . " If you 're wondering why it 's so quiet in here , I just kicked the radio to death . " Violent , thought the doctor . The prisoner read this thought , smiled , put out a gentle hand . " No , only to machines that yak-yak-yak . " Bits of the wall radio 's tubes and wires lay on the gray carpeting . Ignoring these , feeling that smile upon him like a heat lamp , the psychiatrist sat across from his patient in the unusual silence which was like the gathering of a storm . " You 're Mr. Albert Brock , who calls himself The Murderer ? "  |p93Brock  nodded pleasantly . " Before we start . . . " He moved quietly and quickly to detach the wrist radio from the doctor 's arm . He tucked it in his teeth like a walnut , gritted , heard it crack , handed it back to the appalled psychiatrist as if he had done them both a favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruined machine . " You 're running up quite a damage bill . " " I do n't care , " smiled the patient . " As the old song goes : Do n't Care What Happens to Me ! ' " He hummed it . The psychiatrist said : " Shall we start ? " " Fine . The first victim , or one of the first , was my telephone . Murder most foul . I shoved it in the kitchen Insinkerator ! Stopped the disposal unit in mid-swallow . Poor thing strangled to death . After that I shot the television set ! " The psychiatrist said , " Mmm . " " Fired six shots right through the cathode . Made a beautiful tinkling crash , like a dropped chandelier . " " Nice imagery . " " Thanks , I always dreamt of being a writer . " " Suppose you tell me when you first began to hate the tele-phone . " " It frightened me as a child . Uncle of mine called it the Ghost Machine . Voices without bodies . Scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was never comfortable . Seemed to me a phone was an impersonal instrument . If it felt like it , it let your personality go through its wires . If it did n't want to , it just drained your personalityaway until what slipped through at the other end was some cold fish of a voice , all steel , copper , plastic , no warmth , no reality . It 's easy to say the wrong thing on telephones ; the telephone changes your meaning on you . First thing you know , you 've made an enemy . Then , of course , the telephone 's such a convenient thing ; it just sits there and demands you call someone who doesn'tp94want to be called . Friends were always calling , calling , calling me . Hell , I had n't any time of my own . When it was n't the telephone it was the television , the radio , the phonograph . When it was n't the television or radio or the phonograph it was motion pictures at the corner theater , motion pictures projected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain rain any more , it rains soapsuds . When it was n't High-Fly Cloud advertisements , it was music by Mozzek in every restaurant ; music and commercials on the busses I rode to work . When it was n't music , it was inter-office communications , and my horror chamber of a radio wrist watch on which my friends and my wife phoned every five minutes . What is there about such conveniences ' that makes them so temptingly convenient ? The average man thinks , Here I am , time on my hands , and there on my wrist is a wrist telephone , so why not just buzz old Joe up , eh ? Hello , hello ! ' I love my friends , my wife , humanity , very much , but when one minute my wife calls to say , Where are you now , dear ? ' and a friend calls and says , Got the best off-color joke to tell you . Seems there was a guy --  ' And a stranger calls and cries out , This is the Find-Fax Poll . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ! " " How did you feel during the week ? " " The fuse lit . On the edge of the cliff . That same afternoon I did what I did at the office . " " Which was ? " " I poured a paper cup of water into the intercommunications system . " The psychiatrist wrote on his pad . " And the system shorted ? " " Beautifully ! The Fourth of July on wheels ! My God , stenographersran around looking lost ! What an uproar ! " " Felt better temporarily , eh ? " " Fine ! Then I got the idea at noon of stomping my wrist radiop95on the sidewalk . A shrill voice was just yelling out of it at me , This is People 's Poll Number Nine . What did you cat for lunch ? ' when I kicked the Jesus out of the wrist radio ! " " Felt even better , eh ? " " It grew on me ! " Brock rubbed his hands together . " Why did n't start a solitary revolution , deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I cried . Convenient for friends : Hey , Al , thought I 'd call you from the locker room out here at Green Hills . Just made a sockdolager hole in one ! A hole in one , Al ! A beautiful day . Having a shot of whiskey now . Thought you 'd want to know , Al ! ' Convenient for my office , so when I 'm in the field with my radio car there 's no moment when I 'm not in touch . In touch ! There 's a slimy phrase . Touch , hell . Gripped ! Pawed , rather . Mauled and massaged and pounded by FM voices . You ca n't leave your car without checking in : Have stopped to visit gas-station men 's room . ' ' Okay , Brock , step on it ! ' Brock , what took you so long ? ' ' Sorry , sir . ' ' Watch it next time , Brock . ' Yes , sir ! ' So , do you know what I did , Doctor ? I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the car radio transmitter . " " Was there any special reason for selecting French chocolate ice cream to spoon into the broadcasting unit ? " Brock thought about it and smiled . " It 's my favorite flavor . " " Oh , " said the doctor . " I figured , hell , what 's good enough for me is good enough for the radio transmitter . " " What made you think of spooning ice cream into the radio ? " " It was a hot day . " The doctor paused . " And what happened next ? " " Silence happened next . God , it was beautiful . That car radio cackling all day , Brock go here , Brock go there , Brock check in ,  |p96Brock  check out , okay Brock , hour lunch , Brock , lunch over , Brock , Brock , Brock . Well , that silence was like putting ice cream in my ears . " " You seem to like ice cream a lot . " " I just rode around feeling of the silence . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made . Silence . A whole hour of it . I just sat in my car , smiling , feeling of that flannel with my ears . I felt drunk with Freedom ! " " Go on . " " Then I got the idea of the portable diathermy machine . I rented one , took it on the bus going home that night . There sat all the tired commuters with their wrist radios , talking to their wives , saying , Now I 'm at Forty-third , now I 'm at Forty-fourth , here I am at Forty-ninth , now turning at Sixty-first . ' One husband cursing , Well , get out of that bar , damn it , and get home and get dinner started , I 'm at Seventieth ! ' And the transit-system radio playing Tales from the Vienna Woods , ' a canary singing words about a first-rate wheat cereal . Then  --  I switched on my diathermy ! Static ! Interference ! All wives cut off from husbands grousing about a hard day at the office . All husbands cut off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The Vienna Woods ' chopped down , the canary mangled ! Silence ! A terrible , unexpected silence . The bus inhabitants faced with having to converse with each other . Panic ! Sheer , animal panic ! " " The police seized you ? " " The bus had to stop . After all , the music was being scrambled , husbands and wives were out of touch with reality . Pandemonium , riot , and chaos . Squirrels chattering in cages ! A trouble unit arrived , triangulated on me instantly , had me reprimanded , fined , and home , minus my diathermy machine , in jig time . " " Mr. Brock , may I suggest that so far your whole pattern here is not very  --  practical ? If you did n't like transit radios or officep97radios or car business radios , why did n't you join a fraternity of radio haters , start petitions , get legal and constitutional rulings ? After all , this is a democracy . " " And I , " said Brock , " am that thing best called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass petitions , take it to court . Year after year I protested . Everyone laughed . Everyone else loved bus radios and commercials . I was out of step . " " Then you should have taken it like a good soldier , do n't you think ? The majority rules . " " But they went too far . If a little music and keeping in touch ' was charming , they figured a lot would be ten times as charming . I went wild ! I got home to find my wife hysterical . Why ? Because she had been completely out of touch with me for half a day . Remember , I did a dance on my wrist radio ? Well , that night I laid plans to murder my house . " " Are you sure that 's how you want me to write it down ? " " That 's semantically accurate . Kill it dead . It 's one of those talking , singing , humming , weather-reporting , poetry-reading , novelreciting , jingle-jangling , **35;6936;TOOLONG houses . A house that screams opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sleep . One of those blathering caves where all kinds of electronic Oracles make you feel a trifle larger than a thimble , with stoves that say , I 'm apricot pie , and I 'm clone , ' or ' I 'm prime roast beef , so baste me ! ' and other nursery gibberish like that . With beds that rock you to sleep and shake you awake . A house that barely tolerates humans , I tell you . A front door that barks : You 've mud on your feet , sir ! ' And an electronic vacuum hound that snuffles around after you from room to room , inhaling every fingernail or ash you drop . Jesus God , I say , Jesus God ! " " Quietly , " suggested the psychiatrist . " Remember that Gilbert and Sullivan song  --  I 've Got It on Myp98List , It Never Will Be Missed ' ? All night I listed grievances . Next morning early I bought a pistol . I purposely muddied my feet . I stood at our front door . The front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feet ! Please be neat ! ' I shot the damn thing in its keyhole ! I ran to the kitchen , where the stove was just whining , Turn me over ! ' In the middle of a mechanical omelet I did the stove to death . Oh , how it sizzled and screamed , I 'm shorted ! ' Then the telephone rang like a spoiled brat . I shoved it down the Insinkerator . I must state here and now I have nothing whatever against the Insinkerator ; it was an innocent bystander . I feel sorry for it now , a practical device indeed , which never said a word , purred like a sleepy lion most of the time , and digested our leftovers . I 'll have it restored . Then I went in and shot the televisor , that insidious beast , that Medusa , which freezes a billion people to stone every night , staring fixedly , that Siren which called and sang and promised so much and gave , after all , so little , but myself always going back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ j Like a headless turkey , gobbling , my wife whooped out the front door . The police came . Here I am ! " He sat back happily and lit a cigarette . " And did you realize , in committing these crimes , that the wrist radio , the broadcasting transmitter , the phone , the bus radio , the office intercoms , all were rented or were someone else 's property ? " " I would do it all over again , so help me God . " The psychiatrist sat there in the sunshine of that beatific smile . " You do n't want any further help from the Office of Mental Health ? You 're ready to take the consequences ? " " This is only the beginning , " said Mr. Brock . " I 'm the vanguard of the small public which is tired of noise and being taken advantage of and pushed around and yelled at , every moment music , every moment in touch with some voice somewhere , do this , dop99that , quick , quick , now here , now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name will go down in history ! " " Mmm . " The psychiatrist seemed to be thinking . " It 'll take time , of course . It was all so enchanting at first . The very idea of these things , the practical uses , was wonderful . They were almost toys , to be played with , but the people got too in-volved , went too far , and got wrapped up in a pattern of social behavior and could n't get out , could n't admit they were in , even . So they rationalized their nerves as something else . Our modern age , ' they said . Conditions , ' they said , High-strung , ' they said . But mark my words , the seed has been sown . I got world-wide coverage on TV , radio , films ; there 's an irony for you . That was five days ago . A billion people know about me . Check your financial columns . Any day now . Maybe today . Watch for a sudden spurt , a rise in sales for French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the psychiatrist . " Can I go back'to my nice private cell now , where I can be alone and quiet for six months ? " " Yes , " said the psychiatrist quietly . " Do n't worry about me , " said Mr. Brock , rising . " I 'm just going to sit around for a long time stuffing that nice soft bolt of quiet material in both ears . " " Mmm , " said the psychiatrist , going to the door . " Cheers , " said Mr. Brock . " Yes , " said the psychiatrist . He pressed a code signal on a hidden button , the door opened he stepped out , the door shut and locked . Alone , he moved in the offices and corridors . The first twenty yards of his walk were ac-companied by " Tambourine Chinois . " Then it was " Tzigane , " Bach 's Passacaglia and Fugue in something Minor , " Tiger Rag , " " Love Is Like a Cigarette . " He took his broken wrist radio from hisp100pocket like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bell sounded ; a voice came out of the ceiling , " Doctor ? " " Just finished with Brock , " said the psychiatrist . " Diagnosis ? " " Seems completely disorientated , but convivial . Refuses to accept the simplest realities of his environment and work with them . " " Prognosis ? " " Indefinite . Left him enjoying a piece of invisible material . " Three phones rang . A duplicate wrist radio in his desk drawer buzzed like a wounded grasshopper . The intercom flashed a pink light and click-clicked . Three phones rang . The drawer buzzed . Music blew in through the open door . The psychiatrist , humming quietly , fitted the new wrist radio to his wrist , flipped the intercom , talked a moment , picked up one telephone , talked , picked up another telephone , talked , picked up the third telephone , talked , touched the wrist-radio button , talked calmly and quietly , his face cool and serene , in the middle of the music and the lights flashing , the two phones ringing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzing , and the intercoms talking , and voices speaking from the ceiling .

" The town of Kwan-Si , beyond the hill , was very small in my childhood . Now it has grown so large that at last they are building a wall . " " But why should a wall two miles away make my good father sad and angry all within the hour ? " asked his daughter quietly . " They build their wall , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do you see ? Our own city wall ' is built in the shape of an orange . That pig will devour us , greedily ! " " Ah . " They both sat thinking.  |p102Life  was full of symbols and omens . Demons lurked everywhere , Death swam in the wetness of an eye , the turn of a gull 's wing meant rain , a fan held so , the tilt of a roof , and , yes , even a city wall was of immense importance . Travelers and tourists , caravans , musicians , artists , coming upon these two towns , equally judging the portents , would say , " The city shaped like an orange ? No ! I will enter the city shaped like a pig and prosper , eating all , growing fat with good luck and prosperity ! " The Mandarin wept . " All is lost ! These symbols and signs terrify .

The Mandarin faced them most uneasily , himself waiting for a whisper from the silken screen behind his throne . At last the whisper came . " I have called you here , " said the whisper . " I have called you here , " said the Mandarin aloud , " because our city is shaped like an orange , and the vile city of Kwan-Si has this lay shaped theirs like a ravenous pig --  " Here the stonemasons groaned and wept . Death rattled his cane in the outer courtyard . Poverty made a sound like a wet cough in he shadows of the room . " And so , " said the whisper , said the Mandarin , " you raisers of walls must go bearing trowels and rocks and change the shape of our city ! " The architects and masons gasped . The Mandarin himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mandarinp103went on : " And you will change our walls into a club which may beat the pig and drive it off ! " The stonemasons rose up , shouting . Even the Mandarin , delightedat the words from his mouth , applauded , stood down from his throne . " Quick ! " he cried . " To work ! " When his men had gone , smiling and bustling , the Mandarin turned with great love to the silken screen . " Daughter , " he whispered , " I will embrace you . " There was no reply . He stepped around the screen , and she was gone . Such modesty , he thought . She has slipped away and left me with a triumph , as if it were mine . The news spread through the city ; the Mandarin was acclaimed . Everyone carried stone to the walls . Fireworks were set off and the demons of death and poverty did not linger , as all worked together . At the end of the month the wall had been changed . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boars , even lions , far away . The Mandarin slept like a happy fox every night . " I would like to see the Mandarin of Kwan-Si when the news is learned . Such pandemonium and hysteria ; he will likely throw himself from a mountain ! A little more of that wine , oh **30;6973;TOOLONG . " But the pleasure was like a winter flower ; it died swiftly . That very afternoon the messenger rushed into the courtroom . " Oh , Mandarin , disease , early sorrow , avalanches , grasshopper plagues , and poisoned well water ! " The Mandarin trembled . " The town of Kwan-Si , " said the messenger , " which was built like a pig and which animal we drove away by changing our walls to a mighty stick , has now turned triumph to winter ashes . They have built their city 's walls like a great bonfire to burn our stick ! " The Mandarin 's heart sickened within him , like an autumn fruitp104upon an ancient tree . " Oh , gods ! Travelers will spurn us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick , so easily destroyed , to the fire , which conquers all ! " " No , " said a whisper like a snowflake from behind the silken screen . " No , " said the startled Mandarin . " Tell my stonemasons , " said the whisper that was a falling drop of rain , " to build our walls in the shape of a shining lake . " The Mandarin said this aloud , his heart warmed . " And with this lake of water , " said the whisper and the old man , " we will quench the fire and put it out forever ! " The city turned out in joy to learn that once again they had been saved by the magnificent Emperor of ideas . They ran to the walls and built them nearer to this new vision , singing , not as loudly Is before , of course , for they were tired , and not as quickly , for since it had taken a month to rebuild the wall the first time , they had had to neglect business and crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed a succession of horrible and wonderful days , me in another like a nest of frightening boxes . " Oh , Emperor , " cried the messenger , " Kwan-Si has rebuilt their walls to resemble a mouth with which to drink all our lake ! " " Then , " said the Emperor , standing very close to his silken screen , " build our walls like a needle to sew up that mouth ! " " Emperor ! " screamed the messenger . " They make their walls like a sword to break your needle ! " The Emperor held , trembling , to the silken screen . " Then shift : he stones to form a scabbard to sheathe that sword ! " " Mercy , " wept the messenger the following morn , " they have worked all night and shaped their walls like lightning which will explode and destroy that sheath ! "  |p105Sickness  spread in the city like a pack of evil dogs . Shops closed . The population , working now steadily for endless months upon the changing of the walls , resembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind . Funerals began to appear in the streets , though it was the middle of summer , a time when all should be tending and harvesting . The Mandarin fell so ill that he had his bed drawn up by the silken screen and there he lay , miserably giving his architectural orders . The voice behind the screen was weak now , too , and faint , like the wind in the eaves . " Kwan-Si is an eagle . Then our walls must be a net for that eagle . They are a sun to burn our net . Then we build a moon to eclipse their sun ! " Like a rusted machine , the city ground to a halt . At last the whisper behind the screen cried out : " In the name of the gods , send for Kwan-Si ! " Upon the last day of summer the Mandarin Kwan-Si , very ill and withered away , was carried into our Mandarin 's courtroom by four starving footmen . The two mandarins were propped up , facing each other . Their breaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Let us put an end to this . " The old men nodded . " This can not go on , " said the faint voice . " Our people do nothingbut rebuild our cities to a different shape every clay , every hour . They have no time to hunt , to fish , to love , to be good to their ancestors and their ancestors ' children . " " This I admit , " said the mandarins of the towns of the Cage , the Moon , the Spear , the Fire , the Sword and this , that , and other things . " Carry us into the sunlight , " said the voice.  |p106The  old men were borne out under the sun and up a little hill . In the late summer breeze a few very thin children were flying dragon kites in all the colors of the sun , and frogs and grass , the color of the sea and the color of coins and wheat . The first Mandarin 's daughter stood by his bed . " See , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the two old men . " But what is a kite on the ground ? " she said . " It is nothing . What does it need to sustain it and make it beautiful and truly spiritual ? " " The wind , of course ! " said the others . " And what do the sky and the wind need to make them beau-tiful ? " " A kite , of course  --  many kites , to break the monotony , the sameness of the sky . Colored kites , flying ! " " So , " said the Mandarin 's daughter . " You , Kwan-Si , will make a last rebuilding of your town to resemble nothing more nor less than the wind . And we shall build like a golden kite . The wind will beautify the kite and carry it to wondrous heights . And the kite will break the sameness of the wind 's existence and give it purpose and meaning . One without the other is nothing . Together , all will be beauty and co-operation and a long and enduring life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took their first nourishment in days , momentarily were given strength , embraced , and lavished praise upon each other , called the Mandarin'sdaughter a boy , a man , a stone pillar , a warrior , and a true and unforgettable son . Almost immediately they parted and hurried to their towns , calling out and singing , weakly but happily . And so , in time , the towns became the Town of the Golden Kite and the Town of the Silver Wind . And harvestings were harvestedand business tended again , and the flesh returned , and disease ran off like a frightened jackal . And on every night of thep107year the inhabitants in the Town of the Kite could hear the good clear wind sustaining them . And those in the Town of the Wind could hear the kite , singing , whispering , rising , and beautifying them . " So be it , " said the Mandarin in front of his silken screen.  |p109The  soft knock came at the kitchen door , and when Mrs. O'Brian opened it , there on the back porch were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , one on each side of him . Mr. Ramirez just stood there , walled in and small . " Why , Mr. Ramirez ! " said Mrs. O'Brian . Mr. Ramirez was overcome . He did not seem to have words to explain . He had arrived at Mrs. O'Brian 's rooming house more than two years earlier and had lived there ever since . He had come by bus from Mexico City to San Diego and had then gone up to Los Angeles . There he had found the clean little room , with glossyp110blue linoleum , and pictures and calendars on the flowered walls , and Mrs. O'Brian as the strict but kindly landlady . During the war he had worked at the airplane factory and made parts for the planes that flew off somewhere , and even now , after the war , he still held his job . From the first he had made big money . He saved some of it , and he got drunk only once a week  --  a privilege that , to Mrs. O'Brian 's way of thinking , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kitchen , pies were baking in the oven . Soon the pies would come out with complexions like Mr. Ramirez '  --  brown and shiny and crisp , with slits in them for the air almost like the slits of Mr. Ramirez ' dark eyes . The kitchen smelled good . The policemen leaned forward , lured by the odor . Mr. Ramirez gazed at his feet , as if they had carried him into all this trouble . " What happened , Mr. Ramirez ? " asked Mrs. O'Brian . Behind Mrs. O'Brian , as he lifted his eyes , Mr. Ramirez saw the long table laid with clean white linen and set with a platter , cool , shining glasses , a water pitcher with ice cubes floating inside it , a bowl of fresh potato salad and one of bananas and oranges , cubed and sugared . At this table sat Mrs. O'Brian 's children  --  her three grown sons , eating and conversing , and her two younger daughters , who were staring at the policemen as they ate . " I have been here thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. O'Brian 's plump hands . " That 's six months too long , " said one policeman . " He only had a temporary visa . We 've just got around to looking for him . " Soon after Mr. Ramirez had arrived he bought a radio for his little room ; evenings , he turned it up very loud and enjoyed it . And he had bought a wrist watch and enjoyed that too . And on many nights he had walked silent streets and seen the bright clothes in the windows and bought some of them , and he had seen the jewels and bought some of them for his few lady friends . And hep111had gone to picture shows five nights a week for a while . Then , also , he had ridden the streetcars  --  all night some nights  --  smelling the electricity , his dark eyes moving over the advertisements , feelingthe wheels rumble under him , watching the little sleeping houses and big hotels slip by . Besides that , he had gone to large restaurants , where he had eaten many-course dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had bought a car , which later , when he forgot to pay for it , the dealer had driven off angrily from in front of the rooming house . " So here I am , " said Mr. Ramirez now , " to tell you I must give up my room , Mrs. O'Brian . I come to get my baggage and clothes and go with these men . " " Back to Mexico ? " " Yes . To Lagos . That is a little town north of Mexico City . " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Ramirez . " " I 'm packed , " said Mr. Ramirez hoarsely , blinking his dark eyes rapidly and moving his hands helplessly before him . The policemen did not touch him . There was no necessity for that . " Here is the key , Mrs. O'Brian , " Mr. Ramirez said . " I have my bag already . " Mrs. O'Brian , for the first time , noticed a suitcase standing behind him on the porch . Mr. Ramirez looked in again at the huge kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shining waxed floor . He turned and looked for a long moment at the apartment house next door , rising up three stories , high and beautiful . He looked at the balconies and fire escapes and back-porch stairs , at the lines of laundry snapping in the wind . " You 've been a good tenant , " said Mrs. O'Brian . " Thank you , thank you , Mrs. O'Brian , " he said softly . He closed his eyes . Mrs. O'Brian stood holding the door half open . One of her sons ,  |p112behind  her , said that her dinner was getting cold , but she shook her head at him and turned back to Mr. Ramirez . She remembered a visit she had once made to some Mexican border towns  --  the hot days , the endless crickets leaping and falling or lying dead and brittle like the small cigars in the shopwindows , and the canals taking river water out to the farms , the dirt roads , the scorched scape . She remembered the silent towns , the warm beer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm beer , the hot , thick foods each day . She remembered the slow , dragging horses and the parched jack rabbits on the road . She remembered the iron mountains and the dusty valleys and the ocean beaches that spread hundreds of miles with no sound but the waves  --  no cars , no buildings , nothing . " I 'm sure sorry , Mr. Ramirez , " she said . " I do n't want to go back , Mrs. O'Brian , " he said weakly . " I like it here , I want to stay here . I 've worked , I 've got money . I look all right , do n't I ? And I do n't want to go back ! " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Ramirez , " she said . " I wish there was something I could do . " " Mrs. O'Brian ! " he cried suddenly , tears rolling out from under his eyelids . He reached out his hands and took her hand fervently , shaking it , wringing it , holding to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you never ! " The policemen smiled at this , but Mr. Ramirez did not notice it , and they stopped smiling very soon . " Good-by , Mrs , O'Brian . You have been good to me . Oh , good-by , Mrs. O'Brian . I see you never ! " The policemen waited for Mr. Ramirez to turn , pick up his suitcase , and walk away . Then they followed him , tipping their caps to Mrs. O'Brian . She watched them go down the porch steps . Then she shut the door quietly and went slowly back to her chair at the table . She pulled the chair out and sat down . She picked upp113the shining knife and fork and started once more upon her steak . " Hurry up , Mom , " said one of the sons . " It 'll be cold . " Mrs. O'Brian took one bite and chewed on it for a long , slow time ; then she stared at the closed door . She laid down her knife and fork . " What 's wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , " said Mrs. O'Brian  --  she put her hand to her face  --  " I ' 11 never see Mr. Ramirez again . "  |p115The  dark porch air in the late afternoon was full of needleflashes , like a movement ofgathered silver insects insects in the light . The three women 's mouths twitched over their work . Their bodies lay back and then imperceptibly forward , so that the rocking chairs tilted and murmured . Each woman looked to her own hands as if quite suddenly she had found her heart beating there . " What time is it ? " " Ten minutes to five . " " Got to get up in a minute and shell those peas for dinner . " " But  --  " said one of them . " Oh yes , I forgot . How foolish of me . . . . " The first woman paused , put down her embroidery and needle , and looked throughp116the open porch door , through the warm interior of the quiet house , to the silent kitchen . There upon the table , seeming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her life , lay the mound of fresh-washed peas in their neat , resilient jackets , waiting for her fingers to bring them into the world . " Go hull them if it 'll make you feel good , " said the second woman . " No , " said the first . " I wo n't . I just wo n't . " The third woman sighed . She embroidered a rose , a leaf , a daisy on a green field . The embroidery needle rose and vanished . The second woman was working on the finest , most delicate piece of embroidery of them all , deftly poking , finding , and return , ing the quick needle upon innumerable journeys . Her quick black glance was on each motion . A flower , a man , a road , a sun , a house ; the scene grew under hand , a miniature beauty , perfect in every threaded detail . " It seems at times like this that it 's always your hands you turn to , " she said , and the others nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , " said the first lady , " that our souls are in our hands . For we do everything to the world with our hands . Sometimes I think we do n't use our hands half enough ; it 's certain we do n't use our heads . " They all peered more intently at what their hands were doing . " Yes , " said the third lady , " when you look back on a whole lifetime , it seems you do n't remember faces so much as hands and what they did . " They recounted to themselves the lids they had lifted , the doors they had opened and shut , the flowers they had picked , the dinners they had made , all with slow or quick fingers , as was their manner or custom . Looking back , you saw a flurry of hands , like a magician'sdream , doors popping wide , taps turned , brooms wielded ,  |p117children  spanked . The flutter of pink hands was the only sound ; the rest was a dream without voices . " No supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , " said the third lady . " No windows to open or shut . " " No coal to shovel in the basement furnace next winter . " " No papers to clip cooking articles out of . " And suddenly they were crying . The tears rolled softly down their faces and fell into the material upon which their fingers twitched . " This wo n't help things , " said the first lady at last , putting the back of her thumb to each under-eyelid . She looked at her thumb and it was wet . " Now look what I 've done ! " cried the second lady , exasperated . The others stopped and peered over . The second lady held out her embroidery . There was the scene , perfect except that while the embroidered yellow sun shone down upon the embroidered green field , and the embroidered brown road curved toward an embroideredpink house , the man standing on the road had something wrong with his face . " I 'll just have to rip out the whole pattern , practically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What a shame . " They all stared intently at the beautiful scene with the flaw in it . The second lady began to pick away at the thread with her little deft scissors flashing . The pattern came out thread by thread . She pulled and yanked , almost viciously . The man 's face was gone . She continued to seize at the threads . " What are you doing ? " asked the other woman . They leaned and saw what she had done . The man was gone from the road . She had taken him out entirely.  |p118They  said nothing but returned to their own tasks . " What time is it ? " asked someone . " Five minutes to five . " " Is it supposed to happen at five o'clock ? " " Yes . " " And they 're not sure what it 'll do to anything , really , when it happens ? " " No , not sure . " " Why did n't we stop them before it got this far and this big ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten times , maybe a thou-sand . " " This is n't like the first one or the dozen later ones . This isdifferent . Nobody knows what it might do when it comes . " They waited on the porch in the smell of roses and cut grass . " What time is it now ? " " One minute to five . " The needles flashed silver fire . They swam like a tiny school of metal fish in the darkening summer air . Far away a mosquito sound . Then something like a tremor of drums . The three women cocked their heads , listening . " We wo n't hear anything , will we ? " " They say not . " " Perhaps we 're foolish . Perhaps we 'll go right on , after five o'clock , shelling peas , opening doors , stirring soups , washing dishes , making lunches , peeling oranges . . . " " My , how we 'll laugh to think we were frightened by an old experiment ! " They smiled a moment at each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hushed , they all busied themselves . Their fingers darted . Their faces were turned clown to the motions they made . They made frantic patterns . They made lilacs and grass and treesp119and houses and rivers in the embroidered cloth . They said nothing , but you could hear their breath in the silent porch air . Thirty seconds passed . The second woman sighed finally and began to relax . " I think I just will go shell those peas for supper , " she said . But she had n't time even to lift her head . Somewhere , at the side of her vision , she saw the world brighten and catch fire . She kept her head down , for she knew what it was . She did n't look up , nor did the others , and in the last instant their fingers were flying ; they did n't glance about to see what was happening to the country , the town , this house , or even this porch . They were only staring down at the design in their flickering hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to embroider it back in , but it went , and then the road vanished , and the blades of grass . She watched a fire , in slow motion almost , catch upon the embroidered house and unshingle it , and pull each threaded leaf from the small green tree in the hoop , and she saw the sun itself pulled apart in the design . Then the fire caught upon the moving point of the needle while still it flashed ; she watched the fire come along her fingers and arms and body , untwisting the yarn of her being so painstakingly that she could see it in all its devilish beauty , yanking out the pattern from the material at hand . ' What it was doing to the other women or the furniture or the elm tree in the yard , she never knew . For now , yes , now ! it was plucking at the white embroidery of her flesh , the pink thread of her cheeks , and at last it found her heart , a soft red rose sewn with fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by delicate one ...  |p121The  people filled the stands be- hind the wire screen , waiting . Us kids , dripping from the lake , ranbetween the white cottages , past the resort hotel , screaming , and sat on the bleachers , making wet bottom marks . The hot sun beat down through the tall oak trees around the baseball diamond . Our fathers and mothers , in golf pants and light summer dresses , scolded us and made us sit still . We looked toward the hotel and the back door of the vast kitchen , expectantly . A few colored women began walking across the shade-freckled area between , and in ten minutes the far left section of the bleachers was mellow with the color of their freshwashedfaces and arms . After all these years , whenever I think back on it , I can still hear the sounds they made . The sound on thep122warm air was like a soft moving of dove voices each time they talked among themselves . Everybody quickened into amusement , laughter rose right up into the clear blue Wisconsin sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big and little , the dark and high-yellar uniformed Negro waiters , janitors , bus boys , boatmen , cooks , bottle washers , soda jerks , gardeners , and golf-links tenders . They came capering , showing their fine white teeth , proud of their new red-striped uniforms , their shiny shoes rising and coming down on the green grass as they skirted the bleachers and drifted with lazy speed out on the field , calling to everybody and everything . Us kids squealed . There was Long Johnson , the lawn-cutting man , and Cavanaugh , the soda-fountain man , and Shorty Smith and Pete Brown and Jiff Miller ! And there was Big Poe ! Us kids shouted , applauded ! Big Poe was the one who stood so tall by the popcorn machine every night in the million-dollar dance pavilion farther down beyond the hotel on the lake rim . Every night I bought popcorn from Big Poe and he poured lots of butter all over it for me . I stomped and yelled , " Big Poe ! Big Poe ! " And he looked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , waved , and shouted a laugh . And Mama looked to the right , to the left , and back of us with worried eyes and nudged my elbow . " Hush , " she said . " Hush . " " Land , land , " said the lady next to my mother , fanning herself with a folded paper . " This is quite a day for the colored servants , ai n't it ? Only time of year they break loose . They look forward all summer to the big Black and White game . But this ai n't nothing . You seen their Cakewalk Jamboree ? " " We got tickets for it , " said Mother . " For tonight at the pavilion . Cost us a dollar each . That 's pretty expensive , I 'd say . " " But I always figure , " said the woman , " once a year you got top123spend . And it 's really something to watch them dance . They just naturally got . . . " " Rhythm , " said Mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rhythm . That 's what they got . Land , you should see the colored maids up at the hotel . They been buying satin yardage in at the big store in Madison for a month now . And every spare minute they sit sewing and laughing . And I seen some of the feathers they bought for their hats . Mustardand wine ones and blue ones and violet ones . Oh , it 'll be a sight ! " " They been airing out their tuxedos , " I said . " I saw them hanging on lines behind the hotel all last week ! " " Look at them prance , " said Mother . " You 'd think they thought they were going to win the game from our men . " The colored men ran back and forth and yelled with their high , fluting voices and their low , lazy , interminable voices . Way out in center field you could see the flash of teeth , their upraised naked black arms swinging and beating their sides as they hopped up and down and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fistful of bats , bundled them on his huge bull shoulder , and strutted along the first-base line , head back , mouth smiling wide open , his tongue moving , singing : "  --  gon na dance out both of my shoes , When they play those jelly Roll Blues ; Tomorrow night at the Dark Town Strutters ' Ball ! " Up went his knees and down and out , swinging the bats like musical batons . A burst of applause and soft laughter came from the left-hand grandstands , where all the young , ripply colored girls with shiny brown eyes sat eager and easy . They made quick motionsthat were graceful and mellow because , maybe , of their rich coloring . Their laughter was like shy birds ; they waved at Big Poe ,  |p124and  one of them with a high voice cried , " Oh , Big Poe ! Oh , Big Poe ! " The white section joined politely in the applause as Big Poe finished his cakewalk . " Hey , Big Poe ! " I yelled again . " Stop that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the white men came running between the trees with their uniforms on . There was a great thunder and shouting and rising up in our grandstand . The white men ran across the green diamond , flashing white . " Oh , there 's Uncle George ! " said Mother . " My , does n't he look nice ? " And there was my uncle George toddling along in his outfit which did n't quite fit because Uncle has a potbelly , and jowls that sit out over any collar he puts on . He was hurrying along , trying to breathe and smile at the same time , lifting up his pudgy little legs . " My , they look so nice , " enthused Mother . I sat there , watching their movements . Mother sat beside me , and I think she was comparing and thinking , too , and what she saw amazed and disconcerted her . How easily the dark people had come running first , like those slow-motion deer and buck antelopes in those African moving pictures , like things in dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know they were alive , but lived . And when they ran and put their easy , lazy , timelesslegs out and followed them with their big , sprawling arms and loose fingers and smiled in the blowing wind , their expressions did n't say , " Look at me run , look at me run ! " No , not at all . Their faces dreamily said , " Lord , but it 's sure nice to run . See the ground swell soft under me ? Gosh , I feel good . My muscles are moving like oil on my bones and it 's the best pleasure in the world to run . " And they ran . There was no purpose to their running but exhilarationand living . The white men worked at their running as they worked at everything . You felt embarrassed for them because they were alive toop125much in the wrong way . Always looking from the corners of their eyes to see if you were watching . The Negroes did n't care if you watched or not ; they went on living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to think about it any more . " My , but our men look so nice , " said my mother , repeating herselfrather flatly . She had seen , compared the teams . Inside , she realized how laxly the colored men hung swaying in their uniforms , and how tensely , nervously , the white men were crammed , shoved , and belted into their outfits . I guess the tenseness began then . I guess everybody saw what was happening . They saw how the white men looked like senators in sun suits . And they admired the graceful unawareness of the colored men . And , as is always the case , that admiration turned to envy , to jealousy , to irritation . It turned to conversation like : " That 's my husband , Tom , on third base . Why does n't he pick up his feet ? He just stands there . " " Never you mind , never you mind . He 'll pick ' em up when the time comes ! " " That 's what I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry might n't be active all the time , but when there 's a crisis  --  just you watch him . Uh  --  I do wish he 'd wave or something , though . Oh , there ! Hello , Henry ! " " Look at that Jimmie Cosner playing around out there ! " I looked . A medium-sized white man with a freckled face and red hair was clowning on the diamond . He was balancing a bat on his forehead . There was laughter from the white grandstand . But it sounded like the kind of laughter you laugh when you 're embarrassed for someone . " Play ball ! " said the umpire . A coin was flipped . The colored men batted first . " Darn it , " said my mother . The colored men ran in from the field happily.  |p126Big  Poe was first to bat . I cheered . He picked up the bat in one hand like a toothpick and idled over to the plate and laid the bat on his thick shoulder , smiling along its polished surface toward the stands where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring over their legs , which hung down between the seat intervals like crisp new sticks of ginger ; their hair was all fancily spun and hung over their ears . Big Poe looked in particular at the little , dainty-as-a-chicken-bone shape of his girl friend Katherine . She was the one who made the beds at the hotel and cottages every morning , who tapped on your door like a bird and politely asked if you was done dreaming , ' cause if you was she 'd clean away all them old nightmares and bring in a fresh batch  --  please use them one at a time , thank yoah . Big Poe shook his head , looking at her , as if he could n't believe she was there . Then he turned , one hand balancing the bat , his left hand dangling free at his side , to await the trial pitches . They hissed past , spatted into the open mouth of the catcher 's mitt , were hurled back . The umpire grunted . The next pitch was the starter . Big Poe let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the umpire . Big Poe winked goodnaturedlyat the white folks . Bang ! " Stee-rike two ! " cried the umpire . The ball came for the third time . Big Poe was suddenly a greased machine pivoting ; the dangling hand swept up to the butt end of the bat , the bat swiveled , connected with the ball --  Whack ! The ball shot up into the sky , away down toward the wavering line of oak trees , down toward the lake , where a white sailboat slid silently by . The crowd yelled , me loudest ! There went Uncle George , running on his stubby , woolstockingedlegs , getting smaller with distance . Big Poe stood for a moment watching the ball go . Then he began to run . He went around the bases , loping , and on the way homep127from third base he waved to the colored girls naturally and happily and they waved back , standing on their scats and shrilling . Ten minutes later , with the bases loaded and run after run being driven in , and Big Poe coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're the most inconsiderate people , " she said . " But that 's the game , " I said . " They 've only got two outs . " " But the score 's seven to nothing , " my mother protested . " Well , just you wait until our men come to bat , " said the lady next to my mother , waving away a fly with a pale blue-veined hand . " Those Negroes are too big for their britches . " " Stee-rike two ! " said the umpire as Big Poe swung . " All the past week at the hotel , " said the woman next to my mother , staring out at Big Poe steadily , " the hotel service has been simply terrible . Those maids do n't talk about a thing save the Cakewalk Jamboree , and whenever you want ice water it takes them half an hour to fetch it , they 're so busy sewing . " " Ball one ! " said the umpire . The woman fussed . " I 'll be glad when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " she said . " Ball two ! " said the umpire to Big Poe . " Are they going to walk him ? " asked my mother of me . " Are they crazy ? " To the woman next to her : " That 's right . They beenacting funny all week . Last night I had to tell Big Poe twice to put extra butter on my popcorn . I guess he was trying to save money or something . " " Ball three ! " said the umpire . The lady next to my mother cried out suddenly and fanned herselffuriously with her newspaper . " Land , I just thought ! ' Would n't it be awful if they won the game ? They might , you know . They might do it . " My mother looked at the lake , at the trees , at her hands . " Ido n't know why Uncle George had to play . Make a fool of himself .  |p128Douglas  , you run tell him to quit right now . It 's bad on his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpire to Big Poe . " Ah , " sighed the grandstand . The side was retired . Big Poe laid down his bat gently and walked along the base line . The white men pattered in from the field looking red and irritable , with big islands of sweat under their armpits . Big Poe looked over at me . I winked at him . He winked back . Then I knew he was n't so dumb . He 'd struck out on purpose . Long Johnson was going to pitch for the colored team . He ambled out to the rubber , worked his fingers around in his fists to limber them up . First white man to bat was a man named Kodimer , who sold suits in Chicago all year round . Long Johnson fed them over the plate with tired , unassuming , controlled accuracy . Mr. Kodimer chopped . Mr. Kodimer swatted . Finally Mr. Kodimer bunted the ball down the third-base line . " Out at first base , " said the umpire , an Irishman named Mahoney . Second man up was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to center field which was taken by a little plump Negro who did n't look fat because he moved around like a smooth , round glob of mercury . Third man up was a Milwaukee truck driver . He whammed a line drive to center field . It was good . Except that he tried to stretch it into a two-bagger . When he pulled up at second base , there was Emancipated Smith with a white pellet in his dark , dark hand , waiting . My mother sank back in her seat , exhaling . " Well , I never ! " " It 's getting hotter , " said the lady elbow-next . " Think I 'll go for a stroll by the lake soon . It 's too hot to sit and watch a silly gamep129today . Might n't you come along with me , missus ? " she asked Mother . It went on that way for five innings . It was eleven to nothing and Big Poe had struck out three times on purpose , and in the last half of the fifth was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd been trying all afternoon , clowning , giving directions , telling everybody just where he was going to blast that pill once he got hold of it . He swaggered up toward the plate now , confident and bugle-voiced . He swung six bats in his thin hands , eying them critically with his shiny green little eyes . He chose one , dropped the others , ran to the plate , chopping out little islands of green fresh lawn with his cleated heels . He pushed his cap back on his dusty red hair . " Watch this ! " he called out loud to the ladies . " You watch me show these dark boys ! Ya-hah ! " Long Johnson on the mound did a slow serpentine windup . It was like a snake on a limb of a tree , uncoiling , suddenly darting at you . Instantly Johnson 's hand was in front of him , open , like black fangs , empty . And the white pill slashed across the plate with a sound like a razor . " Stee-rike ! " Jimmie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpire . He said nothing for a long time . Then he spat deliberately near the catcher 's foot , took up the yellow maple bat again , and swung it so the sun glinted the rim of it in a nervous halo . He twitched and sidled it on his thin-boned shoulder , and his mouth opened and shut over his long nicotined teeth . Clap ! went the catcher 's mitt . Cosner turned , stared . The catcher , like a black magician , his white teeth gleaming , opened up his oily glove . There , like a white flower growing , was the baseball.  | " Stee-rike two ! " said the umpire , far away in the heat . Jimmie Cosner laid his bat across the plate and hunched his freckled hands on his hips . " You mean to tell me that was a strike ? " " That 's what I said , " said the umpire . " Pick up the bat . " " To hit you on the head with , " said Cosner sharply . " Play ball or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect enough saliva to spit , then angrily swallowed it , swore a bitter oath instead . Reachingdown , he raised the bat , poised it like a musket on his shoulder . And here came the ball ! It started out small and wound up big in front of him . Powie ! An explosion off the yellow bat . The ball spiraled up and up . Jimmie lit out for first base . The ball paused , as if thinking about gravity up there in the sky . A wave came in on the shore of the lake and fell down . The crowd yelled . Jimmie ran . The ball made its decision , came down . A lithe high-yellar was under it , fumbled it . The ball spilled to the turf , was plucked up , hurled to first base . Jimmie saw he was going to be out . So he jumped feet-first at the base . Everyone saw his cleats go into Big Poe 's ankle . Everybody saw the red blood . Everybody heard the shout , the shriek , saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " protested Jimmie two minutes later . Big Poe sat on the ground . The entire dark team stood around him . The doctor bent down , probed Big Poe 's ankle , saying , " Mmmm , " and " Pretty bad . Here . " And he swabbed medicine on it and put a white bandage on it . The umpire gave Cosner the cold-water eye . " Hit the showers ! " " Like hell ! " said Cosner . And he stood on that first base , blowinghis cheeks out and in , his freckled hands swaying at his sides . " I 'm safe . I 'm stayin ' right here , by God ! No nigger put me out ! "  | " No , " said the umpire . " A white man did . Me . Get ! " " He dropped the ball ! Look up the rules ! I 'm safe ! " The umpire and Cosner stood glaring at each other . Big Poe looked up from having his swollen ankle tended . His voice was thick and gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's safe , Mr. Umpire . Leave him stay . He 's safe . " I was standing right there . I heard the whole thing . Me and some other kids had run out on the field to see . My mother kept calling me to come back to the stands . " Yes , he 's safe , " said Big Poe again . All the colored men let out a yell . " What'sa matter with you , black boy ? You get hit in the head ? " " You heard me , " replied Big Poe quietly . He looked at the doctorbandaging him . " He 's safe . Leave him stay . " The umpire swore . " Okay , okay . So he 's safe ! " The umpire stalked off , his back stiff , his neck red . Big Poe was helped up . " Better not walk on that , " cautioned the doctor . " I can walk , " whispered Big Poe carefully . " Better not play . " " I can play , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wet streaks drying under his white eyes . " I 'll play good . " He looked no place at all . " I 'll play plenty good . " " Oh , " said the second-base colored man . It was a funny sound . All the colored men looked at each other , at Big Poe , then at Jimmie Cosner , at the sky , at the lake , the crowd . They walked off quietly to take their places . Big Poe stood with his bad foot hardly touching the ground , balanced . The doctor argued . But Big Poe waved him away . " Batter up ! " cried the umpire.  |p132We  got settled in the stands again . My mother pinched my leg and asked me why I could n't sit still . It got warmer . Three or four more waves fell on the shore line . Behind the wire screen the ladies fanned their wet faces and the men inched their rumps forward on the wooden planks , held papers over their scowling brows to see Big Poe standing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the immense shade of that dark tree . Young Moberg came up to bat for our side . " Come on , Swede , come on , Swede ! " was the cry , a lonely cry , like a dry bird , from out on the blazing green turf . It was Jimmie Cosner calling . The grandstand stared at him . The dark heads turned on their moist pivots in the outfield ; the black faces came in his direction , looking him over , seeing his thin , nervously arched back . He was the center of the universe . " Come on , Swede ! Let 's show these black boys ! " laughed Cosner . He trailed off . There was a complete silence . Only the wind came through the high , glittering trees . " Come on , Swede , hang one on that old pill . ... " Long Johnson , on the pitcher 's mound , cocked his head . Slowly , deliberately , he eyed Cosner . A look passed between him and Big Poe , and Jimmie Cosner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long Johnson took his time with his windup . Cosner took a lead off base . Long Johnson stopped loading his pitch . Cosner skipped back to the bag , kissed his hand , and patted the kiss dead center on the plate . Then he looked up and smiled around . Again the pitcher coiled up his long , hinged arm , curled loving dark fingers on the leather pellet , drew it back and  --  Cosner danced off first base . Cosner jumped up and down like a monkey.  |p133The  pitcher did not look at him . The pitcher 's eyes watched secretively , slyly , amusedly , sidewise . Then , snapping his head , the pitcher scared Cosner back to the plate . Cosner stood and jeered . The third time Long Johnson made as if to pitch , Cosner was far off the plate and running toward second . Snap went the pitcher 's hand . Born went the ball in Big Poe 's glove at first base . Everything was sort of frozen . Just for a second . There was the sun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grandstands , the pitcher on his mound standing with his hand out and down after tossing the ball ; there was Big Poe with the ball in his mighty black hand ; there was the infield staring , crouching in at the scene , and there was Jimmie Cosner running , kicking up dirt , the only moving thing in the entire summer world . Big Poe leaned forward , sighted toward second base , drew back his mighty right hand , and hurled that white baseball straight down along the line until it reached Jimmie Cosner 's head . Next instant , the spell was broken . Jimmie Cosner lay flat on the burning grass . People boiled out of the grandstands . There was swearing , and women screaming , a clattering of wood as the men rushed down the wooden boards of the bleachers . The colored team ran in from the field . Jimmie Cosner lay there . Big Poe , no expression on his face , limped off the field , pushing white men away from him like clothespins when they tried stopping him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come on , Douglas ! " shrieked Mother , grabbing me . " Let 's get Lome ! They might have razors ! Oh ! " That night , after the near riot of the afternoon , my folks stayed home reading magazines . All the cottages around us were lighted . Everybody was home . Distantly I heard music . I slipped out thep134back door into the ripe summer-night darkness and ran toward the dance pavilion . All the lights were on , and music played . But there were no white people at the tables . Nobody had come to the Jamboree . There were only colored folks . Women in bright red and blue satin gowns and net stockings and soft gloves , with wine-plume hats , and men in glossy tuxedos . The music crashed out , up , down , and around the floor . And laughing and stepping high , flinging their polished shoes out and up in the cakewalk , were Long Johnson and Cavanaugh and Jiff Miller and Pete Brown , and  --  limping  --  Big Poe and Katherine , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ janitors and chambermaids , all on the floor at one time . It was so dark all around the pavilion ; the stars shone in the black sky , and I stood outside , my nose against the window , lookingin for a long , long time , silently . I went to bed without telling anyone what I 'd seen . I just lay in the dark smelling the ripe apples in the dimness and hearing the lake at night and listening to that distant , faint and wonderful music . Just before I slept I heard those last strains again :  --  gon na dance out both of my shoes , When they play those Jelly Roll Blues ; Tomorrow night at the Dark Town Strutters ' Ball ! "  |p135The  sign on the wall seemed toA SOUND OF THUNDER quaver under a film of sliding warm water . Eckels felt his eyelidsblink over his stare , and thesign burned in this momentary darkness : TIME SAFARI , INC . SAFARIS TO ANY YEAR IN THE PAST . YOU NAME THE ANIMAL . WE TAKE YOU THERE . YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat ; he swallowed and pushed it down . The muscles around his mouth formed a smile as he put his hand slowly out upon the air , and in that hand waved a check for ten thousand dollars to the man behind the desk.  | " Does this safari guarantee I come back alive ? " " We guarantee nothing , " said the official , " except the dinosaurs . " He turned . " This is Mr. Travis , your Safari Guide in the Past . He 'll tell you what and where to shoot . If he says no shooting , no shooting . If you disobey instructions , there 's a stiff penalty of another ten thousand dollars , plus possible government action , on your return . " Eckels glanced across the vast office at a mass and tangle , a snaking and humming of wires and steel boxes , at an aurora that flickered now orange , now silver , now blue . There was a sound like a gigantic bonfire burning all of Time , all the years and all the parchment calendars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A touch of the hand and this burning would , on the instant , beautifully reverse itself . Eckels remembered the wording in the advertisementsto the letter . Out of chars and ashes , out of dust and coals , like golden salamanders , the old years , the green years , might leap ; roses sweeten the air , white hair turn Irish-black , wrinkles vanish ; all , everything fly back to seed , flee death , rush down to their beginnings , suns rise in western skies and set in glorious casts , moons eat themselves opposite to the custom , all and everything cupping one in another like Chinese boxes , rabbits into hats , all and everything returning to the fresh death , the seed death , the green death , to the time before the beginning . A touch of a hand might do it , the merest touch of a hand . " Hell and damn , " Eckels breathed , the light of the Machine on his thin face . " A real Time Machine . " He shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , I might be here now running away from the results . Thank God Keith won . He 'll make a fine President of the United States . " " Yes , " said the man behind the desk . " We 're lucky . If Deutscher had gotten in , we 'd have the worst kind of dictatorship . There 's an anti-everything man for you , a militarist , anti-Christ , anti-human ,  |p137anti-intellectual  . People called us up , you know , joking but not joking . Said if Deutscher became President they wanted to go live in 1492 . Of course it 's not our business to conduct Escapes , butto form Safaris . Anyway , Keith 's President now . All you got to worry about is --  " " Shooting my dinosaur , " Eckels finished it for him . " A Tyrannosaurus rex . The Thunder Lizard , the damnedest11monster in history . Sign this release . Anything happens to you , we 're not responsible . Those dinosaurs are hungry . " Eckels flushed angrily . " Trying to scare me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going who 'll panic at the first shot . Six Safari leaders were killed last year , and a dozen hunters . We 're here to give you the damnedest thrill a real hunter ever asked for . Traveling you back sixty million years to bag the biggest damned game in all Time . Your personal check 's still there . Tear it up . " Mr. Eckels looked at the check for a long time . His fingers twitched . " Good luck , " said the man behind the desk . " Mr. Travis , he 's all yours . " They moved silently across the room , taking their guns with them , toward the Machine , toward the silver metal and the roaring light . First a day and then a night and then a day and then a night , then it was day-night-day-night-day . A week , a month , a year , a decade ! A.D. 2055 . A.D. 2019. 1999 ! 1957 ! Gone ! The Machine roared . They put on their oxygen helmets and tested the intercoms . Eckels swayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff . He felt the trembling in his arms and he looked down and found his hands tight on the new rifle . There were four other men in thep138Machine . Travis , the Safari Leader , his assistant , Lesperance , and two other hunters , Billings and Kramer . They sat looking at each other , and the years blazed around them . " Can these guns get a dinosaur cold ? " Eckels felt his mouth saying . " If you hit them right , " said Travis on the helmet radio . " Some dinosaurs have two brains , one in the head , another far down the spinal column . We stay away from those . That 's stretching luck . Put your first two shots into the eyes , if you can , blind them , and go back into the brain . " The Machine howled . Time was a film run backward . Suns fled and ten million moons fled after them . " Good God , " said Eckels . " Every hunter that ever lived would envy us today . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its scream fell to a murmur . The Machine stopped . The sun stopped in the sky . The fog that had enveloped the Machine blew away and they were in an old time , a very old time indeed , three hunters and two , Safari Heads with their blue metal guns across their knees . " Christ is n't born yet , " said Travis . " Moses has not gone to the mountain to talk with God . The Pyramids are still in the earth , waiting to be cut out and put up . Remember that . Alexander , Caesar , Napoleon , Hitler  --  none of them exists . " The men nodded . " That "  --  Mr. Travis pointed  --  " is the jungle of sixty million two thousand and fifty-five years before President Keith . " He indicated a metal path that struck off into green wilderness , over steaming swamp , among giant ferns and palms . " And that , " he said , " is the Path , laid by Time Safari for your use . It floats six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one grass blade , flower , or tree . It 's an anti-gravity metal . Its pur/pose is to keep you from touching this world of the past in any way . Stay on the Path . Do n't go off it . I repeat . Do n't go off . For any reason ! If you fall off , there 's a penalty . And do n't shoot any animal we do n't okay . " " Why ? " asked Eckels . They sat in the ancient wilderness . Far birds ' cries blew on a wind , and the smell of tar and an old salt sea , moist grasses , and flowers the color of blood . " We do n't want to change the Future . We do n't belong here in the Past . The government does n't like us here . We have to pay big graft to keep our franchise . A Time Machine is damn finicky business . Not knowing it , we might kill an important animal , a small bird , a roach , a flower even , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not clear , " said Eckels . " All right , " Travis continued , " say we accidentally kill one mouse here . That means all the future families of this one particularmouse are destroyed , right ? " " Right . " " And all the families of the families of the families of that one mouse ! With a stamp of your foot , you annihilate first one , then a dozen , then a thousand , a million , a billion possible mice ! " " So they 're dead , " said Eckels . " So what ? " " So what ? " Travis snorted quietly . " Well , what about the foxes that 'll need those mice to survive ? For want of ten mice , a fox dies . For want of ten foxes , a lion starves . For want of a lion , all manner of insects , vultures , infinite billions of life forms are thrown into chaos and destruction . Eventually it all boils down to this : fifty-nine million years later , a cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goes hunting wild boar or saber-tooth tiger for food . But you , friend , have stepped on all the tigers in that region . By stepping on one single mouse . So the cave man starves . And thep140cave man , please note , is not just any expendable man , no ! He is an entire future nation . From his loins would have sprung ten sons . From their loins one hundred sons , and thus onward to a civilization . Destroy this one man , and you destroy a race , a people , an entire history of life . It is comparable to slaying some of Adam 's grandchildren . The stomp of your foot , on one mouse , could start an earthquake , the effects of which could shake our earth and destinies down through Time , to their very foundations . With the death of that one cave man , a billion others yet unborn are throttled in the womb . Perhaps Rome never rises on its seven hills . Perhaps Europe is forever a dark forest , and only Asia waxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush the Pyramids . Step on a mouse and you leave your print , like a Grand Canyon , across Eternity . Queen Elizabeth might never be born , Washingtonmight not cross the Delaware , there might never be a United States at all . So be careful . Stay on the Path . Never step off ! " " I see , " said Eckels . " Then it would n't pay for us even to touch the grass ? " " Correct . Crushing certain plants could add up infinitesimally . A little error here would multiply in sixty million years , all out of proportion . Of course maybe our theory is wrong . Maybe Time ca n't be changed by us . Or maybe it can be changed only in little subtle ways . A dead mouse here makes an insect imbalance there , a population disproportion later , a bad harvest further on , a depression , mass starvation , and , finally , a change in social temperamentin far-flung countries . Something much more subtle , like that . Perhaps only a soft breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a slight , slight change that unless you looked close you would n't see it . Who knows ? Who really can say he knows ? We do n't know . We 're guessing . But until we do know for certain whether our messing around in Time can make a big roar or a little rustle in history , we 're being damned careful . This Machine ,  |p141this  Path , your clothing and bodies , were sterilized , as you know , before the journey . We wear these oxygen helmets so we ca n't introduce our bacteria into an ancient atmosphere . " " How do we know which animals to shoot ? " " They 're marked with red paint , " said Travis . " Today , before our journey , we sent Lesperance here back with the Machine . Ile came to this particular era and followed certain animals . " " Studying them ? " " Right , " said Lesperance . " I track them through their entire existence , noting which of them lives longest . Very few . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short . When I find one that 's going to die when a tree falls on him , or one that drowns in a tar pit , I note the exact hour , minute , and second . I shoot a paint bomb . It leaves a red patch on his hide . We ca n't miss it . Then I correlate our arrival in the Past so that we meet the Monster not more than two minutes before he would have died anyway . This way , we kill only animals with no future , that arenever going to mate again . You see how careful we are ? " " But if you came back this morning in Time , " said Eckels eagerly , " you must 've bumped into us , our Safari ! How did it turn out ? Was it successful ? Did all of us get through  --  alive ? " Travis and Lesperance gave each other a look . " That 'd be a paradox , " said the latter . " Time does n't permit thatsort of mess  --  a man meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps aside . Like an airplane hitting an air pocket . You felt the Machine jump just before we stopped ? That was us passing ourselves on the way back to the Future . We saw nothing . There 's no way of telling if this expedition was a success , if we got our monster , or whether all of us  --  meaning you , Mr. Eckels  --  got out alive . " Eckels smiled palely . " Cut that , " said Travis sharply . " Everyone on his feet ! " They were ready to leave the Machine.  |p142The  jungle was high and the jungle was broad and the jungle was the entire world forever and forever . Sounds like music and sounds like flying tents filled the sky , and those were pterodactyls soaring with cavernous gray wings , gigantic bats out of a delirium and a night fever . Eckels , balanced on the narrow Path , aimed his rifle playfully . " Stop that ! " said Travis . " Do n't even aim for fun , damn it ! If your gun should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Lesperance checked his wrist watch . " Up ahead . We 'll bisect his trail in sixty seconds . Look for the red paint , for Christ 's sake . Do n't shoot till we give the word . Stay on the Path . Stay on the Path ! " They moved forward in the wind of morning . " Strange , " murmured Eckels . " Up ahead , sixty million years , Election Day over . Keith made President . Everyone celebrating . And here we are , a million years lost , and they do n't exist . The things we worried about for months , a lifetime , not even born or thought about yet . " " Safety catches off , everyone ! " ordered Travis . " You , first shot , Eckels . Second , Billings . Third , Kramer . " " I 've hunted tiger , wild boar , buffalo , elephant , but Jesus , this is it , " said Eckels . " I 'm shaking like a kid . " " Ah , " said Travis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he whispered . " In the mist . There he is . There 's His Royal Majesty now . " The jungle was wide and full of twitterings , rustlings , murmurs , and sighs . Suddenly it all ceased , as if someone had shut a door . Silence.  |p143A  sound of thunder . Out of the mist , one hundred yards away , came Tyrannosaurus rex . " Jesus God , " whispered Eckels . " Sh ! " It came on great oiled , resilient , striding legs . It towered thirty feet above half of the trees , a great evil god , folding its delicate watchmaker 's claws close to its oily reptilian chest . Each lower leg was a piston , a thousand pounds of white bone , sunk in thick ropes of muscle , sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the mail of a terrible warrior . Each thigh was a ton of meat , ivory , and steel mesh . And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like toys , while the snake neck coiled . And the head itself , a ton of sculptured stone , lifted easily upon the sky . Its mouth gaped , exposing a fence of teeth like daggers . Its eyes rolled , ostrich eggs , empty of all expression save hunger . It closed its mouth in a death grin . It ran , its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes , its taloned feet clawing damp earth , leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight . It ran with a gliding ballet step , far too poised and balanced for its ten tons . It moved into a sunlit arena warily , its beautifully reptile hands feeling the air . " My God ! " Eckels twitched his mouth . " It could reach up and grab the moon . " " Sh ! " Travis jerked angrily . " He has n't seen us yet . " " It ca n't be killed . " Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly , as if there could be no argument . He had weighed the evidence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands seemed a cap gun . " We were fools to come . This is impossible . " " Shut up ! " hissed Travis . " Nightmare . "  | " Turn around , " commanded Travis . " Walk quietly to the Machine . We 'll remit one half your fee . " " I did n't realize it would be this big , " said Eckels . " I miscalculated , that 's all . And now I want out . " " It sees us ! " " There 's the red paint on its chest ! " The Thunder Lizard raised itself . Its armored flesh glittered like a thousand green coins . The coins , crusted with slime , steamed . In the slime , tiny insects wriggled , so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate , even while the monster itself did not move . It exhaled . The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness . " Get me out of here , " said Eckels . " It was never like this before . I was always sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good safaris , and safety . This time , I figured wrong . I 've met my match and admit it . This is too much for me to get hold of . " " Do n't run , " said Lesperance . " Turn around . Hide in the Machine . " " Yes . " Eckels seemed to be numb . He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move . He gave a grunt of helplessness . " Eckels ! " He took a few steps , blinking , shuffling . " Not that way ! " The Monster , at the first motion , lunged forward with a terrible scream . It covered one hundred yards in four seconds . The rifles jerked up and blazed fire . A windstorm from the beast 's mouth engulfed them in the stench of slime and old blood . The Monster roared , teeth glittering with sun . Eckels , not looking back , walked blindly to the edge of the Path , his gun limp in his arms , stepped off the Path , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet sank into green moss . His legsmoved him , and he felt alone and remote from the events behind . The rifles cracked again . Their sound was lost in shriek andp145lizard thunder . The great lever of the reptile 's tail swung up , lashed sideways . Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch . The Monstertwitched its jeweler 's hands down to fondle at the men , to twist them in half , to crush them like berries , to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat . Its boulder-stone eyes leveled with the men . They saw themselves mirrored . They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris . Like a stone idol , like a mountain avalanche , Tyrannosaurus fell . Thundering , it clutched trees , pulled them with it . It wrenched and tore the metal Path . The men flung themselves back and away . The body hit , ten tons of cold flesh and stone . The guns fired . The Monster lashed its armored tail , twitched its snake jaws , and lay still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , a sac of fluids burst . Sickening gushes drenched the hunters . They stood , red and glistening . The thunder faded . The jungle was silent . After the avalanche , a green peace . After the nightmare , morning . Billings and Kramer sat on the pathway and threw up . Travis and Lesperance stood with smoking rifles , cursing steadily . In the Time Machine , on his face , Eckels lay shivering . He had found his way back to the Path , climbed into the Machine . Travis came walking , glanced at Eckels , took cotton gauze from a metal box , and returned to the others , who were sitting on the Path . " Clean up . " They wiped the blood from their helmets . They began to curse too . The Monster lay , a hill of solid flesh . Within , you could hear the sighs and murmurs as the furthest chambers of it died , the organs malfunctioning , liquids running a final instant from pocket to sac to spleen , everything shutting off , closing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a steam shovel at quittingp146time , all valves being released or levered tight . Bones cracked ; the tonnage of its own flesh , off balance , dead weight , snapped the delicate forearms , caught underneath . The meat settled , quivering . Another cracking sound . Overhead , a gigantic tree branch broke from its heavy mooring , fell . It crashed upon the dead beast with finality . " There . " Lesperance checked his watch . " Right on time . That 's the giant tree that was scheduled to fall and kill this animal originally . " He glanced at the two hunters . " You want the trophy picture ? " " What ? " " We ca n't take a trophy back to the Future . The body has to stay right here where it would have died originally , so the insects , birds , and bacteria can get at it , as they were intended to . Everythingin balance . The body stays . But we can take a picture of you standing near it . " The two men tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They let themselves be led along the metal Path . They sank wearily into the Machine cushions . They gazed back at the ruined Monster , the stagnating mound , where already strange reptilian birds and golden insects were busy at the steaming armor . A sound on the floor of the Time Machine stiffened them . Eckels sat there , shivering . " I 'm sorry , " he said at last . " Get up ! " cried Travis . Eckels got up . " Go out on that Path alone , " said Travis . He had his rifle pointed . " You 're not coming back in the Machine . We 're leaving you here ! " Lesperance seized Travis ' arm . " Wait  --  " " Stay out of this ! " Travis shook his hand away . " This son of a bitch nearly killed us . But it is n't that so much . Hell , no . It 's his shoes ! Look at them ! He ran off the Path . My God , that ruins us !  |p147Christ  knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars of insurance ! We guarantee no one leaves the Path . He left it . Oh , the damn fool ! I 'll have to report to the government . They might revoke our license to travel . God knows what he 's done to Time , to History ! " " Take it easy , all he did was kick up some dirt . " " How do we know ? " cried Travis . " We do n't know anything ! It 's all a damn mystery ! Get out there , Eckels ! " Eckels fumbled his shirt . " I 'll pay anything . A hundred thousand dollars ! " Travis glared at Eckels ' checkbook and spat . " Go out there . The Monster 's next to the Path . Stick your arms up to your elbows in his mouth . Then you can come back with us . " " That 's unreasonable ! " " The Monster 's dead , you yellow bastard . The bullets ! The bullets ca n't be left behind . They do n't belong in the Past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dig them out ! " The jungle was alive again , full of the old tremorings and bird cries . Eckels turned slowly to regard that primeval garbage dump , that hill of nightmares and terror . After a long time , like a sleepwalker , he shuffled out along the Path . He returned , shuddering , five minutes later , his arms soaked and red to the elbows . He held out his hands . Each held a number of steel bullets . Then he fell . He lay where he fell , not moving . " You did n't have to make him do that , " said Lesperance . " Did n't I ? It 's too early to tell . " Travis nudged the still body . " He 'll live . Next time he wo n't go hunting game like this . Okay . " He jerked his thumb wearily at Lesperance . " Switch on . Let 's go home . " 1492. 1776. 1812 . They cleaned their hands and faces . They changed their cakingp148shirts and pants . Eckels was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a full ten minutes . " Do n't look at me , " cried Eckels . " I have n't done anything . " " Who can tell ? " " Just ran off the Path , that 's all , a little mud on my shoes  --  what do you want me to do  --  get down and pray ? " " We might need it . I 'm warning you , Eckels , I might kill you yet . I 've got my gun ready . " " I 'm innocent . I 've done nothing ! " 1999. 2000. 2055 . The Machine stopped . " Get out , " said Travis . The room was there as they had left it . But not the same as they had left it . The same man sat behind the same desk . But the same man did not quite sit behind the same desk . Travis looked around swiftly . " Everything okay here ? " he snapped . " Fine . Welcome home ! " Travis did not relax . He seemed to be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the sun poured through the one high window . " Okay , Eckels , get out . Do n't ever come back . " Eckels could not move . " You heard me , " said Travis . " What 're you staring at ? " Eckels stood smelling of the air , and there was a thing to the air , a chemical taint so subtle , so slight , that only a faint cry of his subliminal senses warned him it was there . The colors , white , gray , blue , orange , in the wall , in the furniture , in the sky beyond the window , were . . . were . . . And there was a feel . His flesh twitched . His hands twitched . He stood drinking the oddness with the pores of his body . Somewhere , someone must have been screaming one of those whistles that only a dog can hear . His bodyp149screamed silence in return . Beyond this room , beyond this wall , beyond this man who was not quite the same man seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . lay an entire world of streets and people . What sort of world it was now , there was no telling . He could feel them moving there , beyond the walls , almost , like so many chess pieces blown in a dry wind ... . But the immediate thing was the sign painted on the office wall , the same sign he had read earlier today on first entering . Somehow , the sign had changed : TYME SEFARI INC . SEFARIS TU ANY YEER EN THE PAST . YU NAIM THE ANIMALL . WEE TAEK YU THAIR . YU SHOOT ITT . Eckels felt himself fall into a chair . He fumbled crazily at the thick slime on his boots . He held up a clod of dirt , trembling . " No , it ca n't be . Not a little thing like that . No ! " Embedded in the mud , glistening green and gold and black , was a butterfly , very beautiful , and very dead . " Not a little thing like that ! Not a butterfly ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisite thing , a small thing that could upset balances and knock down a line of small dominoes and then big dominoes and then gigantic dominoes , all down the years across Time . Eckels ' mind whirled . It could n't change things . Killing one butterfly could n't be that important ! Could it ? His face was cold . His mouth trembled , asking : " Who  --  who won the presidential election yesterday ? " The man behind the desk laughed . " You joking ? You know damn well . Deutscher , of course ! ' Who else ? Not that damn weaklingKeith . We got an iron man now , a man with guts , by God ! " The official stopped . " What 's wrong ? " Eckels moaned . He dropped to his knees . He scrabbled at thep150golden butterfly with shaking fingers . " Ca n't we , " he pleaded to the world , to himself , to the officials , to the Machine , " ca n't we take it back , ca n't we make it alive again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " He did not move . Eyes shut , he waited , shivering . He heard Travis breathe loud in the room ; he heard Travis shift his rifle , click the safety catch , and raise the weapon . There was a sound of thunder.  |p151It  was a day to be out of bed , to pull curtains and fling open win- dows . It was a day to make your heart bigger with warm mountain air . Cora , feeling like a young girl in a wrinkled old dress , sat up in bed . It was early , the sun barely on the horizon , but already the birds were stirring from the pines and ten billion red ants milled free from their bronze hills by the cabin door . Cora 's husband Tom slept like a bear in a snowy hibernation of bedclothes beside her . Will my heart wake him up ? she wondered . And then she knew why this seemed a special day . " Benjy 's coming ! " She imagined him far off , leaping green meadows , fordingp152streams where spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water toward the sea . She saw his great shoes dusting and flicking the stony roads and paths . She saw his freckled face high in the sun looking giddily down his long body at his distant hands flying out and back behind him . Benjy , come on ! she thought , opening a window swiftly . Wind blew her hair like a gray spider web about her cold ears . Now Benjy 's at Iron Bridge , now at Meadow Pike , now up Creek Path , over Chesley 's Field .. . Somewhere in those Missouri mountains was Benjy . Cora blinked . Those strange high hills beyond which twice a year she and Tom drove their horse and wagon to town , and through which , thirty years ago , she had wanted to run forever , saying , " Oh , Tom , let 's just drive and drive until we reach the sea . " But Tom had looked at her as if she had slapped his face , and he had turned the wagon around and driven on home , talking to the mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came like a storm , now louder , now softer , every day , she did not know it . And if there were cities where neons were like pink ice and green mint and red fireworks each evening , she did n't know that either . Her horizon , north , south , east , west , was this valley , and had never been anything else . But now , today , she thought , Benjy 's coming from that world out there ; he 's seen it , heard it , smelt it ; he 'll tell me about it . And he can write . She looked at her hands . He 'll be here a whole month and teach me . Then I can write out into that world and bring it here to the mailbox I 'll make Tom build today . " Get up , Tom ! You hear ? " She put her hand out to push the bank of sleeping snow . By nine o'clock the valley was full of grasshoppers flinging themselvesthrough the blue , piney air , while smoke curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pans as she polished them , saw her wrinkled face bronzed and freshened in the copper bottoms . Tom was grumbling the sounds of a sleepy bear at his mush breakfast , while her singing moved all about him , like a bird in a cage . " Someone 's mighty happy , " said a voice . Cora made herself into a statue . From the corners of her eyes she saw a shadow cross the room . " Mrs. Brabbam ? " asked Cora of her scouring cloth . " That 's who it is ! " And there stood the Widow Lady , her gingham dress dragging the warm dust , her letters in her chickeny hand . " Morning ! I just been to my mailbox . Got me a real beauty of a letter from my uncle George in Springfield . " Mrs. Brabbam fixed Cora with a gaze like a silver needle . " How long since you got a letter from your uncle , missus ? " " My uncles are all dead . " It was not Cora herself , but her tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , it would be her tongue alone that must take communion and confess earthly sinning . " It 's certainly nice , getting mail . " Mrs. Brabbam waved her letters in a straight flush on the morning air . Always twisting the knife in the flesh . How many years , thought Cora , had this run on , Mrs. Brabbam and her smily eyes , talking loud of how she got mail ; implying that nobody else for miles around could read ? Cora bit her lip and almost threw the pot , but set it down , laughing . " I forgot to tell you . My nephew Benjy 's coming ; his folks are poorly , and he 's here for the summer today . He 'll teach me to write . And Tom 's building us a postal box , are n't you , Toni ? " Mrs. Brabbam clutched her letters . " Well , is n't that fine ! You lucky lady . " And suddenly the door was empty . Mrs. Brabbam was gone . But Cora was after her . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something like a flicker of pure sunlight , something like a brook trout jumping upstream , leap a fence in the yard below . She saw a huge hand wave and birds flush in terror from a crab-apple tree . Cora was rushing , the world rushing back of her , down the path . " Benjy ! " They ran at each other like partners in a Saturday dance , linked arms , collided , and waltzed , jabbering . " Benjy ! " She glanced swiftly behind his ear . Yes , there was the yellow pencil . " Benjy , welcome ! " " Why , ma'am ! " He held her off at arm 's length . " Why , ma'am , you 're crying . " " Here 's my nephew , " said Cora . Tom scowled up from spooning his corn-meal mush . " Mighty glad , " smiled Benjy . Cora held his arm tight so he could n't vanish . She felt faint , wanting to sit , stand , run , but she only beat her heart fast and laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far countries were brought near ; here was this tall boy , lighting up the room ti like a pine torch , this boy who had seen cities and seas and been places when things had been better for his parents . " Benjy , I got peas , corn , bacon , mush , soup , and beans for breakfast . " " Hold on ! " said Tom . " Hush , Tom , the boy 's down to the bone with walking . " She turned to the boy . " Benjy , tell me all about yourself . You did go to school ? " Benjy kicked off his shoes . With one bare foot he traced a word in the hearth ashes . Tom scowled . " What 's it say ? " 155TILE GREAT WIDE WORLD OVER THERE " It says , " said Benjy , " C and 0 and R and A. Cora . " " My name , Tom , see it ! Oh , Benjy , it 's good you really write , child . We had one cousin here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backwards . So we fattened him up and he wrote letters and we never got answers . Come to find out he knew just enough spelling to mail letters to the dead-letter office . Lord , Tom knocked two months ' worth of vittles out of that boy , batting him up the road with a piece of fence . " They laughed anxiously . " I write fine , " said the serious boy . " That 's all we want to know . " She shoved a cut of berry pie at him . " Eat . " By ten-thirty , with the sun riding higher , after watching Benjy devour heaped platters of food , Tom thundered from the cabin , jamming his cap on . " I 'm going out , by God , and cut down half the forest ! " he said angrily . But no one heard . Cora was seated in a breathless spell . She was watching the pencil behind Benjy 's peach-fuzz ear . She saw him finger it casually , lazily , indifferently . Oh , not so casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring robin 's egg . She wanted to touch the pencil , but had n't touched one in years because it made her feel foolish and then angry and then sad . Her hand twitched in her lap . " You got some paper ? " asked Benjy . " Oh , land , I never thought , " she wailed , and the room walls darkened . " What 'll we do ? " " Just happens I brought some . " He fetched a tablet from his little bag . " You want to write a letter somewhere ? " She smiled outrageously . " I want to write a letter to . . . to ... " Her face fell apart . She looked around for someone in the distance . She looked at the mountains in the morning sunshine.  |p156She  heard the sea rolling off on yellow shores a thousand miles away . The birds were coming north over the valley , on their way to multitudes of cities indifferent to her need at this instant . " Benjy , why , I never thought until this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world out there . Nobody but my aunt . And if I wrote her it 'd make her feel bad , a hundred miles from here , to have to find someone else to read the letter to her . She 's got a whale-boned-corset sort of pride . Make her nervous the next ten years , that letter setting in her house on the mantel . No , no letter to her . " Cora 's eyes moved from the hills and the unseen ocean . " Who then ? ' Where ? Someone . I just 've got to get me some letters . " " Hold on . " Benjy fished a dime magazine from his coat . It had a red cover of an undressed lady screaming away from a green monster . " All sorts of addresses in here . " They leafed the pages together . " What 's this ? " Cora tapped an ad . " HERE 'S YOUR Power Plus FREE MUSCLE CHART . Send name , address , ' " read Benjy , " to Dept . M-3 for Free Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " DETECTIVES MAKE SECRET INVESTIGATIONS . PARTICULARS FREE . WRITE : G.D.M. DETECTIVE SCHOOL- ' " i " Everything 's free . Well , Benjy . " She looked at the pencil in his hand . He drew up his chair . She watched him turn the pencil in his fingers , making minor adjustments . She saw him bite his tongue softly . She saw him squint his eyes . She held her breath . She bent forward . She squinted her own eyes and clamped her tongue . Now , now Benjy raised his pencil , licked it , and set it down to the paper . There it is , thought Cora.  |p157The  first words . They formed themselves slowly on the incrediblepaper . Dear Power Plus Muscle CompanySirs , he wrote . The morning blew away on a wind , the morning flowed down the creek , the morning flew off with some ravens , and the sun burned on the cabin roof . Cora did n't turn when she heard a shuffle at the blazing , sun-filled door . Tom was there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of filled pages , a whisperingpencil , and Benjy 's careful Palmer Penmanship hand . Cora moved her head around , around , with each o , each I , with each small hill of an m ; each tiny dot made her head peck like a chicken ; each crossed t made her tongue lick across her upper lip . " It 's noon and I 'm hungry ! " said Tom almost behind her . But Cora was a statue now , watching the pencil as one watches a snail leaving an exceptional trail across a flat stone in the early morning . " It 's noon ! " cried Tom again . Cora glanced up , stunned . " Why , it seems only a moment ago we wrote to that PhiladelphiaCoin Collecting Company , ai n't that right , Benjy ? " Cora smiled a smile much too dazzling for a woman fifty-five years old . " While you wait for your vittles , Tom , just ca n't you build that mailbox ? Bigger than Mrs. Brabbam 's , please ? " " I 'll nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She rose pleasantly . Her smile said , Better run , better work , better do ! " I want a big , pretty mailbox . All white , for Benjy to paint our name on in black spelling . I wo n't have any shoe box for my very first real letter . "  |p158And  it was done . Benjy lettered the finished mailbox : MRS . CORA GIBBS , while Tom stood grumbling behind him . " What 's it say ? " " MR . TOM GIBBS , ' " said Benjy quietly , painting . Tom blinked at it for a minute , quietly , and then said , " I 'm still hungry . Someone light the fire . " There were no stamps . Cora turned white . Tom was made to hitch up the horse and drive to Green Fork to buy some red ones , a green , and ten pink stamps with dignified gentlemen printed on them . But Cora rode along to be certain Tom did n't hurl these first letters in the creek . When they rode home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poke in the new mailbox . " You crazy ? " said Tom . " No harm looking . " That afternoon she visited the mailbox six times . On the seventh , a woodchuck jumped out . Tom stood laughing in the door , pounding his knees . Cora chased him out of the house , still laughing . Then she stood in the window looking down at her mailbox right across from Mrs. Brabbam 's . Ten years ago the Widow Lady had plunked her letter box right under Cora 's nose , almost , when she could as easily have built it up nearer her own cabin . But it gave Mrs. Brabbam an excuse to float like a flower on a river down the hill path , flip the box wide with a great coughing and rustling , from time to time spying up to see if Cora was watching . Cora always was . When caught , she pretended to sprinkle flowers with an empty watering can , or pick mushrooms in the wrong season . Next morning Cora was up before the sun had warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p159licnjy  was sitting up in his cot when Cora returned from the mailbox . " Too early , " he said . " Postman wo n't drive by yet . " " Drive by ? " " They come in cars this far out . " " Oh . " Cora sat down . " You sick , Aunt Cora ? " " No , no . " She blinked . " It 's just , I do n't recall in twenty years sccing no mail truck whistle by here . It just came to me . All this time , I never seen no mailman at all . " " Maybe he comes when you 're not around . " " I 'm up with the fog spunks , down with the chickens . I never really gave it a thought , of course , but --  " She turned to look out the window , up at Mrs. Brabbam 's house . " Benjy , I got a kind of sneaking hunch . " She stood up and walked straight out of the cabin , down the dust path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mailbox . A hush was on the fields and hills . It was so early it made you whisper . " Do n't break the law , Aunt Cora ! " " Shh ! Here . " She opened the box , put her hand in like someone fumbling in a gopher hole . " And here , and here . " She rattled some letters into his cupped hands . " Why , these been opened already ! You open these , Aunt Cora ? " " Child , I never touched them . " Her face was stunned . " This isthe first time in my life I ever even let my shadow touch this box . " Benjy turned the letters around and around , cocking his head . " Why , Aunt Cora , these letters , they 're ten years old ! " " What ! " Cora grabbed at them . " Aunt Cora , that lady 's been getting the same mail every day for years . And they 're not even addressed to Mrs. Brabbam , they 're to some woman named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican grocery woman ! All these years , " whisperedCora , staring at the worn mail in her hands . " All these years . "  |p160They  gazed up at Mrs. Brabbam 's sleeping house in the cool quiet morning . " Oh , that sly woman , making a commotion with her letters , making me feel small . All puffed out she was , swishing along , readingher mail . " Mrs. Brabbam 's front door opened . " Put them back , Aunt Cora ! " Cora slammed the mailbox shut with time to spare . Mrs. Brabbam drifted down the path , stopping here or there , quietly , to peer at the opening wild flowers . " Morning , " she said sweetly . " Mrs. Brabbam , this is my nephew Benjy . " " How nice . " Mrs. Brabbam , with a great swivel of her body , a flourish of her flour-white hands , rapped the mailbox as if to shake the letters loose inside , flipped the lid , and extracted the mail , covering her actions with her back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wonderful ! Why , just look at this letter from dear Uncle George ! " " Well , ai n't that nice ! " said Cora . Then the breathless summer days of waiting . The butterflies jumping orange and blue on the air , the flowers nodding about the cabin , and the hard , constant sound of Benjy 's pencil scribbling through the afternoons . Benjy 's mouth was always packed with food , and Tom was always stomping in , to find lunch or supper late , cold , or both , or none at all . Benjy handled the pencil with a delicious spread of his bony hands , lovingly inscribing each vowel and consonant as Cora hoveredabout him , making up words , rolling them on her tongue , delighted each time she saw them roll out on the paper . But she was n't learning to write . " It 's so much fun watching you write , Benjy . Tomorrow I 'll start learning . Now take another letter ! " His hands in his pockets again , he walked upstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic , nothing wild . He had made the initial error of not wearing gloves ( but , after all , he had n't planned a murder , and his subconscious , which may have known of the crime before its commitment , had not evenp161They worked their way through ads about Asthma , Trusses , and Magic , they joined the Rosicrucians , or at least sent for a free Scaled Book all about the Knowledge that had been damned to oblivion , Secrets from Hidden ancient temples and buried sanctuaries . Then there were free packets of Giant Sunflower seeds , and something about HEARTBURN . They had worked back to page 127 of Quarter Murder Magazine on a bright summer morning when .. . " Listen ! " said Cora . They listened . " A car , " said Benjy . And up the blue hills and through the tall fiery green pines and along the dusty road , mile by mile , came the sound of a car riding along and along , until finally , at the bend , it came full thundering , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as she ran she heard and saw and felt many things . First , from the corner of her eye , she saw Mrs. Brabbam gliding down the road from the other direction . Mrs. Brabbam froze when she saw the bright green car boiling on the grade , and there was the whistle of a silver whistle and the old man in the car leaned out just before Cora arrived and said , " Mrs. Gibbs ? " " Yes ! " she cried . " Mail for you , ma'am , " he said , and held it toward her . She put out her hand , then drew it back , remembering . " Oh , " she said , " please , would you mind , would you put it , please . . . in my mailbox ? " The old man squinted at her , at the mailbox , back at her , and laughed . " Do n't mind , " he said , and did just that , put the mail in the box . Mrs. Brabbam stood where she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Brabbam ? " asked Cora . " That 's all . " And the car dusted away down the road . Mrs. Brabbam stood with her hands clenched together . Then , without looking in her own letter box , turned and rustled swiftly up her path , out of sight.  |p162Cora  walked around her mailbox twice , not touching it for a long time . " Benjy , I 've got me some letters ! " She reached in delicately and took them out and turned them over . She put them quietly in his hand . " Read them to me . Is my name on the front ? " " Yes 'm . " He opened the first letter with due carefulness and read it aloud in the summer morning : " Dear Mrs. Gibbs .. : He stopped and let her savor it , her eyes half shut , her mouth moving the words . He repeated it for artistic emphasis and then went on : " We are sending you our free folder , enclosed , from the Intercontinental Mailing Schools concerning full particulars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sanitary Engineering  --  ' " " Benjy , Benjy , I 'm so happy ! Start over again ! " " Dear Mrs. Gibbs , ' " he read . After that the mailbox was never empty . The world came rushingand crowding in , all the places she had never seen or heard about or been to . Travel folders , spicecake recipes , and even a letter from an elderly gentleman who wished for a lady "  --  fifty years old , gentle disposition , money ; object matrimony . " Benjy wrote back , " I am already married , but thank you for your kind and thoughtful consideration . Yours truly , Cora Gibbs . " And the letters continued to pour across the hills , coin collectors ' catalogues , Dime Novelty books , Magic List Numbers , Arthritis Charts , Flea Killer Samples . The world filled up her letter box , and suddenly she was not alone or remote from people . If a man wrote a form letter to Cora about the Mysteries of Ancient Maya Revealed , he was likely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , budding out their formal meeting into a warm friendship . After one particularly hard day of writing , Benjy was forced to soak his hand in Epsom salts.  |p163By  the end of the third week Mrs. Brabbam no longer came clown to her mailbox . She did n't even come out the front door of her cabin to get the air , for Cora was always down at the road , leaning out , smiling for the mailman . All too quickly the summer was at an end , or , at least , that part of the summer that counted most , anyway ; Benjy 's visit . There was his red bandanna handkerchief on the cabin table , sandwiches folded fresh and oniony in it , tied with a mint sprig to keep it clean to the smell ; there on the floor , freshly polished , were his shoes to get into , and there on the chair , with his pencil which had once been long and yellow but was now stubby and chewed , sat Benjy . Cora took hold of his chin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer squash of an unfamiliar variety . " Benjy , I owe you an apology . I do n't think I looked at your face once in all this time . Seems I know every wart on your hand , every hangnail , every bump and every crinkle , but I might pass your face in a crowd and miss you . " " It 's no face to look at , " said Benjy shyly . " But I 'd know that hand in a million hands , " Cora said . " Let anyone shake my hand in a dark room , a thousand people , and out of all those I 'd say , Well , this one 's Benjy : " She smiled quietly and walked away to the open door . " I been thinking . " She looked up at a distant cabin . " Ai n't seen Mrs. Brabbam in weeks . Stays in all the time now . I 've got a guilty feeling . I 've done a prideful thing , a thing more sinful than she ever done me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mean and spiteful thing and I 'm ashamed . " She gazed up the hill toward that silent , locked place . " Benjy , would you do me one last favor ? " " Yes 'm . " " Write a letter for Mrs. Brabbam . " " Ma'am ? " " Yes , write one of those companies for a free chart , a sample  --  something , and sign Mrs. Brabbam 's name . "  | " All right , " said Benjy . " That way , in a week or a month the postman 'll come by and whistle , and I 'll tell him to go up to her door , special , and deliver it . And I 'll be sure and be out in my front yard where I can see and Mrs. Brabbam can see I see . And I 'll wave my letters to her and she 'll wave her letters to me , and everybody 'll smile . " " Yes 'm , " said Be* . , , He wrote three letters , licked the envelopes carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when I get to St. Louis . " " It 's been a fine summer , " she said . " It sure has . " " But , Benjy , I did n't learn to write , did I ? I was after the letters and made you write late nights , and we were so busy sending labels and getting samples , land , it seemed there was n't time to learn . And that means . . . " He knew what it meant . He shook her hand . They stood in the cabin door . " Thanks , " she said , " for everything . " Then he was running off . He ran as far as the meadow fence , leaped it easily , and the last she saw of him he was still running , waving the special letters , off into the great world over the hills . The letters kept coming for some six months after Benjy went away . There would be the postman 's little green car and the sharp ice-rimed shout of good morning , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue envelopes into that fine mailbox . And there was that special day when Mrs. Brabbam received her first real letter . After that the letters were spaced a week apart , then a month , and finally the postman did n't say hello at all , there was no sound of a car coming up that lonely mountain road . First a spider moved into the mailbox , then a sparrow . And Cora , while the letters still lasted , would clutch them in her165THE GREAT WIDE WORLD OVER THERE bewildered hands , staring at them quietly until the pressure of her face muscles squeezed clear round shiny drops of water from her eyes . She 'd hold up one blue envelope . " Who 's this from ? " " Do n't know , " said Tom . " What 's it say ? " she wailed . " Do n't know , " said Tom . " What 's going on in that world out there , oh , I 'll never know , I 'll never know now , " she said . " And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tumbled the stacks and stacks of letters that had come I since Benjy ran off . " All the world and all the people and all the happenings , and me not knowing . All that world and people waiting to hear from us , and us not writing , and them not ever writing back ! " And at last the day came when the wind blew the mailbox over . In the mornings again , Cora would stand at the open door of her cabin , brushing her gray hair with a slow brush , not speaking , looking at the hills . And in all the years that followed she never passed the fallen mailbox without stooping aimlessly to fumble inside and take her hand out with nothing in it before she wandered onagain into the fields .  |p167The  horses moved gently to a stop , and the man and his wife gazed down into a dry , sandy valley . The woman sat lost in hersaddle ; she had n't spoken for hours , did n't know a good word to speak . She was trapped somewhere between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hard , granite pressure of the wind-blasted mountains . A few drops of cool rain fell on her trembling hands . She looked over at her husband wearily . He sat his dusty horse easily , with a firm quietness . She closed her eyes and thought of how she had been all of these mild years until today . She wanted to laugh at the mirror she was holding up to herself , but there was no way of doing even that ; it would be somewhat insane . After all ,  |p168it  might just be the pushing of this dark weather , or the telegram they had taken from the messenger on horseback this morning , or the long journey now to town . There was still an empty world to cross , and she was cold . " I 'm the lady who was never going to need religion , " she said quietly , her eyes shut . " What ? " Berty , her husband , glanced over at her . " Nothing , " she whispered , shaking her head . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never would she have need of a church . She had heard fine people talk on and on of religion and waxed pews and calla lilies in great bronze buckets and vast bells of churches in which the preacher rang like a clapper . She had heard the shouting kind and the fervent , whispery kind , and they were all the same . Hers was simply not a pew-shaped spine . " I just never had a reason ever to sit in a church , " she had told people . She was n't vehement about it . She just walked around and lived and moved her hands that were pebble-smooth and pebblesmall . Work had polished the nails of those hands with a polish you could never buy in a bottle . The touching of children had made them soft , and the raising of children had made them temperately stern , and the loving of a husband had made them gentle . And now , death made them tremble . " Here , " said her husband . And the horses dusted down the trail to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The buildingwas all glazed green windows , blue machinery , red tile , and wires . The wires ran off on high-tension towers to the farthest directions of the desert . She watched them go , silently , and , still held by her thoughts , turned her gaze back to the strange stormgreenwindows and the burning-colored bricks . She had never slipped a ribbon in a Bible at a certain significant verse , because though her life in this desert was a life of granite ,  |p169sun  , and the steaming away of the waters of her flesh , there had never been a threat in it to her . Always things had worked out before the necessity had come for sleepless dawns and wrinkles in the forehead . Somehow , the very poisonous things of life had passed her by . Death was a remote storm rumor beyond the farthestrange . Twenty years had blown in tumbleweeds , away , since she 'd come West , worn this lonely trapping man 's gold ring , and taken the desert as a third , and constant , partner to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearfully sick or near death . She had never had to get down on her knees except for the scrubbing of an already well-scrubbed floor . Now all that was ended . Here they were riding toward a remote town because a simple piece of yellow paper had come and said very plainly that her mother was dying . And she could not imagine it  --  no matter how she turned her head to see or turned her mind to look in on itself . There were no rungs anywhere to hold to , going either up or down , and her mind , like a compass left out in a sudden storm of sand , was suddenly blown free of all its once-clear directions , all points of reference worn away , the needle spinning without purpose , around , around . Even with Berty 's arms on her back it was n't enough . It was likethe end of a good play and the beginning of an evil one . Someone she loved was actually going to die . This was impossible ! " I 've got to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , so she made it sound irritated to cover her fear . Berty knew her as no irritated woman , so the irritation did not carry over and fill him up . He was a capped jug ; the contents there for sure . Rain on the outside did n't stir the brew . He side-ran his horse to her and took her hand gently . " Sure , " he said . He squinted at the eastern sky . " Some clouds piling up black there . We 'll wait a bit . It might rain . I would n't want to get caught in it . "  |p170Now  she was irritated at her own irritation , one fed upon the other , and she was helpless . But rather than speak and risk the cycle 's commencing again , she slumped forward and began to sob , allowing her horse to be led until it stood and tramped its foot softly beside the red brick building . She slid down like a parcel into his arms , and he held her as she turned in on his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't look like there 's people here . " He called , " Hey , there ! " and looked at the sign on the door : Danger . Bureau of Electric Power . There was a great insect humming all through the air . It sang in a ceaseless , bumbling tone , rising a bit , perhaps falling just a bit , but keeping the same pitch . Like a woman humming between pressed lips as she makes a meal in the warm twilight over a hot stove . They could see no movement within the building ; there was only the gigantic humming . It was the sort of noise you would expect the sun-shimmer to make rising from hot railroad ties on a blazing summer day , when there is that flurried silence and you see the air eddy and whorl and ribbon , and expect a sound from the process but get nothing but an arched tautness of the eardrums and the tense quiet . The humming came up through her heels , into her medium-slim legs , and thence to her body . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of Berty just sitting on a top rail of the corral often did . And then it moved on to her head and the slenderest niches in the skull and set up a singing , as love songs and good books had done once on a time . The humming was everywhere . It was as much a part of the soil as the cactus . It was as much a part of the air as the heat . " What is it ? " she asked , vaguely perplexed , looking at the building . " I do n't know much about it except it 's a powerhouse , " said Berty . He tried the door . " It 's open , " he said , surprised . " I wishp171someone was around . " The door swung wide and the pulsing hum came out like a breath of air over them , louder . They entered together into the solemn , singing place . She held him tightly , arm in arm . It was a dim undersea place , smooth and clean and polished , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and nothing ever stayed , but always there was motion and motion , invisible and stirring and never settling . On each side of them as they advanced were what first appeared to be people standingquietly , one after the other , in a double line . But these resolved into round , shell-like machines from which the humming sprang . Each black and gray and green machine gave forth golden cables and lime-colored wires , and there were silver metal pouches with crimson tabs and white lettering , and a pit like a washtub in which something whirled as if rinsing unseen materials at invisible speeds . The centrifuge raced so fast it stood still . Immense ' snakes of copper looped down from the twilight ceiling , and vertical pipes webbed up from cement floor to fiery brick wall . And the whole of it was as clean as a bolt of green lightning and smelled similarly . There was a crackling , eating sound , a dry rustling as of paper ; flickers of blue fire shuttled , snapped , sparked , hissed where wires joined porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world , it began to rain . She did n't want to stay in this place ; it was no place to stay , with its people that were not people but dim machines and its music like an organ caught and pressed on a low note and a high note . But the rain washed every window and Berty said , " Looks like it 'll last . Might have to stay the night here . It 's late , anyhow . I 'd better get the stuff in . " She said nothing . She wanted to be getting on . Getting on to what thing in what place , there was really no way of knowing . But at least in town she would hold onto the money and buy thep172tickets and hold them tight in her hand and hold onto a train which would rush and make a great noise , and get off the train , and get on another horse , or get into a car hundreds of miles away and ride again , and stand at last by her dead or alive mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many places she would pass through , but none of them would offer a thing to her except ground for her feet , air for her nostrils , food for her numb mouth . And these were worse than nothing . Why go to her mother at all , say words , and make gestures ? she wondered . What would be the use ? The floor was clean as a solid river under her . When she moved forward on it , it sent echoes cracking back and forth like small , faint gunshots through the room . Any word that was spoken came back as from a granite cavern . Behind her , she heard Berty setting down the equipment . He spread two gray blankets and put out a little collection of tinned foods . It was night . The rain still streamed on the high green-glazed windows , rinsing and making patterns of silk that flowed and intermingledin soft clear curtains . There were occasional thunderclapswhich fell and broke upon themselves in avalanches of cold rain and wind hitting sand and stone . Her head lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it , the humming of the immense powerhouse worked up through the cloth into her head . She shifted , shut her eyes , and adjusted herself , but it went on and on . She sat up , patted the cloth , lay back down . But the humming was there . She knew without looking , by some sense deep in herself , that her husband was awake . There was no year she could remember when she had n't known . It was some subtle difference in hisp173breathing . It was the absence of sound , rather ; no sound of breathingat all , save at long , carefully thought-out intervals . She knew then that he was looking at her in the rainy darkness , concerned with her , taking great care of his breath . She turned in the darkness . " Berty ? " " Yes ? " " I 'm awake too , " she said . " I know , " he said . They lay , she very straight , very rigid , he in a half curl , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , easy curve and was filled with incomprehensible wonder . " Berty , " she asked , and paused a long while , " how . . . how are you like you are ? " He waited a moment . " How do you mean ? " he said . " Flow do you rest ? " She stopped . It sounded very bad . It sounded so much like an accusation , but it was not , really . She knew him to be a man concerned with all things , a man who could see in darknesses and who was not conceited because of his ability . He was worried for her now , and for her mother 's life or death , but he had a way of worrying that seemed indifferent and irresponsible . It was neither of the two . His concern was all in him , deep ; but itlay side by side with some faith , some belief that accepted it , made III it welcome , and did not fight it . Something in him took hold of the sorrow first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traceries beforepassing the message on to all of his waiting body . His body held a faith like a maze , and the sorrow that struck into him was lost and gone before it finally reached where it wanted to hurt him . Sometimes this faith drove her into a senseless anger , from which she recovered quickly , knowing how useless it was to criticize something as contained as a stone in a peach . " Why did n't I ever catch it from you ? " she said at last . He laughed a little bit , softly . " Catch what ? "  | " I caught everything else . You shook me up and down in other ways . I did n't know anything but what you taught me . " She stopped . It was hard to explain . Their life had been like the warm blood in a person passing through tissues quietly , both ways . " Everything but religion , " she said . " I never caught that from you . " " It 's not a catching thing , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " Relax , she thought . Relax what ? The body . But how to relax the mind ? Her fingers twitched beside her . Her eyes wandered idly about the vast interior of the powerhouse . The machines stood over her in dark silhouettes with little sparkles crawling on them . The humming-humming-humming crept along her limbs . Sleepy . Tired . She drowsed . Her eyes lidded and opened and lidded and opened . The humming-humming filled her marrow as if small hummingbirds were suspended in her body and in her head . She traced the half-seen tubing up and up into the ceiling , and she saw the machines and heard the invisible whirlings . She suddenly became very alert in her drowsiness . Her eyes moved swiftlyup and up and then down and across , and the humming-singing of $ the machines grew louder and louder , and her eyes moved , and her body relaxed ; and on the tall , green windows she saw the shadows of the high-tension wires rushing off into the raining night . Now the humming was in her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt seized by a whirling dynamo , around , around in a whirl , out , out , into the heart of whirling invisibilities , fed into , accepted by a thousand copper wires , and shot , in an instant , over the earth ! She was everywhere at once ! Streaking along high monster towers in instants , sizzling between high poles where small glass knobs sat like crystal-green birds hold/lug the wires in their non-conductive beaks , branching in four directions , eight secondary directions , finding towns , hamlets , cities , racing on to farms , ranches , haciendas , she descended gently like a widely filamented spider web upon a thousand square miles of desert ! The earth was suddenly more than many separate things , more than houses , rocks , concrete roads , a horse here or there , a human iu a shallow , boulder-topped grave , a prickling of cactus , a town invested with its own light surrounded by night , a million apart things . Suddenly it all had one pattern encompassed and held by the pulsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was rising from a slap on a naked child 's back , into rooms where life was leaving bodies like the light fading from an electric bulb  --  the filament glowing , fading , finally colorless . She was in every town , every house , every room , making light-patterns over hundreds of miles of land ; seeing , hearing everything , not alone any more , but one of thousands of people , each with his ideas and his faiths . Her body lay , a lifeless reed , pale and trembling . Her mind , in all its electric tensity , was flung about this way , that , down vast networks of powerhouse tributary . Everything balanced . In one room she saw life wither ; in another , a mile away , she saw wineglasses lifted to the newborn , cigars passed , smiles , handshakes , laughter . She saw the pale , drawn faces of people at white deathbeds , heard how they understood and accepteddeath , saw their gestures , felt their feelings , and saw that they , too , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to see the balance , see it as she was seeing it now . She swallowed . Her eyelids flickered and her throat burned under her upraised fingers . She was not alone . The dynamo had whirled and flung her with centrifugal forcep176out along a thousand lines into a million glass capsules screwed into ceilings , plucked into light by a pull of a cord or a twist of a knob or a flick of a switch . The light could be in any room ; all that was needed was to touch the switch . All rooms were dark until light came . And here she was , in all of them at once . And she was not alone . Her grief was but one part of a vast grief , her fear only one of countless others . And this grief was only a half thing . There was the other half ; of things born , of comfort in the shape of a new child , of food in the warmed body , of colors for the eye and sounds in the awakened ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light blinked out , life threw another switch ; rooms were illumined afresh . She was with those named Clark and those named Gray and the Shaws and Martins and Hanfords , the Fentons , the Drakes , the Shattucks , the Hubbells , and the Smiths . Being alone was not alone , except in the mind . You had all sorts of peekholes in your head . A silly , strange way to put it , perhaps , but there were the holes ; the ones to see through and see that the world was there and people in it , as hard put to and uneasy as yourself ; and there were the holes for hearing , and the one for speaking out your grief and getting rid of it , and the holes for knowing the changes of season through the scents of summer grain or winter ice or autumn fires . They were there to be used so that one was not alone . Loneliness was a shutting of the eyes . Faith was a simple opening . The light-net fell upon all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every line . She glowed and pulsed and was gentled in the great easy fabric . It lay across the land , covering each mile like a gentle , warm , and humming blanket . She was everywhere . In the powerhouse the turbines whirled and hummed and the electric sparks , like little votive candles , jumped and clustered uponp177bent elbows of electric piping and glass . And the machines stood like saints and choruses , haloed now yellow , now red , now green , and a massed singing beat along the roof hollows and echoed down iii endless hymns and chants . Outside , the wind clamored at the brick walls and drenched the glazed windows with rain ; inside , she lay upon her small pillow and suddenly began to cry . Whether it was with understanding , acceptance , joy , resignation , she could n't know . The singing went on , higher and higher , and she was everywhere . She put out her hand , caught hold of her husband , who was still awake , his eyes fixed at the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , through the network of light and power . But then , he had always been everywhere at once . He felt himself a unit of a whole and therefore he was stable ; to her , unity was new and shaking . She felt his arms suddenlyaround her and she pressed her face into his shoulder for a long while , hard , while the humming and the humming climbed higher , and she cried freely , achingly , against him ... . In the morning the desert sky was very clear . They walked from the powerhouse quietly , saddled their horses , cinched on all of the equipment , and mounted . She settled herself and sat there under the blue sky . And slowly she was aware of her back , and her back was straight , and she looked at her alien hands on the reins , and they had ceased trembling . And she could see the far mountains ; there was no blur nor a running-of-color to things . All was solid stone touching stone , and stone touching sand , and sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one continuous clear flow , everything definite and of a piece . " Wope ! " cried Berty , and the horses walked slowly off , away from the brick building , through the cool sweet morning air . She rode handsomely and she rode well , and in her , like a stonep178in a peach , was a peacefulness . She called to her husband as they slowed on a rise , " Berty ! " " Yes ? " " Can we . . . " she asked . " Can we what ? " he said , not hearing the first time . " Can we come here again sometime ? " she asked , nodding back toward the powerhouse . " Once in a while ? Some Sunday ? " He looked at her and nodded slowly . " I reckon . Yes . Sure . I reckon so . " And as they rode on into town she was humming , humming a strange soft tune , and he glanced over and listened to it , and it was the sound you would expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the air rises in a shimmer , flurried and whorling ; a sound in one key , one pitch , rising a little , falling a little , humming , humming , but constant , peaceful , and wondrous to hear.  |p179All  night Mrs. Navarrez moaned , and these moans filled the tenementlike a light turned on inevery room so no one could sleep . All night she gnashed her white pillow and wrung her thin hands and cried , " My Joe ! " The tenement people , at 3 A.M. , finally discouragedthat she would never shut her painted red mouth , arose , feeling warm and gritty , and dressed to take the trolley downtown to an all-night movie . There Roy Rogers chased bad men through veils of stale smoke and spoke dialogue above the soft snorings in the dark night theater . By dawn Mrs. Navarrez was still sobbing and screaming . During the day it was not so bad . Then the massed choir of babies crying here or there in the house added the saving grace ofp180what was almost a harmony . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenement porch , and chenillerobedwomen standing on the flooded , soggy boards of the porch , talking their Mexican gossip rapidly . But now and again , above the shrill talk , the washing , the babies , one could hear Mrs. Navarrez like a radio tuned high . " My Joe , oh , my poor Joe ! " she screamed . Now , at twilight , the men arrived with the sweat of their work under their arms . Lolling in cool bathtubs all through the cooking tenement , they cursed and held their hands to their ears . " Is she still at it ! " they raged helplessly . One man even kicked her door . " Shut up , woman ! " But this only made Mrs. Navarrez shriek louder . " Oh , ah ! Joe , Joe ! " " Tonight we eat out ! " said the men to their wives . All through the house , kitchen utensils were shelved and doors locked as men hurried their perfumed wives down the halls by their pale elbows . Mr. Villanazul , unlocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown eyes and stood for a moment , swaying . His wife Tina stood beside him with their three sons and two daughters , one in arms . " Oh God , " whispered Mr. Villanazul . " Sweet Jesus , come down off the cross and silence that woman . " They entered their dim little room and looked at the blue candlelight flickering under a lonely crucifix . Mr. Villanazul shook his head philosophically . " He is still on the cross . " They lay in their beds like burning barbecues , the summer night basting them with their own liquors . The house flamed with that ill woman 's cry . " I am stifled ! " Mr. Villanazul fled through the tenement , downstairs to the front porch with his wife , leaving the children , whohad the great and miraculous talent of sleeping through all things . Dim figures occupied the front porch , a dozen quiet mencrouched with cigarettes fuming and glowing in their brown fingers ,  |p181women  in chenille wrappers taking what there was of the summernightwind . They moved like dream figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their eyes were puffed and their tongues thick . " Let us go to her room and strangle her , " said one of the men . " No , that would not be right , " said a woman . " Let us throw her from the window . " Everyone laughed tiredly . Mr. Villanazul stood blinking bewilderedly at all the people . His wife moved sluggishly beside him . " You would think Joe was the only man in the world to join the Army , " someone said irritably . " Mrs. Navarrez , pall ! This Joehusbandof hers will peel potatoes ; the safest man in the infantry ! " " Something must be done . " Mr. Villanazul had spoken . He was startled at the hard firmness of his own voice . Everyone glanced at him . " We ca n't go on another night , " Mr. Villanazul continued bluntly . " The more we pound her door , the more she cries , " explained Mr. Gomez . " The priest came this afternoon , " said Mrs. Gutierrez . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even let him in the door , no matter how he pleaded . The priest went away . We had Officer Gilvie yell at her , too , but do you think she listened ? " " We must try some other way , then , " mused Mr. Villanazul . " Someone must be  --  sympathetic  --  with her . " " What other way is there ? " asked Mr. Gomez . " If only , " figured Mr. Villanazul after a moment 's thought , " if only there was a single man among us . " He dropped that like a cold stone into a deep well . He let the splash occur and the ripples move gently out.  |p182Everybody  sighed . It was like a little summer-night wind arisen . The men straightenedup a bit ; the women quickened . " But , " replied Mr. Gomez , sinking back , " we are all married . There is no single man . " " Oh , " said everyone , and settled down into the hot , empty river bed of night , smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot back , lifting his shoulders , tighteninghis mouth , " it must be one of us ! " Again the night wind blew , stirring the people in awe . " This is no time for selfishness ! " declared Villanazul . " One of us must do this thing ! That , or roast in hell another night ! " Now the people on the porch separated away from him , blinking . " You will do it , of course , Mr. Villanazul ? " they wished to know . He stiffened . The cigarette almost fell from his fingers . " Oh , but I --  " he objected . " You , " they said . " Yes ? " He waved his hands feverishly . " I have a wife and five children , one in arms ! " " But none of us are single , and it is your idea and you must have the courage of your convictions , Mr. Villanazul ! " everyone said . He was very frightened and silent . He glanced with startled flashes of his eyes at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to see him . " I 'm so tired , " she grieved . " Tina , " he said . " I will die if I do not sleep , " she said . " Oh , but , Tina , " he said . " I will die and there will be many flowers and I will be buried if I do not get some rest , " she murmured . " She looks very bad , " said everyone.  |p183Mr  . Villanazul hesitated only a moment longer . He touched his wife 's slack hot fingers . He touched her hot cheek with his lips . Without a word he walked from the porch . They could hear his feet climbing the unlit stairs of the house , up and around to the third floor where Mrs. Navarrez wailed and screamed . They waited on the porch . The men lit new cigarettes and flicked away the matches , talking like the wind , the women wandering around among them , all of them coming and talking to Mrs. Villanazul , who stood , lines under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , " whispered one of the men quietly . " Mr. Villanazul is at the top of the house ! " Everybody quieted . " Now , " hissed the man in a stage whisper . " Mr. Villanazul taps at her door ! Tap , tap . " Everyone listened , holding his breath . Far away there was a gentle tapping sound . " Now , Mrs. Navarrez , at this intrusion , breaks out anew with crying ! " At the top of the house came a scream . " Now , " the man imagined , crouched , his hand delicately weavingon the air , " Mr. Villanazul pleads and pleads , softly , quietly , to the locked door . " The people on the porch lifted their chins tentatively , trying to see through three flights of wood and plaster to the third floor , waiting . The screaming faded . " Now , Mr. Villanazul talks quickly , he pleads , he whispers , he promises , " cried the man softly . The screaming settled to a sobbing , the sobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pounding of hearts and listening . After about two minutes of standing , sweating , waiting , everyoneon the porch heard the door far away upstairs rattle its lock , open , and , a second later , with a whisper , close . The house was silent . Silence lived in every room like a light turned off . Silence flowed like a cool wine in the tunnel halls . Silence came through the open casements like a cool breath from the cellar . They all stood breathingthe coolness of it . " Ah , " they sighed . Men flicked away cigarettes and moved on tiptoe into the silent tenement . Women followed . Soon the porch was empty . They drifted in cool halls of quietness . Mrs. Villanazul , in a drugged stupor , unlocked her door . " We must give Mr. Villanazul a banquet , " a voice whispered . " Light a candle for him tomorrow . " The doors shut . In her fresh bed Mrs. Villanazul lay . He is a thoughtful man , she dreamed , eyes closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a cool hand , stroking her to sleep.  |p185The  camera clicked like an inSUNAND SHADOW sect . It was blue and metallic , like a great fat beetle held in the man 's precious and tenderly exploitinghands . It winked in the flashing sunlight . " Hsst , Ricardo , come away ! " " You down there ! " cried Ricardo out the window . " Ricardo , stop ! " He turned to his wife . " Do n't tell me to stop , tell them to stop . Go down and tell them , or are you afraid ? " " They are n't hurting anything , " said his wife patiently . He shook her off and leaned out the window and looked down into the alley . " You there ! " he cried . The man with the black camera in the alley glanced up , thenp186went on focusing his machine at the lady in the salt-white beach pants , the white bra , and the green checkered scarf . She leaned against the cracked plaster of the building . Behind her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomas ! " yelled Ricardo . He turned to his wife . " Oh , Jesus the Blessed , Tomas is in the street , my own son laughing there . " Ricardo started out the door . " Do n't do anything ! " said his wife . " I 'll cut off their heads ! " said Ricardo , and was gone . In the street the lazy woman was lounging now against the peelingblue paint of a banister . Ricardo emerged in time to see herdoing this . " That 's my banister ! " he said . The cameraman hurried up . " No , no , we 're taking pictures . Everything 's all right . We 'll be moving on . " " Everything 's not all right , " said Ricardo , his brown eyesflashing . He waved a wrinkled hand . " She 's on my house . " " We 're taking fashion pictures , " smiled the photographer . " Now what am I to do ? " said Ricardo to the blue sky . " Go madwith this news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it 's money , well , here 's a five-peso bill , " smiled the photographer . Ricardo pushed the hand away . " I work for my money . You do n't understand . Please go . " The photographer was bewildered . " Wait .. " Tomas , get in the house ! " " But , Papa ... " " Gahh ! " bellowed Ricardo . The boy vanished . " This has never happened before , " said the photographer . " It is long past time ! What are we ? Cowards ? " Ricardo asked the world . A crowd was gathering . They murmured and smiled and nudged each other 's elbows . The photographer with irritable good willp187snapped his camera shut , said over his shoulder to the model , " All right , we 'll use that other street . I saw a nice cracked wall there and some nice deep shadows . If we hurry . .. " The girl , who had stood during this exchange nervously twisting her scarf , now seized her make-up kit and darted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do not misunderstand , " he said quickly . She stopped , blinked at him . He went on . " It is not you I am mad at . Or you . " He addressed the photographer . " Then why --  " said the photographer . Ricardo waved his hand . " You are employed ; I am employed . We are all people employed . We must understand each other . But when you come to my house with your camera that looks like the complex eye of a black horsefly , then the understanding is over . i will not have my alley used because of its pretty shadows , or my sky used because of its sun , or my house used because there is an interesting crack in the wall , here ! You see ! Ah , how beautiful ! Lean here ! Stand there ! Sit here ! Crouch there ! Hold it ! Oh , I heard you . Do you think I am stupid ? I have books up in my room . You see that window ? Maria ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them my books ! " he cried . She fussed and muttered , but a moment later she held out one , then two , then half a dozen books , eyes shut , head turned away , as if they were old fish . " And two dozen more like them upstairs ! " cried Ricardo . " You 're not talking to some cow in the forest , you 're talking to a man ! " " Look , " said the photographer , packing his plates swiftly . " We 're going . Thanks for nothing . " " Before you go , you must see what I am getting at , " said Ricardo . " I am not a mean man . But I can be a very angry man . Do I look like a cardboard cutout ? " " Nobody said anybody looked like anything . " The photographer hefted his case and started off.  | " There is a photographer two blocks over , " said Ricardo , pacing him . " They have cutouts . You stand in front of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you and it looks like you arc in the Grand Hotel . Do you see what I mean ? My alley is my alley , my life is my life , my son is my son . My son is not cardboard ! I saw you putting my son against the wall , so , and thus , in the background . What do you call it  --  for the correct air ? To make the whole attractive , and the lovely lady in front of him ? " " It 's getting late , " said the photographer , sweating . The model trotted along on the other side of him . " We are poor people , " said Ricardo . " Our doors peel paint , our walls are chipped and cracked , our gutters fume in the street , the alleys are all cobbles . But it fills me with a terrible rage when I sec you make over these things as if I had planned it this way , as if I had years ago induced the wall to crack . Did you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I knew you were coming and put my boy in his dirtiest clothes ? We are not a studio ! We are people and must be given attention as people . Have I made it clear ? " " With abundant detail , " said the photographer , not looking at him , hurrying . " Now that you know my wishes and my reasoning , you will do the friendly thing and go home ? " " You are a hilarious man , " said the photographer . " Hey ! " They had joined a group of five other models and a second photographer at the base of a vast stone stairway which in layers , like a bridal cake , led up to the white town square . " How you doing , Joe ? " " We got some beautiful shots near the Church of the Virgin , some statuary without any noses , lovely stuff , " said Joe . " ' What 's the commotion ? " " Pancho here got in an uproar . Seems we leaned against his house and knocked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My house is completely intact . " " We 'll shoot it here , dear , " said the first photographer . " Stand by the archway of that store . There 's a nice antique wall going up there . " He peered into the mysteries of his camera . " So ! " A dreadful quiet came upon Ricardo . He watched them prepare . When they were ready to take the picture he hurried forward , calling to a man in a doorway " Jorge ! What are you doing ? " " I 'm standing here , " said the man . " Well , " said Ricardo , " is n't that your archway ? Are you going to let them use it ? " " I 'm not bothered , " said Jorge . Ricardo shook his arm . " They 're treating your property like a movie actor 's place . Are n't you insulted ? " " I have n't thought about it . " Jorge picked his nose . " Jesus upon earth , man , think ! " " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am I the only one in the world with a tongue in my mouth ? " said Ricardo to his empty hands . " And taste on my tongue ? Is this a town of backdrops and picture sets ? Wo n't anyone do something about this except me ? " The crowd had followed them down the street , gathering others to it as it came ; now it was of a fair size and more were coming , drawn by Ricardo 's bullish shouts . He stomped his feet . He made fists . He spat . The cameraman and the models watched him nervously . " Do you want a quaint man in the background ? " he said wildly to the cameraman . " I 'll pose back here . Do you want me near this wall , my hat so , my feet so , the light so and thus on my sandals which I made myself ? Do you want me to rip this hole in my shirt a bit larger , eh , like this ? So ! Is my face smeared with enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Stand there if you want , " said the photographer.  | " I wo n't look in the camera , " Ricardo assured him . The photographer smiled and lifted his machine . " Over to your left one step , dear . " The model moved . " Now turn your right leg . That 's fine . Fine , fine . Hold it ! " The model froze , chin tilted up . Ricardo dropped his pants . " Oh , my God ! " said the photographer . Some of the models squealed . The crowd laughed and pummeled each other a bit . Ricardo quietly raised his pants and leaned against the wall . " Was that quaint enough ? " he said . " Oh , my God ! " muttered the photographer . " Let 's go down to the docks , " said his assistant . " I think I 'll go there too . " Ricardo smiled . " Good God , what can we do with the idiot ? " whispered the photographer . " Buy him off ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go high enough . " " Listen , you run get a policeman . I 'll put a stop to this . " The assistant ran . Everyone stood around smoking cigarettes nervously , eying Ricardo . A dog came by and briefly made water against the wall . " Look at that ! " cried Ricardo . " What art ! What a pattern ! Quick , before the sun dries it ! " The cameraman turned his back and looked out to sea . The assistant came rushing along the street . Behind him , a native policeman strolled quietly . The assistant had to stop and run back to urge the policeman to hurry . The policeman assured him with a gesture , at a distance , that the day was not yet over and in time they would arrive at the scene of whatever disaster lay ahead.  |p191The  policeman took up a position behind the two cameramen . " Vhat seems to be the trouble ? " " That man up there . We want him removed . " " That man up there seems only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . " No , no , it 's not the leaning , he -- - Oh hell , " said the cameraman . " The only way to explain is to show you . Take your pose dear . " The girl posed . Ricardo posed , smiling casually . " Hold it ! " The girl froze . Ricardo dropped his pants . Click went the camera . " Ah , " said the policeman . " Got the evidence right in this old camera if you need it ! " said the cameraman . " Ah , " said the policeman , not moving , hand to chin . " So . " He surveyed the scene like an amateur photographer himself . He saw the model with the flushed , nervous marble face , the cobbles , the wall , and Ricardo . Ricardo magnificently smoking a cigarette there in the noon sunlight under the blue sky , his pants where a man 's pants rarely are . " Well , officer ? " said the cameraman , waiting . " Just what , " said the policeman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do you want me to do ? " " Arrest that man ! Indecent exposure ! " " Ah , " said the policeman . " Well ? " said the cameraman . The crowd murmured . All the nice lady models were looking out at the sea gulls and the ocean . " That man up there against the wall , " said the officer , " I know him . His name is Ricardo Reyes. "  | " Hello , Esteban ! " called Ricardo . The officer called back at him , " Hello , Ricardo . " They waved at each other . " He 's not doing anything I can see , " said the officer . " What do you mean ? " asked the cameraman . " He 's as naked as a rock . It 's immoral ! " " That man is doing nothing immoral . He 's just standing there , " said the policeman . " Now if he were doing something with his hands or body , something terrible to view , I would act upon the instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , not moving a single limb or muscle , there is nothing wrong . " " He 's naked , naked ! " screamed the cameraman . " I do n't understand . " The officer blinked . " You just do n't go around naked , that 's all ! " " There are naked people and naked people , " said the officer . " Good and bad . Sober and with drink in them . I judge this one to be a man with no drink in him , a good man by reputation ; naked , yes , but doing nothing with this nakedness in any way to offend the community . " " What are you , his brother ? What are you , his confederate ? " said the cameraman . It seemed that at any moment he might snap and bite and bark and woof and race around in circles under the blazing sun . " Where 's the justice ? What 's going on here ? Come on , girls , we 'll go somewhere else ! " " France , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said France , or Spain , " suggested Ricardo . " Or Sweden . I have seen some nice pictures of walls in Sweden . But not many cracks in them . Forgive my suggestion . " " We 'll get pictures in spite of you ! " The camerman shook his camera , his fist . " I will be there , " said Ricardo . " Tomorrow , the next day , at thep193bullfights , at the market , anywhere , everywhere you go I go , quietly , with grace . With dignity , to perform my necessary task . " Looking at him , they knew it was true . " Who are you  --  who in hell do you think you are ? " cried the photographer . " I have been waiting for you to ask me , " said Ricardo . " Considerme . Go home and think of me . As long as there is one man like me in a town of ten thousand , the world will go on . Without me , all would be chaos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer , and the entire swarm of ladies , hatboxes , cameras , and make-up kits retreated down the street toward the docks . " Time out for lunch , dears . We 'll figure something later ! " Ricardo watched them go , quietly . He had not moved from his position . The crowd still looked upon him and smiled . Now , Ricardo thought , I will walk up the street to my house , which has paint peeling from the door where I have brushed it a thousand times in passing , and I shall walk over the stones I have worn down in forty-six years of walking , and I shall run my hand over the crack in the wall of my own house , which is the crack made by the earthquake in 1930 . I remember well the night , us all in bed , Tomas as yet unborn , and Maria and I much in love , and thinking it was our love which moved the house , warm and great in the night ; but it was the earth trembling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I shall climb the steps to the lacework-grille balcony of my father 's house , which grillwork he made with his own hands , and I shall eat the food my wife serves me on the balcony , with the books near at hand . And my son Tomas , whom I created out of whole cloth , yes , bed sheets , let us admit it , with my good wife . And we shall sit eating and talking , not photographs , not backdrops , not paintings , not stage furniture , any of us . But actors , all of us , very fine actors indeed.  |p194As  if to second this last thought , a sound startled his ear . He was in the midst of solemnly , with great dignity and grace , lifting his pants to belt them around his waist , when he heard this lovely sound . It was like the winging of soft doves in the air . It was applause . The small crowd , looking up at him , enacting the final scene of the play before the intermission for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elevating his trousers . The applausebroke like a brief wave upon the shore of the nearby sea . Ricardo gestured and smiled to them all . On his way home up the hill he shook hands with the dog that had watered the wall.  |p195A  wall collapses , followed by another and another ; with dull thunder , a city falls into ruin . The night wind blows . The world lies silent . London was torn down during the day . Port Said was destroyed . The nails were pulled out of San Francisco . Glasgow is no more . They are gone , forever . Boards clatter softly in the wind ; sand whines and trickles in small storms upon the still air . Along the road toward the colorless ruins comes the old night watchman to unlock the gate in the high barbed-wire fence and stand looking in . There in the moonlight lie Alexandria and Moscow and Newp196York . There in the moonlight lie Johannesburg and Dublin and Stockholm . And Clearwater , Kansas , and Provincetown , and Rio de Janeiro . Just this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaringoutside the barbed-wire fence , saw the lean , sun-tanned men in that car , the men with their luxurious charcoal-flannel suits , and winking gold-mask cuff links , and their burning-gold wrist watches , and eye-blinding rings , lighting their cork-tipped cigarettes with engraved lighters ... . " There it is , gentlemen . ' What a mess . Look what the weather 's done to it . " " Yes , sir , it 's bad , Mr. Douglas ! " " We just might save Paris . " " Yes , sir ! " " But , hell ! The rain 's warped it . That 's Hollywood for you ! Tear it down ! Clear it out ! We can use that land . Send a wrecking crew in today ! " " Yes , sir , Mr. Douglas ! " The car roaring off and gone away . And now it is night . And the old night watchman stands inside the gate . He remembers what happened this same still afternoon when the wreckers came . A hammering , ripping , clattering ; a collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust ! And the whole of the entire world shook loose its nails and lath and plaster and sill and celluloid window as town after town followingtown banged over flat and lay still . A shuddering , a thunder fading away , and then , once more , only the quiet wind . The night watchman now walks slowly forward along the empty streets.  |p197And  one moment he is in Baghdad , and beggers loll in wondrous filth , and women with clear sapphire eyes give veiled smiles from high thin windows . The wind blows sand and confetti . The women and beggars vanish . And it is all strutworks again , it is all papier-mache and oilpaintedcanvas and props lettered with the name of this studio , and there is nothing behind any of the building fronts but night and space and stars . The old man pulls a hammer and a few long nails from his tool chest ; he peers around in the junk until he finds a dozen good strong boards and some untorn canvas . And he takes the bright steel nails in his blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to put London back together again , hammering and hammering , board by board , wall by wall , window by window , hammering , hammering , louder , louder , steel on steel , steel in wood , wood against sky , working the hours toward midnight , with no end to his striking and fixing and striking again . " Hey there , you ! " The old man pauses . " You , night watchman ! " Out of the shadows hurries a stranger in overalls , calling : " Hey , what's-your-name ! " The old man turns . " The name 's Smith . " " Okay , Smith , what in hell 's the idea ! " The watchman eyes the stranger quietly . " Who are you ? " " Kelly , foreman of the wrecking gang . " The old man nods . " Ah . The ones who tear everything down . You 've done plenty today . ' Why are n't you home bragging about it ? " Kelly hawks and spits . " There was some machinery over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipes his mouth . . . . " Now ,  |p198Smith  , what in Christ 's name you think you 're doing ? Drop that hammer . You 're building it all up again ! We tear it down and you put it up . You crazy ? " The old man nods . " Maybe I am . But somebody has to put it up again . " " Look , Smith . I do my work , you do yours ; everyone 's happy . But I ca n't have you messing , see ? I 'm turning you in to Mr. Douglas . " The old man goes on with his hammering . " Call him up . Send him around . I want to talk to him . He 's the crazy one . " Kelly laughs . " You kidding ? Douglas do n't see nobody . " He jerks his hand , then bends to examine Smith 's newly finished work . " Hey , wait a minute ! What kind of nails you using ? Singleheads ! Now , cut that ! It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em out ! " Smith turns his head and looks for a moment at the other man swaying there . " Well , it stands to reason you ca n't put the world together with double-headed nails . They 're too easy to yank out . You got to use single-headed nails and hammer ' em way in . Like this ! " He gives a steel nail one tremendous blow that buries it completelyin the wood . Kelly works his hands on his hips . " I 'll give you one more chance . Quit putting things back together and I 'll play ball with you . " " Young man , " says the night watchman , and keeps on hammeringwhile he talks , and thinks about it , and talks some more , " I was here long before you were born . I was here when all this was only a meadow . And there was a wind set the meadow running in waves . For more than thirty years I watched it grow , until it was all of the world together . I lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world to me now . That world out there , beyond thep199cnce , is where I spend time sleeping . I got a little room on a little , Preet , and I see headlines and read about wars and strange , bad people . But here ? Here I have the whole world together and it 's ; 111 peace . I been walking through the cities of this world since 920 . Any night I feel like it , I have a one o'clock snack at a bar on the Champs Elyse-es ! I can get me some fine amontillado sherry at a sidewalk cafe in Madrid , if I want . Or else me and the stone gargoyles , high up there  --  you see them , on top Notra Dame ?  --  we can turn waves impatiently . " And now you come and kick it down and leave only that world out there which has n't learned the first thing about peace that I know from seeing this land here inside the barbed wire . And so you come and rip it up and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wreckers so proud of your wrecking . Pulling down towns and cities and whole lands ! " " A guy 's got to live , " says Kelly . " I got a wife and kids . " " That 's what they all say . They got wives and kids . And they go on , pulling apart , tearing down , killing . They had orders ! Somebodytold them ! They had to do it ! " " Shut up and gim me that hammer ! " " Do n't come any closer ! " " Why , you crazy old --  " " This hammer 's good for more than nails ! " The old man whistlesthe hammer through the air ; the wrecker jumps back . " Hell , " says Kelly , " you 're insane ! I 'm putting a call through to the main studio ; we 'll get some cops here quick . My God , one minute you 're building things up and talking crazy , but how do I know two minutes from now you wo n't run wild and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't harm the smallest piece of kindling in this place , and you know it , " says the old man.  | " Might burn the whole goddam place down , hell , " says Kelly . " Listen , old man , you just wait right there ! " The wrecker spins about and runs off into the villages and the ruined cities and the sleeping two-dimensional towns of this night world , and after his footsteps fade there is a music that the wind plays on the long silver barbed wires of the fence , and the old man hammering and hammering and selecting long boards and rearing walls until a time finally comes when his mouth is gasping , his heart is exploding ; the hammer drops from his open fingers , steel nails tinkle like coins on the pavement , and the old man cries out to himself alone : " It 's no use , no use . I ca n't put it all back up before they come . I need so very much help I do n't know what to do . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to walk with no direction , with no purpose , it seems , save that he is thinking to make one last round and take one last look at everything and say good-by to whatever there is or was in this world to say good-by to . And so he walks with the shadows all around and the shadows all through this land where time has grown late indeed and the shadows are of all kinds and types and sizes , shadows of buildings , and shadows of people . And he does n't look straight at them , no , because if he looked at them straight , they would all blow away . No , he just walks , down the middle of PiccadillyCircus . . . the echo of his steps . . . or the Rue de la Paix ... the sound of him clearing his throat ... or Fifth Avenue ... and he does n't look right or left . And all around him , in dark doorways and empty windows , are his many friends , his good friends , his very good friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft whispering of a caffe espresso machine , all silver and chrome , and soft Italian singing ... the flutter of hands in darknessover the open mouths of balalaikas , the rustle of palm trees , a touching of drums with the chimes chiming and small bells bell/ing , and a sound of summer apples dropped in soft night grass which are not apples at all but the motion of women 's bared feet slowly dancing a circle to the chimes ' faint chiming and the bellingof the tiny golden bells . There is the munch of maize kernels crushed on black volcanic stone , the sizzle of tortillas drowned in hot fat , the whisk of charcoals tossing up a thousand fireflies of spark at the blowing of a mouth and the wave of a papaya frond ; everywhere faces and forms , everywhere stirs and gestures and ghost fires which float the magical torch-colored faces of Spanish gypsies in air as on a fiery water , the mouths crying out the songs that tell of the oddness and the strangeness and the sadness of living . Everywhereshadows and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just that very trite thing  --  the wind ? No . The people are all here . They have been here for many years . And tomorrow ? The old man stops , presses his hands to his chest . They will not be here any more . A horn blows ! Outside the barbed-wire gate  --  the enemy ! Outside the gate a small black police car and a large black limousine from the studio itself , three miles away . The horn blares ! The old man seizes the rungs of a ladder and climbs , the sound of the horn pushing him higher and higher . The gate crashes wide ; the enemy roars in . " There he goes ! " The glaring lights of the police shine in upon the cities of the meadow ; the lights reveal the stark canvas set-pieces of Manhattan , Chicago , and Chungking ! The light glitters on the imitation stone towers of Notre Dame Cathedral , fixes on a tiny figure bal/ancing on the catwalks of Notre Dame , climbing and climbing up where the night and the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Douglas , at the top ! " " Good God . It 's getting so a man ca n't spend an evening at a quiet party without --  " " He 's striking a match ! Call the fire department ! " On top of Notre Dame , the night watchman , looking down , shielding the match from the softly blowing wind , sees the police , the workmen , and the producer in a dark suit , a big man , gazing up at him . Then the night watchman slowly turns the match , cupping it , applies it to the tip of his cigar . He lights the cigar in slow puffs . He calls : " Is Mr. Douglas down there ? " A voice calls back : " What do you want with me ? " The old man smiles . " Come up , alone ! Bring a gun if you want ! I just want a little talk ! " The voices echo in the vast churchyard : " Do n't do it , Mr. Douglas ! " " Give me your gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to the party . Keep me covered , I 'll play it safe . I do n't want these sets burned . There 's two million dollars in lumber alone here . Ready ? I 'm on my way . " The producer climbs high on the night ladders , up through the half shell of Notre Dame to where the old man leans against a plaster gargoyle , quietly smoking a cigar . The producer stops , gun pointed , half through an open trap door . " All right , Smith . Stay where you are . " Smith removes the cigar from his mouth quietly . " Do n't you be afraid of me . I 'm all right . " " I would n't bet money on that . " " Mr. Douglas , " says the night watchman , " did you ever read that story about the man who traveled to the future and foundp203everyone there insane ? Everyone . But since they were all insane they did n't know they were insane . They all acted alike and so they thought themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one among them , he was abnormal ; therefore , he was the insaneone . To them , at least . Yes , Mr. Douglas , insanity is relative . It all depends on who has who locked in what cage . " The producer swears under his breath . " I did n't climb up here to talk all night . What do you want ? " " I want to talk with the Creator . That 's you , Mr. Douglas . You created all this . You came here one day and struck the earth with a magical checkbook and cried , Let there be Paris ! ' And there was Paris : streets , bistros , flowers , wine , outdoor bookshops and all . And you clapped your hands again : Let there be Constantinople ! ' And there it was ! You clapped your hands a times , and each time made something new , and now you think just by clapping your hands one last time you can drop it all down in ruins . But , Mr. Douglas , it 's not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the stock in this studio ! " " But did the studio ever belong to you , really ? Did you ever think to drive here late some night and climb up on this cathedral and see what a wonderful world you created ? Did you ever wonder if it might not be a good idea for you to sit up here with me and my friends and have a cup of amontillado sherry with us ? All right  --  so the amontillado smells and looks and tastes like coffee . Imagination , Mr. Creator , imagination . But no , you never came around , you never climbed up , you never looked or listened or cared . There was always a party somewhere else . And now , very late , without asking us , you want to destroy it all . You may own fifty-one per cent of the studio stock , but you do n't own them . " " Them ! " cries the producer . " What 's all this business about them ' ? "  | " It 's hard to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night watchman moves his hand in the empty air toward the half cities and the night . " So many films were made here in all the long years . Extras moved in the streets in costumes , they talked a thousandtongues , they smoked cigarettes and meerschaums and Persianhookahs , even . Dancing girls danced . They glittered , oh , how they glittered ! Women with veils smiled down from high balconies . Soldiers marched . Children played . Knights in silver armor fought . There were orange-tea shops . People sipped tea in them and dropped their h 's . Gongs were beaten . Viking ships sailed the inland seas . " The producer lifts himself up through the trap door and sits on the plankings , the gun cradled more easily in his hand . He seems to be looking at the old man first with one eye , then the other , listening to him with one ear , then the other , shaking his head a little to himself . The night watchman continues : " And somehow , after the extras and the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and the gates were shut and they drove off in big cars , somehow something of all those thousands of different people remained . The things they had been , or pretended to be , stayed on . The foreign languages , the costumes , the things they did , the things they thought about , their religions and their music , all those little things and big things stayed on . The sights of far places . The smells . The salt wind . The sea . It 's all here tonight  --  if you listen . " The producer listens and the old man listens in the drafty strutworksof the cathedral , with the moonlight blinding the eyes of the plaster gargoyles and the wind making the false stone mouths to whisper , and the sound of a thousand lands within a land belowblowing and dusting and leaning in that wind , a thousand yellow minarets and milk-white towers and green avenues yet un/inched among the hundred new ruins , and all of it murmuring its wires and lathings like a great steel-and-wooden harp touched in the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky to these two men who stand listening and apart . The producer laughs shortly and shakes his head . " You heard , " says the night watchman . " You did hear , did n't you ? I see it in your face . " Douglas shoves the gun in his coat pocket . " Anything you listenfor you can hear . I made the mistake of listening . You should have been a writer . You could throw six of my best ones out of work . Well , what about it  --  are you ready to come down out of here now ? " " You sound almost polite , " says the night watchman . " Do n't know why I should . You ruined a good evening for me . " " Did I ? It has n't been that bad , has it ? A bit different , I shouldsay . Stimulating , maybe . " Douglas laughs quietly . " You 're not dangerous at all . You just need company . It 's your job and everything going to hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , though . " " Do n't tell me I 've got you thinking ? " asks the old man . Douglas snorts . " After you 've lived in Hollywood long enough , you meet all kinds . Besides , I 've never been up here before . It 's a real view , like you say . But I 'll be damned if I can figure why you should worry about all this junk . What 's it to you ? " The night watchman gets down on one knee and taps one hand into the palm of the other , illustrating his points . " Look . As I said before , you came here years ago , clapped your hands , and three hundred cities jumped up ! Then you added a half thousand other nations and states and peoples and religions and political setups inside the barbed-wire fence . And there was trouble ! Oh , nothing you could see . It was all in the wind and the spaces between . But it was the same kind of trouble the world out there beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at last the trouble died out . You want to know why ? " " If I did n't , I would n't be sitting up here freezing . " A little night music , please , thinks the old man , and moves his hand on the air like someone playing the proper and beautiful music to background all that he has to tell ... . " Because you got Boston joined to Trinidad , " he says softly , " part of Trinidad poking out of Lisbon , part of Lisbon leaning on Alexandria , Alexandria tacked onto Shanghai , and a lot of little pegs and nails between , like Chattanooga , Oshkosh , Oslo , Sweet Water , Soissons , Beirut , Bombay , and Port Arthur . You shoot a man in New York and he stumbles forward and drops dead in Athens . You take a political bribe in Chicago and somebody in London goes to jail . You hang a Negro man in Alabama and the people of Hungary have to bury him . The dead Jews of Polandclutter the streets of Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a man 's stomach in Berlin and it comes out the back of a farmer in Memphis . It 's all so close , so very close . That 's why we have peace here . ' We 're all so crowded there has got to be peace , or nothing would be left ! One fire would destroy all of us , no matterwho started it , for what reason . So all of the people , the memories , whatever you want to call them , that are here , have settled down , and this is their world , a good world , a fine world . " The old man stops and licks his lips slowly and takes a breath . " And tomorrow , " he says , " you 're going to stomp it down . " The old man crouches there a moment longer , then gets to his feet and gazes out at the cities and the thousand shadows in those cities . The great plaster cathedral whines and sways in the night air , back and forth , rocking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , " shall  --  shall we go down now ? " Smith nods . " I 've had my say . " Douglas vanishes , and the watchman listens to the younger manp207going down and down through the ladders and catwalks of the night . Then , after a reasonable hesitation , the old man takes hold of the ladder , breathes something to himself , and begins the long descent in shadow . The studio police and the few workers and some minor executivesall drive away . Only one large dark car waits outside the barbed-wire gate as the two men stand talking in the cities of the meadow . " What are you going to do now ? " asks Smith . " Go back to my party , I suppose , " says the producer . " Will it be fun ? " " Yes . " The producer hesitates . " Sure , it 'll be fun ! " He glances at the night watchman 's right hand . " Do n't tell me you 've found that hammer Kelly told me you were using ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up , do you ? " " Would you , if you were the last builder and everybody else was a wrecker ? " Douglas starts to walk with the old man . " Well , maybe I 'll see you again , Smith . " " No , " says Smith , " I wo n't be here . This all wo n't be here . If you come back again , it 'll be too late . " Douglas stops . " Hell , hell ! What do you want me to do ? " " A simple thing . Leave all this standing . Leave these cities up . " " I ca n't do that ! Damn it . Business reasons . It has to go . " " A man with a real nose for business and some imaginationcould think up a profitable reason for it to stay , " says Smith . " My car 's waiting ! How do I get out of here ? " The producer strikes off over a patch of rubble , cuts through half of a tumbled ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facades and strutworks . Dust rains from the sky . " Watch out ! "  |p208The  producer stumbles in a thunder of dust and avalanching brick ; he gropes , he topples , he is seized upon by the old man and yanked forward . " Jump ! " They jump , and half the building slides to ruin , crashes into hills and mountains of old paper and lathing . A great bloom of dust strikes out upon the air . " You all right ? " " Yes . Thanks . Thanks . " The producer looks at the fallen building . The dust clears . " You probably saved my life . " " Hardly that . Most of those are papier-mache bricks . You might have been cut and bruised a little . " " Nevertheless , thanks . What building was that that fell ? " " Norman village tower , built in 1925 . Do n't get near the rest of it ; it might go down . " " I 'll be careful . " The producer moves carefully in to stand by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn building over with one hand . " He demonstrates ; the building leans and quivers and groans . The producer steps quickly back . " I could knock it down in a second . " " But you would n't want to do that , " says the watchman . " Oh , would n't I ? What 's one French house more or less , this late in the day ? " The old man takes his arm . " Walk around here to the other side of the house . " They walk to the other side . " Read that sign , " says Smith . The producer flicks his cigarette lighter , holds the fire up to help him squint , and reads : " ' THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK , MELLIN TOWN . ' " He pauses . " ILLINOIS , ' " he says , very slowly . The building stands there in the sharp light of the stars and the bland light of the moon.  | " On one side "  --  Douglas balances his hand like a scales  --  : ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven steps to theright , seven steps to the left , peering . " TILE FIRST NATIONAL BANK . ' Bank . Tower . Tower . Bank . Well , I 'll be damned . " Smith smiles and says , " Still want to push the French tower clown , Mr. Douglas ? " " Wait a minute , wait a minute , hold on , hold on , " says Douglas , and suddenly begins to see the buildings that stand before him . He turns in a slow circle ; his eyes move up and down and across and over ; his eyes flick here , flick there , see this , see that , examine , file , put away , and re-examine . He begins to walk in silence . They move in the cities of the meadow , over grasses and wild flowers , up to and into and through ruins and half ruins and up to and into and through complete avenues and villages and towns . They begin a recital which goes on and on as they walk , Douglasasking , the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's this over here ? " " A Buddhist temple . " " And on the other side of it ? " " The log cabin where Lincoln was born . " " And here ? " " St. Patrick 's church , New York . " " And on the reverse ? " " A Russian Orthodox church in Rostov ! " " What 's this ? " " The door of a castle on the Rhine ! " " And inside ? " " A Kansas City soda fountain ! " " And here ? And here ? And over there ? And what 's that ? " asks Douglas . " What 's this ! What about that one ! And over there ! "  |p210It  seems as if they are running and rushing and yelling all through the cities , here , there , everywhere , up , down , in , out , climbing , descending , poking , stirring , opening-shutting doors . " And this , and this , and this , and this ! " The night watchman tells all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow alleys , and avenues as broad as rivers made of stone and sand . They make a great talking circle ; they hurry all around and back to where they started . They are quiet again . The old man is quiet from having said what there was to say , and the producer is quiet from listening and remembering and fitting it all together in his mind . He stands , absent-mindedly fumbling for his cigarette case . It takes him a full minute to open it , examining every action , thinking about it , and to offer the case to the watchman . " Thanks . " They light up thoughtfully . They puff on their cigarettes and watch the smoke blow away . Douglas says , " Where 's that damned hammer of yours ? " " Here , " says Smith . " You got your nails with you ? " " Yes , sir . " Douglas takes a deep drag on his cigarette and exhales . " Okay , Smith , get to work . " " What ? " " You heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own time . Most of the stuff that 's already torn down is a complete loss . But any bits and pieces that fit and will look decent , put ' em together . Thank God there 's a lot still standing . It took me a long time to get it through my head . A man with a nose for business and some imagination , you said . This is the world , you said . I should have seen it years ago . Here it all is inside the fence , and me too blindp211to see what could be done with it . The World Federation in my own back yard and me kicking it over . So help me God , we need more crazy people and night watchmen . " " You know , " says the night watchman , " I 'm getting old and I 'm getting strange . You would n't be fooling an old and a strange man , would you ? " " I 'll make no promises I ca n't keep , " says the producer . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance we can go ahead . It would make a beautiful film , there 's no doubt of that . We could make it all here , inside the fence , photograph it ten ways from Christmas . There 's no doubt about a story , either . You provided it . It 's yours . It would n't be hard to put some writers to work on it . Good writers . Perhaps only a short subject , twenty minutes , but we could show all the cities and countries here , leaning on and holdingeach other up . I like the idea . I like it very much , believe me . We could show a film like that to anyone anywhere in the world and they 'd like it . They could n't pass it up , it would be too im-portant . " " It 's good to hear you talk this - way . " " I hope I keep on talking this way , " says the producer . " I ca n't be trusted . I do n't trust myself . Hell , I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you 'll have to hit me on the head with that hammer to keep me going . " " I 'd be pleased , " says Smith . " And if we do the film , " says the younger man , " I suppose you could help . You know the sets , probably better than anyone . Any suggestions you might want to make , we 'd be glad to have . Then , after we do the film , I suppose you wo n't mind letting us tear the rest of the world down , right ? " " I 'd give my permission , " says the watchman . " Well , I 'll call off the hounds for a few days and see what happens . Send out a camera crew tomorrow to see what we canp212line up for shots . Send out some writers . Maybe you can all gab . Hell , hell . We 'll work it out . " Douglas turns toward the gate . " In the meantime , use your hammer all you want . I 'll be seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hurry toward the gate . On the way , the old man finds his lunch box where he abandoned it some hours ago . He picks it up , takes out the thermos , and shakes it . " How about a drink before you go ? " " What 've you got ? Some of that amontillado you were yelling about ? " " 1876 . " " Let 's have some of that , sure . " The thermos is opened and the liquid poured steaming from it into the cup . " There you are , " says the old man . " Thanks . Here 's to you . " The producer drinks . " That 's good . Ah , that 's damned good ! " " It might taste like coffee , but I tell you it 's the finest amontilladoever put under a cork . " " You can say that again . " The two of them stand among the cities of the world in the moonlight , drinking the hot drink , and the old man remembers something : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , a song that all of us who live inside the fence sing , when we 're of a mind , when I listen right , and the wind 's just right in the telephonewires . It goes like this : " We all go the same way home , All the same collection , in the same direction , All go the same way home . So there 's no need to part at all , And we 'll all cling together like the ivy on the old garden wall .. "  |p213They  finish drinking the coffee in the middle of Port-au-Prince . " Hey ! " says the producer suddenly . " Take it easy with thatcigarette ! You want to burn down the whole darn world ? " They both look at the cigarette and smile . " I 'll be careful , " says Smith . " So long , " says the producer . " I 'm really late for that party . " " So long , Mr. Douglas . " The gate hasp clicks open and shut , the footsteps die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonlight , leaving behind the cities of the world and an old man standing in the middle of these cities of the world , raising his hand to wave . " So long , " says the night watchman . And then there is only the wind. i 'll  |p215This  is how his work was : he got up at five in the cold dark morning and washed his face withwarm water if the heater was working and cold water if the heater was not working . He shaved carefully , talking out to his wife in the kitchen , who was fixing ham and eggs or pancakes or whatever it was that morning . By six o'clock he was driving on his way to work alone , and parking his car in the big yard where all the other men parked their cars as the sun was coming up . The colors of the sky that time of morning were orange and blue and violet and sometimes very red and some-times yellow or a clear color like water on white rock . Some morning she could see his breath on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun was still rising he knocked his fist on the side of the green truck , and his driver , smiling and saying hello , 111111p216would climb in the other side of the truck and they would drive out into the great city and go down all the streets until they came to the place where they started work . Sometimes , on the way , they stopped for black coffee and then went on , the warmness in them . And they began the work which meant that he jumped off , in front of each house and picked up the garbage cans and brought them back and took off their lids and knocked them against the bin edge , which made the orange peels and cantaloupe rinds and coffee grounds fall out and thump down and begin to fill the empty truck . There were always steak bones and the heads of fish and pieces of green onion and stale celery . If the garbage was new it was n't so bad , but if it was very old it was bad . He was not sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job and he did it well , talking about it a lot at some times and sometimes not thinking of it in any way at all . Some days the job was wonderful , for you were out early and the air was cool and fresh until you had worked too long and the sun got hot and the garbage steamed early . But mostly it was a job significant enough to keep him busy and calm and looking at the houses and cut lawns he passed by and seeing how everybody lived . And once or twice a month he was surprised to find that he loved the job and that it was the finest job in the world . It went on just that way for many years . And then suddenly the job changed for him . It changed in a single day . Later he often wondered how a iob could change so much in such a few short hours . He walked into the apartment and did not see his wife or hear her voice , but she was there , and he walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him as he touched the chair and sat down in it without saying a word . He sat there for a long time.  | " What 's wrong ? " At last her voice came through to him . She must have said it three or four times . " Wrong ? " He looked t this woman and yes , it was his wife all right , it was someone he Knew , and this was their apartment with the tall ceilings and the worn carpeting . " Something happened a , work today , " he said . She waited for him . " On my garbage truck , something happened . " His tongue moved dryly on his lips and his eyes shut over his seeing until there was all blackness and no light of any sort and it was like standing alone in a room when you got out of bed in the middle of a dark night . " I think I 'm going to quit my job . Try to understand . " " Understand ! " she cried . " It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever happened to me in my life . " He opened his eyes and sat there , his hands feeling cold when he rubbed his thumb and forefingerstogether . " The thing that happened was strange . " " Well , do n't just sit there ! " He took part of a newspaper from the pocket of his leather jacket . " This is today 's paper , " he said . " December io , 1951 . Los Angeles Times . Civil Defense Bulletin . It says they 're buying radios for our garbage trucks . " " Well , what 's so bad about a little music ? " " No music . You do n't understand . No music . " He opened his rough hand and drew with one clean fingernail , slowly , trying to put everything there where he could see it and she could see it . " In this article the mayor says they 'll put sending and receiving apparatus on every garbage truck in town . " He squinted at his hand . " After the atom bombs hit our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then our garbage trucks will go pick up the bodies . " " Well , that seems practical . When  --  "  | " The garbage trucks , " he said , " go out and pick up all the bodies . " " You ca n't just leave bodies around , can you ? You 've got to take them and --  " His wife shut her mouth very slowly . She blinked , one time only , and she did this very slowly also . He watched that one slow blink of her eyes . Then , with a turn of her body , as if someone else had turned it for her , she walked to a chair , paused , thought how to do it , and sat down , very straight and stiff . She said nothing . He listened to his wrist watch ticking , but with only a small part of his attention . At last she laughed . " They were joking ! " He shook his head . He felt hs head moving from left to right and from right to left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They put a receiver on my truck today . They said , at the alert , if you 're working , dump your garbage anywhere . When we radio you , get in there and haul out the dead . " Some water in the kitchen boiled over loudly . She let it boil for five seconds and then held the arm of the chair with one hand and got up and found the door and went out . The boiling sound stopped . She stood in the door and then walked back to where he still sat , not moving , his head in one position only . " It 's all blueprinted out . They have squads , sergeants , captains , corporals , everything , " he said . " We even know where to bring the bodies . " " So you 've been thinking about it all day , " she said . " All day since this morning . I thought : Maybe now I do n't want to be a garbage collector any more . It used to be Tom and me had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . Garbage is bad . But if you work at it you can make a game . Tom and me did that . We watched people 's garbage . We saw what kind they had . Steak bones in rich houses , lettuce and orange peel in poor ones . Sure it 's silly ,  |p219but  a guy 's got to make his work as good as he can and worth while or why in hell do it ? And you 're your own boss , in a way , on a truck . You get out early in the morning and it 's an outdoor job , anyway ; you see the sun come up and you see the town get up , and that 's not bad at all . But now , today , all of a sudden it 's not the kind of job for me any more . " His wife started to talk swiftly . She named a lot of things and she talked about a lot more , but before she got very far he cut gently across her talking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our car , I know , " he said . " And bills and money and credit . But what about that farm Dad left us ? Why ca n't we move there , away from cities ? I know a little about farming . We could stock up , hole in , have enough to live on for months if anything happened . " She said nothing . " Sure , all of our friends are here in town , " he went on reasonably . " And movies and shows and the kids ' friends , and ... " She took a deep breath . " Ca n't we think it over a few more clays ? " " I do n't know . I 'm afraid of that . I 'm afraid if I think it over , a bout my truck and my new work , I 'll get used to it . And , oh Christ , it just does n't seem right a man , a human being , should over let himself get used to any idea like that . " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray walls , the dark pictures on the walls . She tightened her hands . She started to open her mouth . " I 'll think tonight , " he said . " I 'll stay up awhile . By morning I 'll know what to do . " " Be careful with the children . It would n't be good , their knowingall this . " " I 'll be careful . " " Let 's not talk any more , then . I 'll finish dinner ! " She jumped up and put her hands to her face and then looked at her handsp220and at the sunlight in the windows . " Why , the kids 'll be home any minute . " " I 'm not very hungry . " " You got to eat , you just got to keep on going . " She hurried off , leaving him alone in the middle of a room where not a breeze stirred the curtains , and only the gray ceiling hung over him with a lonely bulb unlit in it , like an old moon in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both hands . He got up and stood alone in the dining-room door and walked forward and felt himself sit down and remain seated in a dining-room chair . He saw his hands spread on the white tablecoth , open and empty . " All afternoon , " he said , " I 've thought . " She moved through the kitchen , rattling silverware , crashing pans against the silence that was everywhere . " Wondering , " he said , " if you put the bodies in the trucks lengthwise or endwise , with the heads on the right , or the feet on the right . Men and women together , or separated ? Children in one truck , or mixed with men and women ? Dogs in special trucks , or just let them lay ? Wondering how many bodies one garbage truck can hold . And wondering if you stack them on top of each other and finally knowing you must just have to . I ca n't figure it . I ca n't work it out . I try , but there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack in one single truck . " He sat thinking of how it was late in the day at his work , with the truck full and the canvas pulled over the great bulk of garbage so the bulk shaped the canvas in an uneven mound . And how it was if you suddenly pulled the canvas back and looked in . And for a few seconds you saw the white things like macaroni or noodles , only the white things were alive and boiling up , millions of them . And when the white things felt the hot sun on them they simmereddown and burrowed and were gone in the lettuce and the old ground beef and the coffee grounds and the heads of white fish.  |p221After  ten seconds of sunlight the white things that looked like noodles or macaroni were gone and the great bulk of garbage silent Ind not moving , and you drew the canvas over the bulk and looked it how the canvas folded unevenly over the hidden collection , and underneath you knew it was dark again , and things beginning to move as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still sitting there in the empty room when the front door of the apartment burst wide . His son and daughter rushed n laughing , and saw him sitting there , and stopped .  --  Their mother ran to the kitchen door , held to the edge of it quickly , and stared at her family . They saw her face and they heard her voice : " Sit down , children , sit down ! " She lifted one hand and pushed it . toward them . " You 're just in time . "  |p223The  morning the great fire started , nobody in the housecould put it out . It was Mother'sniece , Marianne , living with us while her parents were in Europe , who was all aflame . So nobody could smash the little window in the red box at the corner and pull the trigger to bring the gushing hoses and the hatted firemen . Blazing like so much ignited cellophane , Marianne came downstairs , plumped herself with a loud cry or moan at the breakfast table , and refused to eat enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the warmth in the room being excessive . " Good morning , Marianne . "  | " What ? " Marianne looked beyond people and spoke vaguely . " Oh , good morning . " " Did you sleep well last night , Marianne ? " But they knew she had n't slept . Mother gave Marianne a glass of water to drink , and everyone wondered if it would evaporate in her hand . Grandma , from her table chair , surveyed Marianne 's fevered eyes . " You 're sick , but it 's no microbe , " she said . " They could n't find it under a microscope . " " What ? " said Marianne . " Love is godmother to stupidity , " said Father detachedly . " She 'll be all right , " Mother said to Father . " Girls only seem stupid because when they 're in love they ca n't hear . " " It affects the semicircular canals , " said Father . " Making many girls fall right into a fellow 's arms . I know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let me tell you --  " " Hush . " Mother frowned , looking at Marianne . " She ca n't hear what we 're saying ; she 's cataleptic right now . " " He 's coming to pick her up this morning , " whispered Mother to Father , as if Marianne was n't even in the room . " They 're going riding in his jalopy . " Father patted his mouth with a napkin . " Was our daughter like this , Mama ? " he wanted to know . " She 's been married and gone so long , I 've forgotten . I do n't recall she was so foolish . One would never know a girl had an ounce of sense at a time like this . That 's what fools a man . He says , Oh , what a lovely brainless girl , she loves me , I think I 'll marry her . He marries her and wakes up one morning and all the dreaminess is gone out of her and her s intellect has returned , unpacked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins running into ropes and lines . He finds himself on a little desert isle , a little living room alone in the midst of a universe , with a honeycomb that has turned into a bear trap , with a butterfly metamorphosed into a wasp . He thenp225immediately takes up a hobby : stamp collecting , lodge meetings , or --  " How you do run on , " cried Mother . " Marianne , tell us about this young man . What was his name again ? Was it Isak Van Pelt ? " " What ? ' Oh  --  Isak , yes . " Marianne had been roving about her bed all night , sometimes flipping poetry books and reading in- ( edible lines , sometimes lying flat on her back , sometimes on her t4mmy looking out at dreaming moonlit country . The smell of jasmine had touched the room all night and the excessive warmth of early spring ( the thermometer read fifty-five degrees ) had kept her awake . She looked like a dying moth , if anyone had peeked through the keyhole . This morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror and come to breakfast , remembering just in time to put on a dress . Grandma laughed quietly all during breakfast . Finally she said , " You must eat , child , you must . " So Marianne played with her toast and got half a piece down . Just then there was a loud honk outside . That was Isak ! In his jalopy ! " Whoop ! " cried Marianne , and ran upstairs quickly . The young Isak Van Pelt was brought in and introduced around . When Marianne was finally gone , Father sat down , wiping his forehead . " I do n't know . This is too much . " " You were the one who suggested she start going out , " said Mother . " And I 'm sorry I suggested it , " he said . " But she 's been visiting is for six months now , and six more months to go . I thought if she met some nice young man --  " " And they were married , " husked Grandma darkly , " why , Mariannemight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " said Father . " Well , " said Grandma.  | " But now it 's worse than before , " said Father . " She floats around singing with her eyes shut , playing those infernal love records and talking to herself . A man can stand so much . She 's getting so she laughs all the time , too . Do eighteen-year-old girls often wind up in the booby hatch ? " " He seems a nice young man , " said Mother . " Yes , we can always pray for that , " said Father , taking out a little shot glass . " Here 's to an early marriage . " The second morning Marianne was out of the house like a fireball when first she heard the jalopy horn . There was no time for the young man even to come to the door . Only Grandma saw them roar off together , from the parlor window . " She almost knocked me down . " Father brushed his mustache . " What 's that ? Brained eggs ? Well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted about the living room to the phonograph records . The needle hiss filled the house . She played " That Old Black Magic " twenty-one times , going " la la la " as she swam with her eyes closed in the room . " I 'm afraid to go in my own parlor , " said Father . " I retired from business to smoke cigars and enjoy living , not to have a limp relative humming about under the parlor chandelier . " " Hush , " said Mother . " This is a crisis , " announced Father , " in my life . After all , she 's just visiting . " " You know how visiting girls are . Away from home they think they 're in Paris , France . She 'll be gone in October . It 's not so dreadful . " " Let 's see , " figured Father slowly . " I 'll have been buried just about one hundred and thirty days out at Green Lawn Cemetery by then . " He got up and threw his paper down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By George , Mother , I 'm talking to her right now ! "  |p227He  went and stood in the parlor door , peering through it at the waltzing Marianne . " La , " she sang to the music . Clearing his throat , he stepped through . " Marianne , " he-said . " That old black magic .. " sang Marianne . " Yes ? " He watched her hands swinging in the air . She gave him a sudden fiery look as she danced by . " I want to talk to you . " He straightened his tie . " Dah dum dee dum dum dee dum dee dum dum , " she sang . " Did you hear me ? " he demanded . " He 's so nice , " she said . " Evidently . " " Do you know , he . bows and opens doors like a doorman and plays a trumpet like Harry James and brought me daisies this morning ? " " I would n't doubt . " " His eyes are blue . " She looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling to look at . She kept looking , as she danced , at the ceiling as he came over and stood near her , looking up , but there was n't a rain spot or a settling crack there , and he sighed , " Marianne . " " And we ate lobster at that river cafe . " " Lobster . I know , but we do n't want you breaking down , getting weak . One day , tomorrow , you must stay home and help your aunt Math make her doilies --  " " Yes , sir . " She dreamed around the room with her wings out . " Did you hear me ? " he demanded . " Yes , " she whispered . " Yes . " Her eyes shut . " Oh yes , yes . " Her skirts whished around . " Uncle , " she said , her head back , lolling . " You 'll help your aunt with her doilies ? " he cried. "  --  with her doilies , " she murmured . " There ! " He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess I told her ! "  |p228But  next morning he was on the edge of his bed when he heard the hot-rod 's thunderous muffler and heard Marianne fall down- 1 stairs , linger two seconds in the dining room for breakfast , hesitate by the bathroom long enough to consider whether she would be sick , and then the slam of the front door , the sound of the jalopy banging down the street , two people singing off key in it . Father put his head in his hands . " Doilies , " he said . " What ? " said Mother . " Dooley 's , " said Father . " I 'm going down to Dooley 's for a morning visit . " " But Dooley 's is n't open until ten . " " I 'll wait , " decided Father , eyes shut . That night and seven other wild nights the porch swing sang a little creaking song , back and forth , back and forth . Father , hiding in the living room , could be seen in fierce relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumined his immensely tragic face . The porch swing creaked . He waited for another creak . He heard little butterfly-soft sounds from outside , little palpitations of laughter and sweet nothings in small ears . " My porch , " said Father . " My swing , " he whispered to his cigar , looking at it . " My house . " He listened for another creak . " My God , " he said . He went to the tool shed and appeared on the dark porch with a shiny oil can . " No , do n't get up . Do n't bother . There , and there . " He oiled the swing joints . It was dark . He could n't see Marianne ; he could smell her . The perfume almost knocked him off into the , rosebush . He could n't see her gentleman friend , either . " Good night , " he said . He went in and sat down and there was no more creaking . Now all he could hear was something that sounded like the mothlike flutter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mother in the kitchen door , wiping a dinner dish.  | " That 's what I 'm hoping , " whispered Father . " That 's why I let hem have the porch every night ! " " So many days in a row , " said Mother . " A girl does n't go with a nice young man that many times unless he 's serious . " " Maybe he 'll propose tonight ! " was Father 's happy thought . " Hardly so soon . And she is so young . " " Still , " he ruminated , " it might happen . It 's got to happen , by the Lord Harry . " Grandma chuckled from her corner easy chair . It sounded like someone turning the pages of an ancient book . " What 's so funny ? " said Father . " Wait and see , " said Grandma . " Tomorrow . " Father stared at the dark , but Grandma would say no more . " Well , well , " said Father at breakfast . He surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , well , by gosh , last night , on the porch , there was more whispering . What 's his name ? Isak ? Well , now , if I 'm any judge at all , I think he proposed to Marianne last night ; yes , I 'm positive of it ! " " It would be nice , " said Mother . " A spring marriage . But it 's so soon . " " Look , " said Father with full-mouthed logic . " Marianne 's the kind of girl who marries quick and young . We ca n't stand in her way , can we ? " " For once I think you 're right , " said Mother . " A marriage would be fine . Spring flowers , and Marianne looking nice in that gown I saw at Haydecker 's last week . " They all peered anxiously at the stairs , waiting for Marianne to appear . " Pardon me , " rasped Grandma , sighting up from her morning toast . " But I would n't talk of getting rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not ? " " Because . " " Because why ? " " I hate to spoil your plans , " rustled Grandma , chuckling . She gestured with her little vinegary head . " But while you people were worrying about getting Marianne married , I 've been keeping tab on her . Seven days now I 've been watching this young fellow each day he came in his car and honked his horn outside . He must be an actor or a quick-change artist or something . " " What ? " asked Father . " Yep , " said Grandma . " Because one day he was a young blond fellow , and next day he was a tall dark fellow , and Wednesday he was a chap with a brown mustache , and Thursday he had wavy red hair , and Friday he was shorter , with a Chevrolet stripped down instead of a Ford . " Mother and Father sat for a minute as if hit with hammers right behind the left ear . At last Father , his face exploding with color , shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , woman , you say ; all those men , and you --  " You were always hiding , " snapped Grandma . " So you would n't spoil things . If you 'd come out in the open you 'd have seen the same as I. I never said a word . She 'll simmer down . It 's just her time of life . Every woman goes through it . It 's hard , but they can survive . A new man every day does wonders for a girl 's ego ! " " You , you , you , you , you ! " Father choked on it , eyes wild , throat gorged too big for his collar . He fell back in his chair , exhausted . Mother sat , stunned . " Good morning , everyone ! " Marianne raced downstairs and popped into a chair . Father stared at her . " You , you , you , you , you , " he accused Grandma . I shall run down the street shouting , thought Father wildly , andp231break the fire-alarm window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoses . Or perhaps there will be a late snowstorm and I shall set Marianne out in it to cool . He did neither . The heat in the room being excessive , according to the wall calendar , everyone moved out onto the cool porch while Marianne sat looking at her orange juice.  |p233But  of course he was going away , there was nothing else to do , the time was up , the clock had run out , and he was going very far away indeed . His suitcase was packed , his shoes were shined , his hair was brushed , he had expressly washed behind his ears , and it remained only for him to go down the stairs , out the front door , and up the street to the small-town station where the train would make a stop for him alone . Then Fox Hill , Illinois , would be left far off in his past . And he would go on , perhaps to Iowa , perhaps to Kansas , perhaps even to California ; a small boy , twelve years old , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been born forty-three years ago . " Willie ! " called a voice belowstairs . " Yes ! " He hoisted his suitcase . In his bureau mirror he saw ap234face made of June dandelions and July apples and warm summermorningmilk . There , as always , was his look of the angel and the innocent , which might never , in the years of his life , change . " Almost time , " called the woman 's voice . " All right ! " And he went down the stairs , grunting and smiling . In the living room sat Anna and Steve , their clothes painfully neat . " Here I am ! " cried Willie in the parlor door . Anna looked like she was going to cry . " Oh , good Lord , you ca n't really be leaving us , can you , Willie ? " " People are beginning to talk , " said Willie quietly . " I 've been here three years now . But when people begin to talk , I know it 's time to put on my shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all so strange . I do n't understand . It 's so sudden , " Anna said . " Willie , we 'll miss you . " " I 'll write you every Christmas , so help me . Do n't you write me . " " It 's been a great pleasure and satisfaction , " said Steve , sitting there , his words the wrong size in his mouth . " It 's a shame it had to stop . It 's a shame you had to tell us about yourself . It 's an awful shame you ca n't stay on . " " You 're the nicest folks I ever had , " said Willie , four feet high , in no need of a shave , the sunlight on his face . And then Anna did cry . " Willie , Willie . " And she sat down and looked as if she wanted to hold him but was afraid to hold him now ; she looked at him with shock and amazement and her hands empty , not knowing what to do with him now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Willie . " You get used to things . You want to stay . But it does n't work . I tried to stay on once after people began to suspect . How horrible ! ' people said . All these years , playing with our innocent children , ' they said , and us not guessing ! Awful ! ' they said . And finally I had to just leave town one night . It 's not easy . You know darned well how much I love both of you . Thanks for three swell years . "  |p235They  all went to the front door . " Willie , where 're you going ? " " I do n't know . I just start traveling . When I see a town that looks green and nice , I settle in . " " Will you ever come back ? " " Yes , " he said earnestly with his high voice . " In about twenty years it should begin to show in my face . When it does , I 'm going to make a grand tour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They stood on the cool summer porch , reluctant to say the last words . Steve was looking steadily at an elm tree . " How many other folks 've you stayed with , Willie ? How many adoptions ? " Willie figured it , pleasantly enough . " I guess it 's about five towns and five couples and over twenty years gone by since I started my tour . " Well , we ca n't holler , " said Steve . " Better to 've had a son thirty-six months than none whatever . " " Well , " said Willie , and kissed Anna quickly , seized at his luggage , and was gone up the street in the green noon light , under the trees , a very young boy indeed , not looking back , running steadily . The boys were playing on the green park diamond when he came by . He stood a little while among the oak-tree shadows , watching them hurl the white , snowy baseball into the warm summer air , saw the baseball shadow fly like a dark bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch this swift piece of summer that now seemed most especially important to hold onto . The boys ' voices yelled . The ball lit on the grass near Willie . Carrying the ball forward from under the shade trees , he thought of the last three years now spent to the penny , and the five years before that , and so on down the line to the year when he was really eleven and twelve and fourteen and the voices saying : " What 's wrong with Willie , missus ? " " Mrs. B. , is Willie latep236a-growin ' ? " " Willie , you smokin ' cigars lately ? " The echoes died in summer light and color . His mother 's voice : " Willie 's twentyonetoday ! " And a thousand voices saying : " Come back , son , when you 're fifteen ; then maybe we 'll give you a job . " He stared at the baseball in his trembling hand , as if it were his life , an interminable ball of years strung around and around and around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the kids walking toward him ; he felt them blot out the sun , and they were older , standing around him . " Willie ! ' Where you goin ' ? " They kicked his suitcase . How tall they stood to the sun . In the last few months it seemed the sun had passed a hand above their heads , beckoned , and they were warm metal drawn melting upward ; they were golden taffy pulled by an immense gravity to the sky , thirteen , fourteen years old , looking down upon Willie , smiling , but already beginning to neglect him . It had started four months ago : " Choose up sides ! Who wants Willie ? " " Aw , Willie 's too little ; we do n't play with kids . " And they raced ahead of him , drawn by the moon and the sun and the turning seasons of leaf and wind , and he was twelve years old and not of them any more . And the other voices beginning again on the old , the dreadfully familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Steve . " " Anna , does shortness run in your family ? " And the cold fist kneading at your heart again and knowing that the roots would have to be pulled up again after 3o many good years with the " folks . " " Willie , where you goin ' ? " He jerked his head . He was back among the towering , shadowingboys who milled around him like giants at a drinking fountain bending down . " Coin ' a few days visitin ' a cousin of mine . " " Oh . " There was a day , a year ago , when they would have caredp237very much indeed . But now there was only curiosity for his luggage , their enchantment with trains and trips and far places . " How about a coupla fast ones ? " said Willie . They looked doubtful , but , considering the circumstances , nodded . He dropped his bag and ran out ; the white baseball was up in the sun , away to their burning white figures in the far meadow , up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pattern . Here , there ! Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hanlon , Creek Bend , Wisconsin , 1932 , the first couple , the first year ! Here , there ! Henry and Alice Boltz , Limeville , Iowa , 1935 ! The baseball flying . The Smiths , the Eatons , the Robinsons ! 1939 ! 1945 ! Husband and wife , husband and wife , husband and wife , no children , no children , no children ! A knock on this door , a knock on that . " Pardon me . My name is William . I wonder if --  " " A sandwich ? Come in , sit down . Where you from , son ? " The sandwich , a tall glass of cold milk , the smiling , the nodding , the comfortable , leisurely talking . " Son , you look like you been traveling . You run off from some-where ? " " No . " " Boy , are you an orphan ? " Another glass of milk . " We always wanted kids . It never worked out . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . It 's getting late , son . Do n't you think you better hit for home ? " " Got no home . " " A boy like you ? Not dry behind the ears ? Your mother 'll be worried . " " Got no home and no folks anywhere in the world . I wonder if  --  I wonder  --  could I sleep here tonight ? " " Well , now , son , I do n't just know . We never considered taking in --  " said the husband.  | " We got chicken for supper tonight , " said the wife , " enough for extras , enough for company .... " And the years turning and flying away , the voices , and the faces , and the people , and always the same first conversations . The voice of Emily Robinson , in her rocking chair , in summer-night darkness , the last night he stayed with her , the night she discovered his secret , her voice saying : " I look at all the little children 's faces going by . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that all these flowers have to be cut , all these bright fires have to be put out . What a shame these , all of these you see in schools or running by , have to get tall and unsightly and wrinkle and turn gray or get bald , and finally , all bone and wheeze , be dead and buried off ' away . When I hear them laugh I ca n't believe they 'll ever go the road I 'm going . Yet here they come ! I still remember Wordsworth 's poem : When all at once I saw a crowd , A host of golden daffodils ; Beside the lake , beneath the trees , Fluttering and dancing in the breeze . ' That 's how I think of children , cruel as they sometimes are , mean as I know they can be , but not yet showing the mean -- ness around their eyes or in their eyes , not yet full of tiredness . They 're so eager for everything ! I guess that 's what I miss most in older folks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , so much of the drive and life down the drain . I like to watch school let out each day . It 's like someone threw a bunch of flowers out the school front doors . How does it feel , Willie ? How does it feel to be young forever ? To look like a silver dime new from the mint ? Are you happy ? Are you as fine as you seem ? " The baseball whizzed from the blue sky , stung his hand like a great pale insect . Nursing it , he hears his memory say : " I worked with what I had . After my folks died , after I found I could n't get man 's work anywhere , I tried carnivals , but theyp239only laughed . Son , ' they said , you 're not a midget , and even if you are , you look like a boy ! We want midgets with midgets ' faces ! Sorry , son , sorry . ' So I left home , started out , thinking : What was I ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , so I might as well go on being a boy . No use fighting it . No use screaming . So what could I do ? What job was handy ? And then one day I saw this man in a restaurant looking at another man 's pictures of his children . Sure wish I had kids , ' he said . Sure wish I had kids . ' He kept shaking his head . And me sitting a few seats away from him , a hamburger in my hands . I sat there , frozen ! At that very instant I knew what my job would be for all of the rest of my life . There was work for me , after all . Making lonely people happy . Keeping myself busy . Playing forever . I knew I had to play forever . Deliver a few papers , run a few errands , mow a few lawns , maybe . But hard work ? No . All I had to do was be a mother 's son and a father 's pride . I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg your pardon , ' I said . I smiled at him . . . . " " But , Willie , " said Mrs. Emily long ago , " did n't you ever get lonely ? Did n't you ever want  --  things  --  that grownups wanted ? " " I fought that out alone , " said Willie . " I 'm a boy , I told myself , I 'll have to live in a boy 's world , read boys ' books , play boys ' games , cut myself off from everything else . I ca n't be both . I got to be only one thing  --  young . And so I played that way . Oh , it was n't easy . There were times --  " He lapsed into silence . " And the family you lived with , they never knew ? " " No . Telling them would have spoiled everything . I told them I was a runaway ; I let them check through official channels , police . Then , when there was no record , let them put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as they never guessed . But then , after three years , or five years , they guessed , or a traveling man came through , or a carnival man saw me , and it was over . It always had to end . "  | " And you 're very happy and it 's nice being a child for over forty years ? " " It 's a living , as they say . And when you make other people happy , then you 're almost happy too . I got my job to do and I do it . And anyway , in a few years now I 'll be in my second childhood . All the fevers will be out of me and all the unfulfilled things and most of the dreams . Then I can relax , maybe , and play the role all the way . " He threw the baseball one last time and broke the reverie . Then he was running to seize his luggage . Tom , Bill , Jamie , Bob , Sam  --  their names moved on his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , ' Willie , it ai n't as if you 're going to China or Tim-buktu . " " That 's right , is n't it ? " Willie did not move . " So long , Willie . See you next week ! " " So long , so long ! " And he was walking off with his suitcase again , looking at the trees , going away from the boys and the street where he had lived , and as he turned the corner a train whistle screamed , and he began to run . The last thing he saw and heard was a white ball tossed at a high roof , back and forth , back and forth , and two voices crying out as the ball pitched now up , down , and back through the sky , " Annie , annie , over ! Annie , annie , over ! " like the crying of birds flying off to the far south . In the early morning , with the smell of the mist and the cold metal , with the iron smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling shaking his bones and his body , and a smell of the sun beyond the horizon , he awoke and looked out upon a small town just arising from sleep . Lights were coming on , softp241voices muttered , a red signal bobbed back and forth , back and forth in the cold air . There was that sleeping hush in which echoes are dignified by clarity , in which echoes stand nakedly alone and sharp . A porter moved by , a shadow in shadows . " Sir , " said Willie . The porter stopped . " What town 's this ? " whispered the boy in the dark . " Valleyville . " " How many people ? " " Ten thousand : Why ? This your stop ? " " It looks green . " Willie gazed out at the cold morning town for a long time . " It looks nice and quiet , " said Willie . " Son , " said the porter , " you know where you going ? " " Here , " said Willie , and got up quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train dark , with a rustling and stir . " I hope you know what you 're doing , boy , " said the porter . " Yes , sir , " said Willie . " I know what I 'm doing . " And he was down the dark aisle , luggage lifted after him by the porter , and out in the smoking , steaming-cold , beginning-to-lighten morning . He stood looking up at the porter and the black metal train against the few remaining stars . The train gave a great wailing blast of whistle , the porters cried out all along the line , the cars jolted , and his special porter waved and smiled down at the boy there , the small boy there with the big luggage who shouted up to him . even as the whistle screamed again . " What ? " shouted the porter , hand cupped to ear . " Wish me luck ! " cried Willie . " Best of luck , son , " called the porter , waving , smiling . " Best of luck , boy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sound of the train , in the steam and roar . He watched the black train until it was completely gone away " South , " said the captain . " But , " said his crew , " there simply are n't any directions out here in space . " " When you travel on down toward the sun , " replied the captain , " and everything gets yellow and warm amid lazy , then you 're going in one direction only . " He shut his eyes and thought about the smoldering , warm , faraway land , his breath moving gently in his mouth . " South . " He nodded slowly to himself . " South . " Their rocket was the Copa de Oro , also named the Prometheus and the Icarus , and their destination in all reality was the blazing noonday sun . In high good spirits they had packed along two thousand sour lemonades and a thousand white-capped beers for this journey to the wide Sahara . And now as the sun boiled up at them they remembered a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun ' ? " " Yeats . " " Fear no more the heat of the sun ' ? " " Shakespeare , of course ! " " Cup of Gold ' ? Steinbeck . The Crock of Gold ' ? Stephens . And what about the pot of gold at the rainbow 's end ? There 's a name for our trajectory , by God . Rainbow ! " " Temperature ? " " One thousand degrees Fahrenheit ! " The captain stared from the huge dark-lensed port , and there indeed was the sun , and to go to that sun and touch it and steal part of it forever away was his quiet and single idea . In this ship were combined the coolly delicate and the coldly practical . Through corridors of ice and milk-frost , ammoniated winter and storming snowflakes blew . Any spark from that vast hearth burning out there beyond the callous hull of this ship , any small firebreaththat might seep through would find winter , slumbering here like all the coldest hours of February . The audio-thermometer murmured in the arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falling , thought the captain , like a snowflake into the lap of June , warm July , and the sweltering dog-mad days of August . " Three thousand degrees Fahrenheit ! " Under the snow fields engines raced , refrigerants pumped ten thousand miles per hour in rimed boa-constrictor coils . " Four thousand degrees Fahrenheit . " Noon . Summer . July . " Five thousand Fahrenheit ! " And at last the captain spoke with all the quietness of the journey in his voice : " Now , we are touching the sun . " Their eyes , thinking it , were melted gold.  | " Seven thousand degrees ! " Strange how a mechanical thermometer could sound excited , though it possessed only an emotionless steel voice . " What time is it ? " asked someone . Everyone had to smile . For now there was only the sun and the sun and the sun . It was every horizon , it was every direction . It burned the minutes , the seconds , the hourglasses , the clocks ; it burned all time and eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark world behind the lids , the retina , the hidden brain ; and it burned sleep and the sweet memories of sleep and cool nightfall . " Watch it ! " " Captain ! " Bretton , the first mate , fell flat to the winter deck . His protective suit whistled where , burst open , his warmness , his oxygen , and his life bloomed out in a frosted steam . " Quick ! " Inside Bretton 's plastic face-mask , milk crystals had already gathered in blind patterns . They bent to see . " A structural defect in his suit , Captain . Dead . " " Frozen . " They stared at that other thermometer which showed how winter lived in this snowing ship . One thousand degrees below zero . The captain gazed down upon the frosted statue and the twinkling crystals that iced over it as he watched . Irony of the coolest sort , he thought ; a man afraid of fire and killed by frost . The captain turned away . " No time . No time . Let him lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The dials jumped four thousand degrees . " Look . Will you look ? Look . " Their icicle was melting . The captain jerked his head to look at the ceiling.  |p246As  if a motion picture projector had jammed a single clear memory frame in his head , he found his mind focused ridiculously on a scene whipped out of childhood . Spring mornings as a boy he had leaned from his bedroom window into the snow-smelling air to see the sun sparkle the last icicle of winter . A dripping of white wine , the blood of cool but warming April fell from that clear crystal blade . Minute by minute , December 's weapon grew less dangerous . And then at last the icicle fell with the sound of a single chime to the graveled walk below . " Auxiliary pump 's broken , sir . Refrigeration . We 're losing our ice ! " A shower of warm rain shivered down upon them . The captain jerked his head right and left . " Can you see the trouble ? Christ , do n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed ; the captain bent in the warm rain , cursing , felt his hands run over the cold machine , felt them burrow and search , and while he worked he saw a future which was removed from them by the merest breath . He saw the skin peel from the rocket beehive , men , thus revealed , running , running , mouths shrieking , soundless . Space was a black mossed well where life drowned its roars and terrors . Scream a big scream , but space j snuffed it out before it was half up your throat . Men scurried , ants in a flaming matchbox ; the ship was dripping lava , gushing steam , nothing ! " Captain ? " The nightmare flicked away . " Here . " He worked in the soft warm rain that fell from the upper decks . He fumbled at the auxiliary pump . " Damn it ! " He jerked the feed line . When it came , it 'd be the quickest death in the history of dying . One moment , yelling ; a warm flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unheard , inp247space . Popped like strawberries in a furnace , while their thoughts lingered on the scorched air a long breath after their bodies were charred roast and fluorescent gas . " Damn ! " He stabbed the auxiliary pump with a screw driver . " Jesus ! " He shuddered . The complete annihilation of it . He clamped his eyes tight , teeth tight . God , he thought , we 're used to more leisurely dyings , measured in minutes and hours . Even twenty seconds now would be a slow death compared to this hungry idiot thing waiting to eat us ! " Captain , do we pull out or stay ? " " Get the Cup ready . Take over , finish this . Now ! " He turned and put his hand to the working mechanism of the huge Cup ; shoved his fingers into the robot Glove . A twitch of his hand here moved a gigantic hand , with gigantic metal fingers , from the bowels of the ship . Now , now , the great metal hand slid out holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron furnace , the bodiless body and the fleshless flesh of the sun . A million years ago , thought the captain , quickly , quickly , as he moved the hand and the Cup , a million years ago a naked man on a lonely northern trail saw lightning strike a tree . And while his clan fled , with bare hands he plucked a limb of fire , broiling the flesh of his fingers , to carry it , running in triumph , shielding it from the rain with his body , to his cave , where lie shrieked out a laugh and tossed it full on a mound of leaves and gave his people summer . And the tribe crept at last , trembling , near the fire , and they put out their flinching hands and felt the new season in their cave , this small yellow spot of changing weather , and they , too , at last , nervously , smiled . And the gift of fire was theirs . " Captain ! " It took all of four seconds for the huge hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are again , today , on another trail , he thought , reaching for a cup of precious gas and vacuum , a handfulp248of different fire with which to run back up cold space , lighting our way , and take to Earth a gift of fire that might burn forever . Why ? He knew the answer before the question . Because the atoms we work with our hands , on Earth , are pitiful ; the atomic bomb is pitiful and small and our knowledge is pitiful and small , and only the sun really knows what we want to know , and only the sun has the secret . And besides , it 's fun , it 's a chance , it 's a great thing coming here , playing tag , hitting and running . There is no reason , really , except the pride and vanity of little insectmen hoping to sting the lion and escape the maw . My God , we 'll say , we did it ! And here is our cup of energy , fire , vibration , call it what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail our + ships and light our libraries and tan our children and bake our daily breads and simmer the knowledge of our universe for us for a thousand years until it is well done . Here , from this cup , all good men of science and religion : drink ! Warm yourselves against the night of ignorance , the long snows of superstition , the cold winds of disbelief , and from the great fear of darkness in each man . So : we stretch out our hand with the beggar 's cup .. . " Ah . " The Cup dipped into the sun . It scooped up a bit of the flesh of God , the blood of the universe , the blazing thought , the blindingphilosophy that set out and mothered a galaxy , that idled and swept planets in their fields and summoned or laid to rest lives and livelihoods . " Now , slow , " whispered the captain . " What 'll happen when we pull it inside ? That extra heat now , at this time , Captain ? " " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Start it ! "  |p249The  pump leaped on . " Close the lid of the Cup and inside now , slow , slow . " The beautiful hand outside the ship trembled , a tremendous image of his own gesture , sank with oiled silence into the ship body . The Cup , lid shut , dripped yellow flowers and white stars , slid deep . The audio-thermometer screamed . The refrigerator systemkicked ; ammoniated fluids banged the walls like blood in the head of a shrieking idiot . He shut the outer air-lock door . " Now . " They waited . The ship 's pulse ran . The heart of the ship rushed , beat , rushed , the Cup of gold in it . The cold blood raced around about down through , around about down through . The captain exhaled slowly . The ice stopped dripping from the ceiling . It froze again . " Let 's get out of here . " The ship turned and ran . " Listen ! " The heart of the ship was slowing , slowing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirred , invisible . The thermometer voice chanted the change of seasons . They were all thinking now , together : Pull away and away from the fire and the flame , the heat and the melting , the yellow and the white . Go on out now to cool and dark . In twenty hours perhaps they might even dismantle some refrigerators , let winter die . Soon they would move in night so cold it might be necessary to use the ship 's new furnace , draw heat from the shielded fire they carried now like an unborn child . They were going home . They were going home and there was some little time , even as he tended to the body of Bretton lying in a bank of white winterp250snow , for the captain to remember a poem he had written many years before : Sometimes I see the sun a burning Tree , Its golden fruit swung bright in airless air , its apples wormed with man and gravity , Their worship breathing from them everywhere , As man sees Sun as burning Tree .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling many separate things . I feel sad , he thought , and I feel good , and I feel like a boy coming home from school with a handful of dandelions . " Well , " said the captain , sitting , eyes shut , sighing . " Well , where do we go now , eh , where are we going ? " He felt his men sitting or standing all about him , the terror dead in them , their breathing quiet . " When you 've gone a long , long way down to the sun and touched it and lingered and jumped around and streaked away from it , where are you going then ? When you go away from the heat and the noonday light and the laziness , where do you go ? " His men waited for him to say it out . They waited for him to gather all of the coolness and the whiteness and the welcome and refreshing climate of the word in his mind , and they saw him settle the word , like a bit of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's only one direction in space from here on out , " he said at last . They waited . They waited as the ship moved swiftly into cold darkness away from the light . " North , " murmmured the captain . " North . " And they all smiled , as if a wind had come up suddenly in the middle of a hot afternoon. **28;7005;TOOLONG . But then things like this are done by people with the specific ambition to do them . I did n't like the way he talked ; for instance , the boast that we were handsome men  --  it made us sound like studs . However , I could n't hope that he 'd have another failure ; he was n't that rich in heart that he could make good use of it . " Let 's see the girl 's picture . " He had it in his pants pocket . She seemed young enough , a big girl , with a pretty good face . I thought she was rather handsome , though not of an open or easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little too heavy maybe . " Her name was Charlotte Magnus . " Magnus ? Was n't it a Magnus truck that delivered coal to the Einhorns ? " " That 's her uncle , in the coal business . Four or five big yards . And her father owns propertfby the acre . Hotels . Also a few five-and-dime stores . It 'll be the coal business for me . That 's where I think the most dough is . I 'll ask for a yard as a wedding present . " " You have it all pretty well figured out . " " Sure . I have something figured out for you too . " " What , am I supposed to get married also ? " " In time , yes , we 'll fix you up . Meanwhile you have to help me out . I have to have some family . I 've been told they 're family-minded people . They would n't understand or like it , the way we are , and we have to make it look better . There 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement party . You do n't expect me to go downstate and fetch George here to show them , do you ? No , I have to have you . We need clothes . Do you have any ? " " They 're in hock . " " Get them out . " " And what am I going to use for money ? " " Do n't you have any at all ? I thought you were in some kind of book business here . " " Mama gets all the money I have to spare . " He said tightly , " All right , do n't be wise . I 'll take care of all that soon . I 'll raise the dough . " I wondered where his credit might still be good . Perhaps his buyer friend lent him some money . Anyway , I got a postal order from Simon a few days later , and when I redeemed the clothes he came to borrow one of my Evanston suits . Soon he said that he had met Charlotte Magnus . He believed she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster of a time when a multitude of objects can not be clear ; they 're too dense and there 's an island rain , North Sea lightlessness , the vein of the Thames . That darkness in which resolutionshave to be made  --  it is n't merely local ; it 's the same darkness that exists in the fiercest clearnesses of torrid Messina . And what about the coldness of the rain ? That does n't deheat foolishness in its residenceof the human face , nor take away deception nor change defects , but this rain is an emblem of the shared condition of all . It maybe means that what is needed to mitigate the foolishness or dissolve the deception is always superabundantly about and insistently offered to us  --  a black offer in Charing Cross ; a gray in Place Pereires where you see so many kinds and varieties of beings go to and fro in the liquid and fog ; a brown in the straight unity of Wabash Avenue . With the dark , the solvent is in this way offered until the time when one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are finished . The house where I was living on the South Side was a student house within range of the university chimes and chapel bell when the evenings were still , and it had a crowded medieval fullness , besides , of hosts inside the narrow walls , faces in every window , every inch occupied . I had some student book customers and even several friends here . In fact I really knew everybody through the circumstance that Owens , the old Welshman who operated the place , had me answering telephone calls and distributing the mail in the little varnished hole called the lobby . This I did in exchange for my rent . And as I sorted the letters I unavoidably read return addresses and postcards , and , signalingby bell to call people to the telephone , I had to hear their conversationssince there was no booth . Owens too listened in , he and his spinster sister who was housekeeper ; the door of their stale parlorp202was always open  --  the smell of the kitchen governed over all the other smells of the house  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every evening could see their after-supper state , their square pillars of walnut , the madnesses of starched lace , the insects ' - eye inspirationof cut-glass , the screwy detail of fern both fiddle-necked and expanded , the paintings of fruit , which were full of hardness against liberty , plus the wheels of blue dishes around the wainscoting . With such equipment making an arsenal of their views  --  I must n't forget the big fixtures of buffalo glass hanging on three chains  --  they demonstratedhow they were there to stay and endure . Their tenants were transient , hence the Owenses probably needed something like this to establish home for themselves , and it was made very heavy . Clem Tambow took to visiting me . His father the old politician had died , and Clem and his brother , now a tap dancer on the Loew 's circuit , had divided an insurance policy . Clem would n't say how much he had inherited , out of a queer personal niceness or privacy , or maybe from superstition . But he had registered at the university , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you think of the old man leaving me money ? " he said , laughing , shy of his big mouth and carious teeth  --  he still had the big clear whites of his eyes and his head furry at the back as when a boy ; and he went on confessing the trouble of his ugliness to me , being somber about the grief of his nose , but interrupting his complaints with enormous laughs , suddenly and swiftly moving his hand to save his cigar from falling . Now that he had money he wore a row of Perfecto Queens in his coat . " I did n't appreciate my old man enough . I was all-out for my mother . I mean out . I would be still , but now she 's just plain too old . Ca n't kid myself about it any more , especially since I 've read a few psychology books . " Speaking of psychology , he always laughed . He said , " I 'm only on campus because of the pussy . " And then , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I may as well harvest . I would n't get anywhere otherwise , with this fish mouth and my nose . Educated girls , you can appeal to their minds , and they do n't expect you to spend too much on them . " He could n't consider himself a student ; he was a sort of fee-paying visitor ; he played poker in the law-school basement and pool at the Reynold 's Club and went to a handbook on Fifty-third Street to bet on horses . If he attended a class he was apt to " haw-hawhaw " in the big lecture hall at Kent , the amphitheater , at any standard joke of the science , or from private fun , unpreventably.  | " But , " he would explain , " that dumbbell was trying to put over some behaviorist junk , that all thinking is in words and so it must take place partly in the throat , in the vocal cords  --  what he said was inhibited sub-vocalization . ' So they got curious as to what happened with mutes , and got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all the stuff was escaping through the fingers , because of course they talk with their hands . Then they poured plaster casts on their hands . Well , when the guy got this far I started laughing  --  haw-haw ! And he asked me to leave . " Clem said this with one of his convulsions of embarrassment and shyness which then was wiped out by further laughter . Haw-haw-haw ! Then a big flush of delight . Then gloom again , as he recalled his troubles , his having been shortweighed as to gifts by nature . I tried to tell him that he was wrong and that he did n't need to make up for anything . It was his ramming time , and his appearance was strongly virile in spite of exaggerations , such as his mustache , the gambler 's stripe of the $22.50 suits he bought on time  --  he had the money but he preferred to pay installments . He said , " Do n't be nice to me , Augie . You do n't have to . " Sometimes he took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly the same age . He sought middle-agedness . He had decided that he could appeal to women whose taste was for experience ; a little worn , somewhat bitter , debauched uncle . And that was how he tried to play it . " Well , what about you , Augie , what 's the matter with you ? " he said . " What are you slopping around here for ? You 've got more possibilitiesthan you know what to do with . The trouble with you is thatyou 're looking for a manager . Now you 're in cahoots with this Mexican . What are you postponing everything for ? " " What 's everything ? " " I do n't know . But you lie here in a wicker chair , taking it easy , holding a book on your chest , and letting time go by when there are a thousand things you could do . " Clem had a vast idea of what things there were to be had , which was quite natural when you consider how it wounded and stung him to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know , money , admiration , women made absolutely helpless before you by love . The goods of fortune . He was disturbed by these thousand things , and , sometimes , so was I. He insisted that I should be going somewhere , at least that I should be practicing how to go , that I should concentrate on how to be necessary , and not be backward but energetic , absolute , and so forth . And of course I had some restlessness to be taken upp204into something greater than myself . I could not shine the star of great individuality that , by absorbed stoking , became a sun of the world over a throng to whom it glitters  --  whom it does n't necessarily warm but only showers down a Plutarch radiance . Being necessary , yes , that would be fine and wonderful ; but being Phoebus 's boy ? I could n't even dream of it . I never tried to exceed my constitution . In any case , when someone like Clem urged me and praised me , I did n't listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't infallible , but it made mistakessuch as I could bear . Clem was n't fooling with me on this great topic , but it was n't his main purpose to talk to me when he came to the house . He was n't there to hop me up or tell me news about Jimmy Klein , who was already married , and the father of a child , and working in a department store ; or about his brother 's trying to get on Broadway big-time . He came because he was after a girl named Mimi Villars who lived in the house . Mimi was n't a student ; she waited on tables in a student hash-house on Ellis Avenue . I had noted her with appreciation , maybe the more fit to judge because I had no thought of making her myself . She was very fair and ruddy , of a push-faced tough beauty , long brows continued in very thin pencil slightly upward , like the lash of the euglena , away from their natural line toward tight blond ears that had to be looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a soul of wild appetite , nothing barred ; she 'd say anything , and had no idea of what could hinder her . Her hips were long and narrow , her bust was large , and she wore close-fitting skirts and sweaters and high heels that gave a tight arch of impatience to the muscles of her calves ; her step was small and pretty and her laughter violent , total , and critical . She did n't much remind me of Willa from the Symington , also a waitress . Willa , whom I preferred personally , this country girl  --  I think I could have been perfectly happy with Willa and lived all my life in a country town if the chance had ever presented itself . Or , anyhow , I sometimes tell myself that . Mimi came from Los Angeles . Her father had been an actor in the silent movies . She 'd speak of him when she wanted to say how she hated Englishmen . Originally she came to Chicago to study , but she was expelled from the university for going past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge . She was a natural for being bounced . You would n't doubt that she was capable of the offense , if it was one , and as for the penalty , it was a favorite subject of her ferocious humor . I knew that Clem did n't stand a chance with her . The cause of her strong color was not sheer health or self-excitement : love also con/tributed to it . By a coincidence her lover was one of the customers Padilla had passed on to me , a man named Hooker Frazer who was a graduate assistant in Political Science . He was hard to deal with , for he ordered rare and out-of-print books . Two volumes of Nietzsche 's Will to Power I had a hell of a time swiping , for they were in a closed case at the Economy Book Store ; I also got him Hegel 's Philosophy of Right , as well as the last volumes of Capital from the Communist bookshopon Division Street , Herzen 's Autobiography , and some de Tocqueville . He bargained keenly , just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man the university ought to have been pleased about , with his tall , free look of intelligence early crow-footed from the practice of consideration , a young Calhoun or statesman already , with clear blue spaces indicative of rigorous consistency and an untimelywrinkle , like the writing of a seismograph . He was not one of those tall men of whom you think that they must come in sections of different mechanical principle , but was not awkward although his posture was loose . The fact that he lived in Burton Court , so much like a new Christ Church or Magdalen , and in a don 's state , that learned bachelorhood , itself fetched me . It did n't Padilla , with his stiff nose of Gizeh 's mummy and livid eye-patches , his narrow vault of shoulders and back , and his hard , sharp step on the **28;7035;TOOLONG . Manny came from a high mountain slum and had a cultureless disposition . He did n't go in for the Old World much . But Hooker Frazer was Mimi Villars ' man , and , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired them , both made so well , she hard and spirited , editing her words for no one , and he so distinct-looking he might have been lineally direct from Cro-Magnon man  --  but of course with present-day differences , including the disorders . He had a temper that did n't go with the rest of him , with his composure and even toploftiness . His teeth were often set hard , and his straight nose ended in a nervous fancifulness that must have originated in character rather than inheritance . But even Padilla , who did n't like him much , said he was muy hombre , a considerable man . Padilla was , however , down on him for his condescension to us ; to me more than to him , for Frazer was aware that Padilla was a genius at mathematical physics . But he called us both " mister , " as though he were a West Pointer , and treated us like amusing thieves . As if he was n't a receiver of stolen goods himself . He 'd say , " Mr. March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expropriators a good copy of the Esprit des Lois ? The other day I noticed one at the Argus . " I 'd laugh out loud at his mixture of pompousness and revolutionist 's jargonp206and his amended Tennessee accent . At first he seemed to consider me an agreeable nitwit and joshed me about my color . " Anybody would say that you spent your days in the cow pasture , Mr. March , from your rosiness , instead of breathing the air of bookshops . " Later he was more grave with me and offered me old copies of Communist and Trotskyist papers and magazines  --  he had them in stacks , sheaves , and bundles in his room , in various languages ; he received all kinds of journals and bulletins . He even invited me once to hear him lecture , but that may have been because I was his cheap source of supply ; I extended him credit , and he wanted to stay on good terms with me . Padilla threw fits when he heard that I gave him books on the cuff ; I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , longfingeredfist ; he screamed at me , " Bobo ! " and " you gringo dummy ! " And I said I 'd stop Frazer 's credit at twenty-five dollars . It was a lie to calm him ; he was already into me for nearer to forty . " Shit ! I would n't give him a penny . This is just the way he shows he 's better than you , " Manny said . But I was n't affected . Probably I too much enjoyeddelivering a few books to Frazer for the chance of spending half an hour in the atmosphere of his rooms and hearing him talk . Often I stole two copies of what he ordered , from curiosity , to read one myself , and thus had some dull and difficult afternoons . I never blamed myself for throwing aside such things as did n't let themselves be read with fervor , for they left nothing with me anyhow , and I took my cue from Padilla not to vex myself about what did n't come easy . After all , I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things on . But I had to tell Clem that he would n't get anywhere with Mimi Villars . " Why , " he said , " because I 'm so homely ? I figure her for the kind that does n't care about looks . She 's a hot girl . " " Your looks have nothing to do with it . She has a man already . " " What , and you think she 'll never have another one ? That 's how much you know . " So he backed his belief about her stubbornly , and came to sit with me , washed and fresh-shaved , long black shoes gleaming , and acted with his depressed gallantry , practicing it even on me , lacking only laces and swords to be a follower of decayed Stuarts in exile  --  his heavy drama of boredom . Only his unlicked electric fur of boyish back-hair and the soft glossiness of his eye whites and his haw-haw ! told a differentstory about him . I was glad of his company . But of course I could n't tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I readp207postcards and could n't help listening to telephone conversations ; it was that Mimi did n't care about secrecy . She led a proclaimed life , and once she got talking she held back nothing . Frazer would occasionallysend her a card breaking a date , and she would go into a temper , flinging it away , and say to me furiously , tearing open the clasp of her purse , " Sell me a slug " ; and to him on the phone she 'd say , " You yellow bastard , ca n't you call me and tell me why you wo n't come ? Do n't give me any of that old crap about working on your thesis ! What were you doing on Fifty-seventh Street the other night with those fat goofs when you were supposed to be working on it ? Who are they ? One of them was an English fairy , I could spot him a mile away . Do n't tell me I do n't understand . I 'm tired of your bullshit , you preacher ! " In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I sprawled and listened in the rocker . And then Owens ' beefy wrist would come out to fetch the door and slam it . He did n't care what tenants did in their rooms , but he did n't like her swearing to reach his parlor  --  he was sitting in there on his leather , crunching like dry snow ; his main sounds were , at close range , breathing , and , at a distance , turning his weight . " You 'll never live to hear me beg for anything , " were Mimi 's last words to Frazer , and when she slammed phone and hook together with cruelty it was as a musician might shut the piano after he had finished storming chords of mightiest difficulty without a single flinch or error . To rip off a piece of lover 's temper was pleasure in her deepest vein of enjoyment . She said to me then , " If that bastard calls back , tell him I ran out of the house swearing . " However , she would be waiting for his next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have no interest in Clem , at least for the time being , was that lately Frazer had been phoning with regularity , and she took her time about descending when I buzzed her . He , knowing it was I that answered the phone , said , " Ca n't you get her to make it a little faster , Mr. March ? " To which I said , " I can try , but I 'm not King Canute , you know , " and let the big club of the receiver hang from the cord . " What do you want ? " were her first words when she laid her burning cigarette on the instrument box . " I ca n't talk to you . I 'm stymied . If you want to find out how I am you can come over in person and ask . " And then in her joyful , reckless way of welcoming her anger , " All right , if you do n't care , I do n't care either . No , I have n't come around yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry me . I would n't marry a manp208who does n't know what love is . You do n't want a wife , you want a looking glass . What ! What do you mean , money ! You still owe me forty-seven dollars . That 's okay . I do n't care what it was spent for . If I 'm up the stump I 'll take care of it myself . Sure you owe everybody . Do n't give me that kind of stuff . Tell it to your wife . She seems to swallow everything . " Frazer was not yet divorced from his first wife , from whom Mimi , in her version of it , had rescued him . " Do you remember a picture called The Island of Dr. Moreau ? This mad scientist made men and women out of animals ? And they called the laboratory The House of Pain ' ? Well , with his wife he was living like one of those animals , " she once told me , speaking of how she had first found him . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man like Hooker could live in it ; no matter what I think of his personality , he 's intelligent , he has ideas ; when he was a Communist he was chosen to go study at the Lenin Institute , where they train national leaders like Cachin and Mao ; he did n't make it because he was expelled over the German question . Well , in this flat there were chenille rugs in the toilet so you felt you were doing wrong , going in your shoes . A man ca n't do anything while putting up with that . Women really are no good , Augie , " she declared with her characteristic and favorite humorous rage . " They 're no fuckinggood . They want a man in the house . Just there , in the house . Sitting in his chair . They pretend to take what he thinks and says seriously . Is it about government ? Is it about astronomy ? So they play along and make believe they care about parties and stars . They baby men , and they do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the house . If the husband is a Socialist , she 's a Socialist , hotter than he , and if he changes into a Technocrat she beats him to it  --  she makes him think so . All she really cares about is to have a man in the house and does n't give a hoot in hell what she says she is . And it is n't even hypocritical , it 's deeper than that . It 's having the man . " With things like this  --  and it was one of many  --  Mimi tried to pierce you through . Sufficiently said , I suppose , the thing was true for her . She believed in words , in speaking , and if she convinced you , then she herself could believe what her inspiration told her . And when it came to speaking , she had borrowed some from Frazer  --  that private forensic method that did n't always seem quite right in personal conversation : he with his long knees spread and elbows resting on them , hands clasped , perfect earnestness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , the straight white middle part of his sandy hair . Mimi followed his manner as much as she might , and she had more knottedness inp209her and passion , and the speed you can get from narrow gauge and high compression . She was , as Einhorn had rightly said that I was , in opposition ; only she named names and wrongs , and was an attacker where I had other ways , temperamentally , and she did n't persuade me . I did n't believe she was right because emphatic . " Well , " she said , " if you do n't agree with me , why are you quiet ? Why do n't you say what you think instead of turning down what I say by grinning ? You try to look more simple than you are , and it is n't honest . But if you know better , come on and speak up . " " No , " I said , " I do n't know . But I do n't like low opinions , and when you speak them out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk will lead people on until they convince their minds of things they ca n't feel true . " She took this as a harder criticism of her than I had meant it to be , and answered me nastily with a kind of cat 's electric friction and meanness of her face . " Why , you 're a lousy bonehead ! If you do n't even know how to be indignant  --  why , Christ , even a cow gets indignant ! And what do you mean , low ! You want to have high opinions of garbage ? What do you want to become , a sewage plant ? Hell , I say no ! If a thing is bad it 's bad , and if you do n't hate it you kiss it on the sly . " She shot it off in my face that I was n't mad enough about abominationsor aware enough of them , did n't know how many graves were underneath my feet , was lacking in disgust , was n't hard enough against horrors or wrathful about swindles . The worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a loving exchange of bodies and the foundation of all the true things of life . The women to blame for this were far worse than whores . And I guess that she explodedagainst me in this conversation because I was n't enough of an enemy of such things but smiled at such ruining wives too for their female softnesses . I was too indulgent about them , about the beds that would be first stale and then poisonous because their manageresses ' thoughts were on the conquering power of chenille and dimity and the suffocation of light by curtains , and the bourgeois ambering of adventuringman in parlor upholstery . These things not appearing so threatening to me as they ought to appear , I was , on this topic anyhow , a fool to her , one who also could be stuck , leg-bent , in that white spiders ' secretion and paralyzed inside women 's edifices of safety . She had torn Frazer out of that . He was worth saving . And here I could see what a value she set on the intelligence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of effort and nobility , then she wished for them the commonplace death in the gas cloud of settled existence , office bondage , quiet-store-festering , unrecognized despair of marriage without hope , or the commonness of resentment that grows unknown boils in one 's heart or bulbs of snarling flowers . She had a high , absolute standard , and she preferred people to miss it from suffering , vice , being criminal or perverted , or of loony impulse . I learned about her when I knew her better that she was a thief too ; she stole her clothes from department stores , stole a good deal , since she liked to dress well , and had even been arrested but got off on suspended sentence . Her method was to put on layers of dresses in the fitting booths , also underpants and slips ; and the way she had gotten out of the rap was to convince the court psychiatrist that she had money and could pay but was afflicted with kleptomania . She was proud of this and urged me to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was lifting books . There was another thing of which she was not so proud . About a year before , late one night as she was passing an alley on Kimbark Avenue , a stickup man had tried to take her pocketbook , and she had kicked him in the groin , snatched the gun when he dropped it , and shot him through the thigh . It made her wretched to remember this , and when she talked about it her hands became nervous and worked inward at her waist  --  which was small : she drew notice to its smallness by wearing broad belts  --  and her color got rough enough to be a symptom of scarlatina . She tried to get into Bridewell Hospital to see him , and was n't allowed . " The poor guy , " she said , and this was remorse over her savage speed and rashness as well as pity for this boy , haunting the mouth of an alley with that toy of swift decisions . For the robbery money can shrink mighty small , and you can soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do precisely what you say is a thing of a differentorder . And a woman too . She did n't interpret this as cowardice of the assailant but as special mark of crude love appeal , that a citytutoredrough child struggled for his instinct and was less cared about , providentially speaking , than the animal in the woods who was at least in the keeping of nature . Well , she had to go to court and testify , to explain why she had shot him . She did n't , however , want to bring charges , and she tried to speak a piece to the judge and was prevented . So the boy was given five years for armed robbery , and now she sent him packages and letters . Not because she feared harm from him when he got out , but out of remorse . This time she was n't up the stump , as she spoke of it . Eventuallyp211she was able to give Frazer better news . But she made him wait for it . She wanted him to worry , or to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about himself . She was not easy toward him . She knew it was unequal , that she loved him more than he could her or anyone . But neither was love his calling , as it was hers . And she was very severe and exalted about this . She too could have lived in desert wilderness for the sake of it , and have eaten locusts . The thing I began to learn from her was of the utmost importance ; namely , that everyone sees to it his fate is shared . Or tries to see to it . You may say that I should have known this before . I should have , and in a way I did , or else Grandma Lausch or Einhorn or the Renlings would have had more success with me . But it was never so clear in anyone as in Mimi Villars , whose actual body was her recruiting place and who more conspicuously issued her own warrant , license , diploma , asserting what she was , and she had no usual place of legitimate activity , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but banked all on her clinching will , her hard reason , and her obstinate voice . I think she must have recognized  --  and how could it fail to give her sharp pain ?  --  the contradiction of harsh persuasion to such a love belief as hers . But the thick rind of world-organized resistance made that inevitable . Well , that too was a fate to be shared and another underlying bitterness . By the end of summer we were already close friends and under suspicion by Tambow of being more . But there was nothing to that except his envious although not grudging imagination , backed by such slight apparent proof as that she came into my room in her petticoat . This was only because we lived on the same floor . She went into Kayo Obermark 's the same way  --  we had the attic between the three of us ; it just was proximity ; even if provocation was never far away it came simply from unremitting practice , like that of the fiddler who has a rubber ball in the pocket of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is never far from , for him , the greatest thing , along the accidentals and slides of landscape and steel rail . No , she came to borrow a cigarette or to use the closet where she kept the overflow of her dresses . Or to talk . We now had something more to talk about , for by and by we found we had another connection . It was through that swarthy Sylvester for whom I used to pass out movie handbills and who had tried to make a Communist of Simon . He had never finished his degree at Armour Tech . He said it was from lack of dough and hinted also his political assignment elsewhere , but it was everybody 's thought that he hadp212washed out . Be that as it might , he was living in New York and working for the subway at a technical job . Under Forty-second Street . He seemed bound to have occupations in the darkness , and by now this had laid a peculiar coloring on him , his face darkened sallow and slack-cheeked and his eyes , injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin by the continual effort and wrinkling his eyes , probably , at the ruby and green cut buttons of his burrow office  --  there where he sat at a drawing board and copied blueprints and read pamphlets in his leisure time . He had been expelled , like Frazer , from the Communist party . On charges of Infantile Leftism and Trotskyist Deviationism  --  the terms were queer to me , and just as queer was his assuming that I understood them . He belonged to another party now , the Trotskyites , and was still a Bolshevik , and disclosed that he was never free from duty , never unassigned , never went anywhere without permission from party chiefs . Even returning to Chicago , ostensibly to visit his father , the old man called by Grandma " the Baker , " he had a mission , which was to contact Frazer . So I inferred that Frazer was being recruited to the new party . I happened to walk behind them on Fifty-seventh Street one day . Sylvester was toting a fat briefcaseand looking up at Frazer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent while Frazer was looking past and over him with aloof gravity and had his hands clasped at his back . I also saw Sylvester on the stairs of the rooming house , with Mimi . He was , or had been , Mimi 's brother-in-law , married in New York to her sister Annie , who had now left him and was getting a divorce . I recalled how his first wife threw stones at him when he tried to come through her father 's backyard to talk to her , and I even remembered the surroundings in which I had heard about this from him , the grim air of cold Milwaukee Avenue when we peddled razorblades and glasscutterswith Jimmy Klein . Sylvester wanted Mimi to plead with her sister for him . " Hell , " Mimi told me , as much for my private ear as any of her opinions were , " if I had known him before they were marriedI would have told Annie not to do it . He leaks misery all over . I wonder how she could stand two full years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine being in bed with him , and that mud face and those lips ? Why , he looks like the frog prince . I hope now she 'll get under the sheets with a young strong stevedore . " If somebody fell against Mimi 's lines she had no mercy , and as she listened to Sylvester she kept in mind her sister bolt upright in a huskier man 's clasp and struggling her arms with pleasure , and it made me for a minute dislike her for her cruelty that she held her eyes open forp213Sylvester so that he might look in and see this . What was to make it an acceptable joke was the supposition that he could n't see . No , he probablycould n't . It needs to be explained that in Mimi 's hard view all that you inheritedfrom the mixing peoples of the past and the chance of parents ' encountering like Texas cattle was your earthy material , which it was your own job to make into admirable flesh . In other words , applied to Sylvester , he was in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bad kiln . And also it was his fault that he could n't keep his wives and girls . " I hear his first one was a dizzy bitch . And Annie has something of a slut about her too . What makes them go for him at the start ? That really interests me , " said Mimi . And she supposed that they must take his little gloom for real devilishness and expect him to visit their places with prickles and fire , like a genuine demon ; when he failed to , turning out to be mere uncompleted mud , they threw stones at him , real or figurative . She was savage-minded , Mimi , and prized her savagery as proof that there was no monkey business about her ; she punished and took blows as the real thing . That humiliated , bandy-legged , weak-haired , and **27;7065;TOOLONG , however , the subterranean draftsman and comedy commissar of a Soviet-America-to-be , teaching himself the manner and even the winner 's smile and confidence , why , he was going to blast off the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh humanity . He tried to impress me with the command he had over Marxian coal and cotton , plenary dates , factional history , texts of Lenin and Plekhanov ; what he had really was the long-distance dreaminggaze of the eyes into the future and the pick of phrase , which he smiled and smelled like a perfume , heavy-lidded . He condescended to me and dutch-uncled me because he knew that I liked him and was n't aware how much I knew about him . Which I was bound to spare him . Anyway , his defects were n't as serious to me as they were to Mimi . With me he could be fully confident , and some of his charm could n't live except in the presence of confidence . " How 's tricks , kid ? " he said with a rejoicing smile  --  but darkness and bitterness could never wholly leave it any more  --  and while he gentled his palms on his doublebreastedjoint belly and chest . " What are you up to ? Getting by ? What are you here , a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This word , even jesting , he pronounced with veneration . " Well , a sort of student . " " Our boys , " he replied , more deeply smiling . " Anything but honestlabor . And how 's your brother Simon ? What 's he doing ? I thoughtp214I could recruit him once . He 'd have made a good revolutionary . Where are they going to come from if not from your kind of background ? But I guess I could n't make him see it . He 's very intelligent though . One day he 'll see it himself . " In the peculiar fate of people that makes them fat and rich , when this happens very swiftly there is the menace of the dreamy state that plunders their reality . Let 's say that anyway old age and death would come , so why should n't the passage be comfortable ? But this proposal does n't make a firm mind , in the strange area where things swim too fast . Against this trouble thought may be a remedy ; force of person is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , organizational deeds . So there are these various remedies and many more , older ones , but you do n't actually have full choice among all the varieties , especially those older ones of the invisible world . Most people make do with what they have , and labor in their given visible world , and this has its own stubborn merit . Not only did Simon make what he had do , but he went the limit . It astonished me how he took his objectives and did exactly what he had projected . It was well-nigh unfair to have called the turns so accurately and to do to people what he planned while he was still a stranger to them . Charlotte was in love with him . Not only that , but they were already married , and it was n't only he who had hastened and pushed the thing , but she too was in a hurry . Partly because he was too broke to court her long . He told her that , and she and her parents agreed they should n't waste time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the news out of the papers , and for the rest of the family there had to be an engagement and a wedding . So Charlotte and her mother had worked it out , and while Simon paid rent in a good bachelor 's club downtown he was actually living with the Magnusesin their huge old West Side flat . He came to see me after the one-day honeymoon which was all the secrecy of the marriage gave them time for . They had been in Wisconsin . Already he had more new attributes than I could keep track of , draped in comfortable flannel , owning a new lighter , and effects in his pockets he did n't yet have the hang of . He said , " ' The Magnuses have been wonderful to me . " There was a new gray Pontiac at the curb  --  he showed it to me from the window ; and he was learning the coal business at one of the Magnuses ' yards . " And what about your own yard ? Did n't you say  --  " " Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can runp215a place myself . It wo n't take long . No , it has n't been so hard , " he said further , understanding my unasked question . " They 'd rather have a poor young man . A poor young man gets up more steam and pressure . They were like that themselves , and they know . " Already he did n't look like such a poor young man in the high qualitygray flannel , and shoes with new stitching ; his shirt smelled of the store ; it had n't been to the laundry yet . " Get dressed , I 'm taking you to dinner there , " he said . When we were outside , walking down the path to the car , he took a stiff shot of breath and hawked , exactly as on the day I went with him to the La Salle Street Station where apparently I was too dumb to sell papers . Except that this time he had gloomy big rings round his eyes ; and we sat down in the car , which had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time I had seen him drive . He swung it round like a veteran , even somewhat recklessly . So I was taken into that hot interior of lamps and rugs , to the Magnuses ' . Everything was ungainly there , roomy and oversized . The very parrots painted on the lampshades were as big as Rhode Island Reds . The Magnuses too were big ; they had a Netherlandish breadth of bone . My sister-in-law was of that size also , and was aware or shy of it as indelicacy , giving me the touch of her hand as though it were a smaller one . She need n't have . It 's difficult when outsized people worry about their presentation , and women especially , who have secret dismay of grossness . She had remarkably handsome eyes , soft , with occasional lights of distaste though , shrewd , and expressing immense power of management ; but also they were warm . So was her bosom , which was abundant , and she had large hips . She was on her guard with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say to Simon the first time we were alone . She must have convinced herself that he had done her a great favor by marrying her , he was so obviously smart and good-looking , and at the same time she was swept with resentment lest she should n't be thought good enough or the money be too much remembered . The issue most alive was whether he would have marriedher without money . It was much too troubling not to be spoken of , so it was spoken of in a kind of fun and terrible persiflage . Simon did it with the kind of coarseness that has to be laughed at because to take it seriously would be murder  --  his saying , for instance , when the three of us were left alone in the parlor to become acquainted , " Nobody 's ever been laid better at any price . " It was so ambiguous and inside-out as to who had paid the price that it had to be taken as amusing , and she hurried and came down from a romantic , senti/mental position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joke of sincerity and deep underlying agreement , a more realistic sort of love . But leaning above him like a kind of flounced Pisan tower construction  --  she dressed with luxury and daring  --  keeping a hand on his hair , she had instants of great difficulty before me . She had difficulty only for a while , until she absorbed from Simon the attitude that I was a featherhead , affectionate but not long on good sense . She soon enough learned to deal with me . But it was painful until she found confidence , and I suppose that at the time she had n't recovered from the honeymoon , which , Simon had been frank to tell me , was awful . He did n't specify in which way , but he expressed enough to make it profoundly believable ; he had some notes in the end of the scale that I would rather not have heard played for the consents to death that rang in them , but I was forced to listen to all he had , struck right on the key and sounded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were the weirdest of their kind ever to be laughed at and spoken in that carpeted peace and brown-gravy velour . It was all supposed to pass for fun and bridegroom 's lustiness , energy , and play-wickedness , and it came through to me that he was being tortured by thought of suicide , stronger than a mere hint , but simultaneously he could dive to clasp his compensations , such as his pride in audaciousness and strength of nerve and body or the luxury he was coming into , and furthermore , a certain recklessness in demands : the sense of what he could do and what he could exact withoutcaring what anybody thought was much to him . Then the family came in , wondering what type of person I might be . I wondered at them no less . They were so big you thought what could prevent them from handling even Simon and me like children , though we were by no means midgety  --  Simon was nearly six feet tall and I only an inch shorter than he . It was their width that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting stout Simon did n't begin to approach them . They were substantial in their lives as in girth ; they made their old people respected  --  there was a grandmother there that evening  --  and they bought the best of everything , clothes , furniture , or machinery . Also they were grateful for entertainment and admired speed of wit , which they did n't have themselves , and dramatic selfpresentation , which Simon gave them . He more than pleased them and more than made a big hit . He went both deep and far into the place of star and sovereign . They had patriarchs and matriarchs but they had no prince before him . To make this of himself , the prince , he went through a metamorphosis . That was the next of my astonishments.  |p217Elsewhere  I 've said that he had always , even when silent , been noticeable . But he was n't silent any more , and his old reserve was gone to pieces ; he was boisterous , capricious , haughty , critical , arbitrary , mimicking and deviling , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but spinning in this dining room of stable and uprightwealth . I saw Grandma 's satire in him , across the plaited white bread and the sprigged fish and candles  --  yes , the old woman 's hardness of invention and travestying savagery , even certain Russian screams . I did n't know Simon had gotten so much from her . I could draw my mind back over some six or seven hundred Friday nights and see his uncommenting eyes follow a performance of the . old woman 's . And how deep that had sunk in , without even appearing to . At the shrieks he caused I nearly heard her comment of disdain , a disdain of which Simon was not all innocent either . He both borrowed from her and burlesqued her . His appearance was new in more than one way ; more was new than the shirt , or the jewel on his finger and minor gems in his cuffs , or even the fat , and the haggardness from unwanted thought that lit on him in instants between the turns of his performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was it . In a way he made them meet the expense of this too , as when he imitated his good queen mother-in-law 's accent . But it was just the opposite of offensive to her and to them all ; it was grand and uproarious . However , he was n't just their entertainer ; when he turned grave and stopped the vaudeville with a pair of somber eyes he got earnest silence for the speech he was going to make , and a full weight of respect . He spoke to me , but of course his words were in large part for them . " Angie , " he said , putting his arm around Charlotte  --  she laid her painted nails on his hand  --  " you can see how unlucky we were not to have this kind of close and loyal family . There is n't anything these peoplewo n't do for one another . We do n't even understand what that is because we never experienced it , we missed it all our lives . We had no luck . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if I were their own child . I never understood what a real family was till now , and you ought to know how grateful I am . They may seem a little slowwittedto you "  --  Mr. and Mrs. Magnus did n't quite get this , Simon 's tone being enough for them and the fine satisfaction they took in him , but Charlotte was seized with a laugh in the throat at this mischief interruptinghis seriousness  --  " but they have something you 'll have to learn to appreciate , and that 's their kindness and the way they stick by their own . " When he scrawled this on me , I had a fit of hate for the fat personp218he was becoming , and I wanted to say , " This is crummy , to boost them and tear down your own . What 's the matter with Mama or even Grandma ? " But then what he said of the Magnuses had its truth , you could n't miss it . I was a sucker for it too , family love . And though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that he could have been absolutely insincere and putting on . Finding yourself amongst warm faces , why , there 're many objections that recede , as when enemy women may kiss . Many common lies and hypocrisies are like that , just out of the harmony of the moment . And with Simon there was also a revulsionfrom his gnawing trouble and his need to get some breath on his Valley of Ezekiel slain . Therefore he was building up his causes for gratitude . And therefore , also , I answered nothing . As he had said this to me , however , they were watching and were suspicious because I did n't grab a piece of this love feast . I had consented to play his game , but I was n't fast enough to do everything . I had a sea of feeling of my own which I was straining under . And then I think all their unresolved suspicions about Simon came to gather on me . They seemed to expect me to clear myself  --  all , in their ruddiness and size , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting small , an old creature in black , wearing pious wig and amulets , who looked to have metaphysical judgmental powers . Well , they owned stores ; maybe they smelled a thief in me . Anyway , they looked at me so acutely that I could perceive myself with their eyes , just about , my sizable head and uncommitted smile , my untrained and anti-disciplinary hair . Instead of asking , " Who are they ? " about both Simon and me , they could demand of themselves , " Who is he ? " Indeed , who was I to be sharing their gold soup of supper light and putting their good spoons in my mouth ? Observing this difficulty , Simon quickly came up with a remedy , saying , " Augie is a good kid , he just does n't know his own mind yet . " They were glad to be reassured about me ; all they asked was that I should be regular , that I should speak up more , make a few jokes , laugh when all laughed . I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an obstacle to being like him , which was that I had n't yet grasped him in his new character . But I soon caught on a little and made myself more acceptable , even welcome , by joining in the fun and dancing in the parlor after dinner . The only nearly serious hitch , with Mr. Magnus , was that I did n't know how to play pinochle . How was it that a decently brought-up young fellow did n't know how ? Otherwisean indulgent easygoing character , Mr. Magnus was dissatisfied about this . Like Talleyrand making a tight mouth about the man whop219did n't play whist . Simon could play pinochle . ( Where had he learned ? Well , where , for that matter , had all his new accomplishments come from ? ) " Oh , Augie is a sort of studious type and he does n't go in for such things , " he said . This was n't good enough for Mr. Magnus , with the long gray threads of baldness on his robust head . " I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But he should play a friendly game . " I felt he was n't unjustified . " I 'll play if you teach me , " I said , which went a long way toward improving the situation and making me one of the house . I sat in a corner with some of the younger children to study pinochle . More relatives came ; the vast apartment filled . It was family customon Friday night , and , moreover , the word was out that Charlotte was engaged . People wanted to see Simon . He already knew most of them , the giant uncles and heavy-pelted aunts in their Siberian furs who came up from their Cadillacs and Packards : Uncle Charlie Magnus who owned the coal yards ; Uncle Artie who owned a big mattress factory ; Uncle Robby who was a commission merchant in South Water Street , ponderous , white , and caracul-haired  --  like Stiva Lausch  --  and with a hearing-aid plugged in . There were sons in uniform , from militaryacademy , and others with football letters , and daughters , and littlechildren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very familiar and even already overbearing to some . He had a natural hang of their wholesystem of fellowship and contempt  --  how not to be caught under any circumstances in a position where to be looked down on was unavoidable , so that you could read in a back , bearishly turned , that you were a schmuck . I have to say that Simon 's confidence was superb , and it was he who was getting them under , though he was deferential with a few of the women . Toward these , heartiness or brazening was n't indicated , but what was necessary was to prove that in addition to everything he was also a lover . I must say also that he had no embarrassment because of me ; he assumed my complicity and was teaching and leading me . So I followed him around , because there was nobody else for me to stand close to comfortably . It lacked white stockings and fans to resemble the Directorate  --  I 'm thinking of commoners suddenly in the palaces of power . But the Magnuses seemed less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world there was no one who had more than they of anything exceptmoney  --  a gap that could perhaps be closed . Over this tumultuousness and family heat , melding yells at the pinochle table , the racing of the kids , pitchers of cocoa and tea and masses of coffee cake carried in , political booming and the sharperp220neighing of women and all this grand vital discord , there was the supervision of Uncle Charlie standing , or rather rearing , beside his wigged mother in her black dress . If it strikes me as advisable to add " rearing " it is because of the tightness of his belly and the great weight supported by his feet , and possibly also because the old woman wore a collar of things in gold shaped like grizzly-teeth , and that reminds me of creatures . He was white , thick , and peevish , and had the kind of insolence that sometimes affects the eyes like snowblindness , making you think there 's something arctic about having a million bucks . At least an immigrantwho during the Depression was a millionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all respects ; I 'm taking him at a posed moment , during a family occasion , a niece to be married off and new kin to be added . Through Simon I had got to be a candidate too . if he worked out well then I might also be considered as a husband , for there was n't any lack of daughters to marry , some of them pretty and all with money . So far Simon had had nothing but successes . For several weeks he had been working under Uncle Charlie 's eye , first as weighmaster and cashier and then learning to buy , meeting brokers and salesmen and learning about freight rates and the different coal fields . Uncle Charlie certified that he was fehig , or apt , a naturally good businesshead , and all were very pleased . Simon was already looking for a yard of his own , hoping to find one with an overhead track that would reduce unloading costs . In short , Uncle Charlie was extremely indulgent with him as an up  --  .. and-comer , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the simple cordial obscenities and hand on the shoulder ; he wagged his head near Simon 's face and opened up all bounties . His humor made everybody laugh with pleasure . Nobody thought to remonstrate about children and young girls when Uncle Charlie said , " Sonofabitch , you 're fo-kay , my boy , fo-kay . You got the goods . I think you can put it down between the sheets too , eh ? " because this was just his usual manner of speaking . " What do you think ? " said Simon . " Leave it to me . " " Yes , I think . I leave it to you . You think I 'm goin ' to take it myself ? Would n't be fun for Charlotte . Look how she 's built . Nothing was left out . She has to have a young husk . " Here I came in for my share of the notice . Kelly Weintraub , one of the distant cousins by marriage and a trucker who worked for Uncle Robby , said , " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . Your daughter Lucy the worst . You got no shame , kid ? In this family the girls ca n't hardly wait . "  |p221There  were shrieks about this . Through them Lucy Magnus continued to smile at me though her color deeply changed . She was slighter than most of her family ; she was n't shy to make a declaration of honest sensuality under the scrutiny of the whole clan . None of the Magnuses took the trouble to conceal such things ; it was n't necessary . The young ones could tell their parents exactly what they wanted , which I found admirable . I could look at Lucy with pleasure too . She was plain but had a healthy face , very clear skin , and pretty breasts that she swung where she pleased . Only her nose might have been finer ; it was a little broad , as was her mouth , but her black eyes were strong and declarative , and her hair black and delicate . It made me think of her maiden hair and there were suggestions I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not husbandly thoughts . I had no special mind to get married . I saw Simon 's difficulties too clearly for that . " Come here , " said her father to me , and I had to stand close inspection . " What do you do ? " he said , winking with the full snowblindness . Simon answered for me , " He 's in the book business . Until he saves enough to go back to the university and finish his degree . " " Shut up ! " he said . " C  --  sucker ! I asked him , not you , budinski ! What do you do ? " I said , " I 'm in the book business , as Simon told you . " I thought the old man must be able to pierce by strength of suspicion my crookery , all the oddity of Owens ' house and my friends there . What a book business could signify to him but starving Pentateuch peddlers with beards full of Polish lice and feet wrapped in sacking , I could n't fathom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray hair . So what are you studying for , a lawyer ? Fo-kay ! I guess we got to have them , the crooks . My sons do n't go to school . My daughters go , so long it keeps them out of trouble . " " Augie was thinking of going to law school , " Simon said to Lucy 's mother . " Yes , that 's right , " I too said . " Fine , fine , fine , fine , " said Uncle Charlie , my hearing done and his face of thick white hide turned in dismissal from us all ; he threatened with his intensest care his daughter Lucy , who answered him with one of her smiles . I saw that she promised him obedience and he promised back the satisfaction of all legitimate needs as long as she obeyed him . There was another special glance on me. that of my sister-in-law Charlotte , with her investigative , warm , and to some extent despairing eyes . I do n't doubt that she already knew some displeasing things aboutp222Simon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . I presume she was thinking what risks her cousin Lucy ran with me . Meanwhile Kelly Weintraub was saying , " He has a pair of bedroom eyes , Augie . " But I was the only one of the principals to hear and I took a good look at him to see how much harm he really meant me and to what extent he was kidding , the handsome teameo , slick-haired , with certainly horny eyes of his own and a suggestive pad of a chin . " I know you guys , " he said to me . Then I recognized him , not greatly different , really , from what he had been in the schoolyard , in his sweaters . " You had a little brother , George . " " We still have him . He 's not little any more , " I said . " He 's big and he 's living downstate . " " Where , in Manteno ? " " No , it 's in another town , a little place down near Pinckneyville . You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it myself . Simon was the only one of us who had ever gone down there , the Renlings having been unable at that time to spare me . " No , I do n't . But I remember George , " he said . " I remember you too , skitching rides on the ice wagons . " I shrugged , smiling . It was foolish of him to be suggesting a menace . He thought he could put a stick in Simon 's spokes ; Simon was way ahead of him . " Of course Charlotte knows , " said Simon when I told him about Kelly Weintraub . " Why should we make a secret of it ? She even wants to put George into a private institution . Do n't worry , nobody pays any attention to this guy . He does n't count around here . Anyhow , I recognized him first and got the jump on him . Leave it to me , I have them all eating out of my hand . " He added , " You 'll be doing the same if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first impression . " I quickly learned what power he really had with them . For he had absolutely meant it when he said he had plans for me , and he came for me several times a week to take me on his rounds . We had lunch with uncles and cousins in the rich businessmen 's restaurants and clubs , fancy steakhouses . Simon was hard with them and did n't yield ground whether it was a joke or an argument that came up , while in an undertonehe gave me the lowdown on them , contemptuously . I saw him developing some terrible abilities in quarrelsomeness ; he differed with all their opinions no matter on what subject . It might be about tailors , or entertainers , or heavyweight fighters , or politics  --  things on which he informed himself as he went along . He was impatient even in his jokes ; he made waiters fear him , sending dishes back to the kitchen ,  |p223but  then he gave large tips also . He seemed to have no regard for money  --  he always carried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handled wallet and the bills , he convinced me that he knew what he was doing . He said to me , " With these people you 've got to spend . If they see you cautious with a buck , you lose your standing with them . And I have to stand in good . They know everybody , and I 'm going out for myself soon and I need them . Just these bull-session lunches and going to the Chez Paree and the Glass Derby , proving I can keep up their speed , you see , that 's the first thing . They 're not going to deal with anybodythat 's not one of them . Now you understand why a slob like Kelly Weintraub does n't count . He ca n't afford to eat lunch in joints like these , he ca n't take a check at the Chez Paree without everybody being uncomfortable and reckoning he ca n't afford it , because they know exactlywhat he 's pulling down a week . You see , he 's a negligible factor and nobody will listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with dangerous promise . I knew he kept a file of accounts to settle . Did Cissy and Five Properties have a folder in it to themselves ? I thought they must . " Ah ! " he said . " Come downtown with me . Let 's get our hair cut . " We drove to the Palmer House and went below into the big radiance of the barbershop . Simon would have let his fine English coat fall to the ground if the Negro attendant had n't run in time to gather it in his arms . We sat before the huge mirrors in those episcopal machines , the big chairs , and were groomed and shampooed . Simon had himself steamed and singed , manicured , had everything lavished on himself , and not simply urged me but forced me to do as he did . He wanted to try all they knew how to do . It was getting so that I had to undergo an examination of almost brass-hat severity when I appeared before him . My heels must not be turned over by so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to strike my shoes right , he supplied me with ties , taking mine away and leaving a dozen of his own choice on the rack . He yelled and bullied if he thought I did n't wear my clothes exactly as he thought I should . And these were things I had lost interest in since Evanston . I had to expect ridicule from Mimi for having polished nails . I let it be done . I did n't consider my fingers much . It was probably an asset to me as a book thief . Looking at my hands and at my ties , who would suspect me ? For I had n't , of course , stopped stealing . I did n't any longer have to support Mama ; Simon took care of that . But while he paid for me wherever we went , it was still expensive to go with him . Occasionally there werep224tips or drinks or cigars or corsages for Charlotte that slipped his mind , and I had larger cleaning and laundry bills than ever before . Once in a while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our friends on Lake Park Avenue . And besides , I was trying to get together the university entrance fee . Shrewdly , Simon gave me little money ; mostly he gave me things . He wanted me to learn to have expensive needs , and the desire for dough would come of itself . Then if I were to begin to ask him for more , he could hook me . From the barbershop we 'd go to Field 's to buy him a dozen or so shirts , imported Italian underclothes or slacks or shoes , all things of which he already had a surplus ; he showed me drawers , closets , shelves full , and still kept buying . Some part of this was due to his having been on the wrong side of the counter , or the servile back on the shoefittingstool , and in part this was his way of tempting me . But also I knew that in the barbershop and on the shopping trips he was aiming to refresh himself ; he slept badly and was looking flabby and ill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked himself in the toilet and cried . After that day he would n't come upstairs ; he honked his horn for me in the street . He said , " I ca n't stand the joint you live in ; they do n't keep it clean . Are you sure they do n't have bed animals ? And the can is filthy . I do n't see how you can go into it . " Soon he took to saying this with the same inspection glare he had for my appearance . " When are you going to move out of this rat nest ! Jesus , it 's the sort of place plagues and epidemics start in ! " Eventually he stopped calling for me . He 'd phone when he wanted me ; sometimes he 'd send wires . At first , however , he wanted me with him constantly . So , then , we were in the gleaming lanes and warm indoor puffing of the department store , but after when he started back to the West Side , wearing one of his new ties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , it seemed , and , pressing on the gas pedal , he must have seen himself speeding across the last boundary of his strength . But just as the car , squeeling around corners , righted itself , he too kept balance . However , it was evident that his feelings were suicidal from the way he drove and the way he leaped forward in arguments , hit him who would ; he kept a tire tool under the driver 's seat for his weapon in traffic arguments , and he cursed everybody in the street , running through lights and scattering pedestrians . The truth back of all this was that he had his pockets full of money as an advance on his promised ability to make a rich man of himself and now had to deliver . In spring he leased a yard , at the end of the coal season . It had no overhead track , only a long spur of siding , and the first rains made ap225marsh of the whole place . It had to be drained . The first coal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the scale needed expensiverepairs . His first few thousand dollars ran out and he had to ask for more ; he had a credit to establish with the brokers , and it was important that he meet his bills on time . Uncle Charlie made that easier . Nevertheless , there was Uncle Charlie himself to satisfy . There was , besides , a substantial wage to pay his yard manager and weighmaster , Happy Kellerman , whom he had lured away from a large old West Side company . He 'd have hired me instead ( at perhaps a littleless ) if I 'd been able to handle the job , and he insisted on my coming to learn the ropes from Happy , so that presently I was spending a good amount of time at the office ; for when he grabbed my wrist and told me , almost drunkenly , with the grime and chapping of the mouth that comes of long nervous talking , saying low , huskily , viciously , " There 's got to be somebody here I can trust . Got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not much that Happy could be dishonest about . He was a beer saufer , droopy , small , a humorist , wry , drawn , weak , his tone nosy and quinchy , his pants in creases under his paunch ; his nose curved up and presented offended and timorous nostrils , and he had round , disingenuous eyes in which he showed he was strongly defended . He was a do listo , a carnival type , a whorehouse visitor . His style was that of a hoofer in the lowest circuit , doing a little cane-swinging and heel-and-toe routine , singing , " I went to school with Maggie Murphy , " and telling smokehouse stories while the goofy audience waited for the naked star to come out and begin the grinds . He had a repertory of harmless little jokes , dog yipes , mock farts ; his best prank was to come up behind and seize you by the leg with a Pekinese snarl . By Simon 's wish I had to spend afternoons with him studying the business . Especially since I had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to turn down . Often I relieved Happy at lunch . He hopped a car down to HalstedStreet because he detested walking . Coming back at two , he would shuffle off at the stop by the driveway , carrying his coat and straw skimmer , vest stuffed with cigarettes , pencils , and cards  --  he had his own business card : " Happy Kellerman representing March 's Coal and Coke " : a rooster chasing a frantic hen , with the line beneath , " I mean business . " Walking in , he tested the beam of the scale , put the Times in the stove , walked around the yard , and then , these being the dog days , great heat , we would sit where the coolness rose from the concrete pit of the scale . The office had the appearance of a squatter 's shack or end house of a Western street . Over the way was a stockyardsp226siding , dusty animals bawling in the waiting cars , putting red muzzles to the slats ; truck wheels sucked through the melting tar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdocks died on the stalk . There were rats in a corner of the yard who did not stir or go away for anyone , whole families , nursing , creeping , feeding there . I had never seen them so domestic , going whither they list , walking by your feet without fear . Simon bought a pistol  --  " We need one anyhow , " he said  --  and shot at them , but they only scattered to come back . They did n't even bother to dig holes , only scooped out shallow nesting places . There were a few sales . Happy entered them on the big yellow sheets ; an elegant penman , boastful of his hand , he sat up on the high stool in his flat straw , feathering out the wide and thin strokes . This oldfashionedbookkeeping desk of a scratched yellow brought the writer 's face to a tiny square of window over the scale , and at times I saw Simon there , making out checks in the wide triple checkbook . Writing checks had fascinated him at first . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks for the satisfaction of paying one of my debts with his signature . There was no such satisfaction now , as the figures of the balance took fewer spaces , and he thought of his last audaciousness in money when he had tried to grab a fast buck in order to marry Cissy . This time he believed his whole life was staked . He had not merely been shooting his mouth off the day he had come to tell me he was getting married about how earnest he was over money ; it was now proved by the mental wounds of his face , the death of its color , and the near-insanity of his behavior . The misery of his look at this black Sargassoof a yard in its summer stagnation and stifling would sometimes make my blood crawl in me with horror . If I took so much time from my own enterprises of theft and reading to walk around this yard with him , hands in pockets , it would n't be enough to say it was from solicitude , it was downright fright . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ominous to me . And that he complained of seething in his head , saying , " My brains are going to boil out of my ears . " I had to keep him from clouting Happy once when he misjudged the moment to grab Simon 's leg with his yiping-dog prank . It was a near thing . And just a while ago he had been laughing with Happy at his stories of being a shill during the Florida land boom ; and about his love affair with a Turkish woman who would n't let him out of the house ; and his account of his first dose , when he said , " It was like getting into a can of hot angleworms . " This change from great laughter to savagery made Happy ready to quit , his big , skillful , poachy eyes morose , warn/ing , filling up , as I tried to iron things out . For it was up to me to bring back the peace . " I never took no shit in bigger concerns , " said Happy from the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . I knew that Simon had a strongly beating heart by the way his head hung downward , his mouth open on that still unmended front tooth , and that his craving which he would of necessity fight off was to take Happy by the seat of the pants and throw him into the street . At last Simon said , " Okay , I want to say I 'm sorry . I 'm kind of nervous today . You ought to realize , Happy . . . " Thought of the Magnuses had overcome him , and a horror of so far forgetting that he was a young man in business and Happy merely a drip as to get himself towering about this nonsense . Simon 's patience and swallowing were worse to me than his wrath or flamboyance  --  that shabby compulsory physical patience . Another such hard thing was his speaking low and with an air of difficult endurance to Charlotte on the telephone and answering her questions with subdued repetitiousness , near the surrenderpoint . " Well , " he said to Happy and me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go see some of the dealers ? Try to drum up some trade . Here 's five bucks for beer money . I 'll stay here with Coxie and try to get that back fence in shape . They 'll steal us blind of we do n't do something about it . " Cox was the handyman , an old wino in a slap-happy painter 's cap that looked like an Italian officer 's lid . He sent him scouting along the fence of the Westinghouse plant for old planks . Coxie worked for hamburgers and a bottle of California K. Arakelian 's sherry or of yocky-dock . He was watchman too , and slept on rags back of the green lattice before the seldom used front door . Off he limped  --  he carried a bullet , he claimed , from San Juan Hill  --  by the mile-long big meshed fence of the corporation in which such needs as fences were met by sub-officers ' inviting contractors ' bids and a tight steel net permitted all to look in at the vast remote shimmer , the brick steeples , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smeared summer sky and gaudiness . I went with Happy , who drove . His fear in the Bohunk streets was that he would run over a kid and a crowd would tear him to pieces in its rage . " If it 's their kids anything happens to , then look out , even if it 's not your fault , the way they chase around . " So he was always somewhat in this terror and would n't let me have the wheel , who did n't dread this enough to be vigilant . We took the coal-and-ice dealers into taverns and drank beer and swapped talk , in those sleepy and dark with heat joints where the very flies crept rather than flew , seemingp228doped by the urinal camphors and malt sourness , and from the heated emptiness and woodblock-knocking of the baseball broadcast that gave only more constriction to the unlocatable , undiagnosed wrong . If you thought toward something outside , it might be Padilla theorizing on the size of the universe ; his scientific interest kept the subject from being grim . But in such places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to star , you could pray the non-human universe was not entered from here , and this was no sack-end of it that happened to touch Cook County and Northern Illinois . Such a consideration never would trouble Simon . Whatever the place was , he would make it pay off , the only relation with it that concerned him ; it had dollars , as the rock water , as the waste-looking mountain is made to spit its oil or iron , where otherwise human beings would have no wish to go , the barrens , the Newfoundlands , the scaly earths and the Antarctic snow blackened with the smoke of fuel tapped in Texas or Persia . Hrapek , Drodz , Matuczynski these dealers were called ; we found them in their sheds , by the church , by the funeral home , or on a moving job . They sold coal by the ton and by the bag ; they had stake trucks or dump trucks ; they had to be convinced and sold , entertained , offered special deals , flattered , bantered , told secrets about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical information about BTU 's and ash percentages . Happy was crafty with them , an excellent dealer 's man with talents comparable to those of a ship 's chandler ; he drank as much piva as they did , glass for glass , and he got results . Enticed by undercut prices and the pick of the coal , they began to come in . Also , Simon ran some sales , just to get things moving . He had me pass out handbills in Chinatown , advertising coke which the laundry Chinese favored above other fuel , and slowly he accumulated customers . He also covered the city and hit his new relatives for orders ; Charlie Magnus threw business his way , and little by little things began to stir . Simon was wised up as to how to do things politically  --  to be in a position to bid on municipal business  --  and he saw wardheelers and was kissing-cousins with the police ; he took up with lieutenants and captains , with lawyers , with real-estate men , with gamblers and bookies , the important ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the chauffeurs ' and hikers ' strike he had squad ears to protect his two trucks from strikers who were dumping coal in the streets . I had to wait for his calls in the police station to tell the cops when a load was setting out from the yard , my first lawfulp229sitting in such a place , moving from dark to lighter inside the great social protoplasm . But the dark of this West Side station ! It was very dark . It was spoiled , diseased , sore and running . And as the mis-minted and wrong-struck figures and faces stooped , shambled , strode , gazed , dreaded , surrendered , did n't care  --  unfailing , the surplus and superabundanceof human material  --  you wondered that all was stuff that was born human and shaped human , and over the indiscriminateness and lack of choice . And do n't forget the dirt-hardness , the dough fats and raw meats , of those on the official side . And this was n't even the big Newgate of headquarters downtown but merely a neighborhood tributary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to be , Simon was on very good terms with Lieutenant Nuzzo , than whom few were more smooth and regular-looking . I am not sure how the lieutenantmanaged . A cop , who even in the friendliness of a joke must take you by the shoulder as if in an arrest , with hands whose only practice is to be iron . In some manner Lieutenant Nuzzo had stayed a Valentino , even though his flesh was heavy and his face kept imprints long , like sleep creasings and the marks of fingers . We had dates to go to the Chez Paree with him  --  a party of five until I began to take Lucy Magnus , making it six  --  and had spaghetti and chicken livers with sparkling burgundy or champagne ; the lieutenant , he looked around like a master of ceremonies on a visit from a much better night club . His wife seemed like a woman on probation ; as everybody is , after a fashion , with a police lieutenant . Even a wife . He was an Italian , he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them do . Authority must have death behind it . To cut off Masaniello 's head ; to hang great admirals themselves , as Lord Nelson did in Naples harbor . This I believe was how to read the lieutenant 's smooth face while he sat in the enjoyable noise of the Chez Paree , viewing Veloz and Yolandaor the near-naked chicks who did n't altogether know what they were doing but suggested the motions of busy people bringing their private pleasures to a head . Anyway , while this night club remained tops , Simon and Charlotte were great ones for it , as much , shrewdly , for the lowdown to be gotten there and contacts and public life and business , as to have their pictures taken by flashbulbs , laughing and in shenanigan embraces with paper caps and streamers , an important face at their table , a singer in strapless gown appealing with her lifted chin and fine teeth , or the chairman of a board finishing a drink . Simon grasped very soon the importance for business of such close contact . Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first two days did not smile ? He could n't deal with a man who would n't yield to charm or trade on the basis of love . There had to be sport and amiability to temper decisions that could not all be pleasant , and at least the flash of personality helped . This was somethingSimon well understood , how to be liked , and how to reach an accord on the basis of secret thoughts with people similarly placed . But I 'm still in the middle of the summer with him , at the worst of his trouble when he was envenomed with the fear that he 'd go bankrupt , and he had to confess to himself , I 'm sure , that he was really afraid of the Magnuses , and terrified by what he had taken on himself . So I spent most of these months with him . I wo n't say we were never closer  --  he kept his ultimate thoughts stubbornly to himself  --  but we were never more together . From the fresh of morning to the grime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and made all his stops  --  downtown , the union hall , the bank , the South Water market office Charlotte was managing for her Uncle Robby , the kitchen at Magnuses ' where we stopped to get sandwiches from the black cook , or the back room where they had put the marriage bed  --  the marriage still the secret of the immediate family . Here the door opened on what supported the weight of this heaped -- up life . The room had been refurnishedfor him and Charlotte with silk-shaded reading lamps , bedsidefleeces , drapes against the alley view and its barbarity  --  as in a palazzo against the smell of the canals  --  a satin cover on the bed , and auxiliary pillows on the roll of the bolster . To save steps to the dresser Simon walked on the bed . He changed clothes , letting things lie where they were dropped or flung , kicking his shoes into the corner and drying the sweat from his naked body with an undershirt . There were days when he changed three times , or four , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up from his office chair heavy after hours of silence , saying , " Let 's get out of here . " Instead of going home to change , sometimes he 'd drive to the lake . We 'd go swimming at the North Avenue point the late Commissioner had loved . In whose mouth , as he floated by , I used to place cigarettes . The loose spread of Simon 's legs as he plunged and the embracing awkwardness of his arms to the water gave me the worry that he threw himself in with a thought of never coming back to the surface alive , as if he went to take a blind taste of the benefits of staying down . He came up haggard and with a slack gasp of his mouth and rough blood in his face . I knew it made a strong appeal to him to go down and not come up again . Even if he did n't make a display of this half-a-desirep231and swam up and down , sullen , with flattened coarse hair , making master passes at the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd and carried black spools in its horizon , the cool paving of one of the imaginary series of worlds , clear into the flaming ether . My brother down there , as if Alexander in the harmful Cydnus whose cold made him sick when he leaped in after battle , I stood in striped trunks with toes bent over the wood of a pile , ready to jump after if need be . I did n't go in when he did . He came up the ladder shivering , the big flies bit nastily , the hullabaloo waterside carnival turned your head . I 'd help him dry ; he 'd lie down on the stone like a sick man . But when he 'd warm and get his comfort back , he 'd start to make bullish approaches to women and girls , his eyes big and red , and as if someone who bent over to choose a plum from her lunch bag was makingthe offer of a Pasiphae . And then he 'd start to blare like brass and he 'd hit me on the arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that broad ! " forgetting that he was not only married but also engaged  --  the engagement had taken place before the eyes of the world , in a receptionat a hotel . He did n't think of that . Instead he thought of the powerfulpossibility in a new Pontiac standing near Lincoln Park , and the money he had ; also the things to be done in one street , building , room that need have no bearing on what came later in the day elsewhere . So he got violent and lustful , with step and sidle , and protrusion of his head that made a kind of wall of his neck , charged and hard like that of a fighter who has been hit but not damaged , only roused . There was n't anything in his new class or of his speed at the North Avenue beach ( called a beach , it was merely a stone slab waterfront ) ; the place was rough and hard , the young fellows were tough and the girls battlesome , factory hands , salesgirls , with some Clark Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sorting or choosing words . " You look good to me . You interested ? " Direct , without game , not even nickel phrases of circumlocution . That very fact maybe made it no indecency ; instead it created awe and fear , that brute charge that gave the veins too much to bear and seemed to endanger his underjaw by crowding , his eyeballs darkening with currentsof heat violet and darker , to near black . The girls were not always frightened of him ; he had a smell of power , he was handsome , and I do n't know what floors his bare feet left in shade-drawn hot rooms . Only a year ago he would not have given a second glance at such bims . Now , where he went , he had information unavailable to me , but he had to have advantages and prerogatives , I reckon , in exchange for sacrifices . Yes , principals like that practice an anger not everyone isp232allowed . They come playing the god like bloody Commodus before the Senate , or run with jockeys and wrestlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their downfall is beginning to gather thought to thought about them , like loops on the knitting needle . That was how it was with Simon , as I had had the chance to see before , when he put on a lady 's hat at the Chez Paree and pranced around , or when he had brought me along to a bachelor 's stag where two naked acrobatic girls did stunts with false tools . From circus games to private dissoluteness , then , and only doing as many others did  --  except that from the force of his personality he was prominent and played a leading part . " And you ? Do you ? " said Simon to me . " What a question ! Who 's that babe who lives on your floor ? Is that why you do n't want to move ? Mimi , is n't that her name ? She looks like an easy broad . " I denied it , and he did n't believe me . On her side Mimi was interested in Simon . " What 's eating him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying in the can , was n't it ? What 's he want to be such a sharp dresser for ? What 's the matter ? He has a woman on his neck , huh ? " She was prepared to approve of him despite the satire , noting something extravagant and outlaw about him that she approved of . He was n't all brashness , however , and headlong despair , Simon . No , he was also making a prize showing . It was summer , and slow , and naturally he was losing money . Charlotte , an excellent businesswoman , and highly important as backer , counselor , consultant , gave him just what united them closer than common conjugality . Though he fought with her and even from the very first roared and cursed her , saying astonishing things , she held on steady . A close watcher could see her recoil and then come back to the great , the all-important thing , which was that he was one of those anointed to be rich and mighty . His very outrageousness when he yelled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a nervous laugh that recalled him to his better judgmentand reminded him that such things were supposed to come out as comedy . Whereat he almost never failed to add the laughter drop of the entertainer , even while the glare of his eyes might remain savage . And he was made to do that even when feelings on both sides had burst out so close to injury that it was too much to try to kid them back into something that could pass for affectionate roughness . But Charlotte 's first aim and the reason for her striving was to make the union serious by constructing a fortune on it . She said to me , " Simon has real business ability . This stuff now "  --  he was already , at the time she spoke , makingp233money  --  " is just nothing . " When she said this , sometimes , it was in the territory of seriousness where distinctions of sex do not exist ; the power invoked is too great for that . It is of neither man nor woman . As when Macbeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " A call so hard , to what is so hard , that it makes the soul neuter . Neither her ladies ' trimming and gewgawing , the detail of her tailored person , nor the decorating of the fiat when they furnished one , nor his way of carrying on was of real consequence . But in what related to the bank , the stock , the taxes , head approached to head discussing these , the great clear and critical calculations and confidences made in the key to which real dominion was set , that was what wedlock really rested on . Even though she was continually singing and whistling songsto herself like " My Blue Heaven " and " A Faded Summer 's Love , " doing her nails , revising her hair , she did n't live in these vanities . Which indeed were hopeless . She gave them all their due , and more . Highheels , sheer hose , beautiful suits , hats , earrings , feathers , and thecolors of pancake maquillage , plus electrolysis , sweet-sweats , and the hidden pinnings where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect , she had a lot of dignity , she could be monumentallyhandsome . But her ultimate disbelief in this was unmistakable in the real mouth , unconforming to the painted one , impatient , discount-ingless important things . She would n't have chosen a young man to marry from the pictures on the sheet music of her piano any more than she 'd have chosen a schoolboy ; she bore her ambition tight and was prepared to see , without being moved in her purpose , any limits of coarseness , rashness , harshness , scandal . She knew this in advance by consulting withherself , and she did n't have to wait to see a great part in actuality ; it first arose in her mind and there was where she dealt with it . Simon , in the odd way of these things , was all for her . He said , " She 's got more brain and ability than six women . She 's a hundred per cent straight , no faking . She 's as goodhearted as they come "  --  there was a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you too , Angie . " He said this with a view to my beginning to court Lucy Magnus , as I presently agreed to do . " She keeps sending Mama stuff . She wants to board her with a private family . Her idea . Mama never has complained about the Home . The company there is good for her . What do you think ? " While driving around the city we sometimes stopped to see Mama . Most often we simply passed the building . But you never knew with Simon what your destination was . Saying , " Hop in , " he 'd perhaps himselfself not know where he was off to , answering a need he did n't under/stand yet . Perhaps it was food he was after , perhaps a fight , perhaps disaster , perhaps a woman beckoning from behind , or a business order , a game of billiards , a lawyer 's office , a steam bath at the athletic club . So then among these possible stops was the Home on Arthington Street . It was of gray stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which there were two benches . There were benches inside too . It was furnished like a meeting hall or public forum , all the common space of it bare ; only the bad state of the windows kept the outsider from looking in ; the panes were full of glassy gnarls and dirty , probably from the hands of people who had touched them to discover that this was not wall but window . Everything that could have made a hazard in the old house had been taken away ; thus there were a bar of plaster where the mantelpiece had been and a cork grade at the doorsills . But the blind did not go around very much . They sat , and did n't seem to have any conversation , and soon you were aware of leisure gone bad . I had learned something of this during Einhorn 's days of dirty mental weather . Or of the soul , not the mind , the sick evil of not even knowing why anything should ail you since you 're resigned to accept all condi-tionsThe director and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact that you knew the next menu in advance by the smell of the kitchen . In general I considered it a blessing that Mama was simple . I thought that if there were any characters here that were intriguing or quarrelsome  --  andhow would there fail to be ?  --  there must be some awful events in the innermost privacy of the house . But Mama had put in many years of appeasing tempestuousness or staying out of its way , and she very likely had more trouble as a result of one of Simon 's visits than she ever did with her companions . For he came to check on how she was treated , and he had a harsh way of inquiring . He was tough with the director , who hoped to get mattresses wholesale from Arthur Magnusthrough him . Simon had promised him this favor . But he threw his weight around , full of menace , pleased with nothing . He objected to Mama 's having roommates , and when he obtained a private room for her it was next to the kitchen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank him for . And then , one summer afternoon , we found her sitting on her bed at the task of fitting pins into Roosevelt campaign buttons ; she was getting ten cents a hundred and earning a few dollars a week by the goodheartedness of the precinct captain . Seeingher with her unskillful hands of rough housework at the brass pins , feeling the two objects together in her lap , Simon went into a rage thatp235made her flinch , and knowing that I was with him she turned her face and tried to find me and get me to intercede ; she was frightened , too , to discover that she had been doing wrong unawares . " Stop roaring , " I said , " for God 's sake ! " But he could n't be stopped . " What do they mean ! Look what they 've got her doing ! Where 's that sonofabitch ? " It was the director 's wife who came , in her house dress . She meant to remain respectful but not be servile ; she was white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but spoke up , practical and proud . " Are you responsible for this ? " he shouted at her . She said , " Mrs. March was n't made to do anything she did n't want . She was asked and she wanted to . It 's good for her to have something to keep her occupied . " " Asked ? I know how people are asked so they 're afraid to say no . I 'll have you know that my mother is n't going to do any piecework for ten , twenty , thirty cents , or a dollar an hour . She gets all the money she needs from me . " " You do n't have to yell like this . These are all very sensitive people and easy disturbed . " In the passage I saw many of the blind stop and a group gathered , while in the kitchen the big sloven-haired cook turned with her knife from the meatblock . " Simon , I wanted , I asked , " said Mama . She was unable to put weight in her tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Calm down , " I said to him with some effect at last . It appeared that he could no longer take out the first intention of his heart without touching the inflamed place of self-distinction . Wrongly blessing and cursing like Balaam , but without any outside power to reverse him , only his own arbitrariness doubling back on him . So he could not speak for Mama without commanding how he himself was to be looked upon . Next he went to the closet to see whether the things were there that Charlotte had given her , the shoes , handbag , dresses , and he missed at once a light coat , handed down by a more robust person , that did n't fit her anyway . " Where is it  --  what have they done with that coat ? " " I sent it to the cleaners . She spilled coffee on it , " the director 's wife explained . " I did , " said Mama in her clear , tuneless voice . And the woman , " I 'll take it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big in the shoulders . "  |p236Simon  wore a look of anger and detestation , silent , still regarding the closet . " She can afford a good tailor if she needs alterations . I want her to look right . " He left her money each time , single dollars so that she could not be cheated in the changing . Not that he really distrusted the director and his wife ; he wanted them , however , to realize that he did not have to depend on their honesty . " I want her to go for a walk every day . " " It 's the rule , Mr. March . " " I know rules . You keep them when you want to . " I spoke to him in a low tone , and he said , " That 's all right . Be quiet . I want her to go to the hairdresser at least once a week . " " My husband takes all the ladies in the car together . He ca n't be taking one at a time . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get to go with her once a week ? I 'll pay for it . I want her to be taken care of . I 'm getting married soon . " " We 'll try to accommodate you , sir , " she said , and he , not missing her derision though all she looked was steadfast and unintimidated , stared , spoke to himself , and took up his hat . " Good-by , Ma . " " Good-by , good-by , boys . " " And take away this junk , " said Simon , scattering the pins with a tug of the bedcover . He left , and the woman tartly said to me , " I hope at least FDR is good enough for him personally . "  |p237When  the cold weather came Simon started to make money and everythingwent well . His spirits rose . The wedding was a great affair in the main ballroom of a big hotel , the bridal party getting organized in the governor 's suite where Simon and Charlotte also spent the first night . I was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went along with me to rent a tuxedo , and then liked the fit of it so well he bought it outright . On the wedding day Mimi helped me with the studs of the boiled shirt and the tie . My neighbor Kayo Obermark sat in to observe , on my bed , fat feet bare , and laughed over Mimi 's digs at marriage . " Now you look like the groom himself , " said Mimi . " You probably aim to become one soon , do n't you ? " I snatched up my coat and ran , for I had to pick up Mama . I had the Pontiac for the purpose . She was my charge ; I was supposed to see her through . Simon ordered me to have her wear dark glasses . The day was frosty , windy , clear , the waves piled up , from the slugging green water , white over the rocks of the Outer Drive . And then we came to the proud class of the hotel and its Jupiter 's heaviness and restless marbledetail , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge for flowers , another carved figure , another white work of iron ; and inside luxuriously warm  --  even the subterranean garage where I parked had this silky warmth . And coming out of the white elevator , you were in an Alhambra of roses and cellular ceilings , gilt and ivory , Florida feathering of plants and muffling of carpets , immense distances , and everywhere the pure purpose of supporting and encompassing the human creature in conveniences . Of doing unto the body ; holding it precious ; bathing , drying , powdering , preparing satin rest , conveying , feeding . I 've been at Schonbrunn and in the Bourbon establishment in Madrid and seen all that embellishment as the setting of power . Butp238luxury as the power itself is different  --  luxury without anything ulterior . Except insofar as all yearning , for no matter what , just so its scope is vast , is of one cluster of mysteries and always ulterior . And what will this power do to you ? I know that I in , say , an ancient place like Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls where great men once sat , experienced what it was to be simply a dot , a speck that scans across the cornea , a corpuscle , almost white , almost nothing but air : I to these ottimati in their thought . And this spectacular ancient aggrandizementwith its remains of art and many noble signs I could appreciateeven if I did n't want to be just borne down by the grandeur of it . But in this modern power of luxury , with its battalions of service workers and engineers , it 's the things themselves , the products that are distinguished , and the individual man is n't nearly equal to their great sum . Finally they are what becomes great  --  the multitude of baths with never-failing hot water , the enormous air-conditioning units and the elaborate machinery . No opposing greatness is allowed , and the disturbingperson is the one who wo n't serve by using or denies by not wishing to enjoy . I did n't yet know what view I had of all this . It still was n't clear to me whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does anybody form a decision to be against and persist against ? When does he choose and when is he chosen instead ? This one hears voices ; that one is a saint , a chieftain , an orator , a Horatius , a kamikazi ; one says Ich kann nicht anders  --  so help me God ! And why is it I who can not do otherwise ? Is there a secret assignment from mankind to some unfortunate person who ca n't refuse ? As if the great majority turned away from a thing it could n't permanently forsake and so named some person to remainfaithful to it ? With great difficulty somebody becomes exemplary , anyhow . Conceivably Simon felt that I was this kind of influenceable person and looked liable to become an example . For God knows there are abandoned and hungry principles enough flowing free and looking for attachment . So he wanted to get to me first . Simon 's idea was that I should marry Lucy Magnus , who had more money even than Charlotte . This was how he outlined the future to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to John Marshall law school at night while I worked for him . He 'd pay my tuition and give me eighteen dollars a week . Eventually I could become his partner . Or if his business did n't suit me , we could go into real estate with our joint capital . Or perhapsinto manufacturing . Or , if I chose to be a lawyer , I would n't need to be a mere ambulance chaser , shyster , or birdseed wiseguy and con/niver in two-bit cases . Not with the money I 'd have to play with as Lucy Magnus 's husband . She was a juicy piece besides , even if he did n't care for the way her collarbones stood out when she wore a formal , and she was full of willingness . He would back me while I courted her . I did n't need to worry about the expenses ; he 'd give me the use of the Pontiac for taking her out , build me up with the family , remove the obstacles . All I had to do was play along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the role of the son-in-law her parents wanted . It was a leadpipecinch . We were alone in his room in the governor 's suite , a room of white walls and gold paneling , heavy mirrors hung on silk hawsers , a Louis XIV bed . Having come out of the glass stall of the shower , dried in a thick Turkish mantle , put on black socks and a stiff shirt , he was now lying on the bed , smoking a cigar , while he explained this to me , practicaland severe . He sprawled out with his big body , the mid-part of it nude . This comfort and luxury were not what he preached at me , but the thing to do : not to dissolve in bewilderment of choices but to make myself hard , like himself , and learn how to stay with the necessary , undistractedby the trimmings . This was what he thought , and to some extentI thought it too . Why should n't I marry a rich man 's daughter ? If I did n't want to do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life somewhat differently ? Was n't there any other way to ride this gorgeous train ? Provided Lucy was different from her cousin , why should n't there be ? I was n't unwilling to look into this and profit by Simon 's offers . I was already taking so many of his orders , putting in so much time , that I might as well accept wages too , go the whole way and make it official . And I may as well say that I had a desire to go along with him out of the love I felt for him and enthusiasm for his outlook . In which I did n't fundamentally believe . However , that I should n't be too good to do as he was doing was of enormous importance to him , and the obstinacy that had always made me hold out against him for unspoken or anyway insufficient reasons seemed at last over . I did n't oppose him , so he spoke to me with unusual affection . He rolled from the bed to finish dressing , saying , " Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd start to show some sense , if ever , and worried you would n't be anything but a punk . Here , fix this stud for me in back . My mother-in-law got this set for me . Christ ! how'an I going to find my dress shoes ? All this tissue paper . You ca n't find anything . Get rid of it . Leave it in the can for the governor , " he said , spirited and nervous in his laugh . " The world has n't set too tight yet . There 's room , if you find the openings to it . If you study it out youp240can find them . Horner is a Jew too , after all , and probably did n't have a better start than we did , and is governor . " " Are you thinking of giving politics a try ? " " Maybe . Why not ? It depends on how things shape up . Uncle Artie knows a guy who was made ambassador by contributing often enough to campaign drives . Twenty , thirty , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who has it ? " This being an ambassador could n't be envisioned as in the old days  --  a Guicciardini arriving from Florence with his clever face , or a Russian coming to Venice , or an Adams  --  such grandeurs have sunk down as the imagination has been transferred from the bearer of his country 's power walking on rugs to his blowing shellac through the waterpipes of Lima to stop the rust . Simon , when he put on his tails and walked from mirror to mirror , doubling back his fingers to tug down the white cuffs and pulling up his chin to make his strong neck freer in the band of the butterfly collar , had the vigor to make the place live up to him ; more  --  the thought lay in the open  --  than the governors for whom it was reserved . And having gotten in without ever having been a candidate he could perhaps get far beyond them without running or going through the tiresome part of politics . He had come into a view of mutability , and I too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in specified limits . That 's what you 'll be told in the ranks . I do n't say that I exactly shared his feelings , or spirits of the dauphin 's horse , almost tearing down hangings and shouldering into mirrors with that bucking pride , but with him now I certainly felt less boxed than I ever before had , nothing that others did so inconceivable for me . However , people were waiting below and Simon was holding things up , taking his time . Charlotte came in herself , like a big bridal edifice in her veil and other lace , carrying long-stemmed flowers . With her there was n't much hiding of the behind-the-scenes of life to keep a man in the bonds of love , as Lucretius advises when he tells you to make allowances for mortality . You only had to see her practical mouth to know everything about mortality was admitted in advance , though she did for form 's sake all that other women do . Her frankness gave her a kind of nobility . But here when she came into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassadorships , and the best that Simon could do brought him back to her . " Everybody else is ready . What are you doing ? " She spoke to me , for she would n't blame him in any circumstances where she could blame me instead , his stand-in.  | " I 've been dressing and shmoosing , " said Simon . " There 's plenty of time  --  what 's the big rush ? Anyhow , you did n't have to come , you could have phoned . Now , honey , do n't be nervous ; you look beautiful and everything is going to be fine . " " It will be if I see to it . Now will you go and talk to the guests ? " she said in her bidding tone . She sat on the bed to call the caterer , the musicians , the florist , the management , the photographer , for she kept all under close control and had made every arrangement herself , relying on no one ; and with her white shoes on a chair and a pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer , at the last moment still trying to beat down his price . " Listen , Schultz , if you try to hold me up you 'll get no business out of any of the Magnuses ever again , and there 're plenty of us . " " Angie , " said Simon when we went out , " you can have the car to take Lucy out . You 'll probably need some dough , so here 's ten bucks . I 'll send Mama home in a cab . I want you at the office at eight though . Is she wearing those glasses I told you to get her ? " Mama had obediently put on the glasses , but it displeased him to see that she carried her white cane . She was sitting with Anna Coblin in the lounge , the cane between her knees , and he tried to take it away from her , but she would n't yield it up . " Ma , give me that stick , for Chrissake ! How will it look ? They 're going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bump into me . " " They wo n't bump into you  --  you 'll be with Cousin Anna . " " Hear let her keep it , " said Anna . " Ma , give that cane to Augie and he 'll check it for you . " " I do n't want to , Simon . " " Mama , do n't you want everything to look nice ? " He tried to loosen her fingers . " Cut it out ! " I said to him , and Cousin Anna with her burning morose face muttered something to him . " You shut up , you cow ! " he said to her . He went , but left me instructions . " You get it away from her . What a turnout from our side ! " I let her keep the cane , and had to pacify Cousin Anna and beg her to stay for Mama 's sake . " Money makes you meshuggah , " she said , sitting heavy and tall in her corset , glaring maddened into the luxurious lounge . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surprises the meek will pull . Anyway , Simon dropped the matter ; he was toop242busy to fight every fight through , and he was somewhere off the ballroomwhere the ceremony was shaping up . I went around looking among the guests for some I knew . He had invited the Einhorns , includingArthur . Arthur , who had graduated from the University of Illinois , was in Chicago , where he was doing nothing in particular . OccasionallyI saw him on the South Side and knew that he was friendly with Frazer 's set and that he was supposed to be translating poems from the French . Einhorn would always back him in any intellectual pursuit . There were the Einhorns then , in the ballroom , the old man with a sort of military cloak , gray , looking like the former possessor of a splendor just as good as this who , without special rancor but understanding how it all comes about , watches it change hands . He said to me , " You look very fine in your tuxedo , Augie . " Tillie kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur smiling . He could behave with exceptional charm , but this was absent-mindedly conferred on you . I went on to welcome Happy Kellerman and his wife , a thin blond rattle of a woman who bore out her belly and was wound high and low with beads and pearls . Next I saw Five Properties and Cissy . Simon had asked them from motives not hard to understand , partly to show Cissy what he had gone on to do and also to subject Five Properties to a cruel comparison . Cissy defeated all , though , with that sly provoking decencyabout her female gifts , breast touching breast in the low opening of her dress . She showed her tongue softly in the few words that she spoke . Five Properties had come for a reconciliation of cousins . She had taught him to comb his Scythian hair differently ; it now came lower on the rugged forehead without modifying the skeptical grinning of his eyes ; that savage green would always express everything that Five Properties thought . He too was dressed in a tuxedo , wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon had invited him to see . And so he grinned all around with his gum-buried teeth and green eyes . It was evident that Cissy steered him , taught him civilized behavior  --  him who had loaded and driven the wagon of jolting corpses the Russiansand Germans had made of one another in the Polish mud . She coached him . All the same she could n't prevent him by her smile and slow murmured word from feeling her on the back and fondling her . " So what 's wrong , babe ? " he said . Well , the wedding music began . I went to see that Mama was taken to a plush bench , her place inside the flower cage beside the altar  --  the Coblins were with her  --  and then into rehearsed position in the procession , with Lucy Magnus , along the white carpet down which the principalscame : Charlotte and her father with rose-scattering children be/fore , Mrs. Magnus and Uncle Charlie , and then Simon with Lucy 's brother Sam , first-string guard on the Michigan team , a hulky walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unambiguously declarative way , and when the ring was on and Simon swung Charlotte back before all to kiss her , and all clapped and cried out , Lucy came and took my arm . We went in to the banquet ; ten dollars a plate , it was  --  for that day a staggering price . But I could n't sit through the meal in peace . An usher came to tell me I was wanted and rushed me to the back of the hall . Five Properties , angry , was walking out because he and Cissy had been put at a little table apart behind a pillar . Whether it was Charlotte who was responsible for this , or Simon himself , I never found out . One was as capable of it as the other . Whoever had done it , Five Properties was powerfully offended . " ' S okay , Augie . Against you I got nothing . He asked me ? I came . I wish him all . But what way is it to treat a cousin ? Okay . Eat I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , need his meal . Babe , come on . " I went to get her fur , knowing it was useless to argue , and I saw them to the garage elevator with some dawning thought about rudeness as the measure of achievement and the systems of storing up injury . As Cissy passed into the elevator she said , " Tell your brother congratulations . His wife is awfully pretty . " But this was one game in which I was n't going to play intermediary , and when Simon asked me eagerly about their leaving I said casually , " Oh , they just did n't have the time to stay . They came only for the ceremony . " I gave no satisfaction . But as for that other more important game into which he had gotten me , I played it to the full , going to night clubs , sorority dances , and shows and night-football games at which Lucy and I pitched and necked . She was , up to the last thing of all , unrestrained and exploratory ; and where she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take , especially with people whose rules of life are few . But I enjoyed all that was allowed and to that extent I remained myself . But I was n't much myself in other ways , and it was very disturbing , and sometimes pressed on my head with very heavy weight , and I realized I was in the end zone of my adaptability . It was my pride to make it seem easy though . So that if you took me at Uncle Charlie 's house on a Sunday afternoon , after dinner , by the fire , among the family , with Mrs. Magnus knitting a shawl that rose out of a tapestry carpetbag ; with Sam , Lucy 's brother , standing by , his chin picked up to make way for the foulard beneath it and his dressing gown swelling over his behind while every now and then he treated his plastered hairp244with affection ; with Uncle Charlie listening to Father Coughlin who had n't yet begun to shag out the money-changers but had that boring fervor of the high-powered and misleading who wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trembling vacancy of winter space between Detroit and Chicago  --  if you took me there , by the firelight , facing Uncle Charlie who had one leg thrown forward and his fingers inside the crevice of his shirt drawing at the mat of his chest , I was n't the success envy might have believed me to be . My own envy went out with , I do n't doubt , sick eyes through the clear gray panes where the kids were warring and shooting snowballs that splatted on the black trunks and soared in the elegant scheme of twigs . Not that Lucy , in dark wool dress that just covered the tops of stockings she had helped me loosen the night before so that I could stroke her skin , did n't make up for much . In some way , not the deepest nor yet trivially , I was gone on her and as far as I was allowed gave her a real embrace that she returned , licking my ear and praising and promising me ; she already called me husband . The deep consideration women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demands for the most part outlawed out of fear for everything that has been done to make a reasonable , continuous life , the burden that made Phedra cry she wanted to throw off her harmful clothes , you could find that in Lucy too . It took her as far as to choose me . It was evident I was less desirable than Simon from her family 's standpoint . Their main investigation was conducted on my willingness to be as they were in everything . They never were too sure , and were forever asking to have another look at my credentials , and , so to speak , would come in without knocking , as if I were at West Point , to see whether all was dusted and the hospital corners satisfied regulations . Lucy stood up for me ; it was her only disobedience so far as I , a waywardbut close student of the situation , could see . When I suggested that we run away and get married at Crown Point she refused flat , and I could see the difference between her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon and me ; he had been able to talk Charlotte into eloping . And if Lucy already called me " husband , " Mimi Villars would have said , no compliment intended , that she was a wife , wanting the whole wifely racket . In other words , minor sensuality and no trouble . Unless she was flirting with trouble by havingdetected a source of it in me . But I was , as at the Renlings ' , under an influence and not the carrier of it . I had to get around ; I had a figure to cut , the car to drive , the money to spend , the clothes to wear , and served before I had it clearp250whether I wanted or liked the doing of it at all . Even if her father stole in on us at two in the morning as we were loving-up , he stole through a mansion , and it was hard to think him wrong when the lights went on and he prowled peevish toward us . I suppose I saw nothing very wrong anywhere , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover that he did n't like me , because everything flashed so , all was rich , was heavy , velvet , lepidopterous . The circuit I was in , at the Glass Derby and Chez Paree and the dances at Medinah Club , kept me very busy . Here what had to be established was whether I was qualified in pocket to mix with the sons of established fathers . I had to mind my step , for Simon kept me on a minimum budget ; he somehow thought that I could do what he had done on just a little less . It was true that I could make money go farther , but Lucy thought less about economics than Charlotte . And I had to notice cover charges , tips , the cost of a parking lot , and slip out to the store for Camels instead of buying them from the cigarette girl . I got through examination by Lucy 's set , not hearing what I did n't want to hear , or forcing others to give ground , and even if it did strengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it did me credit to bluff it through . These were n't our only company . We went to visit Simon and Charlottein their flat  --  they had , for a beginning , only three rooms  --  and to eat off the trousseau linen and the wedding china . The Magnuses went to exceptional lengths to procure anything for one of their own , and these plates and cups had been baked in an English kiln , as the rug was really from Bokhara and the silver by Tiffany . If we stayed after dinner we played bridge or rummy , and at ten o'clock Charlotte phoned the drugstoreto send peppermint ice-cream and hot fudge . So we licked spoons and I was in general sociable , helpful , debonair , and thought of the two colors of my silk suspenders and the fit of my shirt , Simon 's gifts . Obedient to him , Charlotte treated Lucy and me like an engaged pair , but with wariness and reserve camouflaged from him . With the instinct of her family she knew that I did n't have Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow in his steps , his difficulties perhaps too much for me to undertake . This he was becoming aware of too . He was pleased at first by my willingness and fluency and spoon-lickery and obliging and niceness that continued while I moved before the regard of the Magnuses and made the most that could be made of the appeal of their seductions  --  all that opulence , the strength of cars in the great rout of cars in the cold-lit darkness of the North Side Drive , and that mobile heraldry onp246soft tires rushing toward the floating balls and moons of the Drake Hotel and the towers around it ; the thick meat , solid eating , excitement of dancing . Following the lake shore , you left the dry wood and grayed brick of the thick-built , jammed , labor-and-poverty Chicago standing apart , speedily passed to the side . Ah no ! but the two halves of the prophecy were there together , the Chaldee beauties and the wild beasts and doleful creatures shared the same houses together . Being in the yard daily , the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget even if my evenings and Sundays were in another sphere . And my Sundays themselves were divided . Simon had me open the gates Sunday morning to catch what trade there was in the very cold weather . He drove me hard , bound to discipline me . Some morning she checked on the time I arrived . If once in a while I overslept it was n't to be wondered at , since , after taking Lucy home and leaving his car in the garage , I had to ride home on the trolley and so rarely got into the sack before one in the morning . He would n't , however , take any excuses from me . He said , " Well , why do n't you make your time with her a little faster ? Marry her and you 'll get more rest . " This , at first , was half a joke , but later , when he began more to doubt me , he was surly and before long fierce toward me . He grudged me the extra money , thinking it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for , goddam you , Augie ! She ought to be a pushover . If it was me I 'd show you how , but fast . " He was more violent as the resistance of her family began to shape up , though this I did n't understand for a while . But should I come in at eight-fifteen instead of eight I might find him at the scale , glaring at me . " What 's the matter , did that Mimi keep you ? " He was convinced that I had carried on and continued still with Mimi . We had other difficulties too . As I was assistant bookkeeper as well as weighmaster , he expected me to take from the pay-envelopes of the Negro hikers installments on the cast-off clothing he had sold them , and on a few occasions there was bad feeling between us . As in December , once , a lushed-up dealer named Guzynski tore onto the scale out of the slushy yard with white steam gushing from his busted radiator . He was buying a ton of coal and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was heavy he cursed me , and he came down from the truck to force his way into the office and break my arm for cheating . I met him at the door and threw him out , and when he picked himself up from the snow , instead of pushing me again , he dumped his coal on the scale . There was now a jam of trucks and wagons in the street as well as in the yard . I told a hiker to clear the scale , but Guzynski wasp247standing over his coal with a shovel and swung on him when he came near . Happy Kellerman was phoning for a squad car when Simon arrived . Simon went for the gun at once , and as he was running from the office with it I caught him by the arm and swung him back , and in his rage he drove a punch at me and hit me in the chest . I yelled at him as he got away , " Do n't be an idiot ! Do n't shoot ! " and then saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned the corner . Guzynski was not too drunk to see the gun and he threw himself , burly in his short filthy coat and seaman 's watch cap , to the side of his truck , trying to get to the cab . Here , in the narrow space between the truck and the office wall , Simon caught him , had him by the throat , and hit him in the face with the side of the gun . This happened right below Happy and me ; we were standing at the scale window , and we saw Guzynski , trapped , square teeth and hideous eyes , foul blue , and his hands hooked , not daring to snatch the gun with which Simon hit him again . He laid open Guzynski 's cheek . My heart went back on me when the cuts were torn , and I thought , Does it make him think he knows what he 's doing if the guy bleeds ? Now he let him go and with the pistol signed to the hikers to clear the scale platform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Guzynski looking with loathing at his blood . He sprang into his truck , and I feared he would crash it into the gates , but he skidded into the snow mash of the street and the tracks caught his wheels and straightened him out in the traffic that took him up with it toward the sunless , faint direction . " Any odds he 's going to the station to swear out a warrant ? " said Happy . Simon , who had put down the gun , listened to him , and with a heavy breath he said , " Get me Nuzzo on the phone . " He spoke to me , and it was in a fashion I had made up my mind to get used to and generally obeyed . He no longer looked up a number himself or did the dialing but took the instrument only when his party was already waiting . This time , however , I did n't stir . My arms were crossed and I held my place by the scale . He marked me down for this , grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Simon . " This is March . How y'doin ' ? What ? No , it 's cold enough , I ca n't kick . Now listen , Nuzzo , we just had a little trouble down here from a squarehead dealer who hit one of my men with a shovel . What ? No , he was drunk as a lord , dumped his load on my scale and tied me up for an hour . Look , he 's probably on his way to make a complaint because I roughed him up . Take care of him for me , will you ? Keep him in the clink till he cools off . Sure I will , I got witnesses.  |p248You  tell him if he 's thinking of laying for me after , you 'll fix his clock good . What ? He does bushel business down by that church on Twentyeighth . Do that for me , will you ? " He did , and Guzynski was in the lockup several days . Next time I saw him he was n't plotting any revenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customer , quiet , and I know that Simon was watching his eyes and would have acted on the least hint . But there was no trouble to hint . Nuzzo , or Nuzzo 's people , had put a deep fright in him in their cellar below cellar , and gave him a Saturn 's bite in the shoulder to show him how he could be picked up whole and eaten . He must even come back a customer . And Simon , too , knew how to put home the clincher , and at Christmas gave Guzynski a bottle of Gordon 's Dry Gin and his wife a box of New Orleans pecan pralines in the form of a cotton bale . She said to him that it had done Guzynski good . " Of course , " said Simon . " He 's satisfied now . Because he knows where he stands . When he swung that shovel he did n't know and was trying to find out . Now he knows . " For Simon wanted to show me how justly he handled such crises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I did . I should have quelled Guzynski 's riot as soon as it broke . But I was n't prompt , was n't brave , did n't understand that Guzynski had to be pistolwhippedand thrown in jail if he was n't to become a Steelkilt mutineer to buffalo all captains . The inference was clear that if I did n't make time with Lucy Magnus it was from these same shortcomings . If I becameher husband in two-armed fact , the rest was merely a formality . But I did n't mount the step of power . I could have done so from love , but not to get to the objective . Thus things became more tough for me at the yard ; Simon increased my hardships both for my good and because it did n't displease him to do it . At this time he could n't say how many high things were suitable for him and was trying on guises . His last thoughts at breakfast sometimeswere the next new policy , and this might be to devote himself absolutelyto the bottom-most detail or fistful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to skim in the big space of principle only and leave the details to subordinates  --  as he could do if they , and mainly I , were trustworthy ; or to be a Jesuit of money ; or to be self-made : that was one of his weakest ideas but it was also persistent . I said , " Oh , but you 're not a Henry Ford . After all , you married a rich girl . " " The question is , " he said , " what you have to suffer to get money , how much effort there is in it . Not that you start with a nickel , like the Alger story "  --  Ip249here remembered what a reader Simon had been  --  " and run it into a fortune . But if you get a stake , what you do with it , whether you plunge or not . " But this was the discussion of theory , which became rarer between us . Mostly I had to see in his disgusted eyes what his theory was and how disadvantageously I fitted into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark . So those were evil days for me , in that particular field of feeling that had the shape of the yard , the forms of the fence , coal heaps , machinery , the window of the scale , and that long , brass , black-graduated beam where I weighed . These things : and also the guys that worked , the guys that bought , the cops that came for theirs , the mechanics and the railroad agents , the salesmen , got into me . My head was full of things to remember ; I must not quote a wrong price and stumble in arithmetic or any dealing . Mimi Viliars heard me talking in my sleep one night about prices and came in and asked me questions , as though in a telephone conversation . She quoted the prices back to me in the morning , all correctly . " Brother ! things must be bad for you , " she said , " if that 's all you can dream . " I might have confessed even worse , if I 'd cared to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent me on errands not exactly for Hesperides apples . I had to fight with janitors about clinkers , soothe and bribe them , sweeten dealers with beer , wrangle with claims agents about shrinkage , make complicateddeposits in the pushing , barking crowd at the bank , everybody in a hurry and temper ; I had furthermore to hunt up shovelers in flophousesand court them in the Madison Street gutter when we were suddenlyshorthanded . I had to go to the morgue to identify one found shot with our pay envelope empty in his shirt pocket . They lifted the bristling , creased wrap from him and I recognized him , his black body rigid , as if he died in a fit of royal temper , making fists , feet out of shape , and crying something from the roof of his mouth , which I saw . " You know him ? " " That 's Ulace Padgett . He worked for us . What happened to him ? " " Girl friend shot him , they say . " He pointed out the wound in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naw , they wo n't even look for her . They never do . " Simon had given me this mission because , he said , I was driving the car anyway , to take Lucy out , and might as well attend to it on the way home . I had to hurry and change , and I did n't have the time to wash off any but the exposed dirt of face , neck , and ears . All over the rest ofp250me was grit from the yard , up my heels and legs . Even in the corners of the eyes there were shadowed places I did n't get into . They widened out my look by darkness . I had no time to eat , even if I had enjoyed an appetite , for the morgue had taken long and Lucy was waiting . I drove faster than I had any business to , and had a near thing at Western Avenue and Diversey , a long , downhill skid that turned the Pontiac round so that I finished backwards , against a streetcar . The motorman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing on a grade , underthe railroad bridge . So I did n't hit hard . I smashed the rear lights but could n't see much other damage , and was congratulated by that sudden gathering that always collects on such an occasion . I was told how lucky I was and laughed it all off , hopped back of the wheel again and continued . I got to the Magnuses ' in marvelous spirits , in the black night of the drive and the snow head of the portico , confident and whistling , the keys melodious in the coat I tossed down on the bench in the hall . However , when Lucy 's brother Sam gave me a drink I went back , infinitely quicker than the speed at which I had come , to the morgue  --  the smell of the whisky on an empty stomach did that for me  --  and to the accident , which now made my work-filthy legs too weak to hold me . I sank down in a chair . Lucy said , " Why are you so white ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B movie , concerned after all lest his sister , huggable , press-bosom dolly , get herself engaged to a weakling . With more of this interest than mercy he bent to me , the stripes of his dressing gown stretched tight over his can . " Am I white ? " I struggled to say and picked up my head . " Maybe because I have n't eaten . " " Oh , how silly . Since when ? Why , it 's after nine . " She sent Sam to the kitchen to get a sandwich and a glass of milk from the cook . " I also had an accident  --  almost , " I said to her when he had gone , and described what had happened . I 'm not sure which most came through , her concern , or the sudden thought at the rear of her mind that I was a Jonah  --  I , the happy lover of the present moment . Trained fine in foresight , when , as now , she wanted to make use of it , she must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery in the horizon . " Did you damage the car badly ? " she said . " It 's banged up a little . " She did n't like my vagueness about it . " The trunk ? " " I do n't know exactly . I broke the tail lights , that I know . About the rest it 's hard to tell in the dark , but it probably is n't much . "  | " We 'll go in my car tonight , " she said , " and I 'll drive . You must be shaky from the accident . " So we went out in her roadster , a new one her father had recently given her , to our party on the North Shore , and afterward parked in one of the big sectors of shadow around the Bahai temple to stroke , strug-gle , and shiver at the base of that cold religious knoll and its broken-up moonlight . Things seemed as usual but were not , either for her or for me . When we got back she wanted to have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't go bend over the back of the car with her and put my finger in the dents . I turned off her headlights , under which the examination was taking place . And in the front hall afterward , when I was in coat and hat , fondling her and being assured she loved me , I knew there was an obstruction of sympathy . She foresaw that Simon would raise hell about the damage  --  as he did  --  and what 's more , no point of view but his seemed possible to her , and she was somewhat frightened at me , feeling that I had one . And I might smell her shoulder and lift up her breast , but it was n't the same intimacy any more in that riches-cluttered hall partly inventoried by the moon , the old man snuffing upstairs , vigilant whether asleep or not . I was therefore worn out in advance of the dripping yellow morning and its sick cold and the close filthy heat of the oil-squirting stove indoors . There is a way , I do n't doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulge of the flood water , if you determine your energy to flow that way , and the weight of morgues and cars depends on the hydrauliclifting power you dispose of . Napoleon when he escaped in the old box of a sledge from wintry Russia , the troops of his dead lying like so many flocks covered in snow , talked three days to Caulaincourt who probably could n't hear very well because his ears were bandaged  --  his master could n't practice his old trick of pulling them  --  but he must have seen in his boss 's swollen face the depth that kept floating a whole Europe of details . Yes , these business people have great energy . There 's a question as to what 's burned to produce it and what things we can and ca n't burn . There 's the burning of an atom . Wild northern forests go like so many punk sticks . Where 's the competitor-fire kindling , and what will its strength be ? And another thing is that while for the sake of another vigor is lacking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth there 's all-out effort , and that 's how love is lavished . I could n't hold up all of these different elements . Simon came in and bawled me out over the car and I was too broken-down to give any backp252talk or even feel he was doing me wrong . All I did reply was , " What are you fussing about ? It was n't much of an accident , and you 're in-sured . " This was just where the error was ; it was that I had to feel bad about the back shell of the car and those crustacean eyes that were dragging by the wires , and it was n't so much the accident as my failure to care as I should that he minded . That was why he burned me with his eyes and showed his broken-edged tooth while his head settled downward with menace . I was too despondent to stand up to him . Nothing visible backed me , as it did him , to see and trust , but all was vague on my side and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening to read . According to our agreement I was to start at the university in the spring , when business would let up a little and Simon could spare me . I still had the craving that I had given in to all summer long when I had lived on books , to have the reach to grasp both ends of the frame and turn the big image-taking glass to any scene of the world . By now Padilla had sold most of my books for me  --  he himself had given up stealing lately since he had taken a parttimejob calculating the speed of nerve impulses in a biophysics lab -- and I had only a few things left . However , there was Einhorn 's firedamagedset of classics in a box under the bed , and I picked out Schiller 's Thirty Years ' War and was lying in my socks reading when Mimi Villars came in . Often she came and went without talking to me , only for her things in the closet . But she had something to say tonight , and did n't spar , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gosh , are you sure ? " " Of course I 'm sure . Come out with me . I want to talk to you and I do n't want Kayo to be in on it . He listens through the wall . " It was black weather , not too cold but very windy , and the street light was hacked and banged like a cymbal . " But where 's Frazer ? " 1 said , having been out of touch with the house lately . " He had to leave . He has to read a damn paper at a convention in Louisiana , Christmas . and so he went to see his folks first , because he ca n't be with them for the holiday . But what difference is it where he is  --  what 's the good of him ? " " Well , honestly now , Mimi , would n't you like it if you could get married ? " She gave me enough silence in which to take it back , looking at me.  | " You must think I lose my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retract . We had n't gone down into the wind yet ; we were on the porch . She had one foot pointed to the side and her hand coming from her deep sleeve held the back of her neck while her round face of tough happiness was turned close under mine . Tough happiness ? Yes , or hard amusement , or something spiritual and gymnastic , with pain done to the brows to make them point finely . " If I would n't marry him before , why should I now because of an accident ? I see you 've been under good influences . Let 's go get a cup of coffee . " She took my arm , and we got as far as the corner , where we stopped again and were talking when a little dog came up , followed by his mistress in a Persian lamb coat and astrakhan hat , and an astonishing thing happened of the sort that made me see how believable it was that Mimi should have grabbed the gun from a stickup man and shot him ; for the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wet on Mimi 's ankle , and she shouted at the woman , who seemed incapable of looking to see what was happening , " Take away your dog ! " And then she tore off the woman 's high fur hat to dry herself with it and left her like that , her hairdress beginning to be destroyed by the wind as she cried out , " My hat ! " The hat was on the street where Mimi had flung it . That lack of respect in occurrences for the difficulties that there alreadyare ! But then proofs always flocked to Mimi to help her make her case . Anyway , in the drugstore , when she had stripped off and rolled her stocking and put it in her bag , it only made her laugh . A real and pure chance for temper tickled her heart . But what she wanted to discuss over coffee was a new method of abortion she had heard about . She had already tried drugs like ergoapiol , with walking , climbing stairs , and hot baths , and now one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor near Logan Square who brought on miscarriages by injection . " I never heard of such a thing before , but it 's worth a try , and I 'm going to try . " " What is it that he uses ? " " How should I know ? I 'm not a scientist . " " And if it has a bad effect you 'll have to go to the hospital , and then what ? " " Oh , they have to take you in if you 're in danger of your life . Only they 'd never get out of me how it happened . " " It sounds risky . Maybe you 'd better not try at all . " " And have a baby ? Me ? Can you see me with a kid ? You do n't carep254how the world gets populated , do you ! Maybe you 're thinking about your mother "  --  I thus knew that either Sylvester or Clem Tambow had talked to her about me  --  " and that you would n't be here if your mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I could be sure I 'd have a son like you , " she said , with her usual comment of laughter , " not that I do n't think the world of you , pal , even with all your faults  --  why should I get into this routine ? So the souls of these things should n't get after me when I die and accuse me of not letting them be born ? I 'd tell them , Listen , stop haunting me . What do you think you ever were ? Why , a kind of little scallop , that 's all . You do n't know how lucky you are . What makes you think you would have liked it ? Take it from me , you 're indignant because you do n't know . ' " We were sitting near the counter , and all the help stopped and listened to this speech . Among them was a man who said , " What a crazy broad ! " She heard him , he caught her eye , and she laughed at him and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die trying to look like Cesar Romero . " " First thing , she comes in , she has to take off her stockings and show her gams . . . " This argument had to run its course , and then we could n't stay ; we finished our conversation in the street . " No , " I said , " I ca n't complain about having been born . " " Yes , sure , you 'd even feel grateful if you knew to whom , and for what was only an accident . " " It could n't have been all an accident . On my mother 's side at least I can be sure there was love in it . " " Is it love that saves it from being an accident ? " " I mean the desire that there should be more life ; from gratitude . " " Show me where that is ! Why do n't you go down to the Fulton egg market and think it over there . Find me the gratitude  --  " " I ca n't argue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliviousnesswould have been better for me , then I 'd be a liar if I answered yes ' or even maybe , ' because the facts are against it . 1 could n't even swear that I knew what obliviousness was , but I could tell you a lot about how pleasant my life has been . " " That 's hunky-dory for you ; maybe you like the way you are , but most people suffer from it . They suffer from what they are , such as they are ; this woman because she 's getting wrinkled and her husband wo n't love her ; and that one because she wants her sister to die and leave her her Buick ; and still another who is willing to devote her whole life to keep her fanny in the right shape ; or getting money out of somebody ;  |p255or  thinking about getting a better man than her husband . Do you want me to give you a list on men too ? I could go on as long as you like . They 'll never change , one beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're lucky . But others are stuck ; they have what they have ; and if that 's their truth , where are we ? " Me , I could n't think all was so poured in concrete and that there were n't occasions for happiness that were n't illusions of people still permitted to be forgetful of permanent disappointment , more or less permanentpain , death of children , lovers , friends , ends of causes , old age , loathsome breath , fallen faces , white hair , retreated breasts , dropped teeth ; and maybe most intolerable the hardening of detestable character , like bone , similar to a second skeleton and creaking loudest before the end . But she , who had to make up her mind practically , could n't be expected to make it up by my feelings . She let you know , but quick , that you , a man , could talk , but she was the one for whom it was the flesh and blood trouble , and she even had a pride about it that made her cheeks shine , that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these arguments with her . And although not convincedby her , I was n't utterly horrified for the unborn either . To be completely consistent in that kind of economy of souls you would have to have great uneasiness and remorse that wombs should ever be unoccupied ; likewise , that hospitals , prisons , and madhouses and graves should ever be full . That wide a spread is too much . The decision was really up to her , whether to have a child by Frazer who was n't free to marry her now , even if she wanted to marry him . And , by the way , I did n't take at face value all that she said about him . However , I was n't any too sure about the injection . I wanted to ask Padilla about it , who was my scientific authority , and I tried to get him at his laboratory . If he did n't know the answer himself he could ask one of his biological buddies in that semi-skyscraper of a building where there were always dogs barking with abnormal strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Padilla did n't seem to mind this ; he only went there to do calculations in that slip-slop queer swift way , standing on an eccentric point , a hand in his pocket and an untouched cigaretteburning with forked smoke . But I could n't find him before Mimi 's appointment with the doctor . To which I took her . This doctor was a man made dolorous , or anyhow heavy of mood , by the bad times , and he looked very unprofessional . There was a carelessoffice of old equipment , and he sat in rolled sleeves and smoked cigars at a desk where my book-accustomed eyes spotted a Spinoza and a Hegel and other things odd for a doctor , and especially one inp256his line . Under him there was a music shop . My memory gives me back the name : Stracciatella . In the window there was the entire family , playing guitars to a microphone  --  the young girls and barelegged boys whose feet did n't yet touch the floor , and the sounds covering the street , cold that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even than the competition of the streetcars , old on that line and passing with a ruckus . The doctor did n't misrepresent what he had to offer  --  he was too careless even for that . He was n't hardhearted maybe , but he appeared to ask , " What could I accomplish by caring ? " Perhaps there was a disdain about him for the double powerlessness of creatures , first to oppose love and then to be free of the consequences . Naturally he took me for the lover . I suppose Mimi wanted him to ; as for me , that was n't what I cared about . Therefore , this was how we were , in the office , the stout doctor explaining his injection for our lay understanding , fatfaced , dry , unarduous , heavy of breath , his arms hairy , the office stinkingof cigars and of his sedentary career in old black leather . He was not actually unkind , in his goggles , and partly a man of thought  --  just as far as the difficulties that purify , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiry woe and clatter . And Mimi with fair face and hair , red cheeks , a cloth rose laying down its folds front and center of her hat , assisted by white and less serious flowers . 0 that red ! of summer walls and yet of fabric and the counters of stores . Also her demonish or ciliary eyebrows , so hard-set and yet she was also so confused . But the time was one of the highest opportunity , if I understood her spirit , having to do with that same powerlessness the doctor observed  --  thepowerlessness of women waiting for what will be done to them , and that way and none other to buy glory . " This injection causes contractions , " said the doctor , " and it may expel your trouble . Nobody can promise that it will , and sometimes even if it works you still need a dilation and curettage . The thing actressesin Hollywood describe in the paper as appendicitis . " " I 'd appreciate it if you would n't make any jokes . I 'm only interested in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw he was n't dealing with a timid little knocked-up factory girl who was grateful , he 'd think , for his wit and signal back to him dimly with a smile over the vast separating distances of real grief and danger . Some poor body in trouble from tenderness . But Mimi  --  her tenderness did n't have an easy visibility . You wondered what it would be , and after what terrific manifestations it would appear . " Let 's just keep everything professional , " she said.  |p257He  said , with offended dark nose holes , " Okay , do you want the injection or not ? " " Well , what the hell do you think I came all this way for , a cold night ! " He got up and put an enamel pot on the gas ring  --  a grizzly-claw collar of fires giving hot scratches . His handling of the pot was suggestiveof the laziness and sloppiness of his morning egg in the kitchen ; he dropped the hypo in , fished it up again with tongs , and was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this only works halfway , will I get it from you ? " He shrugged . Her voice began to ring . " Well , you 're one hell of a doctor ! Do n't discuss it before you start ? Or do n't you give a damn what happens to people after they take your injection ? You think they 're so desperate you do n't have to give a damn and they 're only fooling with their lives , is that the way it is ? " " If I had to , I might be able to do something for you . " I said , " You mean you do if you get paid . How much do you soak for it ? " " A hundred bucks . " " You would n't settle for fifty ? " she said . " You might find somebody who would . " He meant to show  --  and I thought it was genuine  --  that he did n't care . Non euro ! That was what came easiest to him . He would just as soon have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to his ideas . I counseled her not to talk money with him . I said to her , " That part of it is n't important . " " You want to go ahead with it ? Look , to me it 's just the same . " " Mimi , you can still change your mind , " I said for her own ear . " And where will I be if I change it ? On the same spot still . " I helped her off with her fur-collared coat , and she took me by the hand as if it were I that had to be led to the needle . At the moment of my putting my arm around her  --  feeling her need and wanting greatly to do all I could to meet it  --  she broke into sobs . The thing affected me too ; I caught it from her . So we held together like what we were not , a pair of lovers . However , the doctor would not let us forget he was waiting . Sorrowfulor tiresome , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watched how I would comfort her . Whatever there was to envy before , taking me as her lover , this was not enviable to him now . Well , he did n't know.  |p258But  Mimi had decided , and she was n't wavering ; these tears did n't mean that . She gave him her arm , and he sank the needle in it ; the hardlookingfluid went down . He told her she would have pains like birth pangs and had better go to bed . The bite for this was fifteen bucks , which she was able to pay ; she did n't want any money from me at the moment . Not that I had a lot of it . Going with Lucy kept me broke . Frazer owed me something , but if he had been able to pay he would also have been able to send money to Mimi . She did n't want him to be bothered about it . He was still raising money for his divorce . Besides , it was part of Frazer 's style not to know about such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening in the immediate view , more eminent . This was a part of him that Mimi 's satire was always aimed at , and yet she encouraged it as something precious as well as foolish . It was n't that he was specially ungenerous but that he put things off to give his generosity a longer and more significant route . Anyway , Mimi went to bed , cursing the doctor , for the action had already set in . However , it was " dry , " she said , and the cramps were n't going to effect anything . She shuddered and sweated , her bare shouldersthin and square above the quilt , and the childish form of her foreheadpainfully determined with lines , eyes greatly widened , strongly lighted blue . " Oh , that dirty , bloody gypper ! " " Mimi , but he said nothing might happen . Wait " What in the name of hell can I do now but wait when I 'm shot full of this terrible poison ? I must be caught strong , for it 's squeezing my guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Intermittently the spasms passed off and she found the spirit for a relieving joke . " It 's sitting tight , wo n't budge ; stubborn thing . While some women have to stay on their backs nine months to keep theirs . Listen to the radio . But "  --  increasing in seriousness  --  " I ca n't let it alone now and be born , with all the stuff I 've taken . It might be hurt . Groggy . If not , it might be dangerous because it 's so obstinate , and be a criminal . I think if he 'd be wild enough and kick the world around I might let him come . Why do I say he ' though ? It might be a girl , and what would I do to a daughter , poor child ? Still women  --  women . They do themselves more credit , there 's more reality in women . They live closer to their nature . They have to . It 's more with them . They have the breasts . They see their blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be vainer . Oh ! give me your hand , will you , Augie , for Chrissake ? " It was the return of the gripes , making her sit stiffly and squeezep259and bear down on my hand . With shut eyes she let the spasm pass through and then lay back , and I helped her cover up . Little by little the effect of the drug ended and left her tired in the muscles and belly , furious with the doctor and angry also with me . " But you know he did n't make any promises . " " Do n't be stupid , " she said , ugly . " How do you know he gave me a big enough dose ? Or if he did n't want me to come back and have it done the other way , so he 'd get more ? And that 's what it will have to be . Only I 'm not going to him . " Seeing how she was , fiery and sullen , though weakened , and wantingnobody near , I let her be and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between us , and of course he was on to what was happening ; in spite of Mimi 's efforts to keep him out , how could he miss ? He was young , about my own age of twenty-two , but ponderous already , a big , important , impatient face , irritable , smoky with thought that went out far . He was gloomy and rough . His life was rugged in there , that room ; he did n't like classes , his notion being that he could do all his own learning ; the room was foul from the moldering of old things and smelled of bottles he used for urine , because he did n't like to make trips to the toilet when he was working . He lived halfnakedin his bed , which all the rest of the room approached , heaped up with commodities and dirt . He was melancholy and brilliant . He thought the greatest purity was outside human relations , that those only begot lies and cabbage-familiarity , and he told me , " I prefer stones any time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humankind , I just do n't care about it , and if there 's one thing that 's sure , it 's that this world is certainly not enough , and if there is n't any more they can have it all back . " Kayo wanted to know about Mimi although she always baited him . " What 's the matter , she having it rough ? She has hard luck . " " Yes , it 's bad . " " But nah ! it 's not all luck , " he said  --  one of the things he could n't stand was that you should agree with him . " You notice people have the same kind of thing happen to them , over and over and over . " His attitude to her had something in common with the doctor 's ; it was woman 's trouble she had , and neither of them could place it very high . Kayo , however , was a much more intelligent man than the doctor , and though as he stood in my room on bare weight-flattened feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that large face from which everyone was reproached for letting him down and coming short of the mark  --  though , in other words , he was the hard figure of prej/udice , there was still in him an extra effort of justice , a channel kept open . " Well  --  you understand . Everyone has bitterness in his chosen thing . Bitterness in his chosen thing . That 's what Christ was for , that even God had to have bitterness in his chosen thing if he was really going to be man 's God , a god who was human . She also goes in for it . " He gave a heave of terrible impatience . " That was Christ . Other gods poured on the success , knocked you down with their splendor . Those that did n't give a damn . Real success , you see , is terrifying . Ca n't face that . Rather ruin everything first . Everything would have to be changed . You ca n't find a pure desire except the one that everything should be mixed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone acts out this disappointment in his own way as if to prove that the mixed and impure will and must win . " I was always impressed by him and his big horse 's eyes startled by wisdom or the shadow of it , as a horse may shy at a ridiculous thing the same as at an important one . I felt what he was saying . I knew there was truth in it , and had respect for him as the source of illumination ; even while himself he was in dark colors , some of smudge , and green and blue by the eyes , but some of radiance ; and , hands on his fat hips , he looked at me with a face in which some original beauty was turned down as a false lead . That this fact that all had to give in was acted out I could see , and the accompanying warning that to hope too much was a killing disease . Yes , pestilential hope that passes under the evils and leaves them standing . I had enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both drawn to Kayo 's view and resistant to it . No painted sky of the human theater for him , but always on the outside toward the diamond-drop true sky by means of the long , star-crawling clear fog of the medulla and brain , a copy of the Milky Way . But I had the idea also that you do n't take so wide a stand that it makes a human life impossible , nor try to bring together irreconcilablesthat destroy you , but try out what of human you can live with first . And if the highest should come in that empty overheated tavern with its flies and the hot radio buzzing between the plays and plugged beer from Sox Park , what are you supposed to do but take the mixture and say imperfection is always the condition as found ; all great beauty too , my scratched eyeballs will always see scratched . And there may gods turn up anywhere . " If you go into reasons , " I said to Kayo , " there may be reasons for these mixed things too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would n't try to live on a movie  |p261screen  . When you understand that , you 'll be on your way to something . You can be too , if I 'm not wrong about your character . You would n't be afraid to believe in something . What I do n't get is why you want to make a dude of yourself . It wo n't keep up though . " Mimi heard that we were talking and she called me . I went back to her . " What does he want ? " she said . " Kayo ? " " Yes , Kayo . " " We were just talking . " " You were talking about me . If you tell him anything I 'll murder you . All he ever looks for is proof he 's right , and he 'd walk on my chest with his big feet if he could . " " It 's you yourself that do n't keep your own secrets , " I said , trying to be easy about it , however . It was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at me , harsh , from the bent-metal bed with its so many cast-iron nuclei and iron ribbon bows . " What I say , I say , but I can tell you not to . " " Just take it easy , Mimi , I wo n't . " Nevertheless I had to ask Kayo to keep an eye on her next day , not knowing what might come up and worrying through it at the office and at the supper meeting of the Magnus Cousins Club that took place once a month in an oak room downtown . I tried phoning the house and could n't get anyone but Owens himself , who when peeved , and he was with Mimi , put on a Welsh accent I could n't penetrate , so that it was just wasting nickels to continue phoning . Lucy wanted to go dancing after the meeting ; I got out of that by alleging tiredness , which I did n't have to counterfeit , and cut out for home . Mimi was there , and she had happy news . Dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , she was sitting in my room . " I used my head today , " she said . " I started by saying to myself , Are there any ways to get this done legally ? ' Well , there are a few . One is if you go to an alienist and get him to say you 're nuts . They do n't want madwomen to be having kids . I once got off a rap that way so it 's on a court record . But I do n't feel like doing it now . You can go too far . So I decided , to hell with that stuff of putting on a wacky act . The other thing is that if your heart is weak or your life in danger they 'll do it for you . So I went to the clinic today and said I thought I was pregnant but not normally , and kept having trouble . There was a guy who examined me and thought he was pretty sure I had a tube pregnancy . So I have to be examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to operate . "  |p262This  was what overjoyed her . She already was banking on it . I said to her , " What did you do , bone up in a book on what a tube pregnancy was like and then go down and describe the symptoms to them ? " " Baby , what an idea ! Do you think I 'm such a daredevil ? And do you think you can walk in there , tell them any old thing , and take them in ? " " They can be fooled about some things at a clinic . That I can tell you . But watch what you 're getting into , Mimi . Do n't try to put it over on them . " " It is n't all my idea ; they think so too , and I have some of the symptoms . But I wo n't go back , I 'll go to that veterinarian . " I could n't keep watch over her the next few days , having a full calendarof suppers and gatherings , and the times I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six in the morning when I had to turn out , she was too sleepy to talk to me . When I went to wake her she seemed to know at once whose hand was on her shoulder and what the question was , and answered as though out of sleep , " No , nothing , no soap . " Winter was pouring on , late December , smoky and dark . Clobberingdown the steps in my galoshes these mornings of mist and smoke , usually running late , I made for the car line in the seeping-back of night from the bad filters of low sky . Nine o'clock , after the first rush of business , I could catch up with breakfast at Marie 's greasy-spoon , walled with decorative tin panels , one-arm chairs by the walls , no great amount of light because of the height of the fixtures . On a Saturday afternoon I was taking a break at Marie 's . She had the opera on the radio , tuned in from New York , and that eloquence turned loose did n't reach me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service formerly paid for , as when a Burgundian duke in prison in Bruges sent for a painter to alleviate the dark shutters with gold faces and devotional decoration . This kind of aid to people in trouble now diffused practically free , as in magazines or on the air . However , I did n't hear it well , except as powerful and formal voices . Sent by Happy Kellerman , a shoveler came to say that I was wanted on the phone by a lady . It was a nurse from a South Side hospital , calling with a message from Mimi . " Hospital ? What 's the matter ? Since when has she been there ? " " Since yesterday , " the woman said , " and perfectly all right , but says she wants to see you . " I told Simon , who listened to me with suspicion , irony , reprimand ,  |p263already  hard and waiting to spurn my explanation that I had to get off early to see a friend in the hospital . " Which friend ? You mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have too many irons in the fire . How are you mixed up with her ? I think you 're going a little too fast , are n't you , trying to keep up with two dames ? That 's why you look so dug-up lately . If one of them did n't haul your ashes you might make faster time with the other . Or is it more than an ash-haul job ? Ah , that would be just like you , to fall in love too ! You ca n't hold your load of love , can you ! What do you have to give for a piece of tail ? You ca n't climb in bed with a girl without feeling that you have to take care of her for life ? " " You do n't have to say all this , Simon , it does n't have any bearing . Mimi 's sick and wants me to come see her . " " As long as the boy is getting laid , I do n't see what 's such a rush to marry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Simon , out of Happy 's hearing ; and , strangely , his look got hung up on something that resembled satisfactionand pleasure more than anything else , and I saw that he had alreadyhandled the consequences of this to himself ; he 'd repudiate me , and it would do him no harm . As for his notions , the wedding night , of what we two would be able to combine and achieve , he had no doubt changed them , deciding that all should be the work of a single mind and authority . But I was not thinking of this much , but rather of Mimi in the hospital . I was sure she had gone through with her plan to trick the doctors . Late afternoon I saw her , in a ward ; I was in the door , and she was snapping her fingers from the distance and trying to sit up in bed . " You went through with it ? " " Oh , sure ! Did n't you know I would ? " " Well ? At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had an operation for nothing . It 's all normal . I still have the thing to go through with . " I did n't get it at first ; I felt block-headed and stupid . She said with devilish towering humor and plunging bitterness , " Augie , they all come in to congratulate me that I 'm going to have a normal baby . It 's not a fallopian pregnancy . The doctor , the interns , the nurses , they think I should be wild with happiness , and I ca n't even yell at them . I 've been crying . I 'm so crossed up . " " But why did you go through with it ? Did n't you know ? You inventedthe symptoms . "  | " No , I was n't sure . I did n't invent everything , I had some . Maybe it was that injection . And when they thought it might be in the tube I was afraid not to have the operation . Then I thought when they had me on the operating table they 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course they did n't , they 're not allowed to . That 's what it was all about in the first place . " " I realize . I realize . I thought I could crash the gate , I suppose . One of my bright schemes . " She was n't crying now , though in her eyes there were the crimson threads that tear salts bring out , and her nose was stung with them too , but she was not less but more , as was clear on her push-faced beauty , an aristocrat in her idea of the energy you should devote to love . " How long are you supposed to stay in bed , Mimi ? " " I 'm not going to stay as long as they think . I ca n't . " " But you have to . " " Oh no . It 's getting late . A little more and I wo n't be able to . You call that man and get an appointment for me for late next week . By that time I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , and I could n't help it , I showed my horror at such nerve to practice on one 's own body . " Oh , you think a woman should be more fragile than that , " she said . " I keep forgettingyou 're just about engaged to be married . " " But should n't you wait at least until they let you out ? " " They say ten days , and it 'll only weaken me to stay in bed that long . Anyhow , I ca n't stand the ward . And the nurses ' being so pleased about the blessed event . I ca n't put up with it . And I 'm beginning to be nervous . Do you have any dough ? " " Not much . Do you ? " " Not even half of what I need , and ca n't raise much . He wo n't touch me for a buck under the price , I know . Frazer has n't got anything either . " " If I could get into his room I could take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there worth good money . " " He would n't like that . Anyhow , you ca n't get in . " She broke her preoccupation to give me a look for my own sake , straight , and said with a laugh that did n't last , " You take my side , do n't you ? " I saw no necessity to answer . " You can see the point of love , I mean . " She kissed me feelingly , and with some pride in me . All the rest , the women , wan , visiting or gazing around . " Well , " I said , " we can raise this money . How much short of the hundred are you ? "  | " I 'll need at least fifty more . " " We 'll get it . " The easiest way I knew to raise extra dough  --  so easy I was rather proud of it  --  was to steal books . I needed to ask no one , and Simon least of all . I headed downtown right away . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ice ; and trembling in the factories , those nearly all windows , over the prairies that had returned over demolitions with winter grass pricking the snow and thrashed and frozen together into beards by the wind . The cold simmer of the lake also , blue ; the steady skating of rails too , down to the dark . I went to Carson 's on Wabash Avenue , the book section on the ground floor , warm and busy with a late crowd of shoppers under the Christmas bells and silvery ivies . I did n't as a rule loiter long , thus drawing attention . I knew what books I was after , a rare Plotinus , an English edition of The Enneads worth a whole lot of money , more than it was priced . I took the volumes down , leafed them , looked over the bindings , put them under my arm , and with fair ease made my way to the Wabash Avenue door . It was spinning slowly . I got into the quadrantthat opened up for me and was half through when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . I turned to see whether the cause of the jamming was the worst that could be , having in my mind already police , court , and prison , up to a terrible year in Bridewell . But behind me was Jimmy Klein , practically a stranger to me since the old days , but not a stranger nevertheless . It was he who had me caught in the brass barrel that the doors turned within , and he signaled me that he would release me , that I was to wait in the street . There was a good deal of practice in his regard , under the felt brim , and the hook of the forefinger downward , meaning precisely , " Stop outside . " By these signs I knew him to have become a store dick . Had n't Clem Tambow told me that he was working at Carson 's ? I was n't going to make a break . The first thing was to get free of the trap , and I surrenderedthe books to him in the street . He said quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there right away . " I saw his hasty back and hat as he ran in the circle of the door . His behavior was not angry , but he appeared to deal with what he had foreseenand been ready for . By the stoplight , in the crowd , I sweated in the cold air , weak and grateful after the passed danger . Grandma 's warning against Jimmy , that he was a crook , came back to me . He dealt , anyway , with lawbreaking . " Okay , " he said , returning . " You dropped the books and beat itp266when I hollered . I did n't see your face , but I 'm out looking if I can spot you , you understand ? Now you just go to Thompson 's on Monroe . I 'll be right behind . " I set off , drying my face with my silk muffler . In the cafeteria I carriedmy cup from the counter to a table . Presently he came too , and sat down . He considered me for a while ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd , stillish , a commentator . Yet on both sides , as much as the circumstances let it be , there was happiness at meeting again . " Was you scared in the door ? " he finally said . " Jesus , yes  --  what do you think ? " I said , smiling . " Same jerk as you always were . A train could hit you and you 'd think it was just swell and get up with smiles , like knee-deep in June . What 's all the happy joy this time ? " " Well , I 'm glad it was you , not a real dick . " " I am a real dick , only not for you , you fool . I had to chase you . I was standing with the buyer and you came right smack in our sights , two yards ' range . So what could I do but go for you ? But what are you swiping books for ? I thought they beat it out of us both at the same time when we worked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He almost killed me . " " And he made a detective of you ? " " He ? Shit ! I go where they put me and do what they tell me . " I knew his mother was dead ; that , limping and corpulent , she had sunk into coffin and gone down to grave . But what had happened to the others ? " What about your dad now ? " " Putzin ' on . He got married again after Ma died . It turned out he had a romance from the old country lasting about forty years . Is n't that something ? While he had eight kids by Ma and the woman had four by her husband , both eating their hearts out with love . She became a widow , so they went and got married . What 's the matter , you sur-prised ? " " Why , yes . I remember your father always being at home . " " Well , he had to go to the West Side sometimes , and when he did he had a transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Do n't be so rough on him , Jimmy . " " I 'm not against him . I 'd be happy if it did him good , but he stayed the same . He 's the same now . "  | " And how 's Eleanor ? She went to Mexico , I heard . " " Oh , you 're out of date . That was a long time ago . She 's been back a good while . You should visit her . You was her favorite in the old days , and she still talks about you . Eleanor has a big heart . I wish she was better . " " She sick ? " " She was . She 's working again , at Zarropick 's on Chicago Avenue where they make the suckers they sell in the stores next-door to schools . She should n't be working though . She got sick in Mexico . " " I thought she was going there to marry . " " Oh , you remember ? " " Your Spanish relative . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a sweatshop of leather goods , and he had Eleanor working in it for about a year while they were supposed to be engaged . But he was laying the other broads workingthere too , and he was n't really thinking of getting married . Finally she got sick and came home . She 's not heartbroken ; it was great to see another country . " " I 'm sorry for Eleanor . " " Yeah , she hoped to be in love . She banked a lot on it . " He was contemptuous beyond measure , not toward Eleanor for whom he happened to care a lot . No , perhaps for her sake , toward love , as to something that had undermined and debilitated her . " You 're kind of hard on it . " " I do n't think anything of it . " " But you 're married , Clem told me . " This innocence of mine pleased him . " That 's right , and have a son . He 's a winner . " " And your wife ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has sort of a hard life . We live with her folks , we have to . And there 's another married sister and brother-inlaw . Well , what do you think it 's like , with fights about who 's going to use the toilet or take down the wash , or cook , or yell at the kid ? There 's still another sister who 's a tramp and spreads on the stairs , so you can step on her in the dark coming home from the show , so there 's brawls all the time . What I get out of it is space in a double bed . Do n't you know how it is by now ? It 's all that you want from life comes to you as one single thing  --  fucking ; so you and some nice kid get to gether , and after a while you have more misery than before , only now it 's more permanent . You 're married and have a kid . " " Is that how it happened to you ? "  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family way , and I marriedher . " The path of wretchedness as Mrs. Renling had drawn it for me when she predicted what would happen if Simon married Cissy . " You 're set up like the July fourth rocket , " said Jimmy . " Just charge enough to explode you . Up . Then the stick falls down after the flash . You live to bring up the kid and oblige your wife . " " Is that what you do ? " " Well , it 's not much to me ; I give up on that . I do n't think I give her much of a bang . But what are we talking about me for ? You 're the wonder boy . And what the hell are you doing , or think you 're doing ? I died when I saw you glom onto those books . That 's a fine way to meet again . Augie , a crook ! " It was not all dismay ; in part he seemed glad of it . " Not a full-time crook , Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've heard about you and Simon , that you 're so successful . " " He 's doing fine  --  married and in business . " " That 's what I heard from Kreindl . And you was going to the university . Is that why you were copping books ? We catch a lot of students . Most of them do n't make a good impression . " I explained to him my need for money , letting him assume that I was Mimi 's lover , for otherwise it would have been difficult to make him understand ; and though it was curious to meet Jimmy as the cop that caught me , and I felt light with relief and one foot on paradox and all the spirited melancholy that came of that , I had to get on with my money-raising and the other things there were to attend to . However , Jimmy was aroused by what I told him , and his eyes and all the skin of his face expanded with concern and with the immediate determination he took . " How far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Listen , Augie , I 'll help you as much as I can . " " No , Jimmy , " said I , surprised , " I could n't tap you . I know you have it hard . " " Do n't be a dummy . Compare a few bucks to a life of grief . Say it 's for my own sake  --  me not wanting to see it happen to anybody I used to be buddies with . How much do you need ? " " About fifty bucks . " " Easy . Between me and Eleanor it wo n't be anything . She has some dough put aside . I wo n't tell her what it 's for . She would n't ask , butp269anyway why should she know ? You do n't have to tell me why you do n't put the bee on your brother . You would n't be stealing it if he 'd be willingto give it to you . " " If push came to shove I might ask him , but there 're special reasons why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great of you . Thanks , Jimmy ! " The extent of my gratitude made him laugh at me . " Do n't exaggerate . I 'll see you here Monday , this same time , and give you the fifty bucks . " Jimmy had no confidence that he could keep company with kind motives ; he was abashed by them . And I understood well that he wanted to defeat a mechanism as much as he wanted to help a onetimefriend . However that was , he gave me the money , and I made the appointment with the doctor for the end of Christmas week . Things were difficult to arrange . I had a date with Lucy that same night and could n't break it with Simon 's knowledge because I needed the car . Therefore , when I had left Mimi with the doctor I went down in great nervousness and phoned Lucy from a drugstore . " Honey , I 'll have to be very late tonight , " I told her . " Something 's come up . It 'll be ten o'clock before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had not much thought of me tonight . She whispered on the phone , " Darling , I ran into a fence and bent my fender . I have n't told Daddy . He 's downstairs , so I 'm stymied . " " Oh , he wo n't be so angry . " " But , Augie , I 've had the car less than a month . He said he 'd sell it if I did n't take good care of it . I had to promise there would n't be any trouble for six months . " " Maybe we can have it fixed without his knowing . " " Do you think I could ? " " Oh , probably . I 'll dope out something . I 'll be around late . " " Not too late . " " Well , then , if I 'm not there by ten , do n't expect me . " " In that case maybe I ought to get some sleep before New Year 's Eve . You 'll be on time tomorrow , wo n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomorrow at nine , in my tuxedo , and maybe even this evening . But I promised to help out a friend who 's having a little trouble . Do n't worry about the car . " " I do though . You do n't know Daddy . " Empty , I left the booth ; feeling stiff , and the soldier of my fears , and all that I did n't know had power over me.  |p270Stracciatella  was closed , and in the gaunt glass curled saxophones and guitars shrunk in their sides . Deeper , cracks of goblin light out of the spaghetti-feasting kitchen where the family sat . I waited upstairs in the corridor by the door , which , in time , I heard unlocked . Mimi passed through it alone , handed out , and it shut before I could see the doctor to question him . I could n't now , having to support Mimi , who tottered . She was only two days out of the hospital , and the variety of decisions she had made alone , not counting pain and blood loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was faint to such a degree that for the first time I saw her without expression , like a kid asleep on the excursion train , fatigued at night from picnicking . Except that when her head rolled on my shoulder and approached my neck , she drew on the skin of it with her lips , weakly , a reflex of sensuality . For the moment perhaps I was Frazer and she was confirmingthat no matter what complication , injury , foulness , she did n't back down from her belief that all rested on the gentleness in privacy of man and woman  --  they did in willing desire what in the rock and water universe , the green universe , the bestial universe , was done from ignorant necessity . As we stood at the head of the stairs , her lips at my neck while I clasped her and whispered , " Easy now , let 's start down easy , " a man came up from the street and I nervously thought I saw something familiarabout him . Mimi too was aware that someone was approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the shadow , not in the main light of the corridor , when he came up . Nevertheless we recognizedeach other . It was Kelly Weintraub , the Magnuses ' cousin by marriage who came from my neighborhood , the one who had threatenedme about Georgie . By the slow increase of his smile when he saw me , and what there was in the flesh of his mouth more jubilant than mere smiling , also by the setting of his eyes , more clear to me than the eyes themselves in this obscurity , I realized that he had me . He kr .. ; w . " Why , Mr. March , what a hell of a surprise this is ! You been to see my cousin ? " Who 's your cousin ? " " The doctor is . " " That makes sense . " " What does ? " " That you 're his cousin . " I could never run so far or plunge so deep that this man , this Weintraub , would n't have enough erotic line to pay out after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome teameo 's look , fleshy and brow-bentt while he swaggered a little at the knees . " I have other cousins also , " he said . I felt like hitting him , since I probably would never be seeing him after he had blabbed , but I could n't do it because I was supporting Mimi . It may have been the dilation of the senses by rage that made me think I smelled blood , raw , but the result in horror is what counted . I said to him , " Get out of the way ! " To take Mimi home and get her into bed was all I cared about now . " He 's not my boy friend , " said Mimi to Kelly . " He 's only going out of his way to help me out of trouble . " " That makes sense too , " he answered . " Oh , you dirty bastard ! " she said . She was too weakened to put in all the power of savagery she felt . Shaking , I carried her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . I loused things up for you . Who is he ? " " Just a guy  --  he does n't amount to anything . Nobody ever listens to him . Never mind about that , Mimi . Was it all right ? " " He was rough , " she said . " First he took the money . " " But it 's over ? " " It 's all gone now , if that 's what you mean . " The drive was clear of snow , and I went fast over the endless varietiesof black and smooth , along the tracks , through tunnels , lights streaming as if wind had gotten into a church and flown over the candles , sucking out breath , so much the speed fused things down . We arrived . I lifted her up the four flights , and while she was gettingunder the covers ran down to get an icebag from Miss Owens , who fussed with me about the ice . " What ! " I yelled . " It 's the middle of winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made in the refrigerator and takes electricity . " I stopped yelling , seeing that I had snagged a spinsterish trouble upsettingher by rushing in wildly , not thinking how I showed anguish . Calming down , I reasoned with her , turning on what charm I had on reserve . There ca n't have been much , the low charge in my trembling wires there was at this moment . I said , " Miss Villars has had a tooth pulled and it 's very bad . " " A tooth ! You young people get so excited . " She gave me the ice tray and I scooted back with it . Ice , however , did n't help much . She bled very swift , and she tried to keep it secret , but presently she had to tell me , as she herself , aston/ished , with open eyes , tried to keep track of it . She began to soak the bed . I was for taking her to the hospital at once , but she said , " It 'll get better soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Going below , I phoned the doctor , who told me to watch and he 'd tell me what to do if it did n't slacken . He 'd stand by . There was fright in his tone . When I pulled off her sheets and made up her bed with my sheets her hands came up to oppose me , but I said , " Look , Mimi , this has to be done " ; she shut her eyes and let me make the change , laying her cheek down to the hollow of her shoulder . There have great things been done to mitigate the worst human sights and teach you something different from revulsion at them . All the Golgothas have been painted with this aim . But since probably very few people are now helped by these things and lessons , each falls back on whatever he has . I flung the bloody bedclothes into the closet , and she noticed the energy of the swing and said , " Do n't be panicky , Augie . " I sat down by her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be like this ? " " Or even tougher , " she said ; and as her eyes were yellowish and lacking in moisture and her mouth was pale , it occurred to me that possiblyshe could n't grasp just how tough it already was . " But . . . " " But what ? " I said . " You ca n't let your life be decided for you by any old thing that comes up . " " A champion way to be independent , " I said , intending the words for myself , but she heard me . " It makes a difference what you go down from , do n't fool yourself . It does to me , now . Though , " she said , face frowning and then growingsmooth while she made the concession , " probably that is only if I come up again . If you 're dead , does it make a difference for what ? " I could n't bear to talk now , and sat quiet , watching . And as she had thought it would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stiff-spread on the bed , and I was less benumbed in the muscles . My thoughts were crumbled , for I had been having fancies about how I was going to get her into a hospital , knowing how tough it was in such cases , and I imagined pleading and being refused , and official highhandedness and being driven mad . " Well , " she said , " it looks as if even he could n't croak me . " " You beginning to feel better ? " " I 'd like a drink . "  | " Shall I bring you something soft ? I do n't think you ought to drink whisky tonight . " " I mean whisky . I think you could use some yourself . " I took Simon 's car to the garage and came back in a cab with a bottle . She took a good-sized slug , and I drank the rest , for now that I felt reassuredabout Mimi my own trouble came forward ; as I was crawling naked into my sheetless bed in the dark it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swig at the bottle for the sake of stupefaction and se'er . But I woke in the small hours , earlier than my usual rising time . Kelly Weintraub would never let me get by but would nail me . And what I felt about this more definite than general darkness and fear , like the unlighted gathered cloud that hung outside , I did n't know . I dressed in my yard clothes . The whisky was still working in me ; I was not used to drink . In the grimness and mess of her room Mimi seemed to be very hot but normally asleep . When I went to have coffee I arranged at the drugstore to have breakfast sent up to her . Watchfulness and care made me rocky that morning . The weather stayed black , undispersed soot sitting on the snow . Like the interior of something that should be closed . It was much more awful than sad , even to me , a native who did n't have much else to know . Out of this middle-of-Asia darkness , as fiat in humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on business , came trucks and wagons , dying nags inquiring through the window with their grenadiers ' decorations of velvet green or red , looking at us under the brilliant bulbs making out receipts and laying the dollars in the cash drawer . The dollar bills felt snotty and smelled perfumed . Simon kept examining me , so that I wondered whether Kelly had already reached him . But no , he was only keeping me under his severity , stout and red in the eye . And I was n't doing too well . It was , however , a short day , the last of the year . We were passing out little single-snort bottles of bourbon and gin and the joint got merry and jumping , peppered with these empties on the floor . Even Simon loosened up by and by . With the scrapping of the calendar and the old twelvemonth sagging off with his scythe and Diogenes lantern , Simon was after all on a new beginning . His summer troubles were well behind him . He said to me , " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you put on a tux with a head of hair as wild as that ? Go and see a barber . In fact , get some rest . You been balling it somewhere ? Take the car and go on . Uncle Artie is coming for me . Who tired you out like that ? It probably was n't Lucy . It must be thatp274that 's nothing to me if you have to do it that way . But I wo n't let you get me in trouble with the Magnuses . " " There is n't any reason why you should be in trouble with the Magnuses . Listen , I 'll tell you about this tomorrow . " " No , you wo n't . Not after tomorrow either . You 're not with me from here on . Just bring back the car . " " I 'll come by and tell you what this really is  --  " " Stay away , that 's the last and only thing I 'll ever ask you . " " You sonofabitch ! " I yelled with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ! " Padilla came running for me and called into the sitting room , " Hurry , cut out the gabbing . " Bawling , I shoved and kicked past the wicker or paper furniture and plunged out . " What 's the matter ? What 's the tears for ? This too much for you ? " I answered when able , " No , I had a scrap . " " Let 's go . You want me to drive ? " " No , I can . " We drove first to the hospital where she had had her operation . Soberer in the cold air , she said she would go in herself . We led her up to the emergency entrance and let her walk in , then sat in the car , hopingshe would not come out . But presently , through the gilded , frosted drops of the windshield , I saw her appear in the door and I rushed to get her . " I said  --  " " Why did n't they take you in ? " " There 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no room in a place like this for people like you . Why did n't you have the kid ? Go home and wait for the undertaker . ' " " Chinga su madre ! " Padilla helped me lead her back to the car . " I think I know a guy in a hospital on the North Side working in a lab , if he 's still there . I 'll call him . " I drove him to a cigar store and he went in to phone . " We should try it , " he said when he returned . " We should say she did it to herself . Lots of women do . He told me who to ask for . If this other guy is on duty . He 's supposed to be a good guy . " In lower tones he said , " We may have to dump her there and beat it . She 's just about passing out . What will they do ? They ca n't put her in the street . " " No , we wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you and throw her right back at you becausep277they do n't want her on their hands . They pick what troubles they want to help . But let 's use our heads . I 'll go in first and case the doctor . " However , we all entered together . I could n't wait in the car with her and was determined anyhow that they would take her in or I 'd smash everything in sight . So we went through the near-empty first rooms ; I made a one-handed grab at a guy in an orderly 's gray coat who advanced in the way . He ducked and Padilla said to me , " What the Jesus are you doing ! You 're going to queer everything . Now take her over there and sit down till I find out if this buddy of mine is on duty . " Mimi drooped on me , and I felt her heat in the cheek . She could no longer sit ; I held her propped until a stretcher was brought for her . Padilla had gone , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a cop on duty . Together with the orderly he came out of a side door with a cup of coffee , in blue shirt , even holding a club . " Now what 's the story ? " said a doctor . " Instead of asking , why do n't you take care of her ? " " Did you smack this guy ? " said the cop . " Did he swing on you ? " " He swung , but he did n't hit . " Conceivably the cop now observed that I wore a tuxedo. because he was n't quite so deadly packed in the flesh of the neck and small-eyed when he spoke to me . I was in the clothes of a gentleman , and therefore why should he take chances ? " What 's the matter with this woman ? What are you , the husband ? She does n't wear a wedding band . Are you related , or just friends ? " " Mimi ? Has she passed out ? " " No , she 's just not answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor hurrying before him . " Just bring her here and we 'll see what gives , " said the doctor . Manny gave me a great look of success . We got rid of the whole ugly sniff-nosed crowd wanting to be in on trouble and went with the doctor . As we followed Manny gave him a story . " She did it to herself . She 's a working girl and could n't have a kid . " " How did she do it ? " " With something , I guess . Do n't women make a study of these things all their life long ? " " I 've seen some dandies . But also I 've heard pretty stinking stories made up . Well , if the women live we do n't look for the abortionist , becausewhat good does it do the profession ? " " How does she look offhand ? "  | " A lot of blood lost is all I can tell until I look it over . Who 's this second fellow who 's so worried ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really smack that orderly and he 'd have had New Year 's fun in the calaboose with the drunks . Why is he in the monkey suit ? " " Hey , what about your date ? " said Padilla as he put his hand to his long face with shock . It was after eight by the smooth-pulled electric clock in the brilliant room we entered . " When I find out what 's up with Mimi . " " Go on . You better . I 'll be here . I have no date tonight and was staying in anyway . The doctor does n't think it 's so bad . What do you have on ? " " A ball at the Edgewater . " I stood waiting until the doctor returned . " It 's mostly blood loss and infection from the belly surgery , I think , " he said . " Where did she get that done ? " " She 'll answer your questions herself if she wants to , " I told him . " I do n't know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , who can be billed ? " Padilla said , " There 's money . Ca n't you see how good her clothes are ? " And he said to me , for it worried him deeply , " Are you blowing or not ? This guy 's engaged to a millionaire 's daughter and on New Year 's Eve he keeps her waiting . " " Write me a pass so I can get back tonight to see Mimi , " I said to the doctor . He made a perplexed face to Padilla about me and I said further , " For Chrissake , Doc , do n't fiddle around with me , but write the thing out . What 's it to you if I come back ? I 'd tell you my whole hard luck story but do n't have the time . " " Ah , go on , it 's no skin off your nose , " said Padilla to him . " A pass from me would n't do you any good in front . I 'm on now till morning , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I may be back before long , " I said . For I was sure that Kelly Weintraub , since he was talking , had already gotten to Uncle Charlie Magnus . But I reckoned also that he and his wife had not told Lucy , not on New Year 's Eve , when she was going to a dance . Later they 'd throw me out on my prat . But why had she asked me to come an hour sooner ? The dance did n't really begin until ten o'clock . I phoned her once more and asked , " Are you waiting ? " " Of course I 'm waiting . Where are you ? " " Not far . "  | " What are you doing ? " " I had to stop at a place . I 'll hurry now . " " Please ! " About that last word of hers I thought as I drove that it was not like lovers ' impatience , but neither soft nor hard . Turning too wide at the driveway , with a last-minute twist I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portico . Inside , on the turned-over heels of the yard shoes I had n't remembered to change , I walked to the mirror to knot my black tie and saw backward , by the drape in the living room , the tense belly of Uncle Charlie , his sharp feet prepared , and sitting waiting in the oriental mix-up of brass , silk , wool , and all that gave the place so much power , Lucy , her mother , and Sam , observingme . I felt there was a big machine set against me . But I had come in order not to disappoint Lucy , toward whom , given their chance , my feelings could have shone and warmed again . I expected poisoned looks , against which I was coated and immune ; at least , my greater trouble made such looks seem negligible ; and I was n't willing to be tagged for lascivious crime and false pretenses or whatever the counts were that they thought they had against me . By no means nervous , therefore , I judged that I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I could go any distance independent of brothers , relations , and all , provided that her impulse was a true one and she was , as she had always said , in love . This was the thing , for I saw that she had been worked on , though I did n't know how much she had been told . The large-mouthed smile she gave me , staying at her seated distance instead of coming to kiss me , was curious  --  that pretty sketch of charm , in lipstick , widening , the relative of the awful cleft , running the other way , of the schismatics in the sixth bulge of hell , hit open from the bottom and split through the face . Ah , dear face ! treasured as the representative of all the body which , though , dies away from this top delegate when it becomes too gorged and valuable . She , now so unearnest with me through her worked-up countenance , I saw she had been gotten to by her parents and that decisions had been made . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word had been spoken yet in this oriental assembly , and I had no pretext . I was still the escort , dolled up , if you did n't scrutinize me too close , like a chorus boy , in a boiled shirt , and thinking of nothing but courtship and dances . " Why do n't you sit down ? " said Mrs. Magnus . " I thought we were leaving right away . " " Well , Lucy ! " said her father . And on this signal she told me , " I 'm not going with you , Angie. "  | " Now or ever , " he directed . " Never again . " " You 'll go to the dance with Sam . " " But I came to take her , Mr. Magnus . " " No , these things when you decide to break them , it 's better to break at once , " said Mrs. Magnus . " I 'm sorry , Augie . I personally do n't wish you any bad luck . But I advise you to control yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome and intelligent young man . There 's nothing against your family ; I respect your brother . But you 're not what we had in mind for Lucy . " " What about what Lucy had in mind ? " I said with a rising throatful of rage . The old man was impatient with Mrs. Magnus 's effort toward queenly dignity and wisdom . " No dough if she marries you ! " he said . " Well , Lucy , to whom does that make the difference , to you or to me ? " Her smile spread wider and lost all other intentions in the single suggestion that it was she who had inflamed me and when hot I had dischargedit all upon someone else but that it really did n't matter since she was n't so little her father 's child , though a girl , that all that ardor in the car and in the parlor and with the lips and tongues and fingertips and the rest could make her really lose her head and be unwise . I could n't be sure just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her car . Now she confessed it . Her father said of course it would be fixed . As long as nothing else was broken , this being his delicacy about the hymen . But it was worth a laugh to him ; this way a threat and groan also escaping in his fatherly joy that she had remainedintact . There was nothing further to stay for . I was threatened by her brother Sam , whom I found near me when I picked up my coat in the hall , that he would break my back if I bothered his sister ; but with all his thickset hairiness and spreading keister , he could n't make it mean anything to me . I started the car , to which I also felt commitment ending , and drove to the hospital . Padilla had given Mimi blood , and he was lying down after the transfusion in the room where I had left him , sucking an orange ; his skimpy arm with its one curious ball of muscle taped , and his eyes , belowsurface indifference , black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is Mimi ? "  | " They took her upstairs . She 's still off her head , but this Castlemansays he gives her a good chance . " " I 'm going up to see her . How is it with you ? " " Well , I do n't think I 'll be sticking around now . I 'll be going home soon . Are you staying ? " I gave him the cab fare , for I did n't want him to bang all that long way to Hyde Park in a streetcar on a crowded holiday night . " Thanks , Manny . " He put the money in the pocket of his shirt , and suddenly he asked , surprised , " Say , what are you doing back from the dance already ? " I did n't stand and answer but went out . Mimi was in one of the maternity wards . Castleman said that there had been no other place to put her , and I thought that she more or less belonged there . So I went up . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a table was a little Christmas fir with lit bulbs and under it a box with cotton wool and nativity dolls . Castleman told me , " You can stick around , but do n't make yourself noticed or you 'll be thrown out . I think she 's going to pull out of it though she did everything she could not to except cut her wrists and take poison . " There I sat by her bed , it being half-darkness . Nurses coming to bring infants for the breast now and then , there were whispers and crimped cries and sounds of turning in bed , and of coaxing and sucking . I was open to feelings that had no obstacle in coming to cover me , as I was , in darkness and to the side , scorched , bitter , foul , and violent ; and these feelings receding by and by , I was aware of others full of great suggestion and of this place where I was east up . I began to breathe by my own normal measure and grew much calmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns , all that jubilation , it came in rather faint , all the windows being shut , and the nursery squallingcontinued just the same . At about one o'clock , alert enough to hear me stirring , Mimi whispered , " What are you doing here ? " " I do n't have any place special to go . " She knew where she was , hearing the infants cry . Her comment to me was melancholy , about whether she had outwitted a fate or met it . That was perhaps according as she was weak or strong toward what she had chosen and done , and in the truth of her feeling at the present moment , hearing the suckling and crying , and the night-time business of mothering . " Anyhow , I think you 're in good hands , " I told her.  |p282I  went out to take a stroll , looking at the infant faces through the glass , and then , no one interfering , the nurses probably in a New Year 's gathering of their own to snatch a moment 's celebration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , separate cubicles , and in them saw women struggling , outlandish pain and hugebellieddistortion , one powerful face that bore down into its creases and issued a voice great and songlike in which she cursed her husband obscenely for his pleasure that had got her into this ; and others , calling on saints and mothers , incontinent , dragging at the bars of their beds , weeping , or with faces of terror or narcotized eyes . It all stunned me . So that when a nurse hurried up to investigate who I was and what business I had to be there , she made me falter . And just then , in the elevator shaft nearby , there were screams . I stopped and waited for the rising light I saw coming steadily through the glass panels . The door opened ; a woman sat before me in a wheel chair , and in her lap , just born in a cab or paddy wagon or in the lobby of the hospital , covered with blood and screaming so you could see sinews , square of chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and covering her with the red . She too , with lost nerve , was sobbing , each hand squeezing up on itself , eyes wildly frightened ; and she and the baby appeared like enemies forced to have each other , like figures of a war . They were pushed out , passing me close by so that the mother 's arm grazed me . " What are you doing here ? " said the nurse with angry looks . I had no right to be there . I found my way back , and when I saw Mimi resting , much cooler , I cleared out of the hospital by the stairs Castleman had shown me and went to the car , new snow floating at my feet over the gray plating of ice . I did n't exactly know where I was when I started . I went slowly in the increasing snow , through side streets , hoping to come out on a main drag , and at last I did hit Diversey Boulevard in a deserted factorypart , not far from the North Branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon sacking in began to seem agreeable , I had a flat , at the rear . The tire sunk , and I dragged to the curb on the wheel rim and killed the motor . I had to thaw the lock of the trunk with matches , and when I got out the tools I did n't understand the working of the bumper jack . It was new that year , and I was used to the axle type that Finhornhad had . For a while I tried , though the boiled shirt cut me and the cold gripped my feet and fingers , and then I flung the pieces back , locked up , and started to look for a place where I could get warm . But everything was shut , and now that I had my bearings I knew that I wasp283not far from the Coblins ' . Knowing Coblin 's hours , I did n't hesitate to go there and wake him . When the yellow lamp flashed in the black cottage hall and he discovered who was ringing he blinked his eyes , astonished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could come by because you get up around this time for the route . " " No , not today . It 's New Year 's ; no presses working . But I was n't sleeping . I just before heard Howard and Friedl when they got in from a party . Come inside , for God 's sake , and stay . I 'll give you a blanket on the couch . " I went in gratefully , took off the tormenting shirt , and covered my feet with cushions . Coblin was delighted . " What a surprise they 'll have in the morning when they see Cousin Augie ! Boy , that 's great ! Anna will be in seventh heaven . " Because of the brightness of the morning and also the kitchen noise , I was up early . Cousin Anna , no less slovenly than in other days , had pancakes and coffee going and a big spread on the table . Her hair was becoming white , her face with its blebs and hairs darker ; her eyes were gloomy . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicalpessimism . Weeping and catching me in her arms , she said , " Happy New Year , my dearest boy . You should know only happiness , as you deserve . I always loved you . " I kissed her and shook hands with Coblin , and we sat down to breakfast . " Whose car broke down , Augie ? " " Simon 's . " " Your bigshot brother . " " It did n't break down . It 's a flat , and I was too cold to change it . " " Howard will help you when he gets up . " " Do n't have to bother  --  " I thought I might mail Simon the keys and let him come after his damned car himself . This angry idea was momentary , however . I drank coffee and looked out into the brilliant first morning of the year . There was a Greek church in the next street of which the onion dome stood in the snow-polished and purified blue , cross and crown together , the united powers of earth and heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand of sugar . I passed over the church too and rested only on the great profound blue . The days have not changed , though the times have . The sailors who first saw America , that sweet sight , where the belly of the ocean had brought them , did n't see more beautiful color than this . " Augie , it was too bad Friedl could n't come down from Ann Arborp284for your brother 's wedding ; she had exams . You have n't seen her since a child , and you should . She 's so beautiful . I do n't say because she is my child  --  God is my witness . You 'll see her soon for herself . But here , look , this is a picture from the school . And this one was in the paper when she was chairlady of the junior benefit . And not only beautiful , Augie  --  " " I know she 's very pretty , Cousin Anna . " " And why do you want to get mixed up with your brother 's new relatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this picture . She was your little sweetheart when you were kids . You used to say you were engaged . " I almost corrected her , " No , you used to say it . " Instead I laughed , and she thought I was laughing over those pleasant memories and joined in , clasping her hands and closing her eyes . Slowly I realized that she was shedding tears as well as laughing . " I ask one thing only , that before I die I should see my child happy with a husband . " " And children . " " And children  --  " " For the love of mike , let 's have pancakes . There 's nothing on the plate , " said Coblin . She hurried to the stove , leaving the pictures spread before me , albumand clippings ; at which I stared . Only to turn my eyes at last again to the weather.  |p285I  was no child now , neither in age nor in protectedness , and I was thrown for fair on the free spinning of the world . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , familiarity , and love can result in falsehood , this being thrown on the world may be a very desirable even if sad thing . What Christ meant when he called his mother " Woman . " That after all she was like any woman . That in any true life you must go and be exposed outside the small circle that encompasses two or three heads in the same history of love . Try and stay , though , inside . See how long you can . I remember I was in a fishmarket square in Naples ( and the Neapolitansare people who do n't give up easily on consanguinity )  --  this fishmarketwhere the mussels were done up in bouquets with colored string and slices of lemon , squids rotting out their sunk speckles from their flabbiness , steely fish bleeding and others with peculiar coins of scales  --  and I saw an old beggar with his eyes closed sitting in the shells who had had written on his chest in mercurochrome : Profit by my imminent death to send a greeting to your loved ones in Purgatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man was sassing everybody about the circle of love that protects you . His skinny chest went up and down with the respiration of the deep-sea stink of the hot shore and its smell of explosions and fires . The war had gone north not so long before . The Neapolitan passersby grinned and smarted , longing and ironical as they read this ingenious challenge . You do all you can to humanize and familiarize the world , and suddenlyit becomes more strange than ever . The living are not what they were , the dead die again and again , and at last for good . I see this now . At that time not . Well , I went back to books , to reading not stealing them , while I lived on the money Mimi repaid , and on what she loaned me when shep286was on her feet and working once more . Through with Frazer , Mimi had met Arthur Einhorn and had taken up with him . She was still waiting on tables . I got my meals at the joint where she worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given me , the fire- and water-spotted books I had kept in the original cardboard box . They had a somewhat choky smell . So if Ulysses went down to hell or there were conflagrations in Rome or London or men and women lusted as they did in St. Paul , I could breathe an odor that supplemented the reading . Kayo Obermark lent me volumes of poets and took me to lecturesnow and then . This improved his attendance . He did n't like to go alone . I ca n't be sure it is n't sour grapes that the university did n't move me much  --  I say that because according to the agreement I had made with Simon I was to have gone back in the spring  --  but it did n't . I was n't convinced about the stony solemnity , that you could n't get into the higher branches of thought without it or had to sit down inside these old-world-imitated walls . I felt they were too idolatrous and monumental . After all , when the breeze turned south and west and blew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomeivy some of the stages from the brute creation to the sublime mind seemed to have been bypassed , and it was too much of a detour . That winter I had a spell of the WPA . Mimi urged me to go and be certified . She said it would be simple , which it certainly was . I had the two requirements , being indigent and a citizen . The trouble was that I did n't care to be put on one of the street detailsI 'd see picking up bricks and laying them down , and with that shame of purposelessness you smelled as the gang moved a little , just enough to satisfy the minimum demand of the job . However , she said I could always quit if too proud to be assigned to this ; she thought it was n't a good sign in me that I had to have a clerical job ; I 'd be in better shape in the open air among simpler people . It was n't the people that I complained of , but the clinking on a brick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I went to apply because she felt obliged to take care of me , making me her responsibility , giving me money , and as we were n't lovers this would be unfair . Anyhow , I was certified and got a strolling kind of job that was about as good as I could expect . I was with a housing survey , checking on rooms and plumbing back-of-the-yards . I could fix up my own time card and soldier considerably , as everyone expected me to do ; in bitter weather I could pass the time in the back booth of a coffeepot until the check-out hour . Also , the going into houses satisfied my curiosity . Itp287was finding ten people to a room and the toilets in excavations under the street , or the rat-bitten kids . That was what I did n't like too much . The stockyard reek clung to me worse than the smell of the dogs at Guillaume 's . And even to me , as accustomed to slums as Indians are to elephants , it was terra incognita . The different smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . And all the imagination , passion , or even murder you could conceive were wrapped up in apparentsimplicity or staleness , with elementary coarseness of a housewifefeeling cabbages in a Polack store , or a guy who lifted a glass of beer to his white , flat-appearing face , or a merchant hanging ladies ' bloomers and elastics in the drygoods window . I stayed with this deal until the end of winter , and then Mimi , who was always up on these things , had an idea that there might be something for me in the CIO drive that had just started . This was soon after the first sitdown strikes . Mimi was an early member of the restaurant workers ' union CIO . Not that she had any special grievance where she worked , but she believed in unions and she was on fine terms with her organizer , a man named Grammick . She brought us together . This Grammick was no rough-and-tumble type but had points of similarity with Frazer and also Sylvester . He was a college man , softspoken , somewhat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punks but used to them , and causing you a sense of regret . He had a long chest but his legs were relatively short ; he walked quickly , toes in , slovenly in his double-breasted long jacket , a densely hairy , mild , even delicate person . But he was n't an easy man for opponents to deal with . He could n't be caught off balance , he clung hard , he was clever , and he knew a thing or two about deceit himself , Grammick did . I produced a pretty favorable impression , and he agreed I might make an organizer . In fact his behavior toward me was very sweet . I had an idea that my good impression was n't all my doing , but that he was trying to make time with Mimi . But I got to value Grammick for various reasons . Though he was so inconspicuous that he could come and go , not specially noticed around hotel lobbies and service passages , still when a matter came to a head he could act with authority and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated his consciousness in advance of rights and wrongs that had n't risen to view yet . " Yes , they 're hiring organizers . They want experienced people , but where are they going to find them ? The problems are piling up too fast . " " Augie is the kind of person you ought to have , " said Mimi , " somebody who can speak the workers ' language . "  | " Oh , really , does he ? " said Gramtnick , looking at me . It made me laugh to hear this advertised of me , and I said I did n't know whose language I spoke . It could n't have made less difference I soon learned when I began to work at the job . People were rushing to join up , and it was a haste that practically belonged to nature , like a change of hives , and , bent on their ends , they had that touchiness from being immersed in the sense of their own motion that causes striking and stinging . It must have resembled a migration , land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea was about justice . The big strikes had set it off , those people sitting down by their machines and holding parties , but grim parties . That was in the automobile and rubber industries , and of this I saw the farreachingresult , down to the most negligible pearldiver on skid row . I started out at a table of the union hall  --  which was n't the kind of rugged place you might picture but as solid as a bank building , on AshlandAvenue ; it even had a restaurant of its own as well as a pool parlor  --  just a toy , for the members ' recreation , nothing like Einhorn 's  --  in the basement . I was supposed to be Grammick 's inside man and take care of the telephone and office part of things . It was anticipated I would n't be busy above what was average and could gradually pick up what I needed to know . Instead there was a rush on me of peoplehaving to have immediate action ; some hand-hacked old kitchen stiff as thickened with grease as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and see his boss , subito ; or an Indian would bring his grievances written in a poem on a paper bag soaked with doughnut oil . There was n't an empty chair in my room , which was a room well apart from the main offices reserved for workers in the big industries . It made no difference how hidden I was . I 'd have been found had I been in a steel vault by the feeblest signal of possible redress , or as faint a trace as makes the night moth scamper ten miles through clueless fields . There were Greek and Negro chambermaids from all the hotels , porters , doormen , checkroom attendants , waitresses , specialists like the director of the garde-manger from flossy Gold Coast joints , places where I had gone with the dog-wagon and so understood a little . All kinds were coming . The humanity of the under-galleries of pipes , storage , and coal made an appearance , maintenance men , short-order grovelers ; or a ducal Frenchman , in homburg , like a singer , calling himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his card without taking off his gloves . And then old snowbirds and white hound-looking faces , guysp289with Wobbly cards from an earlier time , old Bohunk women with lettersexplaining what was wanted , and all varieties of assaulted kissers , infirmity , drunkenness , dazedness , innocence , limping , crawling , insanity , prejudice , and from downright leprosy the whole way again to the most vigorous straight-backed beauty . So if this collection of people has nothing in common with what would have brought up the back of a Xerxes ' army or a Constantine 's , new things have been formed ; but what struck me in them was a feeling of antiquity and thick crust . But I expect happiness and gladness have always been the same , so how much variation should there be in their opposite ? Dealing with them , signing them into the organization and explaining what to expect , was n't all generous kindness . In large part it was rough , when I wanted to get out of the way . The demand was that fierce , the idea having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to pull you from your clerical side of the desk to go with them . Instead I had to promise to investigate . " When ? " " Soon . As soon as possible . We have a big backlog . But soon . " " Sonsofbitches ! Those guys ! We 're just waiting there to give it to them . You should see that kitchen ! " " There 'll be an organizer out to contact you . " " When ? " " Well , I 'll tell you the truth , we 're shorthanded because there 's such a rush ; we have n't got enough men . But what you must do meanwhile is get ready , have your people sign the cards , and prepare your demands and grievances . " " Yeah , yeah . But , mister , when is the man going to come ? The boss is gon na call in the AFL and sign a contract with them , that 's some outfit . " I tried to discuss this danger with my higher-ups . Just then hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lacked time to deal with them , busy with retail clerks who were out on a big strike and with runaway dress shops in Chicago Heights and so forth , but they could n't bring themselves to turn down new memberships and aimed to keep them until they were prepared to devote the necessary time and money . In short , Grammick and I were intended to hold the line . I learned to do somewhat as he did . He would work sixteen hours daily for ten or twelve days at a stretch and then for two whole days he could n't be found by anyone . He spent that time in his mother 's flat , sleeping and eating steaks and ice-cream , taking the old lady to the movies or read/ing . Once in a while he slipped away to a lecture . He was studying law too . Grammick was n't going to be sucked away from all private existence . I went along with this rush , really needing some such thing now becauseof my blowout with Simon . After office hours I was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hotel clerks on night duty  --  those leafy nights of the beginning green in streets of the lower North Side where the car seemed to blunder as if without tracks , off Fullerton or Belmont , when the white catalpa bells were opening and even the dust could have a sweet odor . Many clerks especially asked you to come at night , when they could speak freely . The conspiratorialpart of it was fine ; and with the radical ideas then going , these people who were placed in a position to be thoughtful , since they were up all night , wanted the chance to say those self-rehearsed things that sometimes had been on their hearts too long . True and false light was distributed just about as usual , is my opinion . But it was n't my place to judge that , but only to advance the work . Some of these guys just plain meant business . I suspect they wanted me to be more dangerousthan I appeared to be . I know I seemed too fresh and well in color , not enough smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My manner was both slipshod and peppy . They were looking for some fire-fed secret personality that would prepare the moment when they could stand up yelling rebellion . And here instead I would breeze in  --  I knew sometimes that my color and the height of my hair , my relaxed way , would give offense . But there was n't any help for that . Occasionally they 'd even ask for my credentials . " Did they send you from headquarters ? " " You Eddie Dawson ? " " That 's right . " " I 'm March . You talked to me on the telephone . " " You ? " said Dawson . And I knew he had expected to see some sandy , suck-cheeked devil , veteran of coal fields or oil or New Jersey textile strikes . Yes , that at least  --  someone on whom it was evident that his first strength had been drawn out of him in the Paterson jail . " You do n't have to worry . I 'm reliable . " Then he resigned himself ; he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a messenger to the higher-ups who 'd be busy Guy-Fawkesing the Drake Hotel or the Palmer House  --  because it was that to Eddie Dawson , hauling up gunpowder in the tunnels . He would tell me , then , what he wanted my superiors to know and give me directives.  | " I want you to arrange a meeting with your top man down there  --  " " Mr. Ackey , you mean ? " " You tell him I can get the employees together , but before we go out on strike we want to talk to him , all of us . That 's to give my people confidence . " " Why are you sure you 'll have to go out ? Maybe you 'll get your demands . " " Do you know who runs this bedbug palace ? " " What , some bank ? Is it a receivership ? Most of these small joints  --  " " It 's an outfit called Holloway Enterprises . " " Karas ? " " You know him ? " " Yes , I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance man Einhornwho is his cousin-in-law . " " He writes the policies for this place . You know what kind of a joint this is , do n't you ? For quickies . " " Is that so ? " I said , observing that the big forehead , flushed and deeply vein-fed in the light cloud of fair hair , was covered with a sweat and that he wiped his hands the nails of which were manicured nails on his pink-striped shirt with an unconscious clutch . " If that 's a problemit 's a police problem . You do n't want the CIO to start a union of them , do you ? " " Do n't talk foolish . I mean I get the brunt of the trouble because I 'm night clerk . Anyhow , if you know Karas you can tell me how easy it 'll be to get our demands . " " He 's a pretty tough character . " " Now when I have the shop ready to go , you ask Mr. Ackey for a few minutes so we can talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , who did n't know Ackey well enough to say good day when passing in and out of the toilet . But I represented him . The situation was different in the hash-houses . I was more trusted and highly regarded . In the kitchens were old men  --  flophouse , County Hospital , and mission attendance inscribed all over them big and bold , and there was nothing like the resentment of a fellow like Dawson in that striped shirt , who was close enough to Karas 's condition to figure how he made profit , to hate and envy , and also to wish to be nifty at the track , to wear hound's-tooth checks , to have a case and binoculars and be seen with a proud-cheeked fine big broad . But take one of these old guys from a Van Buren Street greasy-spoon  --  I 'd be requested by him to come around by the alley , the large paving stones breathing fumes of piss , and signal him through the window . Whereupon he 'd go tight with caution and make me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes as a random motion . At last , by the door , we 'd have a shushing conversation that we could have had just as well after hours . Except that he would want me to have a look at his place of work probably . The angry skin of his dish-plunging arms and his twist horse-gauntness , long teeth and spread liquidness of eyes in the starry alley evening ; also that terrible state of food when you suspect it of approaching garbage that he brought out in his clothes and on all his person , his breath and the hair of his head just below me . Under the fragile shell of his skull he leakily was reasoning . And did it matter to him as it did to Dawson whether I looked like the organizer of his dreams ? He wanted to make his dim contribution to the righting of wrongs , so that it was enough for him that he could locate me in an office or that I would come down this reekingalley to talk to him and accept the lists he slipped me of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to hunt them up in their moldy rooms . Where I had been on altogether different errandswhile I worked for Simon , recruiting coal hikers . No use assumingthat I had reversed all and was now entering these flophouse doors from the side of light , formerly from that of darkness . Those times that I thought clearly of my duties I decided that I could n't consider personsso much but rather the one degree of advancement in which everybody could be included . Having a call in the old neighborhood one morning , I dropped in on Einhorn and found him in his sunny parlor office , in that peculiar , familiar staleness of coffee and bed , papers , his own shaving lotions and the powders of the two women . Mildred with her orthopedic shoes  --  she was polite but did n't like me  --  was already at her machine , heated and lit on the back of the neck , which had just been shaved up to the border where her potent hair began . Over the way , empty , were the windows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't find Einhorn in a good state though I was n't supposed to know it from his weighty face . For a while I thought he wanted to sit me out silently , until I went away . He breathed and felt of himself , looked out in the morning , smoked , nibbled , croaked off some shallow gas . He appeared melancholy and even savage . " How 's the pay at this new job of yours ? " he asked me , deciding to speak . " Fair ? " " It 's liberal . "  | " Then there 's good coming out of it , " he said with his dry decisiveness . I laughed at him . " Is that all you think ? " " At least that anyway . Kid , I do n't want to take away your zeal if you think you 're doing something . And remember , I 'm no conservative . Just because I sit here in a chair . This is no rich guys ' club . In fact I have less to lose than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extreme . I do a little business with Karas , but it does n't follow that my ideas have to be where my interests are . What interests ! Some interests ! He 's a knacker , Karas , he just bought a big new place in San An-tonio . " I was now convinced that something was wrong . " Then you think it 's a waste of time , what I 'm doing ? " " Oh , it seems to me on both sides the ideas are the same . What 's the use of the same old ideas ? On both sides . To take some from one side and give it to the other , the same old economics . " He had n't wanted to talk to me in the first place , but since I did n't go away he drove himself into the subject at first by irritation and then summoning up what he really thought . I was n't zealous , not as he implied , but I did feel called on to say , " Well , people get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right that it should be an illusion , or that they should be so grateful for being allowed to continue in their habit that they should n't ask for anything more . " " You think that with a closed shop you 're going to make men out of slobs ? If they have a steward to gripe for them ? Fooey ! " " So , " I said , " is it better to leave it to Karas or a gorilla of a business agent who takes graft from him ? " " Look here , because they were born you think they have to turn out to be men ? That 's just an old-fashioned idea . And who tells them that ? A big organization . One more big organization . A big organization makes dough or it does n't last . If it makes dough it 's for dough . " " If there ca n't be much sense in these big organizations that 's all the more reason why they should stand for a variety of things , " said I. " There ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on typing out statements . Einhorndid n't reply ; I thought it was the appearance of Arthur from the kitchen half of the house that stopped him , for Arthur 's brainy authority made his dad occasionally hesitate to sound off . But this time it was n't that . He came forward only briefly , but it was evident that all the nervousness and difficulty were because of him . In a black sweater , narrow-shouldered , his hands in his back pockets , he sauntered , an elderlyp294wrinkle on him that surprised me , and his eyes retreated with gradationsof dark into a very somber color of trouble . He put his head to the side , his bushy hair touched the doorframe , and the smoke of his cigarette escaped to the sun where it became silky . Though he was n't quite sure who I was at first , his smile was all the same suave , but also sick or fatigued . I was aware that Einhom , to the very cloth of his coat , was stiff to him and prepared to be curt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I realized also that this was why Mildred had been so cold to me and hitting her machine as though it were a way to get me to leave . Then a little kid came running from the kitchen , and Arthur held it with the clasp of a father , unmistakably , the kid swaying from his fingers . Behind , Tillie stood but did n't come forward . If I 'm not mistakenthey had n't yet decided whether they could keep this a secret , for I realized it was recent news to the Einhorns too , and it was touch and go about acknowledging the baby , a little boy . He , while Arthur turned back into the kitchen , came running to Mildred and secured himself on her knee . She picked him up eagerly , and his booties catching in her skirt , it rode up on her thighs with their little dark hairs . About which she was calm . Thither I followed Einhorn 's look . She kissed the boy with almost adult kisses and sought the hem to straighten her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Einhorn spoke harshly and turned to me with a stiff curve in the back of his neck , partly with intention to bully but also greatly bowed by trouble , and that great representative of him , his face , twitched with an impulse that darted in from a littleexploredplace . " That Arthur is married ? " I did n't know what to say . " Already divorced . It went through last week , and we did n't know anything about it . The girl was from Champaign . " " So you have a grandson . Congratulations ! " He looked strained , his eyes gemmy with the determination to sustainall , but his nosy face flat and with a light of pale unhappiness . " And this is his first visit ? " I said . " Visit ? She dumped him on us . She put him inside the door with a note and beat it , and then we had to wait for Arthur to come home and explain . " " Oh , he 's dear and sweet , " Mildred said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasping her neck . " I 'll take him any time . " At this from his second wife , which in effect she was , Einhom had all his cares come around to his first source : himself ; his sensuality . And he looked angrily struck by this thought for all his Bourbon pridep295of profile and reflected it to the very depth of his black eyes . Like the roof-crouched goblin of an old church , he looked , his hands covered with pale spots placed at the sides of his often purposeless-appearing pants . His hair had the wave of unstranded rope , and from the set of his head there was the sense of ruins forming up behind him . With no motion in his arms , he might have been a man in a cape or a bound prisoner . Poor Einhorn ! At any hour of his decline he could formerly have taken out the gilt bond representing Arthur , and now the spite had come upon him that the value had gone , like that of Grandma 's picturewateredczarist money . The gleaming vault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of squalor . Einhorn did n't even look at the kid , which was a jolly little kid that trod in Mildred 's lap . Tillie stayed out of sight altogether . I hesitated to show sympathy ; he 'd have thrown it back , though I was one of the few remaining people , I imagine , who 'd give him full credit on his old-time greatness . I served a purpose that way for him , that I was prepared to testify that it was true noble and regal greatness . But he himself now started out weakly , saying , " It 's not a good situation . Augie  --  you have some idea what capacities Arthur has . And before he can begin to use them , he gets into this  --  " " I do n't see what 's so wrong , " said Mildred . " You have a cute grand-son . " " Keep out of this , please , will you , Mildred ? A child is n't a toy . " " Oh , " she said , " they grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parents take too much credit . " Einhorn said to me in a lower voice , wanting no conversation with her , " I think Arthur hangs around your part of the woods . And there 's a girl named Mimi he 's interested in . You know her ? " " She 's a good friend of mine . " Quick his brows rose , and I interpreted the hope that she was my mistress and therefore Arthur could n't get into further trouble . " Not that kind of friend . " " You do n't lay her ? " he said secretly . " No . " I disappointed him ; there was also a very fine salt of condescension or mockery , only a glitter on the surface of his look , but I saw it . " Do n't forget I was practically engaged until New Year 's Day , " I told him . " Well , what kind of girl is this Mimi ? He brought her around a couple of weeks ago , and Tillie and I thought she was pretty tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intellectualp296or poetic direction , she could give him a pretty rough time of it . But maybe she 's goodhearted . I do n't want to tear her down needlessly . " " Why , is Arthur thinking of remarrying already ? Well , I 'm an admirerof Mimi . " " Platonic ? " I laughed but felt sullen too , for it seemed to me that Einhorn did n't want his son to succeed me as Mimi 's lover , or any girl 's . I said , " The best person to ask about Mimi is Mimi herself . But I was going to say that I do n't think she would be interested in a marriage proposal . " " That 's good . " I expressed no agreement . " Augie , " he said with a rich preliminary of the face which I knew belonged to business , " it occurs to me that maybe my son could fit into your organization somewhere . " " Is he looking for a job ? " " No , I am for him . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked . I could see Arthur stooping his weight on a desk in the union hall , one finger between the covers of his Valery , or whatever he was interested in . " Mimi could help him if she wanted to , " I said . " I got the job because she knew someone . " " Who knew someone , your friend ? " He hoped still , slyly , to trap me into confessing intimacy with Mimi , but he drew a blank . " Well , " he said , " you do n't mean to tell me you keep that bursting health without the cooperation of a dear friend ? " He was so pleased to have said this that his own troubles for a moment slipped his mind . But then the kid crowed on Mildred 's neck and he changed again from a sensual to a sad or austere face . It was a true guess that I had a friend . She was a Greek girl whose name was Sophie Geratis and she was chambermaid in a luxury hotel . She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership . They were earning twenty cents an hour , and when they went to their local to ask one of the head guys to put in for a raise he was playing poker and would n't be bothered . They knew he was in cahoots with the management . This small Greek girl was shapely every which way , in legs , mouth , and face ; her lips went a little forward and their expression was sweetened a lot by the clear look of her eyes . She had a set of hard-worked hands and she lived with her beauty on rough terms . I could n't for even a minute pretend that I did n't go for her . As soon as I saw her I thought that in the form of her eye-corners there was a personal hope of tenderness , and it got me . What I felt was tender too ,  |p297rather  than that heat that makes Nile mud of you , as like to crack as to be fertile . As soon as the women signed there was a wild excitement and uprushof indignation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working woman 's Thesmophoria of these pale people . They wanted to be led into a strike right away . But I explained , and felt as usual the creep over me of legalistic hypocrisy , that it was a case of dual unionism . Legally they were represented by the AFL and therefore another union could n't bargain for them . But when a majority of the employees was on the CIO side an election could be held . They did n't understand this , and as I could n't talk against their noise I asked Sophie to come out with me and I would make the position clear . The corridor being empty for the moment , we kissed at once , riskily . Our legs were shaking . She said under her breath that I could explain the whole thing to her later ; she would take the women away and come back . I locked up the office , and when she returned I took her home with me . We could n't go to her room . She lived with her sister and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be married in June , six weeks ' time . I saw the photo of her fiance ; he was a calm , responsible-looking gink . She thought she was being sensible , storing up pleasure so she would n't have any unfaithful craving once married . She was made very finely , all her little formations intricate and close and everything smooth . That was the happiness Einhorn took notice of , that I enjoyed in Sophie . Kayo Obermark had too much masculine respect to ask me about her utterances and noises , laughing and otherwise . But Mimi said , " What kind of dame do you have who carries on like that ? " She took a kidding tone , but I felt her nose was somewhat out of joint . " She brings her own cheering section . " I had no answer ready because I had never expected to be asked . " There was someone else looking for you the other day , " she wenton . " I forgot to tell you . It 's getting to be like a shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A young lady and a very pretty one , prettier than the noisy girl . " I wondered if it could be that Lucy had changed her mind . " She did n't leave a note ? " " No , she said she had to talk to you , and I thought she was very agitated , but maybe she was n't used to climbing stairs and was winded . " It did n't especially stir me to think that it had been Lucy . I had no further interest in her ; I was only rather curious about her visit . I took up Tinhorn 's suggestion about Arthur with Mimi . If Einhorn had found fault with her , she was violent against him.  | " Why , that old stinker ! " she said . " As soon as I was close to him for a minute he had his hand on my leg . I do n't like these old men who think they 're all sex . " " Oh , you have to understand him , " I said . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell ! Who says an old cripple has to be so randy ? " " He 's really a grand old guy . I 've known him from a kid , and he ; means a lot to me . " " To me he means exactly nothing , and he 's terrible to Arthur . " " Why , I think he loves Arthur more than anything in the world . " " That 's how much you know ! He takes it out on him all the time . Infact I have to help him get out of there because the old man is ridinghim to death on account of the kid . " " Is n't the mother coming back for it ? " " I ca n't make out from Arthur whether she 's a nice girl or a tramp . He 's terribly vague unless discussing ideas . What kind of bitch would ditch a kid  --  when she 's already had it ? Unless she 's sick . In the head , you understand . " " Does n't Arthur tell you what she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subject like this . His mind wo n't stick to it . " I said , " I wonder if you 've got him straight about what his father does to him . This has been hard for Einhorn to take . He banked on Arthur . So did Tillie . Now it 's just part of the Depression picture . Childrencorning back with their kids to live with the old folks in their flat . " " Why should it be any different for Einhorn than for the Poles or sausage-eaters on his street ? It would be bad if it were different and helped the old fool to put it over that he was entitled to a better fate than anybody around . But when the things that happen pour over everyone alike , then we can really see who is better and who 's worse . And then what 's so awful about what happened to Arthur ? Anyhow , he 's better than grazer. g'razer 's back with his wife , they tell me , and he probably wo n't pay me the money I lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did wrong , and he 's not the guy to admit that anything past , present , or future could be wrong . A girl was laughingover something in a book yesterday and showed me  --  you know , I hardly even read novels . It said , Error has never approached my mind . ' That was Prince Metternich . Well , it could be grazer . I do n't think he would ever in his life forget himself . He 'd never miss a train . Jesus , your Mr. Einhorn would love a son like that who always keeps his head and has a word ready to say and would never miss a train . But Arthur is ap299poet , and that old romancer really did n't want that to happen to him and be the father of a Villon or a Rimbaud . " " Oh , is that it ! " I said . " Well , what is Einhorn doing to Arthur that makes him so cruel ? " " He nags him night and day and looks for chances to insult him . Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy and whenArthur said it was n't good for it he told him , This is my house , he 's mygrandson , and you can get the hell out if you do n't like it . ' " " Oh , that 's rough . He ought to blow then . Why does he take that ? " " He ca n't leave . He has n't got any money . And besides he 's sick . He 's got a dose . " " Holy smokes ! He 's got everything . Did he tell you ? " " Well , do n't be stupid . How do you think I found out ? Of course he told me . " She smiled , and it was with the shine of real excitement . If I had n't known it before I would now have realized that she had decided about him . She was for him . " I 'll see him out of the woods , " she said . " He 's going to a doctor now , and when this thing is dried up he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With the kid ? " " No . Somebody will take care of the kid . What do you think ! Should he become a housewife because of that crazy girl ? " " If he had given her some money maybe she 'd have kept the baby . " " How do you know ? Well , perhaps that would have been best . Old people should n't bring up a child . " " Einhorn wanted me to get Arthur an organizer 's job . " She was too astonished at this even to smile but stared at me firmly , as if she wanted me to admit there was no limit to how grotesque peoplecould make themselves , and then she went about her business , washingout stockings and underwear . She would n't answer . Of course Arthur could n't anyway try to work while he had the clap , and I reckoned it was best to invent a pleasant reason for Einhorn , and I did , saying there was no opening just then on Arthur 's level . Even though it must n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his onetime vanity about Arthur 's superiority . But it did sound reasonable that they could n't offer someone like Arthur simply any old job that happened to be lying around . As for Lucy Magnus , and I could n't imagine who else it might be , I was merely , in the flattest way , curious , but I did n't give her supposed call much thought until a few nights later when there was a femininep300knock at the door . It came at an awkward time , when Sophie Geratis was sitting on the bed in her slip and we were talking away . Seeing her startled , I said , " Do n't worry , honey , nobody 's going to bother us . " She liked my saying this , so that it led to our starting to kiss , and the hooked links of the spring made that sound which goes in such a queer way with love , and which would have sent away anyone but this particularknocker . She said , " Augie  --  Mr. March ! " and not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some reason I remembered it and placed it immediately . I got out of bed . " Hey , put on a robe , " said Sophie . She was disappointed at the kissing ending when another woman spoke at the door . I put my head out and blocked the door with my shoulder and naked foot . It was Thea . She had said in that note I had n't seen the last of her , and here she was . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " but I 've already come a couple of times and I want to see you . " " Only once , I thought . How did you find me ? " " I hired a detective . Then that girl did n't tell you about both times . Is she in there with you ? Ask her . " " No , that 's not the same one . You actually went to a detective agency ? " " I 'm glad it 's not that girl , " she said . I did n't answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . That prompt face , different from what I remembered , delicate but not so firm in nerve , widecheekedand pale , her nostrils open wide . I recalled that Mimi had told me she was breathing heavily from the climb , but it must also have been from determination not to give in to disappointment at not finding me alone . She was dressed in a brown silk suit , kind of strikingly watermarked ; in spite of all , she wanted me to notice it . But at the same time , by her gloved hands and the unsteadiness of her hat of flowers , I was aware she was trembling ; and as the rustling in midoceanagainst the bulwarks is the slight sign of very great miles of depth and extent , the stiffness of the silk gave a small sound of continualtremor . " It 's nothing , " she said . " How could you tell that I was coming ? I do n't expect . . . " I felt no need to be pardoned , as if I should have been waiting for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was n't able to do that . I had thought back on her as an erratic rich girl with whom the main thing was to be rivals with her sister ; I could n't continue top301think so , for no matter how it had started it was now clearly something else . What sets you off not being good enough , you find the better reason once you have got going . This might have happened to her ; but I could n't tell which was uppermost , nobility or illness , whether she was struggling with personal objections of pride or the social ones about what is due a young woman from herself  --  those spiked things that press with such ugly sharpness on the greater social weakness of women . Whether she fought against or went out to look for a torturing occasion , I mean . But that was not all I thought of or felt by any means . OtherwiseI 'd have shooed her away , for I liked Sophie Geratis too well to give her up because I was merely interested or flattered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther Fenchel through her sister , for , as I 've said before , I have n't any grudge-bearing ability to speak of . But all at once Sophie was n't even in it . " What are you doing ? " I said , turning to her . She had put on her shoes . I saw her hold up her arms and the black dress fell on her shoulders . She softly battled her body into it , pulled it into place across her breasts and over her hips , and shook her face free of her hair . " Honey , if this is somebody you want to see . . . " " But , Sophie , I 'm with you tonight . " " You and me are just having a fling before I 'm married , are n't we ? Maybe you want to get married too . It 's just an affair , is n't it ? " " You 're not going , " I said . But she did n't listen , and when she went on to tie her laces covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knee . Because I did n't sound firm enough . And through this act of covering her bare leg  --  not sore , but with a resigned sort of drop of her head  --  she drew back those vital degrees from lover 's heat . To have her again I realized I 'd have to pass a large number of tests and perhaps last of all I 'd have to ask her to marry me . So I admitted in my private mind she was right to go since I could n't any longer honestly furnish that gay interest that had brought us together . A piece of paper slid under the door , and we heard Thea going away . " At least she 's not so brassy as to stand and look at me come out , " said Sophie . " Anyway , she had plenty of brass to knock when she could tell you had company . Are you engaged to her or something ? Go ahead and read your note . " Sophie took her conge and kissed me on the face but would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . So , undressed still , I sat on the cot in the May night air of the high window and opened the piece of paper . It gave her address and number and said , " Pleasep302call me tomorrow , and do n't be angry because of what I ca n't help . " When I thought how she had been ashamed for the jealousy rising to her face , and how rich in trouble the moment had been for her to hold fast while I came to the door naked and talked to her , I was n't inclined to feel angry at all . In fact I could n't help but be glad . Even though it was high-handed to go and proceed against Sophie as she did and assume that only she had the right grade of love . And then I had a lot of other notions , such as whether I was in danger of falling in love to oblige . Why ? Because love was so rare that if one had it the other should capitulate to it ? If , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought there was a good measure of poking fun , with , however , the fact that I was stirred in all kinds of ways , including the soft shuffle in the treetop of leaves just broken out of the thick red beaks . I thought the business of a woman must be only love . Or , at another time , only a child . And I let this be an amusement and an objectionin my light mind . And this lightness of mind  --  I could have benefited from the wisdom about it that the heavy is the root of the light . First , that is , that the graceful comes out of what is buried at great depth . But as wisdom has to spread and knot out in all directions , this can also refer to the slight laugh which is only a little of what is sent upwardby great heaviness of heart , or also to the gravity which passes off by performer 's flutter or pitch for laughs . Even the man who wants to believe , you sometimes note kidding his way to Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , in and out of the sheets . They still smelled of Sophie 's powder , or whatever she had imparted to them , so I slept wrapped in her banners , after a fashion . When I waked I thought it had been a peaceful sleep , and the early day was radiant . But I was mistaken . I remembered nightmares I had had of the jackals trying to get over the walls of Harar , Abyssinia , to eat the plague dead  --  from a book Arthur had left lying around , about one of his favorite poets . I heard Mimi below bitching and yelling at the telephone , though it was just some ordinary conversation . It was a fresh day , of beauty nearly material enough to pick up , with corners of the yard full of the heat of flowers grown in old iron and adapted cast-off boilers . That red which in the greater strength of the day would make you giddy and attack your heart with a power almost like a sickness , some sickness causing spat blood , spasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My face prickled as if I had been hit sharp enough to cause nosebleed . I looked and felt puffy and sullen , and as if I had a surplus of blood and foresaw trouble from it , that it would have to be let . Also my hands and feet were that ominous way . I went out half stone , but even the pave/ment chafed me through the leather ; my veins seemed slowed up with lead . I could n't bear being in the confinement of the drugstore even for the minute of time it took to swallow a cup of coffee . I dragged myself to the office in the poky cars , and when I had fallen into my chair with my legs spread out , I felt the toil of all my processes , down to the arteries of the feet as they sprung and shot with regularity , and I prayed I would n't have to get up . The door and window were open , the fustinessof the hard-trod place having its brief chance to clear out in the courthouse-hung tranquillity before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashcan barrage of Flanders tears the skies . And the lark , who does n't need to spit or clear his throat , goes up . But then the business of the day got under way , and in my harassed inability to keep up , it was like a double-quick-time stamping or dancing ; angry grim waltz in which the clutched partners were out to wear one another down ; or solo clog or tarantella of the hopping mad ; or the limper sway of the almost gone from consciousness ; the decorous sevillanas of the stiff whose faces did n't betray how their heels were slamming ; the epidemic kick of German serfdom ; the squatting kazatsky ; the hesitation-step of adolescence ; the Charleston . I confronted all the varieties , and as far as I could I avoided rising . Except when I had to go to the biffy to take a leak , or when I thought I was hungry and ducked below to the billiard room and lunch counter , where the green of the felt went to my head . However , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not emptiness of gut that was the matter . When I went back there was a fresh crowd waiting to do their stuff . Me the weary booking agent or impresario , watched by them with wrath and avidity , with tics , with dignity by some and booby-hatch glares by others . And what was I going to accomplish for them in the way of redress and throwing open princedoms by explaining how they must fill out a card ? Holy Lord and God ! I know man 's labor must be one of those deals figured out by Providence that saves him by preserving him , or he would be hungry , he would freeze , or his brittle neck would be broke . But what curious and strange forms he ends up surviving in , becoming them in the process . It was in my unusual state of feeling that I reflected about this , and meantime when I would remember the rustle of Thea 's brown silk it made me shiver . Along with the strange outcomes of the history of toil . Every chance I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grammick reached me before I could talk to her . He had to have my help in South Chicago that night in a gauze and bandage factory he had organized more or less in passing . For it was like a band of Jesuits land/ing where a heathen people thirsted for baptism in the dense thousands , thronging out of their brick towns . I had to fill a bag with literature and blanks and race over to the Illinois Central to get the electric train and meet Grammick at his headquarters in a tavern , a rough place but with a ladies ' and family entrance , for many of the gauze-winders were women . I ca n't say how they kept bandages clean in that sooty , pluguglytown built as though so many fool amateur projects for the Tower of Babel that had got crippled at the second story a few dozen times and then all hands had quit and gone in for working in them instead . Grammick was in the middle of this show and busy organizing . He was as firm as a Stonewall Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodshop instructor in a high school or some personage of the Congress party , somebody from that white-flutter India setting out to conquer the whole place flat . By the power of meekness . Most of the night we were up and were ready in the morning with everything necessary , committees on their mark , demands drawn up , negotiation machinery all set and the factions in agreement . At nine o'clock Grammick picked up the phone to talk to management . At eleven the negotiations were already under way , and late that night the strike was won and we went out to a wiener and sauerkraut shindy with the glad union members . It was all a matter of course to Grammick , though I was hopped up about it and full of congratulation . I went to the booth in the back with my glass of beer and tried Thea 's number again . This time I got through . I said , " Listen , I 'm calling from out of town where I had to go on business , otherwise you would have heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " When ? " " Afternoon , I think . " " Ca n't you come sooner ? Where are you now ? " " Out in the sticks , and I 'm coming as soon as I can . " " But I do n't have long to stay in Chicago . " " Do you have to go ? But where ? " " Honey , I 'll explain it when I see you . I 'll wait in all day tomorrow . If you ca n't phone first , ring the doorbell three times . " Like a strong brush the excitement went over me , and I stood up to it with shut eyes of pleasure , heat snarls at the ears and thrills descendingmy legs . I was dying to get to her . But I was n't able to leave yet . There were loose ends to tie up . It was important how even victors said au revoir . Grammick could n't leave until he had arranged the bookkeeping and everything was in order . Then , when we got back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters to report our success.  |p305This  was to advance me too , and was to get a knockdown to Mr. Ackey and be a little thicker with the officials , not stay a supernumerary . Ackey was waiting for us , not to congratulate us but with a redeploymentorder on his spindle . " Grammick , " he said , asking him instead of me , " is this your protege March ? March , " he went on , still not finding me with his eyes , as if the time was n't just ripe , " you 're going to have to do some serious trouble-shooting today , and right this minute . It 's one of those hot dual-union situations . They 're murder . The Northumberland Hotel  --  that 's a ritzy place  --  how many people do we have signed up there ? Not enough . They must have upward of two hundred and fifty in a place like that . " I said , " I think we have about fifty cards from the Northumberland , and most of those from chambermaids . But why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to strike , that 's what . This morning there have been about five calls for you from Sophie Geratis , one of the maids . There 's a strike meeting on right now in the linen room , and you get over there and stop them . The AFL is in there , and the thing to aim for is an election . " " Then what am I supposed to do ? " " Hold the line . You sign them up and keep them from going out . Quick now , there must be hell broke loose . " I snatched up my pack of membership blanks and lit out for the Northumberland ; a huge building , it was , with florid galleries and Roman awnings fluttering up to the thirtieth story and looking down at the growth of the elms and Haglike greens of Lincoln Park . I flashed up in a Checker cab . There was n't any doorman on duty ; the place glittered from the copper arms swelling on shields from either side and from the four glasses of the revolving door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd get far by way of the lobby , and I hurriedback to the alley and found a service entrance . Up three flights of steel stairs , as nobody answered the bell of the freight elevator , I heard yelling and tracked it through the corridors , now velvet , now cement , to this place , the linen room . The fight that was going on was between those who were loyal to the recognized union and the rebellious , mostly the underpaid women , who were scalding mad about the last refusal to raise them from twenty cents an hour . All were in uniform or livery . The room was white and hot , right in the path of the sun , the doors open to the laundry , and the women in their service blues and in white caps shouted and spoiled for war and struggle . They stood on the metalp306tables and soap barrels and screamed for the walkout . I looked for Sophie , who saw me first . She cried , " Here 's the organizer . Here 's the man . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hogsheads , with her gams wide apart in their black stockings . Hot , but grim and pale , and her black hair covered by the cap , her excitement of the eyes was all the blacker . She tried to express no familiarity in them toward me , so no scrutiny could have found out that our arms ever had crossed or hands ever stroked up and down . I looked around and could see my friends and enemies in a minute , jeering or urging , distrustful , partisan , indignant , crying . There was one gaffer dressed up as white as any intern , and a face on him like Tecumseh , or one of the painted attackers of Schenectady ; he wanted right away to explain a strategy to me , being very deliberate in that birdhouse of tropical screaming and laundry heat , to say nothing of the whiteness of the sun . " Now wait , " I called , taking Sophie 's place on the hogshead . Some began to yell , " We strike ! " " Now please listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hell ! Cry-eye ! What 's legal , that we get a buck and a half a day ? What 's there after carfare and union dues ? Do we eat ? We 're just going to walk out . " " No , you do n't want to do that . It would be a wildcat strike . The Federation guys would send other people to take your place and it would be legal . The thing to do is sign with us so there can be an election , and when we win we can represent you . " " Or if you win . That 's again a few months . " " But it 's the best you can do . " I broke open a bundle of cards from my bag and was distributing them into the waving hands when suddenly a bulge started from the direction of the laundry ; several men were fighting through the crowd , thrusting away the women , and the joint began to jump . Just as I realized that these were the enemy union guy and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slugged as I landed , in the eye and on the nose . I burst into blood . My buddy with the Indian 's beak stepped on me , but that was in his rush at the guy who hit me . As he pushed him back a Negro chambermaid raised me . Sophie thrust her hand into my pocket and pulled out my handkerchief . " Dirty gangsters ! Honey , do n't worry . Throw your head back . " There was now a ring of women guarding me , formed around the overturned barrel . When one of the sluggers made a start for me there was a lunge of the women for that place . Some had picked up scis/sors , knives , soap scoops , so the union guy called off his gorillas , and they came to position around him , who was small by contrast but dangerous-looking , if a runt , in his snappy man-about-town suit and his Baltimore heater . He appeared like somebody from the sheriff 's office who had changed to the other side of the law ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he would smell at close quarters like a drinking man , but that was perhaps the color of rage and not of whisky in him . Of unpreventable meanness , able to harm as much as he threatened . I could somewhat show that with those bursts of blood on my noserag and shirt , and snorting out more , while my stinging eye swelled to a slit . However , he was the one who had the law on his side , being the representative under contract of these people . " Now , ladies , get out of the way and let my men take over this punk who got no business here . He 's breakin ' Acts of Congress and I could swear a warrant against him . Besides the hotel could jug him for tres-passin ' . " The women screamed and showed their scissors and weapons , and the Negro woman , who sounded like a West Indian or some Empire Britisher , said , " Never , you bloody little peanut ! " So , while scared , I was also astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him , " said one of the goons . " He ca n't go everywhere with this nooky protection . " His boss told him , " Why n't you shut your trap ! " And he said to me , " What right you got to come here ? " " I was asked here . " " Damn right he was ! You bet we asked him ! " While the cooks in their long hats and others of the better-off faction hollered and scoffed and held noses and pulled the imaginary toilet chain at me . " Listen , you-all . I 'm your representative . When there 's any beefs , what am I for ? " " To throw us out when we come to the hall to ask you something , while your feet are on the table and you 're drinking from the bottle and pickin ' horses ! " " There does n't have to be any goddam mutiny , does there ? Now I see a lot of cards this sonofabitch meddler passed around , and I want you all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and them . " I said , " Do n't do it ! " The guy who had slugged me made a pass to push through the defenseof women and they heaved against him . Sophie pulled me away , through the back and along service corridors . " There 's a **30;7094;TOOLONG , and see whether we do n't get some rational support when all the facts are known . " Taylor Fitzhugh looked thoughtful . " How would you go about it ? " he wanted to know . " Through the Register , in the first place , " Andrew said . " They 've shown that they can be irresponsible . Let 's give them a chance to be responsible . Let 's call in the editors , give them the Library Report , the survey of real estate , everything we have , and ask them to present it fairly and fully . And of course the best assurance I can offer them that neither I nor the trustees plan any attack on the fraternities as such . " " I 'm wondering whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trustees , " Taylor said . " After all , it was addressed to them and presented to them . " " And I hoped , " said Andrew , " that perhaps you could take it on yourself to explain to them , if you approve . After all , we 'll have to act quickly if we want to cool off the excitement and put the whole thing on a plane of reasonable discussion . I suppose I could argue that the Report was a faculty project , largely , undertaken pretty much on my initiative to present a major university need from the faculty point of view . Of course , physical property does come in , and the trustees have the decision about that . " Taylor Fitzhugh considered the question dispassionately . His eyes had some kind of glint , whether of approval Andrew could not tell . " I 'm not sure about the correctness of the procedure , " he said finally . " But if you want to do it , I 'll defend you to the trustees as well as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do without your support , " said Andrew . " I 'll get John Abner to call in the Register boys as soon as possible . " Taylor sat silent a moment . Andrew felt himself being studiedby the disturbingly cool eyes that seemed not only to be reading his face but seeing something behind the central point of his scalp as well . " Are you sure you want to go ahead , Andy ? " Taylor asked him . " Go ahead ? With what I 've just suggested ? "  | " A brawl , as you put it , with Fraternity Row , may not be a pleasant thing . You 'll necessarily be in the forefront of it , you know . " The motive : warning ? Taylor saying that the trustees would let him push rashly into the fight , keeping aloof themselves , and if he lost , ditch him and be entirely right in doing so ? Or could it possibly be kindness , telling him he was worth saving for something better than a squabble with Badger Bratten ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , but you could n't find them until you had lived all the intervening pages ? No time to worry it out ; no time to be curious in subtleties . Too much curiosity self-defeating at best ; had to act , had to commit yourself when the lines were all clear and you felt committed . " I guess I feel , " Andrew said , " that my marriage to trouble has gone so far I can only say I do . ' " Taylor Fitzhugh smiled at that , with the nearest impression to unfeigned warmth he was likely to give . He got up , saying , " I 'd better leave you to your difficulties , Andy . You 'll want to see Dean Abner . I 'm sorry this came up , but possibly it will work out for the best in the end . " " I hope I can see you later in the day , " said Andrew , " to go over the details of our financing plan . We 're lunching together , anyway . It wo n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have money to build . " " I 'll be on hand at the Faculty Club any time you want . " " And I take it the trustees want me to go ahead with the policy for outside contracts ? I 'm seeing Professor Dorion at eleven . " " We think your plan is a sound one , " said Taylor , as Andrew followed him to the door . The Chairman seemed to hesitate briefly , seemed on the point of saying something further . He trained on Andrew again his bright , cool , equivocal look ; then the moment passed , and he went out . Intimations , auguries , passing him in the air like bat wings at dusk . Fourleafedclover , white-circled lucky stone . The raven himself is hoarse that croaks the entrance . Could we but look into the seeds of time . No time for the owls and apes of quotation . Get John Abner at once.  |p102He  went back to his desk and pressed the buzzer for Angela , but it was Miss Tozzer who answered , Myrtle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Abner to come up right away , " Andrew said , " no matter what he 's doing . " " Yes , President Aiken . " She vanished immediately . More attractive girl than Angela , but what could she do with a name like Myrtle ? Hephzibah , Matilda , Hep or Mat for short . Muriel Bratten 's fury when Badger called her Murie . Badger and his wrecking crew of club infants . Must n't go blind angry again . Had Badger , with all his comically assorted loyalties , really , in deliberate malice , played such an underhanded trick on him as this columnin the Register ? Not necessarily ; lent impetus , but studenteditors made the most of it . Anything for journalistic sensation . The bigger the row , the greater the feat . John Abner 's face was flushed and apologetic when he came in . He had the Register in his hand ; evidently he , too , had been nursing a wholesome rage but with an admixture of different motives from Andrew 's . " I 'm sorry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an outrage . I 'm afraid it reflects on me . I thought I 'd explained to those Registerboys that we expected them to consult us on any release involving University policy . I tried to put it on grounds of courtesy and loyalty as much as possible , appeal to their better nature , you know , make them feel adult and so on , but I thought I 'd made it clear  --  " " Forget all that , John , " Andrew said , " at least for the time being . You 're going to see the boys , of course ? You 've served a summons on them ? " " Three o'clock this afternoon . " " Well , good . I 'd suggest you bring them up here . We 'll hold the meeting in this office and I 'll sit in on it myself . " John 's face had the look of a parent who expected to give an unruly child a personal thrashing and suddenly feared that the state was going to substitute a public execution . He sat quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , feeling his grasp of it settle in his mind with repetition , as if it were a ball his wrist was learning to snap with expert looseness , the Dean 's long jaw and wide mouth began to registerp103admiration and the zest of coming encounter . One of the satisfactionsof office , an associate like John Abner . Not much for pure intellect , perhaps , but sensible , faithful , and receptive . Had a feeling of tact for the occasion . Could trust him to understand and carry out . " I think I get it , Andy , " John said , when Andrew had finished his exposition and felt his mouth , the oracular cave of wisdom and folly , satisfied with its roundness . " Two questions . Discipline separate and later . Meanwhile give them everything we have . " " Draw pictures for them . Make up charts . Underline the Report in red , blue , and green , " Andrew said . " Walk them over the grounds and pace off distances if necessary . As I said to Taylor , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a chance to be responsible . Say that to them , if you like . Or I 'll say it myself , if I get the chance . " John Abner looked thoughtful . " The trustees will let you publish the Report , will they ? " " Taylor has undertaken to defend me , " said Andrew . " He thinks it 's irregular procedure , but he told me to try it if I wanted to . Your blood be on your own head ' is his feeling , I guess . " John was still thoughtful . His mind was on more than Andrew had put into words or on something different . He got up restlessly , crumpling the Register in his ample fist . " Well , I 'll get to work , " he said , but he stood hesitating and frowning . " I 'm going to let the boys know who 's treating them this way , " he told Andrew . " They would n't have got off so easily with me . " " Stick to the main point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to prejudice the library business , if we can help it . " " I understand that 's what you want to put first , " John said . He hesitated again at the door . His voice blurted a little when he finally spoke . " Andy , there 's something I 've been meaning to tell you . It 's a bad time , I know , but it ca n't wait much longer . I can put it in ten words now as well as asking for an official interview . " He grinned , but his mouth was wry and he seemed unhappy . A day of omens , feather-drifting signs , impalpablep104brushes of supersensory intelligence on hair and nerve ends . Some of the omens had already revealed their purport . Andrew waited . " My alma mater , " said John , " has asked me to come back and dean it there , or rather asked me whether I 'd consider an offer favorably if made . " The logic of the situation presented itself instantly to Andrew 's mind . Too bad ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did he immediately think of it as though the loss would be his ? The loss would be the next president 's ; it would be Rowley 's . Well , there would be a. loss of friendship , of course , or at least of a man who was friendly disposed ; but he could n't stop at the moment to worry about a mere personal regret . " I 'm sorry for the sake of the college , " Andrew told him . " I can see that it 's an offer you 'll have a hard time refusing . I hope you know your work here has been valued , John . I 'll certainly tell the trustees about this and recommend that they do their utmost to meet the salary terms , if that 's the main consideration . But it will have to be your choice , John . " The Dean 's height looked down at him with eyes of animal gratitude and pathos . " If I knew I 'd be going on working for you as president , Andy  --  " Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand . This question of the presidency : he tried to forget it , and could n't , and when he succeeded in suppressing it in himself , it came at him from some other quarter . " If I knew we 'd continue in our present relation , " he managed to say , " I 'd be even unhappier than I am at the thought of your leaving . " John 's hand was on the knob of the door , but he did not open it . " I 'm glad Taylor Fitzhugh supported you , " he said . Leading remark . The presidency might have been mentionedduring Andrew 's interview with the Chairman of the Board . But it had n't been . Nothing said , only that moment of not saying , moment of equivocal augury when Taylor seemed about to speak before he left . " Taylor has been consistently helpful to me , " Andrew said . " Well , I 'll get to work drawing pictures and thinking upp105words of one syllable , " said John . He turned the doorknob and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to work for you that way . Of course it was John 's whole future at stake ; he had to look at the business from all sides , consider what the opportunities might be in every direction . But that was n't it ; the other job was bigger by every worldly measure . You had to recognize what really seemed to be true , that here was a man who looked on you as an important factor in his life choice . Could have told him to wait , could have said stall it off for a while , let me see what I can do for you here . Would have told him that if you thought you were really in the running , if you wanted to think of yourself as in the running . Could n't escape the question and could n't answer it . Too shy , too timid , too fastidious to think of yourself as a competitor ? Not good at competition ; best when you did n't think of yourself in that light . Or just afraid to admit defeat in something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted it ? Andrew sat down at his desk with the uneasy feeling that he had let John down , that he had perhaps let himself down . John had written him off as a lost cause . John had merely been hoping against hope , giving Andrew a chance to drop some intimation , even merely to show that he did not count himself out , did not give up his own cause as foredoomed . Well , John was right in putting a cynical estimate on his chances . The trustees would let Andrew blow himself to bits fighting Fraternity Row , and that would demonstrate his unsuitability . A sort of coolness in human affairs that could be resented , but resentment was childish . Would n't Andrew act the same way in their position ? That is , if he really had the temperament of an administrator . Are you sure you want to go on , Andy ? He wished he knew . Well , how much did it matter ? He could still be a professor . Perhaps they 'd grant him a Sabbatical leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some spells of travel , discovering whether he could still read a book or write a paragraph that was n't merely a memo approving or disapproving or stating that the policy should be such and such.  |p106It  was not going to be easy to conduct his interview with Raoul Dorion . The blow from the Register partly digested , John Abner at work putting the counterstroke in motion , Andrew remembered his original unsatisfied rage , and felt threatened by its revival . But he could n't get beyond the unappeasedcraving to strike some immediate blow and have it over with . Distasteful prospect : a long , petty conflict , a protractedexercise of patience and sweet reasonableness he was far from feeling . Anger was a seizure ; there was something spontaneousand whole-souled about it , the inevitability of any genuine passion . It leaped on a man from outside , or it sprang upward from his guts . It seemed to have a sanction because it was involuntary , because it came from some ordained seat of indignation in the universe itself . But its aftermath , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invader with their soft dead cushion , left a roil of small distracting emotions that made it even harder for judgment to operate . The flooded stream was no longer tearing at banks and bridges , but the current was still turbid and muddy , useless for fishing or for drinking . Well , in the matter of outside research contracts , he could stick to the lines of his policy , as he had worked it out with Angela and the Treasurer and the trustees . They were clear lines , impersonal and reasonable , and he could have confidence in his grasp of them . Andrew knew Professor Dorion by sight , but little beyond . He looked curiously at the face and figure he was going to confront as Dorion , with an exchange of good mornings , came in and sat down . All sizes and shapes ; the human species only less diverse than dogs in the variants it bred . Dorion was a smallish man ; about up to John Abner 's armpit . Face a very curious specimen : rather large for his frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes tilted outwardp107toward the chin . A face that offered little means of guessing at its racial or national origin , or for that matter its character . Except perhaps the eyes . The kind of glitter there you might expect in the eyes of a religious fanatic . The bright liquid pupils seemed to dilate and contract again within the splitsecondof Andrew 's glance at them . Just an impression , of course , the kind of startled impression that came from sudden eye-contact with a small animal when you were walking in the woods , the sense of that same ominous primitive aliveness . " I asked you to come in , " Andrew began , conscious that his tone was falsely trying to say that Dorion could be at ease with a friendly equal , " because I wanted to discuss a Universityproblem with you . " No response to his smile . " You are one of the faculty members affected by the problem , perhaps I could say one of the causes of it . " He tried out another smile . Still no response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching to see whether the attacker meant to close in . " It 's the problem of our outside research contracts . I want to say that of course I always mean to support and encourage research with any power I have , and so do the trustees . I think we should welcome contracts with the government or with corporations where they seem to be consistent with the best interests of the University . But a problem does come up . You may know that our outside contracts have been taken on largely hit or miss , mostly on the initiative of individual facultymembers , and there has been a good deal of inequality among the various departments in such things as overhead charges and the appointment of research assistants and their standing on the faculty . " It was coming fluently , Andrew felt , too fluently . His ears crackled with his own words , dry and abstract , scraping past like many leaves blown along a pavement . Nothing in the face opposite but impassive sardonic waiting . Dorion was behavinglike a class of stubborn students : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait , then . Doodle . Tap on the desk . Throw the burden to the class . Dorion 's face began to show faint unease . " I know nothing  |p108about  any research contracts except my own , " he said at last . " I do not concern myself with what my colleagues in other departments are doing . " There were lines of tightness at his mouth ; he was shaking a little bit . Scared , after all . One thing young teachers often failed to realize : people afraid of them . Pure effect of relative position . Shook a little himself with Taylor Fitzhugh , considerateas Taylor was . Men had to be aware of balances of power and authority ; could n't escape it . Who am I that anyoneshould fear me ? But give me a little brief authority and I become terrifying . Enough to make a man afraid of himself , afraid of making ridiculous missteps out of misjudgment of power , afraid of the temptation to bluster and pout his chest because his position told him that he could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his swivel chair and hoping that his attitude expressed limitless leisure and reasonableness , " I can assure you that the inequalities exist , and that the trustees agree with me that they present a problem . " Dorion spoke more promptly this time . " I have devoted myself exclusively to my own research , " he said . " As I am unaware of the inequalities you mention , I am unable to expressany opinion about them . " Would the man refuse every invitation to consider the problem generally , to identify himself with the body of which he was a member ? Well , try him once more , and try to break down the infernal prissiness of his speech . " I think you 're missing a chance to help and be helped , " Andrew said . " God Lord , Dorion , we 're all crew on the same ship here . I was a faculty member myself not so long ago . I hope I can still understand the interests of the faculty . " Attempt at naturalness : a failure . Approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be imposed on by such clumsy diplomacy . " Well , all right , " Andrew said , laughing . " I 'm administration , for the time being , and you 're faculty . I 'm trying to interestyou in a problem from my standpoint and at the same time giving you a chance to say how it looks to you . " " Very well , President Aiken , " said Dorion . The stubborn class goading the teacher : interest me if you can.  |p109Angela  's blue-covered report ought to be on the desk , but it was n't . Andrew pressed her buzzer . The other girl , Myrtle , appeared in the doorway . " Get me the report on outside researchcontracts , will you please ? You know the one I mean ? " " Yes , President Aiken , " the girl said , looking doubtful , and vanished into her office , " I can probably give you the main facts , though the chart shows them at a glance in a rather startling way , " Andrew said . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of overhead , and there 's the problem of research assistants . Your own contract , I may as well say , is the highest in overhead charges , and you have three assistants with faculty standing . Their position depends on the contract ; that is , the budget of your department could n't support them of itself . " " The nature of my research is such , and also its magnitude , " said Dorion , " that I could not conduct it without at least the number of assistants I have . " The attacker made an experimental circling move ; the animaldropped its bone and uttered a sound : do n't corner me . " If I 've read the catalogue correctly , " Andrew said , " all three of your assistants give courses in addition to their work for you . " One of the sore points : use of outside contracts to buildlittle factions and wield departmental influence . 1Dorion smiled , and an unexpected look of simplicity came into his face . " I 've been glad to spare them that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enriching our offerings in psychology . The budget of the department is hardly one I should describe as generous . " Return blow : administration unsympathetic and stingy towarddepartment . Andrew could laugh naturally this time . " If you think there 's been any unfairness about the budget , " he said , " you should make a case through your chairman . The trouble is , the trustees and I have to worry about what will become of these young men of yours when  --  well , let 's say when you have completed the research and the contract terminates . The University ca n't escape feeling responsible for their future . That 's why , you see , we 've got to have some central controlling policy about all these outside contracts . "  |p110That  was letting him see that you had a gun to shoot with , if he forced you to shoot . Hateful business . Odious to gloat when you had all the weapons in your own hands . But how could you altogether keep down the rising excitement of the game , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take cover ? " Even if the present project were completed , " Dorion said , " it would only be preliminary to further research in the field I and my assistants have opened up . The implications are limitless , President Aiken , limitless . " Even if . Was it possible the man had no intention of completinghis project , nothing really to complete ? " Suppose , " Andrew said , " we made the Treasurer 's office  --  this is one of the changes we contemplate  --  responsible for handling all overhead charges . That would mean that you , for example , would n't have to worry about bookkeeping any more . You could concern yourself entirely with your re-search . " The planes of Dorion 's face seemed to lengthen and rigidify . Was it fright in his eyes ? The focused glitter that stared at him made Andrew shrink back in his chair . " I could never accept such an arrangement . " Dorion 's voice flattened and cracked . " I have assistants to keep my accounts . Only I know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find it a relief to get all the business side of it off your shoulders ? " It was a weak question , Andrew told himself . The quarry had bared its teeth , and the attacker , for all his weapons , had taken an instinctive step backward . " The allocation of the money is of great importance , " Dorion said . " By careful savings in the overhead account , I pay a large part of the salary of my assistants . " He smiled again , with the same sudden artless simplicity , a secretive smile , but for once sharing his secret , taking a guileless pride of achievement in it . Andrew thought he had met before the naivete of supposedlyintellectual men , but here was an example on a new scale . A faculty member asking , in effect , to be congratulated because he was cheating with his accounts , deliberately makingp111false reports . And why not ? Was n't the University profiting by it to the extent of three courses in psychology it could not otherwise offer ? Incidentally , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research project and providedhimself with a faction by which to make trouble in his department . Miss Tozzer knocked and came in , holding a two-sheet letterin her hand . " I 'm not sure whether this is what you want , President Aiken , but I could n't seem to find the report you mentioned in the files . " She stood waiting uncertainly . No matter about the report and all its charts , dramatic little blows on the eye . Dorion had given him enough to deal with already . " I 'm afraid that is n't it , " Andrew told her . " Keep looking for it a while , will you ? But if it does n't turn up , never mind . I 'll ring again if I want it . " She went out , disappointed but relieved . " She 's a new girl , " Andrew said , considering where to strike in next . " The flu has halved my forces this morning . " What was in order ? A blunt lesson in business ethics ? Dorion sat waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't help asking whether Business Services Corporation knows  --  well , shall we say has ever raised a question about your accounts ? " " They have been very generous , " Dorion said . " Their understandinghas surprised me . They agree that the advancementof the research is the paramount consideration . I think I may say I have their full confidence . " " As a matter of fact , " said Andrew , " I 've an inquiry from them myself that I have n't known quite how to answer . " He was introducing the stroke he counted on to be decisive , and he watched to see what result the first suggestion of it would have . The result was immobility and silence , a silence that prolonged itself until Andrew had to do something . He reached toward the sheaf of letters on his desk and drew out the one on the letterhead of Business Services . He held it on his knee while Dorion 's face seemed to contract and recede into itself and his eyes were bright stylus-points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twop112points , " Andrew said . " One is the possible date when the researchmight be completed . The other , if I interpret the letter correctly , seems to suggest that they have some doubt about what to expect of it in the nature of findings . " He waited again , but the immobility of the face at which he looked did not alter and the silence went on . Dorion might at least have asked to look at the document himself . " They wonder whether I could tell you that they 'd welcomea progress report  --  well , of a more explicit kind than you seem to have given them to date . And that leads me to say that , while it certainly is n't my business to know the detailsof your research , I thought I might be able to help if you could let me know in a general way , or let some of your colleaguesknow  --  " That was enough . Do n't do all the talking . Toss the hint to the stubborn class ; make them worry it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a suppressed croaking voice . " I can only say that if the project were , as in my judgmentit should be , under government auspices , it would be classified . Highly classified . The results of my research have far-reaching implications . " Dorion leaned forward suddenly . His voice became a whisper of raised intensity . " Many people  --  many people would like to know the nature of my research . The consequences , if it reached irresponsible , if it reached disloyal  --  the consequences would be grave , very grave . I myselfhave enemies . I am watched . " Triumph , pride , importance in having enemies , in being watched . It was the moment when Miss Tozzer chose to open her door , timidly holding up to view Angela 's blue-covered report . Andrew repressed an impulse to laugh at the same time that his hackles tingled on his neck . " Thanks , Miss Tozzer , " he said , " but I guess I wo n't need it . I 'm glad to know the filing system works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at it . His head had revolved very slowly and his eyes had pin-pointed top113omniscient , fanatic suspicion . Two ways to cope with an imaginaryfootfall at night : one to whirl suddenly , catch it , and scare it off in its elusive pursuit . Dorion had chosen the other : turn with infinite deliberation and caution , confront it withreproachful long-suffering awareness . " I 'm sure you have no enemies at Rowley , " said Andrew . " Only colleagues who would like to help you in any way they could . I thought you ought to know that this letter had reached me . I 'd be glad to answer it  --  to give them any information could about the nature of your work and the date when it might be finished . " ijA slight dry cough , and a nervous motion of the hands . Dorion was giving way ; his attitude of tense and secretive immobility did not alter , but by some emanation it began to suggest defeat , pathos , and the search for escape . Andrew wanted to escape himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The chief obstacle to my work , " said Dorion slowly , " has , I will confess , been health . I can not work in an aura of suspicion . And there is suspicion , there is disloyalty , everywhere I turn . I have found it necessary to wall off the space in the laboratory where the project is conducted and to keep the doors locked . There is evidence that the locks have been tamperedwith  --  tampered with , President Aiken . The strain has begun to tell on me . I have even thought of suspending my work for a year , or of giving up the contract and turning over to my successors the data already obtained . " His eye suddenly suffused Andrew with a wholly new look ; a sudden helpless and defenseless charm broke from his face in a vivid burst . I am a child , it said ; I am bewildered ; I am being gnawed apart inwardly by forces I do not understand and can not control . The man sick , tragically sick ; but suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why he had gained professional footing , why a woman had married him . He was a case for a medical department . Rowley deficient inmedical services , especially psychiatric ; needed well-equipped center and adequate staff . No end of problems to force themselves on a president , if he were to go on being president ; onep114budding from another in runners , throwing down new roots like those plants that stitch themselves in little thickets over a whole span of ground . But all that was for another man 's future . What to do now with Dorion ? Temptation just to peel the ectoplasm off his neck , if he could ; relieve Dorion for a year on grounds of health . But what about his young assistants ? Could n't turn them out in the cold on short notice , men with small salaries and families . And what about Business Services ? Regret to report our Professor Dorion is ripe for psychiatry . Situations that should n't have been allowed to arise ; then you had to take the best way out you could find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of hand , then fire him , with all sorts of national dangers in consequence . Any way to keep Dorion 's contract going ? Probably not . Even if it could be saved , it would have to be renegotiated ; could n't have dishonestbookkeeping . Dorion could n't stay in charge . Best get him out as a start ; no other step possible . Let Taylor Fitzhugh know how nasty the entanglements might be . Humiliating , though it really went back to the old President who died suddenlylast spring . Acting President Aiken might have caught on sooner . Well , perhaps Taylor would support once more . " I can see , " Andrew said , " that you 've been working under a strain . After all , it is n't going to help the research , is it , to break your strength on it ? I wonder whether your own suggestionis n't the best , that is , giving it up , at least for a while ? If you like , I 'll answer this letter by saying that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of health and ask Business Services to conduct any further correspondenceabout the contract through me . " He waited for Dorian to speak but Dorion 's face had gone dull and secretive again . Well , he had fired one barrel of his shotgun , the false-kindness barrel ; he might as well fire the other , the barrel with the real blast in it . " I 'm afraid I ought to make it clear , " he said , " that unless we proceed in some such way , I shall be obliged to upset your current procedure a good deal . The trustees have decided on a policy and authorized me to carry it out . In the first place , all overhead  --  "  |p115Dorion  interrupted him suddenly . " Very well , President Aiken , I leave the whole matter in your hands . " Although he spoke in the voice of consent , it was a voice that grated and stung . The inscrutable forces in the man ralliedjust when they seemed to have gone slack and soft . He got up quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door he gave one slant glance across his shoulder and then he was gone before Andrew knew what to make of it . You start with the expectation that you are going to vanquisha rational opponent . You school yourself not to take pleasure in routing a man when the armory is all on your side . Then you discover that you have forced a sick mind to expose its vulnerability . The creepiness twined in the air and soured it even yet . Andrew took a deep breath and shook himself . Perhaps it had been a victory of sorts , though a morbid one.  |p115It  seemed obvious that Angela had departed for the day or was skulking in her office , emotionally incapacitated . Not much help in Tozzer ; the child was nervous and still felt new . Funny intrusion , just when Dorion broke out in paranoid stripes ; could n't have timed it better . Gave Acting President a chance to collect himself . Occasional usefulness of a blunder or piece of officiousness . Silly , the need for Angela ; dependenceon the secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? Just to think out loud , say a few words . Angela had the gift of listening and helping that way . Exasperating character . If she had to collapse , why not from some good clean virus instead of this pus of emotions ? State of irritation , complex of annoyances . Get to work , do something . If not , unsatisfied anger with the Register would begin to boil again . No mark on which he could legitimately wreak himself . Every situation called for patience , control , sympathy . Poor sick Dorion ; poor sick Angela . Call Taylorp116Fitzhugh ; go over plans for the final assault on their chosen source of money for the library . Might still be able to keep to the original schedule about that ; might even get the money . Try , anyway . A tangible gift would quiet a lot of petulant voices ; money a hard argument to answer . But somehow Andrew did n't feel ready to call the Chairmanof the Board . His own emotions were insufficiently composedto deal with that formidable composure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Register story again ; had n't given himself time to digest it , points he might have overlooked . Perhaps he could make some estimate of the roles played by the different parties , discover leads for guiding the conference with the editors that afternoon , implicationshe ought to make sure John Abner did not overlook . How much did Badger Bratten have to do individually with the exploit ? Perhaps call Badger and ask him bluntly , tell him in so many words it was an underhand and childish trick and might cost the University a gift for which plans had been laid and patiently worked on for months . No , best deal with Badger impersonally and at long range if he could . If he lost his temper with Badger , he would be more than usually ineffective . Afraid of Badger ? In some ways , perhaps , not all ; just part of his character to be timid about going on the aggressive . The wise thing to wait and see how the counterstrokeworked , full and fair presentation , if they could get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Register , feeling obscurely guilty of evasionand subterfuge , of not knowing what he meant to do or ought to do . The story was entirely as he remembered it . His first white explosion of rage had diagrammed and retained every salient of the enemy 's position . He turned the Register 's one folded sheet , looking for any spilled-over allusions or offshoottreatments the story might have received . Editorial , of course . Mild and moderate , carefully hedged . If it is true , as has been suggested , that this is the first step in an attack on fraternities , and so on . Unable to secure comment from administrativesources as Register goes to press . No doubt ; calculatedtiming . Dawn in smoke-filled news rooms . Still with the sense that he was evading , Andrew lookedp117through bulletins on athletic practice , reviews of motion picturesand newly released recordings , faculty announcements of dates for theses and prizes . The half-seen familiar typographicaloutline of a name teased his eye into focus : Badger Bratten . He looked at it , while it fuzzed and shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly impressed in black on glossed paper . There it was , no mistake : Badger Bratten , president of Bratten Chemical and Allied Products , Inc . He looked up at the head of the column : Chapel Notices . Too much insanity in one morning ; do n't tell me I 'm catching it . Must be a compositor 's jumble ; columns transposed . Opening lines made sense , though . Assistant Chaplain Reverend Cyril St. Clair announced this morning . Prominent leaders in government , business , current affairs . Hoped lay sermons every midweek chapel . First in projected series ' Wednesday , April 18 , Badger Bratten , president Bratten Chemical and Allied , prominent Rowley graduate , rumored in line board of trustees . Unbearable light inside skull . All the little demons in the universe working to persecute a man . Simply could n't endure every species of cross in one day . Fool ; immense , enormous , reverend young fool . Martin Holmes let him . What was Martindoing ? Joke ? Spite ? Retaliatory demonstration of what happened when deans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his body flex forward in his chair , saw his hand moving toward his telephone , began already to be appalled at what he was going to do . Some monitor inside was trying to warn , to restrain him , and only turning the clean white anger muddy and confused . " Get me what's-his-name , the Assistant Chaplain , St. Clair , " he said . He heard and felt the Tozzer girl jump in her seat ; something fell off her desk and landed with a sharp tap and then a purr of paper sheets scatteringon the floor . The inner monitor wrestled with the angel of wrath in a dark whirling combat . Finally a voice , deep , young , and confidently vibrant , spoke at the other end of the line . " Good morning , President Aiken . " " I just want to say , " Andrew told him , " that I just no/ticed  --  " His own petty repetition exasperated him further . " I saw in the Register the annoucement of your plans  --  " He was finding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why and how in the name of God and all His saints ? Did he have to plod through a whole exposition to get to the point that he was out of his wits with fury ? " For the series of lay sermons ? " St. Clair said , helping him out with self-assured enthusiasm . He no doubt thought he was going to be congratulated . " I hoped very much that you would like that plan , president Aiken . I think it will do much to attract more of our  --  " " I have n't anything to say about the plan itself , " Andrew broke in . " That 's entirely a matter of judgment for you and Martin Holmes . But I wish you would tell me how in the name  --  how you lit on Badger Bratten to give the first  --  to give one of these lay sermons , any of them . Did you know what you were doing ? " Silence at the other end of the line . Deflation , bewilderment . " I certainly had no idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm very sorry if it has  --  if I was unaware of any reason  --  " Triumph of the inner monitor . Andrew 's folly lay fully exposed to its hateful I-told-you-so . He could n't give St. Clair the reasons why he questioned Badger Bratten as an appropriatelay preacher . He could n't confide his vexations with Badger to the Assistant Chaplain , and they had nothing to do in any case with Badger 's right to a place in the series , or most of them had n't . Andrew shifted his ground . " May I ask whether you talked this plan over with Martin Holmes ? " " Mr. Holmes said he would be happy to leave it entirely to me . I got the impression that he really did n't want to concernhimself with it . " " Well , " Andrew said , " I 'm afraid F11 just have to say that from my point of view you had bad luck with your first choice . I think Mr. Bratten is conspicuously  --  perhaps incongruouswould be the word . But let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget I called up . I 'm sorry if I sounded ill-tem/pered . I was going to say that Dean Abner , among others , could give you suggestions in the future , especially about Rowley graduates . And I want Martin Holmes , as chaplain , to have final authority over the question of who speaks in chapel . It should be part of his duties . " " Would you like me to withdraw my invitation to Mr. Bratten ? " St. Clair asked . " It might be embarrassing , but perhaps I could find some excuse  --  " " No , " Andrew said . " That would clearly be impossible . Just forget that I said anything about it . " He hung up . He had thrown a tantrum and made a fool of himself . He had played the child . But how could a man bear it ? You simply had to give your wrath an outlet now and then ; it insisted , like sex or a boil . Funny how anger , whether it was right or wrong , noble indignation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just raveled out into frayed disgust . And finally , after a long enough interval , intop119laughter . Andrew picked up his telephone again and asked Miss Tozzerto call Martin Holmes for him . He tried to speak very gently and composedly , so that she would n't spill any more papers on the floor . " Martin , " he said , " I 've just been very rude to your assistant and left him completely mystified and made myself look like an ass . " " Are you calling me up to do penance ? " said Martin 's treble , sweetly humorous . " If I had the courage , Martin , I 'd scold you . I 'd assign a penance to you . " " I 'm sure I deserve many of them , " Martin said , sadly this time . " Have you seen the Register this morning ? " Andrew asked . " Have you read the announcement of your assistant 's plans for midweek chapel ? " " 1 only know the young man has begun his good works by Ali projecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that Badger Bratten is going to give the first of them ? " Badger Bratten in Martin Holmes 's chapel . Saint Martin.  |p120The  holy ghost . Andrew could understand why the sweet eerie voice fell silent , its music extinguished . There was no sound for so long that he began to regret forcing the old man to reproach himself so sharply . Well , Martin would have to know sometime . " I was quite unaware , " Martin said at last . " Had I been aware , Andy , I should have taken the liberty of suggesting that the choice was inappropriate . " " It would n't have been a liberty , " said Andrew . " I regard the chapel as your province . I ca n't relieve you of the duty of seeing that it is n't needlessly desecrated . " He listened again to a silence of gentle self-reproach . " I understand , " said Martin finally . " I 'm bound to say that while your language is strong , I do n't think it is too strong . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him up , rudely and abruptly as I did . I 'm not in a position to explain , myself . " " I 'll try , Andy . " Andrew thanked him and hung up . He sat back , tired , confused , ashamed . At least he felt purged . It would be a long time , he hoped , before he tried to act out of anger again . If only Martin did n't take it too hard ! It gave him a sphere , perhaps , a sense of being needed . Even a saint must n't disown his responsibilities . Perhaps , after all , the best thing was to laugh . As long as your luck and your nerve held out , the world forced its inexhaustible comedy on you , if you kept your wits . You had to accept yourself as a comedy , too , the sane part playing the laughing audience to the fool 's part . Who was it said that the young man who has not wept is a savage and the old man who can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go on in a job like this without reading a book.  |p121The  frame of mind was definitely more favorable . Andrew felt ready to cal Taylor Fitzhugh . He could be his collected self with Taylor now , if he ever was anything but an uncollectedsystem of phantasies and spasms . He made a motion toward his telephone , then noticed the hour . It was approachingtime for lunch . Perhaps it would be better to wait until they had eaten and pursue his business with Taylor afterward . He would n't be able to talk about it during the meal . The Chairman of the Board was a moderate man , no epicure , but it was part of a certain exactitude and fastidiousness in his nature to keep the lunch hour uncontaminated by business , a rule of fitness that he observed scrupulously . If the agenda reared its head at lunch , Taylor would be off on some parallel anecdote about a labor dispute committee or a hospital directors ' meeting . While Andrew was hesitating , Angela 's door opened and she herself appeared , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient who had come back to work prematurely from an attack of flu , but more cheerful and apparently in command of her faculties . " I thought you 'd gone home for the day , " Andrew said . She flushed . " Connie stopped at the office to ask me about a plumbing leak in one of the houses on Faculty Row . It seems that Repairs have done nothing about it , " she said , her cheeks hollowing briefly . " She took me home to your house and made coffee for us . I feel so much better after talking with her . Connie is wonderful to me . You both are . " Now , Angela , his mind began , none of that . No emotions . He took the breath that would have interrupted to ask her what was in the mail , but Angela hurried on . " I did n't know whether you wanted me or what you were doing . I thought I 'd just bring your letters in . And there 's a young man , Sam Delano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Andrew felt he ought to be alerted . If she had said Maurice Holsberg , for instance , her tone would have conveyed that she knew Andrew disagreed but she disapproved of Maurice as a troublesome eccentric . Pest was the word she had once bestowed on him . The way she spoke Delano 's name expressed another kind of interest altogether . " He 's waiting . I told him I thought it would surely be impossible for you to see him today . He has n't even asked for an appointment . But he wanted me just to speak to you  --  " " I do n't place him , " Andrew said . " He 's in psychology , an instructor , in Professor Dorion 's lab . " " Oh , " said Andrew , feeling the two ends of a connection approach each other in his mind . Raoul Dorion , yes , and something about a Mrs. Delano . " Did he say what he wanted to talk to me about ? " " He said it was personal . " " Well , tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have to interrupt us if it looks as though I 'd be late for lunch with Taylor Fitzhugh . " He never liked to make himself inaccessible to faculty members ; why be stuffy and self-important ? If a man were really going to be president , one of his satisfactions would be to make a better life for his faculty , if there were any way to do it . Lives of the academic apt to be meager at best . But a president had small chance to help . Amenities took a low standing on his duty list . Money , policy , buildings , organization . Angela started to go out . " Anything interesting in the mail ? " he asked her . " It 's light this morning  --  " " Good . Take away anything I can neglect . " " There 's one letter you 'll want to see , I think . It 's from  --  " " Put it on the desk , and I 'll run through it when this Delano leaves . " The connection came to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came face to face with across the hedge as he was walking home one afternoon last week . Theyp123would n't know for a long time yet whether it would be twins . The young man who came in had a serious , intent , finely bred face . He walked forward and shook hands with an engagingbriskness and one quick smile , an interruption of his air of nervous preoccupation . His bright metal-blue eyes seemed capable of rapid change from inward to outward focus . " Well , " he said , settling a little tightly in the appointments ' chair , " it 's kind of you to see me , President Aiken , without any warning this way . I 'll try not to take any more of your time than I have to . It 's a point of conscience that 's bothering me , I guess . I guess I 've come to make a protest . " Andrew received again the quick self-conscious smile from direct youthful eyes . He could n't help being charmed , whatever was coming . He felt a rising warmth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still totally unknown . " I 'm glad you 're making it openly , yourself , " he said . " So many get to me in more devious ways . " " Well , it 's about Maurice Holsberg , Professor Holsberg , " said Delano . " I heard on  --  well , I heard from a source I have to assume is correct that he 'd been forced to resign , and that 's what I want to protest . It seems to me it 's entirely unjust to him , and that it 's  --  certainly that it 's abrupt and irregular as a matter of procedure . " Andrew leaned back in his chair . Here was his cause for righteous indignation , if he wanted one , but all he could feel was amusement and the sense of being possessed by a charm entirely unconscious of its own force or existence . A very young man , credulous , all agog for justice . " Forgive me if I 'm taken by surprise , " Andrew said . He did n't want to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped came out as a chuckle . He wanted to pat the boy 's shoulder and tell him to go away and stop worrying , but he 'd have to speak more carefully than that . " No resignation from Professor Holsberg has reached me , " he told Delano . " And I can assure you that none has been called for . On the contrary  --  " Andrew stopped and considered . There were corn/plications in the case . Maurice 's own temperament ; could n't tell yet how he might jump , what he might even have done or said without Andrew 's knowledge . Delano looked crestfallen . " Then he has n't resigned ? " " Not in the least , unless he has told others what he has n't told me . His department has given him a leave for a week or ten days . It appeared  --  " Andrew would have to tell the young man something or send him away full of suspicion of the malign forces of administration . " It appeared that Maurice had reached a state of something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how overconscientious he can be . A temporary state , I hope . At any rate , we all agreed it would be best for him to take a short absence . I expect him back at work next week . No doubt you 'll see him then , and you can get his own version of this  --  may I say rather **26;7126;TOOLONG ? " " I heard , " said Delano , chagrined , " that he had been forced to resign . And the way he left for New York in midterm , without telling any of his friends  --  I had a letter from him the other day . It did n't say anything about resignation , that 's true , but it did sound  --  well , a little bitter about things here . " " I think Maurice has been subject to a whole set of emotionalpressures , " said Andrew . " I 've been afraid , to tell the truth , that any move toward a resignation would come from Maurice himself , and I 've actually been trying to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he comes back . " " Well , " said Delano , getting up with a nervous twist of his slight figure , " I guess I 've put my foot in it again . It 's a habit of mine . " " I have five minutes yet , " said Andrew . " Let me ask you something . Why should it be thought that I or whatever the evil forces are should want Maurice to resign ? " " Because the rumor is he 's a Communist , " said Delano , seatinghimself again . " I know that 's absurd , and I was going to offer to serve as a character witness , or what not . " " Well , " said Andrew , " I know it 's absurd too , and that gives me another reason for not wanting to get rid of him . On the contrary , I think it 's important for the University that he stayp125and carry on his duties , though I suspect the rumor makes it additionally hard for Maurice . Do you know where this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed less than boyishly open . His face clouded over and looked unhappy and defensive . " I 've heard it in various quarters , " he said . " If I remember correctly , " said Andrew , feeling his way , " you work in Professor Dorion 's laboratory , do n't you ? " " That 's right , President Aiken . " " On his contract research project ? " " Yes . " " Are you making progress with it ? " Andrew asked . It was not secretiveness that appeared on Delano 's face ; it was rather gloom , Andrew thought , and something like honestconfusion . Conflict of loyalties , perhaps . " I 'm not in a good position to judge , I 'm afraid , " said Delanoafter a silence . " My functions are pretty humble , feedingcards into a machine and tabulating data , that kind of thing . I get more satisfaction out of the course I 'm allowed to teach . " Andrew tried a quick addition of straws in his mind : authoritativesource , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ; Holsberg forced to resign for communism ; this young man , , evidently ingenuous , evidently troubled , a subordinate on a contract research project , no doubt pretty well isolated from the faculty , punching cards and tabulating results . The addition was suggestive , though it hardly yielded a clear sum . " Tell me , " he asked , " does Professor Dorion know MauriceHolsberg personally ? Are they well acquainted , I mean ? " " Not very well , as far as I know , " Delano said cautiously . Too much like spying to go any further . Did n't want to attempt Gestapo methods with his faculty . If they had to make an official investigation of Dorion 's fitness , Delano might have testimony that could be brought out by open cross-examination , with proper safeguards all around . " You 've been here at Rowley , let me think , one or two years ? " " Two , now , " said Delano crisply.  | " Have you been reasonably contented ? " " I could be , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , if  --  " " If what ? " " I did n't mean to trouble you with personal problems . I realize that a contract research project does n't give a man much standing on the faculty or chance of promotion . I have n't assumed that I 'd be here long enough to feel at home . I 'd like to get away from contract work and try my hand at being really a teacher , " said Delano , and blushed . He had exposeda desire and a hope . " These outside contracts do present problems , " Andrew told him . " All I can say is that I 've been thinking about them . " " Well , thanks for seeing me , " said Delano , getting up . " I 'm glad to have had the chance to talk this way . You 've eased my mind a lot , President Aiken . I mean about Maurice 's position and your attitude and all that . " Andrew watched his square slight back going briskly out . When he could get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see whether anything could be done for this abrupt charming young man who did not hesitate to beard administrationin its lair with accusations of injustice . It would depend , of course , on the assessment Delano 's department put on an instructor who had little chance to show his qualities , whatever they might be . Andrew got up , noticing the letter Angela had left on his desk . He read it on his feet . Then his eye went back to the letterhead , Samuel Holsberg , M.D. , neatly and plainly printed on a half-sheet of excellent quality . Letter typed by the man himself , single-spaced ; the typewriter carriage had jumped at two or three points . President Aiken , it seemed , had taken a very kind interest in Maurice . Efforts to keep him on the faculty deeply appreciated . Ten days in New York had done much good , or Maurice 's father hoped so , at any rate . But the boy was troubled , unsure of himself . Much as he disliked to impose on a busy and important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to consult in person . Could come to Rowley at convenience . Andrew took the steps to Angela 's door , opened it , andp127looked through . She was just rising to tell him he ought to be on his way to lunch . " Please write Doctor Holsberg for me , " Andrew said . " Tell him of course I 'll see him . Make it cordial . Tell him if he gives us notice , we 'd be glad to have him as our guest overnight . I do n't want to exile him to a hotel downtown . " " What about the Faculty Club ? " Angela asked . The suggestion made sense . If the Faculty Club was good enough for Taylor Fitzhugh , it was good enough for Maurice'sfather , though nobody could call it an earthly paradise . But Angela 's motive was open to question , and it just did n't do to yield to her too readily , even when she had a point . And if Dr. Holsberg stayed at the Faculty Club , he might be noticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " said Andrew , trying to suppress a degree of irritation , " just accept it that I want to be as friendly as I can . I want him at the house , for a number of reasons . " The words sounded a little short . He 'd showed his impatience despite himself . " Maurice 's temperament may be a nuisance at times , " he added . " I 'm sure it is to him as well as to others . But he represents issues that are important to the University , and if it 's possible to keep him at work in a stable frame of mind , it 's worth the trouble it takes . " Angela accepted his declaration noncommittally . When he was firm , she usually did . And she had the right secretarial touch ; she would compose a concise note in the tone he wanted . She seemed almost completely restored at the moment . When he got home at the end of the day , if he ever did , he could find out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not until after supper that Connie came and sat down opposite him in the living room and he began to feel as though he had come back to his base , to the mall station inp128the universe he could call his own , the indispensable retreat a man must have when he has spent his energy for the day and survived , when he wants to taste the quality of life in repose for a while , knowing that the energy must build itself up for another cycle of effort but disliking the thought . After the day 's hunt , dodging the saber-toothed tigers , bagging a few harmless gazelles to keep the pot boiling , man returns to his cave , his fire , his woman . Well , he had the cave and the woman , and there was no need tonight for the fire . April humidity , tangy and clean , free from the glutinous dog-day oppression of the later year , breathed at the open windows , disturbing a curtain gently now and then with its mild inhalation . They hardly needed light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp , and its yellowish diffusion was gaining against the blue daylight , all withdrawn into the upperair , that was still visible across the tops of the windowpanes . Andrew sighed , stretched his legs out , and achieved the partly successful relaxation that follows a deliberate effort to relax . It seemed to him that supper had passed in some sort of constraint ; not much said , Connie and Sally and he himself talking in forced spurts , as though they ought to talk but had nothing spontaneous to say . Tension somewhere ; he could n't localize it . He took it for his own leftover exhaustion that would n't let go as yet after a day of shocks and adjustments . The Register . Dorion . Hearing himself accused of injustice for throwing Maurice out . Badger as the new John the Baptist : invited to cry in the wilderness of midweek chapel and populate it with worshipers . He 'd like to see Badger eating a mouthful of locusts . " Well , I think we had a good meeting with the editors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaws tighten into a yawn . " Of course the milk has been handsomely spilt , but we did what we could . John Abner was effective . Created a nice suspense about the disciplinary side , really used it skillfullyto strengthen the propaganda . I think I was good my-self . " " Taylor Fitzhugh did n't seem to be alarmed a bit , " said Connie . " He called up at teatime before taking his plane . He was very cordial , Andy . "  |p129He  knew where she was leading him , but he did n't want his mind to go off on that tack ; do n't think about the presidency . " He 's always as cordial as a cold fish can be . " " Taylor a cold fish ? You do n't mean that , Andy . " " No , of course I do n't . He 's invariably considerate , and I suppose there 's warmth in his engine somewhere . I know there is . It 's just that in his position he ca n't afford to commit himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way it would be with me , Andrew 's mind went on for him , if I got what Connie wants me to have . A president can have no friends . At any rate , he has to be carefulabout having them within the official family , incessantly cautious about how he shows his friendships . Conduct everlastinglystudied . I have enemies ; I am watched . Lightest word taken amiss . Connie began to extract knitting from a bag , a sock , its heel rounding into conformation and bristling with needles like a porcupine . She was a pleasant sight sitting there in her tailored gray skirt and her fuzzy blue sweater over a white blouse with a gold pin at her throat , a little pink pond of flesh , in outline like a vertically tilted eye , peeking out between the clasp and the top button . And her face : decision in the features , the lines of character without the lines of age . Plenty of living there , but nothing down-in-the-mouth or defeated . She was frowning a little over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a resolved chord at the end of a row . Mystery : they used to say that was a woman 's power . Woman unknown a lodestone that moved the world by attraction ; then let her be known and the hunt to recover the original mystery in some other woman would begin , initiating the train of immature male follies and iniquities . Perhaps one form of maturity consisted in learning to do without that particular kind of mystery , learning to live with a woman who was as thoroughly known as one human being could ever know another . Though as to that , any such knowledge never ceased to run into surprises . The mystery was still there ; it shifted its base and altered its quality , but it did n't die . A point had to arrive when you knew approxi/mately what was coming every time and what was not , no more children for example , and still the links that bound a man and a woman could be just as strong . Well , physical habit and need , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part . A marriage was a building in which two very different builders collaborated , thinking they were working from the same blueprints , being led on by the mystery of the house not yet occupied . And then when it was built it had unexpected rooms and some of the expected rooms had n't found their way into the structure . The builders discovered their differences , and it was a shock . The house suffered damagesand sometimes cramped and chafed those who lived in it ; but it was the base from which a man moved toward everything he had perhaps accomplished , and when the energy for accomplishment began to run out , it was the base from which he could begin to let go without too great desolation of loneliness . When a man 's mind got working on things of that sort , it had a natural impulse to try them out in speech , to see whether they could n't be shared . But if he started talking about them , he 'd only hear his own voice going on and on , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd wind up further from her rather than closer . " I 'm afraid we 're going to lose John Abner , " Andrew said . Connie 's face looked up quickly and regretfully . " That would be too bad , would n't it , Andy ? You 'll try to keep him , wo n't you ? " " It is too bad , " Andrew agreed , " and I 'd feel a lot worse about it if I thought that I  --  well , let 's not get off on that subject . But he 's been asked to go back to his alma mater as dean , and I do n't see how he can refuse . I 'm not sure it would be right to try to keep him here by persuasion , even if he 'd be persuaded . " " I think he would be if you spoke to him . He 's devoted to you , Andy . And I do n't see why you 're so pessimistic about  --  " " I try to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my mind . "  | " But you ca n't , " said Connie . " You 're planning all the time  --  " " Why do you want me to be president ? " he asked her . " Because it 's a position of honor and because you 'd be good at it . " The answer was clear and simple and he should have been pleased with it . But he distrusted positions of honor and did n't know whether he 'd be good ; moderately good , perhaps . What could Connie have said to please him ? No honor ; a job to take as a duty or to see whether it could n't be used as an agency for humanizing the life at Rowley . And a higher estimateof his ability . If she was going to be wrong for his sake , why could n't she be extravagantly wrong ? Andrew grinned at himself . " What were you going to tell me this morning about Sally ? " he asked . Connie 's eyes and face came up from her knitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought she was up in her room dressing , " said Andrew , lowering his voice . " She is . " " Music with Jack Richmond again ? " Connie shook her head . Whatever the crisis was , it had to do with Jack Richmond , that much was clear . They heard footsteps cross the hall rapidly above the stairs , and the bathroom door shut . " She 's going out with another man , " said Connie . " Now that I think of it , I have n't been conscious of Jack around the house for several days . What 's going on ? Trouble of some sort ? " Connie listened . They could hear the sound of a running tap . " The child is upset . She did nothing but gloom around the house all day . I found her crying into her handkerchief when I came home this afternoon . " " What 's it all about ? Has there been a quarrel ? Is she that serious about him ? " " I think she feels that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she is serious or not . I think she refusedan invitation of his just so that she could try going out with other men for a while . You know how a girl  --  " The tap stopped running . Connie waited , and in a moment the bathroom door opened and Sally 's footsteps crossed the hall again . " Well , " said Andrew , " I began to get an idea that something  --  I hope she knows what she 's doing . I hope she is n't going to exchange the better for the worse  --  " Connie pursed her lips to hush him . Sally and Jack Richmond . In a vague way he 'd been expecting developments from that quarter . Those two polarized each other , he 'd been aware of that . And in a world where no young man was worthy of Acting President Aiken 's daughter , but she would have to marry one all the same , he rather liked Jack as the unworthy candidate . What was Sally up to ? She always seemed to be fighting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That distrust of her emotions Connie had suggested , aftermath of her first unlucky crush on a man ? Going out with someone else , glooming around the house , tears in the handkerchief . The female of it . Well , the young male had his circuitous approaches , too , incertitudes , advances and withdrawals , ups and downs like a bucket in a well , as Chaucer put it . He was leaning forward , and his face must have taken on one of his crazy abstracted looks . Connie was saying , " What are you grinning at in that strained way , Andy ? " He shook the imaginary sound from his cars . " Just my privatedelusion . I thought I heard the lecture bell ringing . " Connie looked almost worried . " Really , Andy , " she said . He could n't help laughing at her . The doorbell rang , genuinely ; no delusion this time . " You see ? Just prophetic , " Andrew said and got up to answer it . At the same time Sally came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll anwer , Dad , do n't you bother . " She sped by him as he reached the living-room door , and he came back , looking to Connie for enlightenment . Connie smiled at him enigmatically , and Sally led into the room ap133tall rawboned indistinguishable young man who seemed much less at ease than Jack Richmond . Andrew watched his daughter in amazement while she introduced him . More lipstickthan usual ? Something in the eyes to make them glitter ? Nonsense , of course not . Just extra pains with the costume in some way he would n't know how to detect . Unnecessarily attractive . The young man was saying lovely evening for April , really mild , and Sally was explaining that he was interested in painting . Connie was asking him about someone 's watercolors , and Sally was drawing attention to herself with a feverish vivacity quite unlike her natural briskness . When they were ready to go , she astonished Andrew by kissing her mother effusively and then crossing the three steps of rug to kiss him too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subterfuge or an experiment with her emotions , it was a violent one . As they went out , she dodged away from the young man 's proffered arm . Andrew sat down and again went through the deliberate exercise of relaxation . " Well , " he asked Connie , " what do you make of that ? " " She was afraid we would n't like him , " said Connie tranquilly . " She did n't want him to make a bad appearance . " " What did she do to herself ? All that glitter , where did it come from ? " " A girl likes to look attractive , " said Connie indulgently . " Well , I hope she knows what she 's doing . " Try to think about Sally , try to understand . Connie understood . He was probably incapable of it himself , except in a distant puzzled way . Too much to talk about with Connie to keep any one strand uppermost in mind . Day buzzed in his head like a swarm of gnats , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past again and again . " Tell me about Angela , " he said . " I thought she 'd flown for the day , but evidently you took her out and returned her all restored and refurbished . " " It 's just as well I interrupted my morning , though I did n't want to , " Connie told him . " Angela is badly upset . " " Man trouble again ? Some new prospect who 's letting her down ? " .  |p134Connie  's mouth drew tight . She peered hard at the work in her lap , then he felt her eyes on him with an estimating look that ought to prepare him for shock . " She 's afraid she 's going to have a baby . " " Oh God no ! " The explosion pulled itself out of him , and he was up on his feet , dragged after it , like a man who has thrown a rock so hard that he pitches forward off balance . His legs propelled him back and forth across the rug between the two sofas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has emotional trouble . The world 's enormous commonplace joke-in-bad-taste . You could n't put up with the terrible timewornbanality . " No , " said Andrew , " for God 's sake , do n't tell me that . The fool ! What 'll I do with her ? What will she do with herself ? I 'll have to fire her . Who is it this time ? Someone on the faculty whose wife does n't understand him . That would make it just perfect . Is she going to marry the man ? " " Now , Andy , sit down and listen intelligently . In the first place , nothing has happened yet . " " Nothing 's happened ? She 's got herself pregnant , and nothing'shappened ? " " I did n't say she 's pregnant . She 's afraid she may be . " Male against female . Fool to think even for a minute that you ever got past the mysteries and surprises . Fundamental male innocence against primordial first-hand gynecology . A man 's imagination incurably sensual , but it abstained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biology , unless it belonged to an obstetrician or a psychiatrist . Shrank from and hence put up a barrier of taboo . Let 's see , now , the girl could have a three-months ' miscarriage or she could have taken something . Angela , sitting around the office , waiting for some drug to work . Flop over and die on the spot or have convulsions . Water on the temples , chafe her wrists , call up the inadequate medical department and have her carted out . " I do n't know what you mean , " Andrew said . " For the love of God , do n't keep me in suspense . I suppose I was brought up a prude , but I thought I 'd gathered a few fundamentals  --  " Connie smiled at him . " Just the emotional upset , the fear , "  |p135she  said quietly , " will sometimes cause a delay . Angela is terrified , and it 's probably nothing more than that . " " Upset ! I should think she might be upset . Well , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that was frequent enough , I just did n't think . So I sit around the office waiting for Angela 's natural cycle to resume , wondering whether  --  my God , Connie , I ca n't take it . I 'll have to get rid of the girl , that 's all . I 'm not built so that I can stand it . I 'm too self-conscious . I 'll be look-ingat her and speculating all the time . How am I going to know ? I suppose she 'll beam at me some morning with that sickly worship  --  " " Now , Andy , stop living in Deuteronomy or wherever it was a woman had to be locked up and exorcised with charms and purification rites just because she was a woman every month or because she had a baby . Or do you want the poor girl driven into the wilderness like a scapegoat ? " " I ca n't help it , Connie . The fool . She should know how to take care of herself by now . It 's a moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . And why is n't it a moral question anyway ? An employee around the President 's office in a col-lege  --  " " Now you 're being really stuffy , Andy . It might have happened with your own daughter . Perhaps we 've just been lucky with her . " " Well , in Angela 's case it 's a consistent pattern . That is , we might as well have been in this jam with her previously . And if she 's done it once , she 'll do it again . " " It wo n't happen again with Angela . She 's had a bad fright , and she wo n't want another one . " " But we still do n't know that she is n't honestly pregnant . What if she is ? What is she going to do ? Is she going to marry the man ? Who is he ? Is it anyone I can put pressure on if  --  " " Now , Andy , you know you ca n't force a marriage on her if it would n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely unsuitable match . " " I like your word unsuitable . But what do you want her to do ? Go off and heroically bear a little bastard somewhere ? I tell you , Connie , it just ca n't be done . We are n't a home for unmarried mothers . "  | " Of course , if it really turns out that she 's pregnant , " Connietold him , " she must n't have the baby . " Andrew felt his legs give way . He sat down , as Connie had bidden him minutes before , sat down from amazement and weakness . He tried to absorb his astonishment by a study of her face . There she sat , a perfectly civilized woman , her brows drawn together a little as she stared down at her clickingneedles and counted , her expression unperturbed , but tightened into that unassailable firmness against which male resolution was a straw blown against a concrete abutment . You could n't get away from it : men and women were separate species in certain ways . There was some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was emotional , or if not that biological , or all three together . A vocabulary had n't been found to express the distinction . Vocabulary was a male art , though a woman could always find a way to say what she meant . All the proverbs on the subject were cynicisms , because they were male in origin , and it was the male who was baffled by the problem , could only rebound from the tribal solidity of wisdom that women inherited and preserved in their special constitution . Women had no moral sense : the male proverb . Was it that , or were they just less frightened by fundamental biology , less easily imposed on by convention ? " Connie , " Andrew said , " you really stagger me . If I understand what you 're saying  --  after all , this kind of indiscretion that Angela has committed does have moral entanglements , There 's at least one theology that says abortion is murder . There 's a life started , and you scotch it . Well , whatever you may think of that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've understood . It can easily be fatal , ca n't it ? Also , you ca n't always relievepeople of the consequences of what they 've done . None of us expects to escape the consequences of a blunder , if that 's the word for the case . And I must say , whether it 's timidity or hypocrisy or what you like , and I do n't quite think it is , I do n't want to be mixed up in an affair of the sort you seem to have in mind . I do n't feel called on . I 'm not sure enough of the moral ground . " " You do n't need to know anything about it , Andy , " she told him . " I can manage it , if necessary . "  |p137And  she could ; that was it . She 'd see that it was properly done , no quacks , no dirty hands , no backstreet emporium where abortions were sold in wholesale lots . A little humane graft , if you wanted to call it that , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion of dealing in illegal operations . Did n't they use a balloon sometimes to induce premature delivery ? Insert and inflate ? A vast abortive balloon of resentment inflating somewhere within his house of flesh ; it made his neck and skull ache , it pushed his arms up and set his fingers rubbing at his scalp . And it brought forth nothing ; no delivery , only a sense of defeat . He ought to oppose , show himself in command , talk Connie out of it , promulgate law , stand firm on refusal . But he knew he could not deflect her quiet decision . President of college charged with complicity in death of girl ; illegal operation al-. leged . No ; must have strength to reject utterly , protect Connie . But strength would n't come , was n't there . Maybe it would work out . Time yet . Blessing and honor on Angela 's periodicityif it did . " How did it happen ? " Andrew asked . " Did you get the story ? Who was the man ? If it 's anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need n't know the man at all , Andy . It 's better you should n't , you 're taking it so hard . " " Taking it hard ! How should I take it ? " And then the thought occurred to him : that young Sam Delano , the way Angela said his name , and she was really anxious for me to see him , for all her talk about telling him it was impossible . Youth and justice and naivete . It might n't have been his fault . When the drawbridge is down , you ca n't be surprised if the knight-errant enters the castle . Twins coming in his own family ; but of course not twins , or at least they would n't know yet . " Was it anyone on the faculty ? One of the younger set Angela is always trying to attract ? " " No , it was n't . You can relieve your mind of that . As a matter of fact , it was a man of a quite different sort , altogetherdifferent . " " Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " There 's no need to malign the poor girl . I do n't know where she met him , but it certainly was n't on the street . I judge he turned out to be a thoroughly unpleasant character . " " Well , how did it happen ? Did she tell you ? " " It 's pathetic and funny in a way , Andy . They were having a beer party in Angela 's apartment , and singing . A good many of her younger faculty friends were there . " " I can hear them , " said Andrew . " There 's a long , long trail a-winding . ' Angela 's voice winding with the best . Sittingon the floor in a circle . You could hear those banjos strumming  --  ' " " Apparently Angela thinks that  --  She told me that the man has a remarkable though untutored tenor voice . He 's evidentlya ballad singer they all admire . " " Did they come together through music ? " Connie 's eyes crinkled up and overflowed . She seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused or suffered contradictory emotions , her face would pinch togetherand moisture would appear . " She told me she thought he must be a gentleman from the beautiful way he sang I know my love  --  ' " " By her way of walking ' ? He could identify Angela from a mile off by her way of walking . Folding in the middle and toeing out to the side . " " She only does that when she 's upset . You 're being very hard on her , Andy . " " I 'm sorry . Tell me everything . He did n't behave like a gentleman , after all ? " " Apparently he drank too much , and when they all went home he left his guitar behind . Then he came back for it . " " One more song . Oh God , I ca n't bear it . " Connie 's eyes crinkled again . " Angela said she could n't imagine what she 'd done to make him think  --  said he would n't stop when she told him to , that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't kick or scream ? " " Why are men always so anxious to know whether a girl kicks and screams ? "  | " Well , honest to God , Connie , a little resistance  --  " " You know what a prude Angela is , and also how desperatelyshe wants  --  " Connie stopped , and it seemed as though her unfinished thought had said everything there was to say . Except , perhaps , that at the center of the world sits a monstrous artist of the tragicomic . The whole creation groaneth and travaileth together in a stale farce . But it really was n't funny ; Angela was pregnant , or might be . Perhaps it was just the agony of fright and suspense ; perhaps the farce would end in anticlimax . Nothing to do but wait and see . That far , at least , Connie was right . No action in which a president could indulge himself ; could n't fire anyone , could n't even take official cognizance . All he could do was try to file Angela temporarily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about . " This has been a day of days , " Andrew said . " And I have n't told you the full scope of its horrors yet . I do n't know how carefully you looked at the Register this morning . Did you notice what our new Assistant Chaplain has been up to ? " " No . What ? " " He 's arranged for a series of lay sermons by what he calls leaders of industry and government and so on . The first is due next week , and it 's going to be  --  I was so incensed when I saw it , honestly , Connie , I called him up on the spur of the moment and was very rude and senseless about it . " " Who is it going to be ? " " I ca n't say it . The idea sticks in my throat . Can you guess ? " " No . " " Badger Bratten . " Connie gratified him by looking startled . " Of course he could n't know what he was doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . That 's why I was a fool to call him up in a temper when I could n't explain what I was angry about . I ca n't forgive Martin Holmes for washing his hands of the business . " " You 'll have to ask Badger to stay with us. "  | " What ? In the row I 'm bound to have with him ? I want to keep just as far away from Badger as I possibly can . " " You 'll have to , Andy . And Muriel will want to come with him . This will be an occasion in Badger 's life . " " Not to say in my life , too . I do n't see why , when Badger and I are in violent opposition  --  " " That 's exactly the reason . You must show him all the courtesy you can , Andy . We 'll go to hear him , of course . " " Oh God ! I 'd thought of that , and I hoped it would be enough . I 've also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be a child about it . I 'll write Muriel and invite them . You must n't make more of an enemy of Badger than you need to . You may want his help some day . " " I simply do n't care to rise by any assistance of Badger 's , if he is a way to rise , and I do n't believe he is , actually . I do n't want to depend on him for anything . " " Even if you 're going to fight with him , you should n't let it be a petty fight . You 're both grown men . You are n't afraid of him , Andy . " Connie was talking sense , as usual , but he wished she would n't always hold him up to such an exacting standard of behavior . He was n't such a man of the world as all that ; he was n't capable of perfect urbanity all the time . " I suppose we 've got to do it , " Andrew said . " I hate to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live up to my own best judgment in this case , but I 'll try . " His jaws began the clench of a resisted yawn . " What a day ! I 've got to give my mind a change of diet . I think I 'll go into the study and try to read . I have that novel by Willys Darragh . I 'm just getting well into it . If we 're going to tempt him into helping us finance the library , I ought to be able to manage a few graceful allusions to his work that do n't sound as though they came from theBook Review Digest . " " If you 're going into the study , I think I 'll go up and read in bed . It 's a luxury I can seldom afford these days . " " A good crime story ? " Andrew asked . " You should read the works of Willys Darragh . You 'd become an authority on rape and abortion overnight . You 'd be able to prescribe for a whole generation of Angelas. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , " Connie said . " You can have Darragh . I do n't see why you read him . " " Well , I have a practical motive , " Andrew said . " But aside from that , he 's an extraordinary writer . Really , there 's a kind of homicidal energy just in his language . I think he must have left his mouth open some night in his sleep when he was a child , and a demon got in and drove out his proper soul . " " It does n't sound very pleasant , " said Connie . She was gatheringup her knitting , stuffing it back , quills and all , into a striped bag with wooden handles . " Do n't read too late , Andy . " He went into his study , feeling abstracted and disconsolate . The sense of the day as a whirling vortex , humming though apparently motionless , like a gyroscopic top , continued to spin under his mental surface . When he tried to bring its elementsto the fore and give them names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnats , the same little buzzing nodules passing and repassing like shuttles on an elaborate spiral loom . He sat down in the armchair near his desk . The bridge lamp threw a hypnotic cone of light over his left shoulder . Better light the overhead , too , or he 'd find himself in a mesmeric trance . There . He picked up the book from his desk and opened it where a torn slip of newspaper marked his place . This passage right here , where he 'd left off reading , was an example of what he 'd been trying to tell Connie , the cloudy berserk energy with which Darragh wrote . Darragh had alreadybeen liberal in the book with seamy fornications , encounters between deviants of various kinds , and human depravityin general . Yet it seemed as though there was a queer system of judgments and values behind the words , if you could ferret it out , or at any rate some kind of indignant incandescencethat made you feel the man was n't merely frivolousor sensational . Here on this page , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether easy to tell ; you could n't say that Darragh was conspicuous for lucidity . You could n't read him with your mind ; you had to read him through the kind of angry hypersensitive daze you got from a blow on the funny bone or the kneecap . But that 's the way it looked : incest , brother and sister , respectably situated people with plenty of other opportunities . Not like the cases youp142knew about on the back roads behind Amsdentown . You met them ; sometimes you hired them to build a fence or shingle a roof . Halfwits , you called them ; poor people , hill people . The Tattles , that family with the dozen children , daughters and sons coming along at symmetrical intervals , living in a shack , raising a meager diet of potatoes , drawing town charity . None of the girls ever had on more than one piece of clothing , the sort of rag a man might use to swab dust off his car . Amsdentown said the state had sterilized one of the daughters , and papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the scene . No official action had . The man was proud of his family , that was the point , proud of the number of bushels of potatoes it took to sustain them all . The Tattles did n't live and move in a half-lit Darraghnightmare . You saw them , driving a rib-sprung rawjointedhorse in a wagon mended with boards from a tumbleddownfence . You saw them in the clear light , on the open road . Incest there something real and terrible . In Darragh , hard to tell . Seemed at least as much symbol as reality . Seemed the product of that spectral worm that crawled into his unguardedmouth and turned its head and spat out words . And if you were up against a symbol , what was it trying to say ? It was trying to say , apparently , that this is the age and this is America ; especially it was trying to say , in this age this is the American middle class . Darragh certainly had it in for the middle class . The incest symbol was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own symptoms of prejudice , ignorance , venality , vulgarity , violence , and intensified them by psychic inbreeding . It refused to marry out of its own corruption . The hard thing was to see what it should marry and where Darragh thought the redeeming partner was to be found . An idea , a blueprint for a better world , a politicalrevolution ? Darragh did n't seem to be interested in any of these . Well , here he was thinking about Darragh 's book instead of reading it . Obviously not going to make much progress tonight . One thing he 'd like to ask Darragh , though , if the man was an approachable sort . What about the middle class ? Why fix on it as the peculiar locus of everything corrupt ? Like top143tell him about Angela . Fornication , though more or less reluctant . Come , be fair to Angela : very reluctant . That was n't what she wanted ; she was even a prude about it , as Connie said . She wanted home and affection and romance , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next middle-class mother . Was Angela a monster , a walker in nightmare , a Gothic figure dimly glimpsed on the raw northernmarches of some violent dream ? No , an everyday workinggirl , sitting in an office , bringing remarkable intelligence to bear on her job . Was n't that what Darragh left out ? When you woke from one of his nightmares , rubbed the cobwebs out of your eyes and looked around , the world was still there . If you accepted Darragh 's report , you 'd be surprised to find that you still had an environment around you in some sort of running order . And yet the streetcars and buses would still be operating , unlessthere was a strike . The dry cleaners , on a commendable average of times , would take your trousers and return them to you with the spots removed . Teachers would be teaching and chemists pouring solutions into beakers and studying the precipitate , if that 's what they did , and wives would be rounding out the heels of socks and buying groceries at the supermarketand psychiatrists would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going up , plans would be on the drawing boards of architects , lines of men would be queueing at bank tellers ' windows to cash pay checks . Efforts at order , efforts at getting the needful accomplished , even efforts at good . Connie planning for Angela , mistake as it might be , telling a man not to make a fool of himself , telling him to behave like a citizen of the world , and certainly right about that . Perhaps it was n't unreasonable to feel that this was the side of the picture that Darragh turned to the wall . A lot of work got done in the world and surely a lot of it was done by the despised middle class . Well , people wanted to read Darragh , at any rate . It seemed sometimes as though there were religion enough left in the world for a vision of evil but not for a vision of good . And at any rate , the juice of genius and suffering that was squeezed out of Darragh by whatever torture instrument made himp144write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the business of a library to preserve such juice , to let it age like wine in cellars . Later times might know how to assess a collection of Darragh . It was a president 's business to get the collection , not to preach critical sermons to himself . So far from preaching in his own right , he 'd have to listen to Badger . Bratten preach . He 'd like to see Badger make an appearance as a character in one of Darragh 's novels . Badger would come out a monster worse than Caliban . Andrew gave a quick glance back through the morning dusk of the stone chapel building as he and Connie guided Muriel into the presidential front pew . Attendance had picked up a little , not much . A few additional faculty had turned out to swell the scattering of faithful elder dignities who sat on uprightspines in the sparsely populated advance pews . Rather more undergraduates than usual , male and female , were meetingone-third of their weekly chapel requirement in the morninginstead of waiting for the ordinarily crowded Wednesday vespers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rows receded in their twilight perspective . Muttering and jostling ; vague pale grins . Neckties knotted halfway down shirts that were open at the neck ; bare conformity to a rule of dress . Someone should have thought to legislate appropriate chapel costumes for coeds . Andrew could make out a girl in a coat over shorts , giggling and covering up her legs . Young St. Clair was right : compulsory chapel made no sense . Perhaps right in principle about these lay sermons too . No harm in the idea ; it would n't accomplish what he expected of it , but that was a lesson youth had to learn . If chapel was n't compulsory , Andrew would n't have to put in token appearances himself . He ought to keep coming once a week , though , to set an example . Example of what ? Agnosticismacknowledging the unknown . No , more than that . Anp145occasional morning genuflection toward the realm of the spirit , whatever that was , toward the sense of the presence that Martin Holmes kept alive . Truth to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good on hymns , good on the one choral piece they were allowed . Young voices , well trained , bright against stone and small-paned windows , rolling Latin in the prolonged lines and austere harmonies of liturgical music . Andrew noticed with surprise that he was not sitting betweenConnie and Muriel . Connie had maneuvered Muriel to the innermost position and interposed herself between them . He felt relieved and a little ashamed . Connie knew he was going to be all tied up in knots . The clang in the steeple began to peter out in a diminishing series of contacts between clapper and bell ; one final afterthought bounce of metal from metal and the organ began to breathe , coming in off key , establishing its own tonality , filling in the confused harmonics of the steeple with distinct parts grounded on the hollow fogswellof its oceanic base . A door to the left of the lectern opened and Badger appeared , looking uneasy in academic robes with tan shoes showing underneath . He paused and looked back uncertainly , then entered at a gesture from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruggedly handsome , Andrew supposed , and last by Martin Holmes , tiny and neglected , a gnome in the corner of a whimsical picture . They seated themselves , and Andrew felt his ribs stiffen with a premonitory ache . Well , the ordeal would be brief , at least . St. Clair was announcing hymn **25;7154;TOOLONG , **26;7181;TOOLONG , and the population of the chapel was rising with a belated riffle of hymnbook pages . Organ and choir leaped in as always ahead of the mild participationof the church militant . Fresh balanced voices sang with practiced vigor in front ; behind , Andrew could detect only an embarrassed mutter and one natural tenor that ought to have been in the choir letting itself go with unsclf-conscious ebullience . Connie was holding a hymnbook for Muriel and singing herself in her subdued contralto . Andrew tried out a phrase of the baritone , but he had to swallow , and he could n't seem to get even with the choir until the second verse.  |p146Time  to sit down again ; no escaping it . Andrew crossed his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knee from the outside as it rose so that his hand and wrist were wedged between his legs . It was a good position for nervous tension ; you could squeeze and crush until your bones broke and no one the wiser . The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came , St. Clair was reading , and tempting desired Him that he would show them a sign from Heaven . Why did n't Martin give the boy a few hints about reading scripture ? The old man just too docile and tender . The mild virtues can be carried too far . Made that sweet kind of communicative privacyof spirit a privilege into which he retreated . Would be invaluable to the young man 's career if Martin educated him a little , even so simple a thing as not jumping with both feet an the wrong words . St. Clair finished , closed the large Bible on the lectern with a decisive motion , and glanced toward Badger with just the suggestion of a bow . St. Clair sat down and Badger looked startled . Expecting to be introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never this kind of thing . Those eyes of his , dwarfing their sockets , really trying to burst out . Wild look , would like to be anywhere but here . That feeling Maurice Holsberg got in front of his class : ca n't face them again . But no one here to take notes , unless a candidate for the Register hoping to get a couple of inches to his credit . Badger fumbled with his academic gown and extracted a small sheaf of pages from somewhere inside . Ghost-written . Executive roughs out approach to lay sermon ; public relationslooks up material , writes it for him . Why not ? Bible itselfthe first ghost-written book : Holy-Ghost-written . Stop . Ca n't get through the agony that way . He felt a gentle pressureagainst his side . Connie , leaning toward him ever so slightly , telling him to control himself . His face putting on one of its expressions , no doubt . " I 'm not a preacher , " Badger said suddenly , standing at the lectern , putting his typed sheets on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive unnatural tone that evidently surprisedhim . Muriel rustled loudly , crossing her legs . She wasp147all in silk this morning  --  well , rayon or nylon or whatever silk had become these days . " Badger is nervous , " she told Connie in a penetrating whisper . Badger breathed and went on . " PerhapsI should n't take a text , since I 'm not a minister of the gospel . " The words he read from his script evidently did n't have the right ring to his ear . He interjected " or anything like that " in his own unprepared tone . " He should just read , " Muriel whispered . " He 'll say something wrong . " Badger had broken the ice ; he was over the worst of it . " But let me say that if I were going to take a text "  --  He paused and looked out over the chapel with what must have been meant for a ingratiatingsmile  --  " if I were going to take a text , it would be  --  and I take this from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty-second verse  --  " Badger looked up again and had trouble finding his place when he went back to his script . " I believe that 's the correct verse . Yes , the twentysecond . But be ye doers ' "  --  he stopped again to look up and out  --  " doers of the word , and not hearers only . ' Young men and women of Rowley College , despite the fact , as I have said , that I am not a minister of the gospel , I am proud to bring you what I believe is a sacred message , the message of action . This is a time for action . Never has there been a time when doers were more vitally needed . " He should have been able to predict it , Andrew told himself . Badger or his ghost writers had hit on what he would call an approach that , now he was making it , seemed inevitable . The sacred message of action . It put him in character , it had a large consistency , a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back in the forties , of the British Empire , you would n't have wanted Churchill to make any other remark about it than the one he did  --  have n't become the King 's first minister in order to preside over the liquidation , and so on . Whatever you thought of Badger , you would n't want him to stand up , granted he had to stand up , and say anything except " Be ye doers . " Perhaps Badger 's sermon was going to stop short of the unendurable , after all . Badger must think he had established contact with his audience . He was just reading now , not looking up any more , butp148he was losing contact , actually , looking more and more isolatedas he hammered out the words of his script . He was in his office , trying to tell his ghost writers what he wanted them to say for him and wondering why they could n't say it more effectively . Where were the doers found , he was asking . In American business , he was answering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Take the broad international view , he was advising , the truly liberal view as against the demagogues who did not want people to be doers but to take handouts from the welfare state , to surrender their priceless heritage of freedomand enterprise in return for security . Careful , Badger , it was beginning to hurt . What had the suffering and starving millions of Asia to look to except American know-how ? Deceived by the false promises of communism , those sufferingand starving millions . Well , yes ; you might wish that someone else was saying it in some other way , with more knowledge and greater humility , but still , the contention in itself  --  Muriel suddenly began to paw through her handbag , opening it with a loud click , pulling out a handkerchief , looking around over her shoulder . Had Badger made a slip of the tongue ? Andrew was crushing his wrist so painfully between his knees he had scarcely heard . Connie leaning toward him again . Just perceptible pressure . "  --  and the few , " Badger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own land of opportunity . " They were all to be saved by education , all the underprivileged everywhere , and the function of educationwas to produce doers . Where would Christianity be today , Badger wanted to know , if it had been entrusted to dreamers only , not doers ? The Founder himself had been a man of action , do n't forget that . He had driven the moneychangersfrom the temple with a whip . He had said " Go ye into all the world . " Badger did not hesitate to say that the problem of Christianity in these times was a problem of salesmanship . Yes , it had to be sold , put across , and that took doing and doers who worked in the best of that spirit so often exemplifiedby American business . Young men and women of this college we all love  --  Peroration . You hardly knew whether Badger was actually saying it or whether you were saying itp149for him by automatic control . Now in the position of hearers of the word . Priceless opportunity of education under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the creed you have learned in these walls into action , you must sell it , put it across . You must be doers of the word , not hearers only . It was over and it had been brief . But the agony was not over and it had been agony . You tried your best , you granted Badger every point you could , you made a case for him , but still it hurt . As Badger gathered his script and sat down , Andrewlooked with a desperation of hope and pity toward MartinHolmes . There was no sign of discomposure in Martin 's face , no sign that he had heard anything remarkable or incongruous , indeed that he had heard anything at all . He rose , his tiny , not quite plump figure , with its delicate pink skin and impalpable white hair , came forward and stood beside the lectern . " Let us pray , " said Martin . That frail pipe of his could somehow make itself heard through a whole auditorium , its cracked notes could shape the cadence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last sound of rising had quieted , and Andrew thought he could see his blue eyes , their vision far withdrawn within himself , choosing from the scroll of remembered words inscribed on his mind . Did he hesitate a moment longer than usual ? " 0 God , " said Martin , " Thou hast made us for Thyself , and our hearts have no rest until they find their rest in Thee . Amen . " " Amen , " sang choir ; organ loudened into energetic dismissal . Andrew turned about and searched for any sign that someone besides himself had been conscious of a balance redressed , a drama played , spirits of the air , evangels of contemplativefire against the gross element of earth . Faculty eldersbowing , chuckling , greeting one another . Boy stuffing tie hastily into pocket , plunging down aisle . Surely he had not been mistaken ? Surely up there above the slanting light beams that came through the windows , in the dusk spaces under the timbered ceiling , you could still feel it , the breath Martin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . Flight of the alone to the alone . That was how someone had once defined religion.  |p150Andrew  followed Connie and Muriel through the door to the vestry room where the young men and women of the choir were jostling conversationally , hanging robes on pegs and streaming out to classes . Badger , already divested , was grinningwith relief , swinging his arms and stretching his shoulders , talking with St. Clair . Badger looked like himself again in his brownish double-breasted suit . Martin Holmes formed a tiny pivot in the midst of the circling and disintegratingchoir , smiling and exchanging words . Muriel thrust in between Badger and St. Clair . " Why , Badger , you were good . You were almost eloquent . Did n't you think so ? " she asked , turning to St. Clair . The Assistant Chaplain gave Andrew an uneasy look . " I was very much impressed and interested , " he said . " Well , what did you expect , old lady ? " Badger asked , grinninghappily . " But you must n't mix your words up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you said stuffering and sarving ' instead of suffering and starving ' ? " " I guess nobody noticed . I went right on and covered up pretty well , did n't I ? " " It 's just that people were polite , " said Muriel . " After all , they would n't burst out laughing in chapel . " " Yeah , well , " said Badger irritably , " this kind of thing is n't exactly in my line . First time  --  " His head swung round , and Andrew felt himself caught in a brightening look of fellowship . " Andy boy ! How did I do ? How do you like me as 9 preacher ? " Connie was quietly stepping forward , sparing him the need to reply until he had time to prepare himself . " I 'm so glad we had you to get our series off to a start , Badger . I think Mr. St. Clair should be congratulated for such an interesting plan . "  |p151She  turned to St. Clair , whose face looked down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere if I had n't had such splendid cooperation , " he said . He began to appreciate Mr. Bratten 's kindness in and to hope that the rest of the series would continue to  --  Ooze over toward Martin ; Connie had provided the chance . He 'd see Badger later in the morning . They 'd both have their innings . The old man was alone , the last of the choir just going out , and his back was turned as Andrew came up to him . " Martin , " Andrew said . Martin turned unhurriedly and looked up with an undecipherableexpression , perhaps a kind of rueful humor . " Those were Augustine 's words , were n't they ? " Martin appeared to have forgotten the drama he had played , the balance he had redressed with his airy weapons . Then he smiled ever so slightly . " Thou has made us for Thyself ' ? Yes , Andy . " " I was grateful for them . " " I am always grateful for them , " Martin said . You could n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps he had n't listened to Badger , did n't know what Badger had uttered . But it was impossible ; he must have known what he was doing . He did it from a tact too delicate and deep-seated , of course , for conscious contrivance or cheap sense of effect ; he did it from the heart . Connie was leading Muriel toward the door and Badger was trailing them . St. Clair was taking off his gown . Andrew overtook Badger and touched his arm . " I 'll be going to my office , " he said . " You 'll look in later ? " " That 's right , boy . I 'll be seeing you . We 've got things to talk over . " Leaving chapel by the door to the vestry room , Andrew came out on the prospect of Fraternity Row . One half-swing of his head to the right , and the succession of frame or brick buildings in their oblongs of turf across an unpaved road would look him full in the face . His neck tightened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **25;7209;TOOLONG . Boys were bolting from doors , books , clipboards under their arms . Yodels , nicknames flew across the street ; waiting and catching up shuffled the human atoms back and forth . He was n't close enough to hear fragments of conversation that might have told him what was on their minds , what fraternity brothers thought about at this time of the morning in this age of the world . One cropped towhead cuttingslantwise toward him above a compact nonchalant figure looked like young Badger . On pro . Going to his first morningclass . Down there at the extremity of the file of houses , occupying its much too generous lot , and flanked around the corner by the two old faculty houses he hoped the wreckers would also be demolishing , stood the Pi Alpha house itself . Gingerbread brick , peeled brown window frames with wooden scrollwork , slate mansard roof . No Ioss . Andrew turned west across campus . The pegged-out mat of turf , small central breathing park of a crowded college , lay before him in the April light that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here on campus . Room enough for the physical structure . The walls could rise and the roof slant into place . It would annihilate season and perspective ; it would reduce the whole college to a system of alleys between buildings . No one had proposed to do so ; tacit agreement on that point . It made sense to pull the college eastward toward the playing fields and the wooded acres of municipal park beyond them , across the flat lazy curvature of river . FraternityRow would have to sacrifice itself . In the constant social transformations of the city that edged Rowley to the south , there would be houses that clubs of Badger Brattens could acquire if they wanted to pay the price . Farther away ; decidedlyless convenient . But in this world private societies ought to pay for their privileges . The bell above chapel began to ring again for nine o'clock classes . That hipswing coming toward him across the campus path , heavy , earnest , a little uncoordinated ; very familiar . " Maurice , " Andrew said , stopping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture notes and books with slips of paper in them from the crook of his right arm to thep153crook of his left to Rowleythis very evening . He checked them . Do n't let Maurice know , his father had said . The boy was particularly sensitive to any show of parental interference , even concern . Anotherreason against remanding the doctor to the Faculty Club . Andrew had to take refuge in the commonplace . " I 'm delighted to see you back again . How are you ? " The shy innocent smile , trouble always just below the surface . Maurice shifted his weight ; self-conscious or in a hurry . " I 'm well , " he said . " Did you enjoy New York ? " " Very much . " " Lots of concerts and plays ? " " A few , " said Maurice . Nervous ; he had that class to face . Probably this very hour ; the bell beginning to miss beats , premonitory to stopping . " Well , I wo n't keep you , " said Andrew . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time there was an apologetic and mystified look in Maurice 's smile . " We had a violent quarrel , " he said . " You did ? About what ? " " I do n't know . " " But what happened ? " " He invited me to dinner , " said Maurice , " and I said the only hope of America was to educate the middle class and make it politically and culturally conscious and he said the only hope was to destroy it and I told him we were saying the same thing in different ways and he called me a fool and a bourgeois mentality and stormed out of the restaurant . I had to pay the bill . " " Was it all as sudden as that ? " " Oh , it took about an hour , " said Maurice , " but that 's all 1 can really remember . " Andrew could n't help laughing . Too bad , of course ; might even have a bad effect on library plans . Should n't have tried to use Maurice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty disconcerting , " he said . " Tell me , was Rowley mentioned at all in the conversation ? " " If you 'll excuse me , " said Maurice , edging away , " I have a lecture . I 'm afraid the class  --  " " Of course , " Andrew said . " Go along . Maybe I 'll have anotherchance to talk with you about it . " Breaking himself on the rock of conscientiousness . Because those classroom eyes and faces intimidated him so , he had to meet and combat them to the minute , making an added psychicburden of his own excess of responsibility . Well , not every faculty member had the same fault . Andrew went on across the remaining paces of campus , up the steps of Administration , up the stairs toward his office . The door was open as usual , but looking through it aslant as he came down the hall , Andrew received a shock , as though a lesion had occurred in the order of the world , a prodigy in nature . Teetering on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows was what appeared to be a large dark ape , crouching forward ready to take a four-footed leap to the floor . The ape was humming a catchy half-familiar rhythm , a hum that seemed on the verge of bursting out in full crow , like that solitary cheerful tenor in chapel . Andrew 's legs checked involuntarily ; then he saw that it was the heavy thigh and stretched back of a man on a stepladder on the far side of his desk , doing something to the overhead light fixture . Angela was nowhere to be seen . Andrew half turned , thinking to go back down the hall to the outer door of her office , but the ape had detected his approach . " I 'll be right out of the way , President Aiken , " it said , trainingdown on him a large Irish face like a tipsy obsequious moon . " I just thought it was about time to change the bulbs in your light . These bulbs nowadays are n't what they used to be ; give out before you can screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head of Repairs . Why could n't he have sent an underling ? Personal attention to the presidential light bulbs . He was giving a final turn of wrist , backing down his ladder , folding it up , and carrying it out . He stopped at the door and stood aside for Andrew to enter.  | " Good morning , " said Andrew . " Thanks . I 'm hardly going to need an overhead light today . " " Never can tell in April , " said McCarthy . " May get dark and storm any minute . " He went out , carrying his ladder upright by one sandyhairedfist under the handle of the brace where it folded together . Andrew looked expectantly for Angela to appear . Office life easier now that she was a tide faithful to her moon again . Ugh . Better just say now that she had succeeded in menstruating ; the outright word . Stop thinking about Angela 's biology . " Ta da dee do "  --  what was that tune the ape had been singing ? The trouble is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , always next door . Humiliating . Glad to have her cheerfulagain but could n't escape embarrassment . A degree of impersonalitywas really a safeguard in official relations . Actually more human , made life more comfortable . So bright , so unconcerned . Well , what did anyone want ? Moping ? Compunction ? No one could dwell forever on his sins . Calvinistic self-scrutiny a fashion well outgrown . What was it Jeremy Taylor said about penance ? Should be prompt , brief , and afflictive . Doctrine led to queer results , though . Suppose I murder a man . Well , it 's done . I give myself a brief afflictive penance and dismiss it . Ca n't go around cringing and apologizingall my life . He 's dead , I 'm alive ; end of episode . Not as easy as that . Had Angela assigned herself any penance , or was she just rejoicing in pure relief from terror ? Connie had been right all along , of course ; but what if she had n't been ? Close call ; had n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he have answered , put on the stand as a witness , no , accomplice ? I never heard the subject discussed , Mr. District Attorney , I never heard anything said about an abortion . Would n't do . Yes , Mr. District , I admit I did hear the subjectdiscussed . My attitude ? What could I do ? They are women , I a man . Showed disapproval , expressed misgivings . have a bastard ? You are here to answer questions , President Aiken , not to ask them . Angela came in finally , when the steps of Mr. McCarthyp156carrying his ladder were no longer audible going down the hall and the stairs . " How was Mr. Bratten 's sermon ? " she asked , with her most buoyant smile . " I should have been able to predict it and preach it for him , " said Andrew . " The strenuous life , the virtues of action . Be ye doers of the word . ' " " I hope it was n't too awful , " said Angela . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted with Badger later in the morning , I do n't want to work myselfinto a state about his defects as an apostle . By the way , what was that tune McCarthy was humming as I came in ? Did you recognize it ? He put the thing in my head and I ca n't get it out . " " I 'm afraid I did n't hear him , " said Angela , in some sort of tone , a touch of her prim and prudish tone . " Well , I 'll have to let my subconscious take it over and identify it for me . Get me all the copies of the Register that have anything to do with the library business , will you ? And the layout for the follow-up article in the alumni magazine . I want them ready when 1i'Ir . Bratten comes . " Angela turned and crossed toward her door . " Ta da dee do . " His subconscious , that malevolent basement toiler who confounded the orders he received from above stairs and imposed his own eccentricities from below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know my love/ By her way of walking . " McCarthy , head of Repairs , troubadourwho took the castle by storm of song . Such a songster that he even went to chapel to join in the hymns . The crawlingembarrassment of it that stuck to your neck and would n't wipe off . Say what you like , call it morals or simple self-protectionof your own temperament , which you had to get along and work with , they 'd have to go . He 'd find some way to get rid of both of them . But why , if he was n't going to be in this office another April ? It would n't be his problem ; no one would need to know . Angela had learned her lesson , Connie said . And wherever McCarthy went , there would be other girls who would have to learn similar lessons . Besides , hum/ming a tune was no sort of proof . Why could n't any one of a thousand men know his love by her way of walking ? Well , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just rationalizing his helplessness . Nothing a president could do about it that was n't merely petulant . At least he 'd have something to tell Connie ; he 'd show her that he could put two and two together . How small the triumphs in which a man has to find his satisfaction ! And it had n't been any feat of detective work , after all ; he 'd blundered right into it , like a man falling into a cellar hole . How in God 's name could he look Angela in the eye again ? His face felt stiff and his palms hot when she came in , bearingthe exhibits he had asked for , and his voice did n't sound right to him when he said , " Thanks , Angela . Everything there ? " But he did manage to look her in the eye , once , briefly , growing hotter when he had to struggle with a franticimpulse to laugh . She stood by his desk , looking a little injured when he failed to take her into consultation , to think out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . It was Badger who saved him ; Miss Tozzer opened her door to say that he had arrived , and he was able to let Angela go . Badger seemed to be in a state of euphoria . He held out his hand at arm 's length , grinning broadly . " Well , Andy , here 's the preacher boy , " he said , and a slide of laughter tumbled out with the announcement , a pebbled bank dislodged and grinding down to a new angle of rest . " What do you say , going to give me an honorary D.D . this June ? Reverend Badger Bratten , D.D. , sales and prorRotion for the eternal verities . Better take that up with the trustees , Andy . " The follow-up laugh , the slide settling and adjusting in its new position . " Well , " said Andrew , " we have a lot of honoraries who ca n't speak with as much conviction as you do , Badger . " Cowardly evasion . No use quarreling over inessentials , you always told yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excuse . " I thought someone ought to tell those kids that their job was to get up off their asses and do something in the world , "  |p158said  Badger , growing serious . " Trouble with this younger generation , they expect everything to be done for them . Parentstake care of them , state takes care of them . No initiative . All they think about is security . " " I hardly think they 're universally as bad as that . " " Well , there are some exceptions , sure , but not too many , not too many . You ca n't get away from it , they 're different from you and I when we were brought up . We expected to do things for ourselves , make our own way , if we had to claw and fight to do it . But now you take even Harry . He writes back and says he 's going into law . Well , that 's all right . A corporation lawyer or a tax lawyer would be something . There 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what does he think he wants to do after law school ? Go into government , international law , idealistic stuff . And there he is , in Korea now . What does he expect to get paid for idealism in this world ? I ca n't understand this younger generation sometimes . " " I guess they have their troubles understanding us , " Andrewsaid . " I wish my kids would understand me now and then , " said Badger . He fell into his nearest approach to a brown study for a moment . " Well , we 've got to talk about this library business , Andy boy . " Perhaps the younger generation were letting Badger down about the new Pialph house ; perhaps what they failed to understandwas the extremity of his concern for the enterprise . " I thought you 'd like to see how the Register has been treating the affair , " Andrew said , " now that it 's out in the open . " He picked up a copy and extended it toward Badger , indicating a column . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardedly apologetic thrust of his bulging eyes . " About that Register article , " he said , " it must have been pretty rough on you , Andy . I 'm sorry about that . The alumni crowd had nothing to do with writing it , you know . The Register boys called us up and asked whether we knew anything about your idea of tearing down the house and what wep159thought of it , and we told them , I 'll grant that . I hated to see it done to you , old man , but there just was n't any way out . " " I 'll admit I was more than ordinarily angry , " said Andrew . " But I did n't suppose that you or any of your graduate committee wrote the story or even inspired it directly . I did n't , that is , after I 'd thought a while and cooled off . I can guess where the original tip came from . It was a leak from the faculty , was n't it ? " " Now I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Badger said . " I 'm naming no names . " " I would n't try to retaliate if I could , " Andrew told him . " And right now I 'm almost glad the whole thing is out in the open . You can see what we 've been trying to do  --  appeal to the general good sense of the college and the alumni . And if you look through some of these Registers for the past week , you can see the kinds of reactions we 've been getting . " Badger began to look and Andrew watched his face . He had started Badger off with a piece of sophomoric comedy . It might be useful to confuse Badger 's mind by showing him that a sacred subject could be treated frivolously . One of the Rowley sororities had offered to take in the brethren of Pi Alpha when they became homeless and to share quarters with them . The arrangement would offer a laboratory for education in sex relations , the girls thought , a much needed and highly practical addition to the academic curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Badger , " about the younger generation . They do n't see things the way you and I did , Andy . They do n't have a sense of values . Now I call that a  --  well , I think it goes a little too far . I 'd have censored that , if I 'd been in your place . " " I admit , " said Andrew , " that it may be in dubious taste . But I hardly think it 's meant to be taken literally . " Badger refused to smile . " The kids nowadays have no perspective , " he complained . " Imagine a bunch of girls from decentfamilies writing stuff like that when we were in college ! Right out in the open ! Talking about living together and courses in sex relations . I do n't understand this modern generation . We did n't have girls on our minds as much as that inp160our time , Andy , not in that way , I mean , not the kind of girls a kid might think of marrying someday , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were the proms and a lot of guys had girls they rushed on week ends . And of course there were a couple of houses downtown in the freightyard section . When you come to think of it , I do n't suppose many of us were virgins by the time we got the old sheepskin . But a thing like this ! I call it going too far . It 's the result of Freud and psychoanalysis and all this Jew psychology stuff . " " If I 'd wanted to censor anything and had had the chance , " Andrew said , " I 'd have stopped the original article , in which a carefully worked out plan , months of work , was almost wrecked by premature and distorted  --  " Vocabulary getting stuffy ; make it short and sharp . But the only word he could think of was " disclosure . " It would have to do . " I think that raised a question of loyalty , of all-around responsibility , " he finished . Badger scowled . Show him exhibit two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Badger to read . " You 've seen one response , for what it 's worth . Here 's a response of a different sort . " Exhibit two was more serious and more practical . Badger and his band would have to reckon with it . The suggestion came from a strictly local Rowley club , which was well regardedbut small and chronically in debt . The nub of the proposal was that if the brothers Pialph were going to lose their house , they might as well give up their national charter , too , and join forces to create a society that would really belong to Rowley and would have other aims besides drinking and poker , though these pursuits would not be frowned on . Andrew watched Badger 's face unhappily digesting this relativelyenlightened invitation . " These kids have no perspective , " Badger grumbled . " All they want is to horse their way through college on the old man 's money . No thought for the future . They ca n't look ahead and see the value of the contacts you make through something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's sake ! The kids are crazy . " He put the Register down with a fretful motion , and the  |p161whites  of his discolored eyes bulged on Andrew with more downright hostility than he had yet shown . Do n't get flustered ; effective anger is cool . Do n't let it end like a small boy 's fight , puffing and red faces and a haze through which you ca n't even see the blows coming . " I 'll tell you how it is , Andy boy . These kids ca n't judge a thing like this . They have n't been around long enough  --  " " Perhaps they can , " said Andrew , wishing that his vocal cords would n't tighten and his neck would n't quiver . " Perhaps , when the situation is fairly put , they can judge the issues very well indeed . " " No , " said Badger , " they do n't get the perspective on it . Now it comes down to this , Andy . I hate to say it , but no president can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him on an issue like this . Take it or leave it , boy . If you push this thing too far , I just ca n't swing the group I 've got lined up behind you . And if you do n't get in , you know what the man who does get in will do , do n't you ? He 'll dodge this issue as if it was a dose of the clap . He 'll drop it like a hot rivet . Then where will you be , Andy boy ? " " I 'm doing my best , " said Andrew , " to settle the question before my successor takes over . " He was glad that the sense of fatality at this final impasse with Badger enabled him to speak easily and with assurance . " After all , the trustees are the arbiters , Badger . You know that . They 've accepted the Report of the Library Committee , and so far  --  " Badger 's face flushed . His fist even knotted itself as though he were going to pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . It might be in his mind that he expected to become a trustee himself within a short time , that he considered his appointment to the Board long overdue . " Tell you what , Andy , " he said . " We 've got to talk this out later . I 've got some things to settle with the kids over at the house . I 'm glad you showed me this stuff in the Register . Gives me an idea what 's on their minds . Maybe we can go into it some more tonight . " " Tonight ? " said Andrew . It slipped out unguarded , but he could n't help himself . With Maurice 's father coming  --  " Yeah , " said Badger . " If you could fix it up with Connie ,  |p162I  could let the boys in the office struggle along without me for another day . I want to put in some work here on the ground , tell the brothers in the chapter a thing or two , and you and I have n't sewed up this Pialph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know the guest room is always yours , " Andrew said . " The only trouble about tonight is , it just happens we have someone else coming , a busy doctor , we ca n't put him off  --  " " That so ? " said Badger . " Of course , if it 's inconvenient , if you do n't have an extra room  --  " His face flushed again ; he looked miffed , even hurt . " Well , " Andrew said , " Sally 's away visiting . We could put him in her room . Or there 's the upstairs sitting room with a daybed . Connie could decide about that . " He was muddling badly but he could n't see his way through the entanglements . It would n't do to have Maurice 's father with Badger and Muriel ; it simply would n't do . But neither could he appear to be running away from Badger , refusing him hospitality when they were in the thick of a fight and Badger was threatening to make it thicker . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smarting with the sense that he had lost control of the situation . " It 's Doctor Holsberg , the father of Maurice Holsberg in the Philosophy Department . He wants to see me  --  " No ; better not tell Badger that Holsberg wanted to consult Andy boy about ominous symptoms in his son 's frame of mind . " Holsberg , " said Badger . " He 's a Jew , is n't he ? " " Yes , " Andrew said . Perhaps Badger was going to retreat on his own initiative . Perhaps Andy boy had blundered into the right way to handle the business after all . But if Badger scuttled back to New York rather than meet a Jew " Is n't he the one , this professor I mean , there 's been a rumor about ? That is , I 've heard it said he 's a Communist , or close to it . " " It 's as ridiculous as such rumors usually are . I 've known Maurice well myself for years . His younger brother is a sergeantin Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Badger said.  | " But it 's a dangerous thing , Andy boy , to let a place get a reputation , you know . You 've got to think of the college as well as the individual . Now I may not be so much of a Babbitt as you think . I 've known a lot of Jews in a business way and some of them are all right guys . And I know Jews have done some great things for this country , Bernie Baruch and men like that . But you take these Jew intellectuals , they are n't tied in with life in this country , Andy . They 're unstable . Look at them in Washington . " " Let 's fight about one thing at a time , " Andrew said , fearingthat in Badger 's mind a link might be forming that would fuse Maurice , communism , the library , and antifraternalism into a single complex . Badger was silent a moment . " You say this prof 's father is a doctor ? " " And Maurice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Psychoanalyst ? " Badger asked . " As far as I know , he 's a general practitioner , " Andrew said , glad to be able to laugh . " I do n't believe he 'd try to psychoanalyzeyou , Badger , unless you started throwing the furniturearound . " Badger decided to be amiable . " Well , if you can fix it up with Connie , you and I ought to do some more chin work on this house proposition . Now here 's what I want you to think about , Andy . After I 've hashed things over with the brethren and got you to see the light , " Badger said , grinning , " I 'll have to make a report to this group of alumni I 'm trying to hold in line for you . " " I 've left the Register free to print what it likes , " Andrew said . " I 'll have to leave you free to report what you like . Free speech all around . " " Well , I want you to do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important . " " I ca n't believe , " Andrew said , " that if we get the money a group of grown-up alumni will wreck the whole plan and embitter the college for the sake of a fraternity house . " " You do n't see it the way I do . " Badger got up . " Think about it , Andy . We 'll talk some more tonight . "  |p164Andrew  let him get well out of the room and then picked up his phone . It was a piece of luck to find Connie in , so that Angela would n't have to spend half the day tracing her . And it was lucky that she did n't have Muriel at her elbow . Muriel , it seemed , was upstairs nursing an indisposition . " Andy ! " Connie said , with appropriate horror at his news . " I did n't see what else to do . Maybe I handled it badly , but there we are . I certainly was n't going to wire Holsberg not to come , and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to clear out . I was right on the edge of offending Badger anyway , just when we were close to a real brawl over the library . Things moved fast , and I guess I let him get the lead and take the decision out of my hands . " Connie was briefly silent . Then she said , " I 'll invite Uncle Thad to dinner . He and Badger took to each other , and he wants a chance to show Badger that little fishing gadget he invented . I think he still hopes it will make his fortune for him some day . " " Good . That 's a brilliant thought . It will make it easier for me to sneak off for a while with Holsberg . It 's lucky Badger and Muriel got in late last night or we might have wasted Uncle Thad on them yesterday . " After all , Andrew told himself as he hung up , it might n't be as bad as they feared . Badger and Muriel would n't be rude , only inept at worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it hard for him to keep up the civilities with Badger much longer . Badger really meant to make it boil . Andrew leaned over his tray of bottles and glasses , the host in his living room as priest of the evening ceremony prescribed by a civilization . The liturgy of conversation flowed over his bent head , mock liturgy of a profane ritual . He was conscious of Badger sitting beside him ; he felt the placing ofp165the others , Connie in a chair advanced catty-cornered at the end of the opposite sofa , where she could watch them all , then Muriel , eyeing the bottle of brandy Connie had remembered to provide , then Dr. Holsberg , with his broad Semitic face , an older version of Maurice 's face but with a strength he had not been able to pass on to his elder son ; finally Uncle Thad confronting Badger . A repetition of the same scene here in the living room , how long ago ? Two weeks . No , the differencestoo important . Holsberg a new member of the cast . Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-exiled . He wished the evening would repeat the previous occasion in one way , at least . He wanted Uncle Thad to take over , to establish again those perspectives on a country-town boyhood that opened for Andrew a tantalizing sense of connection with a way of life half missed . Uncle Thad sat ready , short plump hands folded on short plump thighs that inflated his shiny blue trousers like balloons , eyes awash with the affectionatebeam of reminiscence waiting for only the slightest provocation . But it seemed as though his opportunity were going to be forbidden him or indefinitely postponed . Holsberg , the alien presence , was a contending focus too strong . They could n't seem to get away from the dominance he exertedover the company . Badger affirming at dinner the statureof MacArthur as an American leader , hoping that when he spoke to Congress next day he would tell off this Communistadministration in Washington that was robbing the countryof its initiative and freedom . The doctor politely saying that he would be the last to deny the general his Roman triumph , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but feared his political influence . Badger holding that a change of any sort would be better than none ; twenty years of the same gang was enough . The doctor asking whether George Marshalldid n't deserve as much of his country as MacArthur . Well , sure , great job during the war , but look at China . Might n't be fighting in Korea now if Marshall or those radicalsaround him had n't sold out Chiang to the Commies . The doctor quietly probing this assertion , and Badger taking ref/uge in the need of a real Republican to get us out of this mess . Personally he 'd like Taft , but he 'd settle for Eisenhower . Taft could n't get elected ; labor against him . Muriel had her brandy and soda . Andrew looked inquiringlyat the doctor . " I 'm not a drinking man , " said Holsberg , smiling . " Dringkingk " was closer to it . Stop noticing the glottal compression . Could n't stop , too conscious of Badger and Muriel being conscious of Holsberg . " One highball , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very light . " " I suppose a doctor has to watch himself about stuff like that , alcohol , I mean , " said Badger . " Personally , I find it pretty relaxing to take a few highballs after a day at the office . I do n't know what the latest word from the medical professionis , but it gives me a lift after a day of pressure . " " Do n't forget all those martinis you and your business friends drink every day at lunch , " said Muriel . " Really , Doctor , do n't you think he should drink less ? " " I should have to know him thoroughly as a patient , " said Holsberg , " to know whether he drinks to excess or not . But of course the true alcoholic is a case for psychiatry . There is little that medicine can do for him . " " Can you cure the d.t. ' s by psychoanalysis ? " Badger asked . " It is not a question of psychoanalysis , Mr. Bratten , " Holsbergsaid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stop noticing . General psychiatry is what he meant , Badger . Rowleyneeds a psychiatric service . Like to ask the doctor about Dorion . Get him to outline an adequate medical center .. . "  --  misfortune that so few of my profession are trained in it at the present time . I feel the lack severely in my own prac-tice . " " I never could bring myself to go to a psychoanalyst , " said Muriel . " Think of answering all those awful questions ! I 'd feel so exposed . " " The analyst , if I understand his work , asks few direct questions , Mrs. Bratten . He tries to create an atmosphere in which the patient will talk freely . Of course he has to prompt when necessary . But psychiatry as a whole is still an infantp167science . Perhaps it will someday throw a great light on the development of normal living as well as on mental disorder . I should like to live in that day . I feel that I might have been a better adviser to my sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my disposal . " " You have a son on the faculty here , is that right ? " said Badger . " I have two sons . One , " said Holsberg slowly and distinctly , " has accepted being a Jew . The other , I am afraid , has not been able to do so as yet . It is a problem all Jews confront with themselves and not an easy one to solve . " The Jew affirming himself as Jew , acknowledging his difference , whether intrinsic or forced on him or an **30;7236;TOOLONG of both . Why does he do it ? Integrity . True colors or none . Take me if you like , receive me if you will ; otherwise I have the strength to bear my rejection . Could it ever be eased , the ancient appalling tension ? Yes , it would be , in time ; but not before many had suffered and broken themselves on the stone , even in twentieth-centuryAmerica . Awkward silence , everyone paralyzed . Ask Holsberg what " Doctor Holsberg 's son teaches philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if young Badger is in his class . He gives a course that many students take , from all sorts of departments . They speak of it with great interest . " " I wish I had a child who would tell me what he does and what he 's interested in , " said Muriel . " I do n't believe my childrenever give me a thought . " " He 's majoring in economics , you know that , " Badger told her . " President Aiken has been very kind to my son , " said Holsberg . Hostile , that concentrated unfathomable glow of the doctor 's eyes ? Hostile despite himself that kindness to his son should be necessary ? Kindness to the Jew , smeared with the nasty consciousness that one is being liberal . " I 'm afraid you give me too much credit , " said Andrew . " I  |p168like  Maurice , and aside from that he 's a valuable investment and we want to make the most of him . He 's a stimulating teacher in a realm where good teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Badger , " quite a place , Rowley , quite a place . Pretty liberal or I would n't have been asked to preach in chapel , is that right , Andy boy ? " Generous helping of laughterfrom Badger 's overflowing board . " Of course I was brought up Episcopalian , but I 'm not exactly ready for holy orders yet . " The second helping of laughter . Connie began explaining Badger 's role in chapel , and Muriel said he really interested her ; she had n't known he could be so eloquent . " Does Rowley have an official religious connection ? " Holsbergasked . " Not any longer , " said Andrew . " Required chapel three times a week . The student body has changed and grown rapidly , and what we have left of our Episcopalian past no longer represents it adequately . That 's one of the reasons for these lay sermons . College chapel has been losing ground . " " I do n't suppose , " said Holsberg , smiling faintly , " that my son as a philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose either of us is any closer to primitive Judaism than I imagine all of you are to  --  shall we say the fundamentalism of the Bible belt . Are n't we all unprofessing Unitarians together ? On one side the approach is from Judaism , on the other side from Christianity . " " Gristianity . " Or something like " Ngristianity . " Badger as a Ngristian . Stop ; if you are n't being a snob , you 're encouraging yourself in schizophrenia . Losing what the doctoris saying . . . "  --  Unfortunately does not solve the contradictionsof the Jew . In the middle ages , we Jews were despised as usurers . We were among the pioneers of capitalism when it was feared and hated as a mysterious revolution . Now we 're suspected of international communism , disloyalty to the states who so cheerfully and patriotically destroy each other . When it comes to that , we 're suspected of both crimes at once . Your Puritan forefathers , " the doctor explained , warming a little to his theme , " adopted all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They looked onp169themselves as a chosen people , called into the wilderness to found the true church in the promised land , God 's elect tribe with whom he entered into a covenant of earthly and heavenlypromise . But in claiming the sentiment and the prophetic vocation of the Jew , they rejected the Jew himself . They turned their Christ into an excuse to preserve for the Jew his unique role of scapegoat . So it has always been , " the doctor said sadly and mildly . " It is no wonder that the Jew feels the contradictions of his position , that they eventually sink in and become deeply seated within his own mind , even leadingsometimes to that distinctively Jewish phenomenon , self-hatred . " He concluded very quietly , very dispassionately , the discoursingscientist , the detached expositor . Badger was out of his depth , frowning , unhappily puzzled and resentful . The idea of conscious inner contradiction was not congenial to his mind . But he was certainly trying to be pleasant . " Well , " he said , " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our religion seriously enough these days . Of course I 'm no fundamentalist , but I believe the country needs religion . Ca n't have discipline and values without it . Here 's something I 'd like to ask you , Doctor . How do you stand on socialized medicine ? " Andrew caught Connie 's eye . Her lips pursed ever so slightly in what he took as a signal of concurrence . " I 'd like to hear Doctor Holsberg on that subject , " he said . " But if you 'll excuse us , we do have some business to talk over . Let me take him into my study for a few minutes , and I 'll leave Badger in charge of the tray . " " If you will pardon us , " Holsberg said , getting up . Andrew waited for him to pass through the door into the hall , then followed him into the study . He turned on the overhead light , seated the doctor in the armchair , and swung his own desk chair about to face him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm fascinated by him , " said Holsberg . " It has been a real privilege to meet him . " " Tell me , did Maurice gain by his holiday in New York ? "  | " That was a very thoughtful arrangement on your part , President Aiken . I 'm very grateful for it , and so was Mau-rice . " " I was glad to do what I could for him . I would have been helpless , of course , if his department had n't agreed . They were a little reluctant , because Maurice is hard to replace . There 's not much a man in my position can do with college departments , unless he moves very carefully . " " I can understand that , " said Holsberg , smiling . " It is so in any organization . " He could be thinking of hospital routines . Were they as hard for an administrator to control ? " I saw Maurice crossing the campus this morning . I thought he seemed in a better frame of mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he been in , President Aiken ? " " Of course , " Andrew said , " I have n't been so close to Maurice for the past year as I used to be when we were both just faculty members . Let me think . " He 'd have to sketch everything for the doctor , without mincing . Maurice coming into the President 's office that afternoon a fortnight past to exhibit his girl student 's absurd , outrageous little paper , an Episcopalian girl , a Ngristian , like Badger . The fear of the eyes and the note-taking hands , the eyes that to Maurice were always on his Jewishness , whether they were in fact or not , the bland featureless gaze nursing itself on his difference . It did n't matter that a good many of the students were themselves Jewish ; that might even make it worse , for all Andrew could tell . The compensatory excess of conscientiousness , the self-flogging supererogatory hours of minute correction . The Communist rumor . " Well , it ended by his offering to resign , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , even those that Andrew had not expressed . " Ah yes , the grand gesture , to you , his befriender , " said Holsberg , smiling gravely , but with that same unspoken , perhapsunwitting hostility in his eyes . " It would have solved so many problems for Maurice . He could have been the scapegoat , the sacrificial victim , fulfilling the traditional Jewishp171role , and for once it might have helped someone who was friendly to him , might not have been altogether a loss . You have no idea of the ease of mind it can bring , the relief from emotional conflict , to sink into a role that everyone prescribes for you and accept it . Why did n't you let him , President Aiken ? " Andrew was startled . " I should think you would be the last to suggest  --  " he said and immediately wondered what he had failed to perceive , what the doctor was getting at . " I hoped that a short respite  --  well , my motives were n't altogether simplebenevolence toward Maurice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of this absurd rumor of communism . You can see what a vulnerable position it would leave the University in if he did that . Naturally I do n't want to sacrifice Maurice to the University either . It 's an old problem , is n't it , how to do good , or try to do it , through an institution ? Reconciling the needs of the individual and the needs of the institution . It 's enough to make any man wonder what his motives really are . Might n't the same be true of a hospital as well as a college ? " " Often , " the doctor assented . " I want to save Maurice 's professional future , " said Andrew . " That 's the thought my mind keeps coming back to . I do n't want him to put unnecessary stumbling blocks in his own path . " He thought he could see the hostility go from the doctor 's eyes , appeased or healed at least momentarily . . . " Did Maurice tell you how he spent his time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word or two . He apparently had some kind of ruckus with a man I wanted him to see , the novelist , Willys Darragh . " " He mentioned that , " said the doctor . " He seemed to take it humorously . I only learned by accident , from a friend Mauricebrought home to dinner , that he spent most of his time in shooting galleries . " " In shooting galleries ? " Human nature : inexhaustible comedyof surprise . But even as astonishment struck , you could begin to see the pattern . Maurice , with rented twenty-two atp172shoulder , popping at rows of mechanical ducks going by in a gallery . Or were they by now silhouettes of Chinese volunteersin Korea ? They should be , because that was it . Maurice was learning to shoot in the war against authoritarianism . Trying to salt and educate the middle class , and yet taking it as his frame of reference , trying to belong to it , qualifying for his brother 's role , a sergeant of infantry . " He was very proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurice 's father said . " He kept very careful track of his scores . " " Did lie say what his purpose was ? " " I ca n't be sure , " said the doctor , " because Maurice confidesin me very little , but I think he made at least one effort to enlist and was rejected . I gathered this impression , too , from the friend he brought home . " " Poor Maurice , " Andrew said . " How do you think he is now ? Will he settle down more happily to teaching ? " " I wish I knew . I thought perhaps you could enlighten me . " " Did he tell you , " asked Andrew , " that I 've encouraged him to apply for a leave of absence next year ? " " That was another very thoughtful act , President Aiken . No , he said nothing about it . " " Perhaps it would be better for him to keep his nose to the grindstone , if the strain has eased . What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and see , if that 's possible . But you have helped clear my mind about Maurice greatly . Perhapsyou 'll let me know if any  --  should any developments occur . I realize that you ca n't concern yourself exclusively with Maurice . I 'm glad to know that he has someone to befriendhim with so much understanding . " The doctor a little stiff as he said that . And then he was saying that if he could be excused , he would not rejoin the company , but would go early to bed . This was the first night he had been away from his practice , except for short summer vacations , in many years . He could n't resist the opportunity to catch up on sleep . Was it that , or was it distaste for Badger and Muriel , or was it a certain delicacy of consideration , the awful King Charles 's head tension again ? These people of a kind , I different . I intruder , I scapegoat , will take with mep173the sins and exclusions of the educated middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what contradictorydreams , leaving them to their MacArthurs and their highballs . " Well , " said Andrew , " if you 'd really like to sleep , I wo n't press you to join us . But I hope you 'll be able to visit Rowley again . There are any number of things I 'd like to talk with you about , including the kind of medical and psychiatric staff we ought to have and do n't . " The doctor hoped very much that the opportunity would present itself and Andrew left him at the foot of the stairs , feeling like a man who had tried to water a desert with a tin cup of good will . From the voices in the living room he could tell that opportunityhad struck for Uncle Thad at last . The tap had been opened and through the pipe that carried him back to Eden the distilled gentle water of reminiscence was running freely . Andrew went in , explained as briefly as he could that Doctor Holsberg had sent his excuses and gone early to bed , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saga of the first family automobile . He was the homely bard embellishing the traditional cadences of a tribal epic . The picture he made : suffused eye , unable to bear its own delighted contemplation of the past without overflowing , the drooping brown mustache , the placid hands folded on pudgy thighs . It was a very provincial picture , if you wanted to look at it that way . Uncle Thad was as much a tribal type as a Hebrew prophet admonishing the chosen , few in number , ringed by foes , leaning on the arm of the Lord for strength . How could the human race get along without all its provincialisms , its local tribes and clans with their cohesive customs and memories ? The roots of any kind of stability you could easily think of were apt to be tribal and local . The stability of one world , of the whole unitary global clan of men as men , was a thousand years ahead as yet and the way to it not obvious . But of course as the planet contractedyou had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each tribe learned to take in the stranger , though an Icelander or a Turk . The two great poles , the north and southp174of a human world that wobbled uneasily on its axis between them : the cosmopolitan against the provincial , clan against man . You could n't say that the south pole was right and the north pole wrong , that the world could do with only one of them . You had to have both poles ; you had to have both clan pride and recognition that the barbarian , too , is human , a member of the same sprawling collective body . The problem was to mediate the unavoidable repulsion between the poles , to keep the tension of difference from becoming that terrible and mutilating seizure that destroyed minds and turned nationsinto beast packs . You could see the same polarization in the way people married . There was marriage between like and like , and it did n't have to come from the conviction of being the Lord 's chosen at the expense of all other peoples . It did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own strain , fealty to one 's own folkways . If I forget thee , 0 Jerusalem , let my right hand forget her cunning . Willys Darragh would call it incestuous , the kind of thing that produced the Brahmin nostril , corrupt , contemptuous , inbred . And so you had to recognize the virtue of the opposite kind of marriage , too , marriage of the different : all breeds and nations stirring themselves into one vast mongrel porridge . Perhaps a man could have his legitimate taste and choice in the matter if he did what he could to avoid becoming a stumbling block to his neighbor . Take Sally and Jack Richmond , just to bring the problem close to home . They were like and like , and say what you will , that was a point in which parents were apt to take comfort . If they got around to marrying each other , it would n't create a stumbling block to any human neighbor , as far as a man could see . The stumblingblock was always in the offing , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bruise some human foot . " I mind the time , " Uncle Thad was saying , " when the whole tribe of us , with your father 's permission , Andy , piled into that contraption to go fishing one Saturday morning . Your father was an ingenious man for a deacon of the church . He knew more about machinery than anyone ought to know except the children of this world . As one of the Lord'sp175anointed , he should have kept his mind on heaven and higher things . Your father thought too much dust and dirt got into the motor and he made a kind of zinc casing to protect it . Trouble was , he forgot the engine was air-cooled . Well , sir , all the time we were bucking up the road at a reckless fifteen miles an hour , that engine was overheating . The exhaust pipe used to get cherry-red after an hour 's run anyway , and we figured out later that the gasoline feedline melted and began to drip on it . First thing we knew , we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was an old farmer in a wagon . We made a noise coming up that hill like the battle of Gettysburg , but he and his horse must have been as deaf as your Aunt Hatty 's bedpost , because neither one of them made a sign , nary a sign . Just as we began to bear down on him in earnest , though , he leaned out the wagon and turned his face to let go with a quid of tobacco juice and that gave him a glimpse of what was coming up behind him . Well , sir , he left that wagon without taking time to say the Lord 's Prayer . I could see the sky under the seat of his pants when he jumped . He came down in the brambles by the side of the road and thrashed around for a minute like a salmon in a net , trying to pick himself up . When he got his legs under him he took off over a stone wall , and the last I saw of him , he was running up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to beat the record . There were still farmers in those days who 'd never seen a horseless buggy , and we thought he was just shy at his first glimpse of that hellwagon of ours . But you know how it is when someone turns around and looks at you that way and acts as though he 'd seen Old Nick in person . You ca n't account for it by your own appearance and so you turn around and look yourself to see what kind of devil may be riding on your coat tails . " The observation was a just one , Andrew thought , but you never could tell what was going to strike any given human being as unbearably funny . Uncle Thad had found the triggerto explode Badger , who was just taking a swallow of highball . The splutter that overcame him made a considerable mopping-up operation necessary before Uncle Thad could go on.  | " Well , we all looked over our shoulders , and so help me Great Jehovah , the flames were streaming out behind us like the tail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charioteer'sseat but I remember he jumped on the brake and the brake would n't work . Bands all burned out by then and we were still bearing down on that wagon , no room to turn out on those old country roads . The old horse had n't taken any notice that he was n't being driven any more . He was edging along at a slow trot , blinders on and head down in the shafts . Veil , sir , at that point the car stalled and kind of humped itselfto a stop with a dying groan , which was just as well for the horse . We did n't do any more than push the wagon into his haunches with a couple of wheels off but it brought out a spirit in the animal I did n't suspect he had . He broke the traces with one kick , and when he went out of sight down the road with the harness trailing , he was hitting a clip fit to win the Derby . Of course when the car slowed down , those flames that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zenith . I remembered all those verses your mother used to read us from scripture about burnt offerings . In fact I never felt so near heaven in all my mortal days . I could see the faces of the saints and martyrs leaning over the bar to welcome me . We got out pretty fast , a little singed , but not much the worse for wear . The time when we made our real mistake , though , was after we got the car towed home . It was a mournful-looking piece of charred wreckage for your father to see in the front yard , and we thought he 'd have more ease of mind if it did n't stand out so naked and stark . So I got in to steer and the rest of the tribe pushed , only we 'd forgotten about the brakes . You remember the way the yard sloped down and back , Andy . Well , sir , that hellwagon rolled right down through your father 's garden , right through the sweet-pea brush and the dahlias and the corn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom , taking about six stakes out of the back fence . I can still hear your brothers yelling Steer , steer , ' as if I had a choice of where I was being conducted . " Uncle Thad 's eyes were full of the dew that fell on the first green evening before Adam was corrupted . Badger was  |p177holding  his glass halfway to his mouth , unable to trust the mechanism of swallowing as yet . Even Muriel was enjoying it as a form of unfamiliar quaintness . " You know , " said Andrew , " I think I can remember the sight of the wreck in the front yard under the big elm tree that used to grow there . My chin was just about high enough so that I could hang it on the window ledge . " " Church and Sunday School were solemn occasions coming on the heels of that Saturday , " said Uncle Thad . " I was in dire danger of repenting my sins and asking for a place at the mercy seat . Or perhaps I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to bring up the fact that they 're Jews ? " Muriel asked . " It makes me so uncomfortable . " " This Holsberg , " said Badger , " he 's probably a good doctor in his line , but if he does n't like this country , I should think he 'd go back to Palestine . He might get rid of some of those contradictions of his over there . " " Not all the Jews are Zionists , " Andrew said . " Some would like just to be accepted as citizens here , on a par with the rest of us . But they do n't want to sail under false colors . " " If I remember the Good Book as well as your mother taught me , Andy , " Uncle Thad said , " there were all kinds of fish in Saint Peter 's net , even if it took a miracle to put ' em there . And speaking of fish , I 've got something here I thought might interest Mr. Bratten . " Uncle Thad 's plump hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From inside his coat he took a worn shiny wallet , which opened on a display of trout flies and a twist of leader . From an outside pocket he extracted a small filed and jointed gadget which he opened , jackknife fashion , with a push of his thumb . " You know how hard it is sometimes to tie a fly on a leader , " he said . " Suppose you miss a strike and lose your fly in an alder bush , or you 're anxious to change flies in a hurry when you know there 's a good one in the pool but ca n't seem to give him what he wants . Or if you 're out in the early spring , with the ice just gone from the rivers . The wind can be mighty cold and raw then , and your hands mighty awkward . I used to pilfer around , as the feller said , making littlep178knickknacks in my spare time . Used to think I was going to be an inventor . I worked out this gadget here to tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guaranteed to work in any temperature or weather , " said Uncle Thad , winking jovially . " See , you open this pair of arms like this and run the loop of the fly up through here and then you feed the end of your leader in through this funnel hole  --  it 's funneled so you ca n't miss it , even if your fingers are stiff as hen 's claws , not like trying to thread a needle in an icehouse  --  and then through this other funneled hole , and then you squeeze the arms shut and pull . " Uncle Thad demonstrated , leaning forwardso that his paunch touched his legs , watching Badger 's face with a glint of shrewdness in his blue eyes and timing his instruction to a nicety . Badger was impressed . He tried the operation two or three times himself and his face showed his pleasure at his success and his respect for Uncle Thad 's ingenuity . " That 's pretty good , " Badger said . " That 's really good . A man could really use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd pretty nearly rather play poker around the fire , with a couple of highballs , than go out at all , even if they were biting . I 'd like to show this thing to a couple of friends of mine . I could make a good act of it , betting how fast they could tie on a fly . " Uncle Thad 's eyes had the self-satisfaction of the artist appreciatedin his work . But there was a glint in them of another kind , too , a glint of something like anxiety . " Of course I do n't know whether there 'd ever be any money in it , " he said deprecatingly . " I never had the capital to promote any of my inventions . I thought it might sell sometime through sporting-goods stores , if I knew how to get it started and had some capital to back it . " Badger was thoughtful . " Well , " he said , " I know some guys who are always interested in manufacturing new products if they can be pretty sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try it out on them some day , if you wanted . " " Glad to have you make any use of it you like , " said Uncle Thad . " You might try it out yourself , if you go fishing later in the spring . "  |p179He  leaned back again on the sofa , and the soberness of his eyes , the faint flushed color in his cheeks , marked a climax passed . Drama again , the quiet concealed drama that goes on almost behind the curtains of perception , not out in the glare of footlights on the public apron of the human stage . But drama all the same . 0 God , Thou halt made us for Thyself . The American Eden up for sale , crying in the marketplace , " Who will buy , " offered on the block for profit . Shame , sacrilege . But no , it was not profit , it was subsistence . Uncle Thad an aging man , proprietor of a hardware store that was not doing well , living alone in a boardinghouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Afraid , insecure . Childhood does n't pay the bills . One must come to market with what one has . Eden must be advertised and sold . Our hearts have no rest . Andrew allowed himself to lose the back-and-forth shuttle of conversation for a while . He could hear the voices going on , Connie and Muriel , Badger and Uncle Thad , no gaps that needed to be bridged . Uncle Thad was well immersed in the past again , but without full animation , a little below his best , the tribal bard remembering only the stock half-lines and standard phrases , unable to summon the improvised embellishments , the new details and fresh kennings . Badger was reminded of a story , not too raucous , and was threatening to be reminded of another when the telephone rang . Andrew got up and went into the hall to answer it . He waited while the operator established his identity and reported to another operator that her party was ready . A longdistancecall always seemed to require a quartet . There was something wrong with the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then ; this might almost be a drunken crank . Alumnus with some grudge . Woman 's voice in the background . Andrew thought he could hear her saying , " Go ahead , " and , " Have to . " followed by the male syllable , " God . " " This is President Aiken , is it ? " " Speaking , " said Andrew , beginning to be impatient . " The reason I called , President Aiken  --  " Interruption by the woman . " Well , is Mr. Bratten there ? That is , well , I un/derstood he 's with you . I 've been trying to get him , could n't seem to connect  --  " " Yes , Mr. Bratten is here . Do you want to speak with him ? " " Well , I 'll have to , I guess . This is his business partner , tell him . You could n't  --  " The word " message " was smothered by the woman saying , " Have to yourself . " It was n't drunkenness , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for Badger . " Oh , God , all right , " he said to the woman , and then loudly into Andrew 's ear , " Ask him to come to the phone . " Andrew put the instrument down and went back into the living room . They had stopped talking . They were all looking at him . " It 's for you , Badger , " he said , and he could n't keep out of his own voice the contagious excitement of some ominous kind , could n't keep his skin temperature from rising or his face from stiffening . " It 's your business partner . " Badger looked nettled , said , " What the hell does he want ? Everything was in good shape when I left , " and got up from the sofa . They tried to resume conversation while he was out of the room . " I wish Badger could keep his business deals to office hours , " said Muriel , pouting with her leathery skin . " Calling up in the middle of the evening this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could reach Badger here if it 's important . " But they were all listening with the more acute part of their attention to the syllables that Badger uttered in a totally strange voice , conscious of his edging away down the hall to the length of the telephone cord , as far out of earshot as he could get . Andrew could almost see the green slime of fear that came crawling into the room , that was under their feet , at their backs , between their faces . That time , on the fringe of memory , when he had been taken to the county fair to see the balloon ascension . Pushed and overtopped by the circle of crowd , he could just make out segments of the balloon on the ground , a vast loose elephant skin lying in dead brown wrinkles . Then suddenly it was mounding up into a haystack , and then distending into a pear-shaped enormity , smoke drooling from its pendant-lipped elephant mouth as it hungp181like a limbless cloud-beast over a frightened and blurry-eyed boy , his hand firmly clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast high in air , sudden as an apple whipped from the end of a stick , the blurred green face of the balloon man sucked up with it on his trapeze underneath , the incredible swift shrinking of the cloud to a haystack and the haystack to a pea , miles off already . " Watch , now , he 's going to jump and open ten parachutes before he comes down . " Drop of a black dot from the pea . Expected bloom in air of the miracle , the parachute . But the dot kept on dropping . Nothing happened . Anticlimax , failure of a grown-up promise . Voices saying , " It did n't open ; none of them opened . " Father talking very loudly and cheerfully , his face pale . " Well , you saw the balloon go up . Would you like to have an ice-cream cone now ? " Bumping and pushing of the crowd , mysterious intensity of eagerness and queer excited joy in faces and eyes . When Badger came back into the room , it was not Badger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with collapsed face and eyes half-sprung like something overripe coming out of its sheath and a physically impossible loss of height as if the blood had run out of him through a spigot and left him shrunken . He was unable to speak , that was clear ; but then words came from him . " Excuse , " and again " Excuse . " And then " News  --  bad . " Trying to be conscious of the company , trying to apologize . A gesture of one hand , bewildered , objectless , and then , " Muriel , they 'll excuse us  --  upstairs a minute . Something you  --  something to tell you . " Muriel getting up , flustered , gathering herself together , frightened into silence . Going out into the hall and up the stairs . Connie followingthem , getting as far as the door , stopping . Going after Connie , looking over her shoulder , trying to think of things to say : " If there 's anything we can do for you , Badger  --  " Muriel , at the stairhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Badger ? Do n't keep me in this unbearablesuspense . It 's unbearable . " Crossing the hall . Door to the guest room closing . Andrew came back into the living room with Connie and they sat down . Uncle Thad still occupied his place at the corner of the sofa . His little gadget for tying flies to leadersp182lay neglected on the tray of drinks . Break the tension somehow . Absolute need to speak , to vocalize , no matter what inanity . " What do you suppose  --  " Andrew managed to begin , and simultaneously Connie was saying , " I hope it is n't  --  " Then the tension was broken for them and at once raised again to a pitch of prolonged unendurable acuteness . From the room above their heads came a sustained full-throated shriek of awful frankness and abandon . They heard the name " Harry " uttered as if screeched by gears tearing each other 's teeth out , then again the fearful wordless nightmare childscreamof doomsday power , the scream of a woman surrenderingherself in full volition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . The sound of a struggle or scuffle . Badger 's voice , inarticulately percussive , drumbeats vibrating dully down through walls and floor , and over it the cyclonic fury of wails breaking in successive crests toward a welkin-tearing climax that voice could not reach but kept trying to reach . Then the screamed anthem of " Harry " again in compulsive repetitive sawblade incision . Words , finally , wrenched out fibrous and raw in a pelting insistent stream : " Do something for me , Badger . Why do n't you do something ? Why do n't you help me ? They ca n't take Harry from me like that , they ca n't , ca n't , ca n't . I wo n't have it . Harry killed , Badger , killed . It is n't true . Tell me it is n't true . Do something for me , Badger . Help me . No one ever does anything for me , me , me . " It seemed for a moment that exhaustion was setting in , dissolution into a running rhythmicalcurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drumbeats through wood and plaster . Then suddenly the storm was on again , belling of the enraged gale in full cry . Feet struck the floor overhead as if in a convulsive leap , a quick flight and pursuit bounded across the room , the guestroomdoor flew open , and the noise came blowing out unobstructed . " I ca n't stay in this house , not another minute . I ca n't I ca n't . Take me home , Badger . Take me away somewhere . Do something for me . " Connie up and at the living-room door . Over her shoulder the spectacle of Muriel taking the stairs with insane animal vigor , coming down , hair disordered ,  |p183bald  eyes staring , Badger coming after her . " Now , Muriel , wait a minute , think what you 're doing . " The mad pursuit going by the door , Muriel jerking at the front-door knob , Badger trying to restrain her , Muriel turning on him ferociously . " I 'm not going to stay in this house . I'rn going away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she was out and Badger was following her . From porch and steps and lawn the shrieks began again . There was no way to think sanely ; nothing sane to think . " What shall we do ? I 'd better get the car out and drive them back to New York . No trains this time of night . " " You ca n't , Andy . You 'd be dead . You 'd be driving all night and into the morning . And in her condition  --  " " Shall I call the doctor ? What about Holsberg ? If I could only get Badger for a minute , if she 'd stop  --  " They were coming in again . Muriel 's head was down now ; the shrieking was over . She was sobbing into handkerchief and hands ; mucus visible . " We 've got to adjust to this thing , " Badger was saying , trying to soothe her back with an unwantedhand , Muriel swaying on ahead . Up the stairs in procession , and halfway up the great shriek once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit . " Nobody helps me , nobody does anything for rne . Why ca n't you help me , Badger ? Take me away  --  this house  --  " Badger looking at them for the first time , looking down over his shoulder , face of gray-plaster desperation . Blocking the stairs , his arm on the banister , Muriel pounding it and shrieking . Connie following them up , himself following on her heels , magnetized by Badger 's look . Muriel climbing again now , low , grunting rhythm of sobbing expulsions from her . " Oh , oh , oh ! "  --  animal , abdominal , fearful . Then at the top , on the landing , an apparition : Holsberg , with scowling sleepy eyes , heavy Semitic figure swathed in a purple silk robe , the door of the upstairs sitting room open behind him . " If Mrs. Bratten will prepare for bed , I think these will enable her to sleep , " he said gravely . He shook two pills from a small bottle into his palm and took a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch me.  |p184Badger  , do n't let him . Do something for me . " But when the doctor took her wrist , she allowed herself to be led quietly into the guest room . " I 'll help you take your things off and hang them up , " said Connie , following them . Badger hesitated at the door , but Muriel must have flung herself on one of the twin beds with her clothes on . Andrew could hear a wrench and a squeak , and Badger went in after Connie . Holsberg came to the door , asking for a glass of water . Andrew went to get it and when he returned he could hear only a hoarse irregular breathing from inside the room . The doctor took the glass and closed the door . Andrew went back as far as the head of the stairs and stood waiting . He might as well go down to the living room ; what could he do up here ? No , not yet ; there might be some other little errand , some gesture or word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower hall made him lean out and peer over the railing . Uncle Thad 's brown mustache and blue eyes were looking up at him . Andrew waved , and Uncle Thad shaped words with his lips and pointed toward the front door . He went out on tiptoe . It was becoming possible to believe in silence again . The guest-room door opened and Dr. Holsberg came out . He looked at Andrew sympathetically . " She will sleep , " he said , and turned toward the sitting room where his own slumberhad been interrupted . Pausing , he faced about and spoke , almost as if to himself , as if giving Andrew an opportunity to escape paying any heed to his words unless he freely chose to share them . " I too have a son in Korea . " Before Andrew could respond , he had shut himself into his room . Andrew let his legs take him down the stairs and back to the comfortable sofas where they had all sat listening to Uncle Thad relive Eden for them until the telephone rang and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open . Vacancy . Exhaustion of feeling . There were the drinks on the tray , Muriel 's brandy and soda for once unfinished , Badger 's highball pale and dilute with melting ice . Badger might come down later . Andrew would have to be ready to say something to him . He might want to walk , to drink ; what would a man want to do ? Watch with me onep185hour . Connie might come down with him . See that she got some sleep . Suddenly a boil of anger began to gather head inside him , began to swell and throb toward ulcerous discharge . Obscene spectacle . Loathsome exhibition . Even now , when you had just lived through it , you could n't really believe . Wreaking her hysteric child 's ego ; " me me me , " wiping mucous lips on every decency of restraint and control . Well , what would you have ? Could everyone take it the Roman way , the gruff soldierly way of the heroic age if it ever existed ? " Had he his hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a brave death and no mourning . Regret only one life for my country . Hard to believe Muriel 's calculated hysteria , but harder still to believe , to encompass , the actual young man 's actual death . Harry , the student , the idealist , as Badger called him . " Ve 've got to adjust to this thing . " We do ; that 's the tragedy . The mind ca n't make it fully real and so the wars go on . The mind fumbles around and around it in words , actual , real , really killed , reality . Reality is the hardest thing to believe . Uncle Thad 's little gadget had disappeared from the tray . He must have taken it home with him in his pocket . Badger no hope now . You run the end of the leader in through this little funnel hole . Fingers as stiff as hen 's claws . Our hearts have no rest untilp187Here she was , on a Friday evening , puttering around her apartment all alone , thinking of things that upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hateful and close , like a room hung with angry colors that did n't match . After stretching up to put the last of her supper dishes on the cupboardshelf , Angela noticed a grimy spot on one finger . There must be dust on the shelf above her eye-level . Over the week end she 'd have to take down her china and give the cupboard a good cleaning , but she was afraid she 'd break something if she started moving her dishes now . She washed her hands and wiped them on a paper towel . Auntie used to tell her that her hands were long and bony and that she had long feet and must always be careful not to toe out and that she would always have a stringbean figure . It seemed as though Auntie tried to discourage her about herselfwhenever she could , and it was on account of men , of course . Well , she did n't want men thinking about her in the way they sometimes  --  in the way that beastly McCarthy  --  but then , neither did she want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less tall , though really she was n't so much above the average . She wished that men would think of how much she had to give . She 'd long ago stopped thinkingthat she 'd ever be glamorous or beautiful , but she knew she 'd have a lot to offer if she just had a home with someone in it and a chance to show him all the ways in which she could help . She could cook , and make a room attractive because she had taste , and she could talk intelligently . And she could help a man with his job . She understood office workp188and organization , she could tell when people were doing their jobs well and when they were n't and why , and she knew how to let a man talk and how to help him reach decisions when he was confused , as men so often were . She could manage children , too ; she knew she could . That course in child psychologyshe took in college : her notes were still tucked away in a drawer , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading even yet . And since that time so many good books had come out on the development and training of children . It seemed as though a lot were being wasted , and it was n't her fault ; she 'd been ready all the time . It was something about men , something she did n't understand . Here she was again , right in the midst of the treadmillthinkingthat threatened to grow into a habit . There was nothing to do but try to break it up by some kind of action , any kind . On the table by her sofa in the living room she had the latest copies of the Atlantic and McCall 's and if she turned on the radio she might be able to find a quiz contest or one of those hillbilly or popular-song programs . Or she could pick up the latest novel from the book club she 'd joined , but she knew it would be horrid . It was by that man Willys Darragh that Andy was interested in , she could n't imagine why . He was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she agreed with Andy about censorship ; she was on the liberalside . But when you saw some of the things that Darragh put in print  --  Anyway , she knew she could n't keep her mind on reading tonight , and a radio program would only make her feel lonelier and more miserable with no one to share it . Angela went into her bedroom cupboard and fished three pairs of stockings and a slip from her laundry bag . She 'd meant to let them wait and wash them later in the week end , just to be sure she 'd have a little something to do if a moment came when she simply had to occupy herself . Here it was only Friday evening , and the moment had come already . It would be better if she had some office work but Andy insistedthat work ought to be finished during regular hours . That was the main reason why he practically forced her to hire the Tozzer girl , Myrtle , as an assistant . Angela worriedp189about it , at first . She did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Andy , and besides , an incompetentwould simply be a nuisance they 'd have to get rid of . But she did n't want the second girl to  --  well , she saw quickly enough that Myrtle would never be able to take her place away from her . Myrtle was a capable routine secretary , and she was rather attractive , but not terribly attractive . Angela hoped for a while that they could rent an apartment together , but Myrtle lived with her mother and father and paid part of her salary into the house . Of course no girl wanted a woman as boss ; just on that account she always tried to be really friendly and helpful to Myrtle , never catty or critical ; that is , after she was really sure  --  What made Andy so wonderful to work for was that he thought about other people 's problemsand tried to help . That Maurice Holsberg , for instance . Andy really allowed Maurice to impose on him . She 'd once thought that Maurice , in the days when he used to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt and she tried to tell him that he did n't need to feel isolated , tried to let him see that what he really needed  --  how could she have made such a mistake ? She could n't stand him any more and she did n't see how Andy could . But he was only one example of how Andy tried to make life decent for people . This business of after-hours work was another . He said the college had become terribly lax about expecting secretariesto take work home at night . He told her to make out a uniform plan for all secretarial offices , including hours of work , salary scales , holidays , and everything else . That plan had been fun ; she 'd taken it home several evenings without telling him , and when it was finished he told her it was one of the ablest pieces of work he 'd ever seen . She had a chart in her desk that she could work on now , showing the whole administrative organization of the University , the departmentsand museums , the library , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deans ' offices and all the rest . It was fun to box in neatly with India ink the name of each unit and to connect them with lines that showed the divisions of responsibility and arrows that traced the flow of authority back and forth , this way and that . She thought her chartp190exposed several weaknesses , areas where power overlapped or responsibility was uncertainly divided . Well , take Repairs , for instance . Repairs did n't seem to be under any control but its own . It ought to be tied in much more closely with the Treasurer 's office and the Purchasing Agent , but from all she could learn , it was n't . Her chart would bring that out clearly . And when she finished this chart , she 'd begin on another , showing how the administrative setup would look if it were ideal . But though it was a help to have a project , she did n't want to work at it tonight . She felt discouraged . Andy had looked at her once or twice recently as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that way , she wished he would come right out and say so . Angela hung the three pairs of stockings on the extra towel rack to dry and went to work on the slip . If she had a man , a husband , he would be sitting just a few steps away in the livingroom , reading the paper or listening to the radio , waiting for her to finish . She could talk to him through the open door while she rinsed out her slip . Except that  --  but no , it was n't true , all men were n't like that . It was the queerest thing how Nick used to act excited and , well , terrified whenever he happenedon her washing stockings or busy with anything that had to do with herself , such as combing her hair . Now she was thinking of him again , when she believed she had just about forgotten him , practically put out of her mind forever the fact that she was once Mrs. Nicholas Petrov . But of course she had n't been Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that she could n't actually realize . It still seemed queer and unbelievable . When he 'd run off with that awful sexy woman , that false blonde , she 'd thought for a while that it was something about herself , something that repelledmen . But then that horrible friend of his that just made her shiver came looking for him one evening , not knowing that Nick had run away , and though she hated the man and he made her sick all over , she thought he might help her understand , and something simply forced her to ask him , " Why did Nick leave me ? " And he laughed and asked her whether Nick had ever  --  well , he put it very coarsely , and she felt sicker than ever and wanted to kill him . He laughedp191again , seeing right through her and making her feel naked , and he told her Nick and the woman were just covering up for each other , whatever that meant . Well , she knew what it meant , but it just seemed too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . She 'd been sick with herself for talking with the man at all ; it was one thing she 'd never told even to Connie . But somehow it made her feel better after she 'd thought about it for a while . And she felt better as soon as she began to forget Nick and put the whole episode out of her mind , because that 's what it was , just an episode . She found she could get an annulment instead of a divorce and that meant she could treat the whole thing as though it never happened . She really had almost managed to stop thinking about it until lately . These last days , though , when she was alone , it kept coming back to her . It was that awful man , that beastly McCarthy . And as if she had n't made it clear that she did n't  --  that she was n't  --  Poking his head in her office all the time on the pretext that the lights needed fixing or that he could get her a new desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Now Angela , I do n't mean anything wrong , nothing like that will happen again , I 'm sorry , I just thought a little singing , you could ask some people in . " She could n't seem to avoid him . She had no protection . If she could only find a girl friend to share an apartment with her , or if she had money enough to rent an apartment of her own in an up-to-date building with a phone in the lobby . Of course Andy paid her as generously as a college budget allowed , but this apartment , just two rooms and a kitchen in an old house  --  What if McCarthy should actually come some night , as he kept threatening ? As Angela stretched up with the dress hanger toward the hook on the bathroom door , she was trembling all over . She shook so that she lost her grip on the hanger . It sprang up in the air and the slip came off and began to fall . She caught it just in time . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clawed her ankle and started a run in her stocking . If she only knew someone , if someone would only call up , it would be so nice to have a date , to know that someone would take care of her . And she could take care of him , shep192could help in lots of ways . She had strength to lend , the kind of strength a man needed , but she needed to be taken care of herself . The last person who ever took care of her since her father and mother died , almost before she could remember , was Auntie , but it was hard living with Auntie , those last few years especially . Auntie was always telling her to be a good girl , and hinting about  --  well , about the kind of beastly things that awful McCarthy  --  and asking her what she 'd done on a date and how she felt , and she insinuated that all men , even Angela 's own father , for that matter  --  It was just impossible to go on living with Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college and secretarial school and get herself a job , even though it took all the savings her mother left her . If she let her mind bring hack those years with Auntie , she could still hear herself asking what it was so awful that men  --  and then Auntie 's hand was coming and she dodged and fell back and her wrist hit something on the stove and she had that scar right where it showed , so that she never liked to wear anythingsleeveless . It was pretty scary , going off to college and then a job , all alone . She was certainly lucky to begin workingright away for people like Andy and Connie . They were the nearest thing she had to father and mother and friends wrapped up in one . Her mind was getting entirely out of control . It was closing in on her like those thunderclouds with the colors of moldy bread that terrified her as a child , made her feel as though some awful vindictive personification were singling her out and tracking her down . Angela went to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center drawer firmly , and extracted the chart of organizationthat lay neatly folded inside , almost finished . She spread it out on the desk blotter and arranged her notes and worksheetsaround it . A few more lines to ink in , a few last relationsand confused spheres of influence to plot so that they would be revealed at a glance , and it would be done . Then she could begin the second chart that would show a completelylucid and rational distribution of power and responsibility . She untwisted the cap of the bottle of India ink , picked up her ruler and pen from the glass tray under the pigeon/holes , and at that moment her apartment buzzer rasped sharply . It was just as though she had a system of electric wires with loose tickling ends right inside herself . The currentran all through , shaking her like chills and fever . Some of the gang were calling on her . They 'd just had the thought , " Would n't it be fun to go over to Angela 's for a while , it 's Friday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ice ? Yes , a dozen bottles . Or it might be that nice Charlie Delano , he was nice , even although he staggered a little at that last party and pulled her curtain down , making a big tear in it , as he tried to catch himself . He 'd stayed on for ten days and more after coming to visit his brother Sam for just a short while , and it was after he met her that he 'd changed his mind . Or it might be  --  there was no use trying to down the awful fear . Those electric wires were stinging her with it , hot and cold and bitter ; her mouth tasted like rancid butter . Angela jumped up before the buzzer stopped rasping . She began to stuff the chart back in her drawer . No , she could do that while the gang were coming upstairs , while Charlie was coming up to take her out to a movie or to drink beer and have a nice talk and then perhaps he 'd kiss her good night at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intimate that he was beginning to be serious . But if it was n't Charlie , if instead  --  No phone in the lobby ; the door did n't even have glass panels , so that she could n't run down and look first . The fear , the indecision , were terrible ; they held her in the middle of the room , actually paralyzed as if she 'd had a stroke . Then she was running to press the button that would click admissionto the gang down in the lobby , or to  --  what could she do if  --  and now , if it was , he 'd be inside and coming up the stairs , he 'd be thinking that she  --  and for that she could kill him , she certainly could , actually kill . She worked at the doorknob , trembling as she was , and got it open and went out and leaned over the railing of the stairs . It did n't seem possible to speak , and she did n't want to shout so that the other apartments could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were strangling her with a hot rope , but she managed to say , " Who is it ? " in some sort of voice , whether loud enough to wake the dead or in a lar/yngitis croak she could n't tell . Someone was just reaching the first stairhead and following the hail along the banisters toward the foot of the next flight , her flight . It was n't the gang ; she would have heard their voices by now . And of course they would have called up first , would n't they ? Anyone would have , just to be sure she was in . She 'd been a fool , a fool . She could kill herself . Looking down over the railing through the grubby hall light she could see a hat coming into view , rounding the turn to begin the ascent of the stairs . The brim made a dusky oval in the midst of a burly circuit of shoulders . Down around a knee that was jerking up toward her a step at a time , a guitarcase rocked and rose with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hands and arms , braced on the railing , gave way with a hot pain , and her collarbone almost bumped on the banister . She straightened up somehowand ran back into her room . Her knees refused to supporther , and she leaned backward against the door after she had slammed it . The lock , she did n't know how strong it was or what a man could do with it whose business was repairs and that sort of thing . She ought to have one of those chain locks that made it possible to open the door just a crack and look out . Steps approached and a knuckle-rap sounded . She felt it through her back and leaped away as if something leproushad touched her . Should she scream ? She did n't know whether she could , and she did n't want the other apartments prying , snickering , making a joke of her . She needed someone to take care , she 'd simply have to get help , callShe went to the telephone , made her hands open the red leather book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beforeshe could fix on one , the Delanos ' number popped into her mind . Her fingers gained control of themselves with action . They whipped the dial around , and while she was waiting for the answer she stretched the telephone cord as far as she could toward the door . The knuckles were beginning to knock again , she could see them in her mind , great coarse knuckles with red hair on them , but he  --  that  --  that beastly  --  he must have heard her steps backing toward the door with thep195telephone , because the knocking stopped . He thought she was going to let him in , did she ? A man 's voice answered at the other end of the line , and she spoke loudly , swinging around and pointing her mouth toward the door . " Is this Charlie ? " " No , it 's Sam . Do you want my brother ? Who is it , please ? " " Oh , Sam , I 'm in the most dreadful  --  it 's Angela . There 's a  --  a drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A drunk ? " Sam did n't understand things quickly ; he was young and serious though he was nice . He just said , " A drunk ? " that way and waited . And from outside she could hear words comingthrough , trying not to be overheard down the hall , trying to make her believe  --  or still thinking that she  --  as though his blarney  --  " It 's just me , Angela , Jim McCarthy . I 've got my guitar here . Just a little music , that 's all . " She could hear Sam Delano talking with his mouth away from the phone . " Angela says a drunk is trying to get into her apartment . " And she could hear a woman 's voice , though she could n't hear the words , and then she could hear Charlie saying something about  --  well , she could n't be sure , but she knew from his tone he was joking , and it was cruel at a time like this , though it was just his way , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could hear his voice go up , and then McCarthy was saying in his blarneyest tone , " I 've got a new ballad I want you to hear , nothing more , Angela , honest to God , " and Sam was saying into the telephone , " Why do n't you call the janitor and have him come up and throw the guy out ? " She walked quickly away from the door . She was less afraid now that McCarthy would try to force his way in . She could tell that he only meant to wheedle and blarney . She slipped around the corner of the hall into the living room , taking the telephone with her as far as the cord would go . " The janitor 's phone is broken , and besides he 's never around . He 's drunk half the time himself . I 'm in such a fright . This man out in the hall simply wo n't go away , and I do n't know what to do . I just thought perhaps you 'd all come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go away , and we could have some beer . I just ca n't face  --  please , Sam , I 'm so fright-ened . " There was another silence in the phone , or almost a silence . She could hear them talking back and forth , and finally Sam said , " Are n't there some neighbors you could call up in the building ? I mean , if the man 's really making a nuisance of himself , they 'd surely  --  well , it would take us fifteen minutes anyway  --  " " I 've called the only people I know , " Angela said , " and they 're out , and it 's mostly girls in the building . " " Why do n't you try the police ? " asked Sam , and he sounded so pleased with himself she could have choked him . " I  --  I did n't think of that , " Angela said . " I thought right away of you and Charlie , and I thought you might come over and help me get rid of  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get mixed up with the police , Sam , and I 'm so  --  " " Well , " said Sam , " maybe Charlie and I  --  we have n't any sitter  --  I guess for a few minutes  --  " " Oh , thanks , Sam , " Angela said . " You do n't know what it means to me . I 'm so scared I 'm beside myself . " She hung up quickly , because she could still hear Charlie 's voice in the background and it sounded as though he were making more of his jokes . Were those McCarthy 's footsteps going away or was it someone from another apartment crossing the hall ? She went to the door and listened . A faint hoarse purr of breathing seemed to come through , and a squeak , as though someone were shifting weight from one foot to the other outside . " If you do n't go away , " she said loudly , " I 'll call the janitor and have him throw you out . " For an instant nothing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . An under-the-breath " God damn " came to her , followed a second later by a word that sounded like  --  he had actually called  --  her mind could hardly say it , but he had , he had called her a " bitch . " The word crawled and wriggled on her skin . She felt it poking inside through her back , felt sick and unclean , and why ? What had she done to make him think  --  But at least he was going away . Thep197steps resumed and started down the stairs . In a few minutes the buzzer would sound again , and it would be Charlie and Sam . If only McCarthy did n't come back , if only he never came back ! Angela ran into the living room , folded and put away her chart in the desk drawer , hurried into the kitchen and began setting out a tray and glasses , cans of beer and an opener . She unwrapped the foil from the cheese that she had put ready on a plate in the icebox and laid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge . Then she carried the tray and board into the living room and put them on the table by the window bench . When had she called ? Fifteenminutes , Sam said . Ten was plenty , and five must have gone by . Time to change her dress ? Her new full skirt that was gathered at the waist made her look less tall , but she would have to hurry , and she looked well in her soft blue sweater with her coral brooch pinned to the shoulder , though it was a warm night and she did n't really need the sweater . At least she could change the stockings in which the dress hanger had started a run . She was just wiping her mouth after using her lipstick when the buzzer sounded again . She ran to the clicker button and pressed it , then back to the bathroom mirror for inspection . She raised her arm to clean off a blurred spot on her lip , and the scar on her wrist showed smooth and livid in the glass . Her bracelet  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost at the head of the stairs , and it would n't do to keep them waiting , because that beastly  --  they 'd think , when they found no one there  --  Perhaps the sleeve of her sweater , if she was careful , while she spread cheese or whatever , not to stretch her arm out too far " Is that Charlie ? Is that Sam ? " she said , running to the door . " Present , " said Charlie 's voice . " Ready for any emergency . Theirs not to reason why , theirs but to do  --  ' " She opened the door , and Charlie asked , " Where 's the intruder ? Here we 've come armed to the teeth , I with my snickersnee and Sam with his academic blunderbuss , but the victim has fled . We searched all the broom cupboards on the way up but we did n't find so much as a skeleton . "  |p198Charlie  was being funny , and she tried to fall in with the spirit of it and laugh , but she really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't know what I 've been through , " she said . " I was terrified . All the time I was talking with Sam on the phone , he was outside , pounding on the door , and I was afraid any minute he 'd break the lock and come in by main force . I finally did the next best thing to what you told me . I shouted that if he did n't go away , I 'd call the janitor , and at last he went off . " " What a waste of chivalry , " Charlie said . " Here we come prepared to sacrifice life itself , and the danger has vanished . " " Well , you deserve a reward anyway , " Angela said . " Do come in , and we 'll have some beer . " She backed away from the door and stood at the entrance to the living room , but it seemed for a minute that they were n't going to come in at all . They looked at each other , and Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children alone . Well , for a jiffy or two , maybe . We really ca n't stay . " They walked in finally , Charlie first and Sam after him , and Charlie said , " A repast . Cheese , crackers , beer . All prepared and waiting . " It was suspicious and sarcastic , the way he said it . Angela felt herself flush . " I had things in the icebox , " she said . " I got a tray out while you were on the way over , after that awful noisy drunk had gone . " " What did he do ? " Sam asked . " Did he really try to break in ? " " Well , not exactly , " Angela said . " But I thought any minute he was going to . That 's what frightened me so . But he 's gone now . Do sit down and have some beer . Pull up some chairs if you do n't like the window seat . " " You know , Angela , " Charlie said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to the dregs through no fault of his own . His wife beat him , perhaps , or his mother was unkind to him . A little understanding , a little love , and who knows , he might be redeemed . " Charlie was funny , but there was such a thing as beingp199too funny . And it was hard to tell sometimes just what he meant . He sounded almost as though he did n't believe  --  Angelafelt herself beginning to shake again , and she could n't keep the tears from coming to her eyes . " It 's all very well to make a joke of it , " she said , " but if you knew how frightened I was , if you knew how it feels to be alone  --  " Both Charlie and Sam looked at her strangely . They believedher now , if they had n't before . They must believe . They were silent , and then Charlie said , " Well , if he was just a stray drunk , he probably did n't have any idea where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . He 'll wanderoff and try somewhere else and eventually get picked up and carted off to the station . You need n't worry , Angela , he wo n't come back . " He was nice when he spoke that way , seriously and sincerely . She shivered and said , " I hope he wo n't , " and Charlie opened a can of beer while she began to spread cheese on a row of crackers . " Would n't it be fun if we had a few more people and could sing ? " she said . " I have n't the time tonight , " Sam said . " I really ought to be home working now . Sometime when we can get a sitter  --  " " That was quite a songfest we had  --  when was it ? Last time we were here , " said Charlie . " That Mother Machree tenor , what was his name , McCarthy , was n't it ? I have n't heard such hundred-proof corn since Edison invented the talking machine . I wish I could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was awfully unpleasant to have it end that way , " Angelasaid , " when we were all having such a good time . Tell me , Charlie , are you going to stay and visit a while longer ? " She hoped he would stay , of course , but she wanted to get the conversation away from drunks , too , and why did Charlie have to think of that beastly McCarthy just when the evening could turn out to be fun after all ? " My vacation has pretty nearly run out , " Charlie said , " and I guess I 've more than spent my welcome . Sam and Mary are too busy raising infants to bother with me , and it makes anp200oppressive atmosphere for a confirmed bachelor . They 're the most pullulative young couple I 've met in the twentieth century . They just have n't heard of planned parenthood . " " We believe in having our children while we 're young , " said Sam . His face was very serious . He had reason to be serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless Mary had money of her own , as Angela suspected . But even if they did n't have money , if he had a woman like Angela herself , if she could manage and plan for someone like Sam " It will end by his taking to drink , " said Charlie . " I 've figuredout that at his current rate of production  --  " " About that McCarthy , " said Sam , his forehead knitting up . " Here 's a funny thing . He 's the head of Repairs here , you know , Charlie . When we  --  that is , when my boss , Professor Dorion , wanted to wall off a section of the lab , we got an estimate from McCarthy . Of course it 's none of my business how the college wants to allocate bookkeeping charges betweendepartments and Repairs , but what he estimated for materials , ordinary plywood and stuff like that ! I went out and bought what we needed myself , and I beat McCarthy 's figures by more than you 'd believe . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her how shocked she was at the cost of altering the secretary 's office so that both she and Myrtle could have rooms . Andy said not to bother , the changes were necessary , but she 'd called the Treasurerand asked him some questions . He grew testy and acted as though she were meddling , so she dropped the whole business . But he said enough to make her think he did n't know too much about Repairs and how it handled bills and accounting . " I managed to save a little on the contract overhead , " Samwas saying . " Not much , but some . And you know we hadanother run-in with him , Mary and I. We had a leak in thekitchen sink pipe , and the college is supposed to keep FacultyRow in a livable condition , so I called McCarthy . He cameover and looked at it and said I do n't know how many feet ofpipe ought to be replaced , and it ought to be copper , and Repairsdid n't have any and could n't get it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thenp201he thought he could get me some privately , if I wanted to pay fo'r it , and the labor could be charged to Repairs and I 'd have a kitchen that would last twenty years , as if I were going to be here that long . I told him I did n't care to do it , and that 's the last I heard from him about the leak . I had to get a plumber to come and he put in one new length of pipe , about six feet . " " Really , Sam ? " Angela said . If there was anything on earth she did n't want to hear about at the moment , it was McCarthy . She wished she could blot him right out of herself forever , as she 'd almost succeeded in doing with Nick . But she could feel her mind beginning to put clues together in spite of herself . The Treasurer thought she was nosy , did he ? Well , let him . She knew someone in his office , they were still good friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested , how could she help ? If she gave him a hint or two , he 'd find out , he 'd get the answers , and she 'd show that  --  thinking she wanted , calling her that word he 'd used . She felt a spot inside her , sultry and unpleasant , like heartburn . She 'd never felt so toward anyone before , not that she could remember , vindictive , ready to kill , to do anything . " Fixing the kitchen sink , buying plywood , " Charlie was saying . " That 's the life of an academic family man . Give me the insurance business every time . I can hardly wait to get back to it . " " Are you going right away ? " Angela asked . " I thought we might arrange another get-together some night , maybe over the week end . " " I 'm too busy , for one , " Sam said . " I 'm working overtime trying to get my data in shape for a progress report on this contract . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple more hours tonight . " " Do you have to go so soon ? " Angela asked . They were both getting up . Sam had n't even finished his beer and Charliewas tipping the remains of his second down his throat in one big gulp . Around the breadboard straggled a wreath of crackers spread with cheese . " He has to get back to his brood , " said Charlie . " He 's an incurable mother hen . " She did n't know why he had to keep rubbing it in so aboutp202Sam and his children and calling himself a confirmed bachelor , and of course it was just that sort of man , if she could only make him see , that everyone said was the best " I 've really got to work , " Sam said . They were across the room already , Sam first , Charlie following . " It was sweet of you both to come , " Angela said . " I 'm awfullygrateful . I just could n't have spent the whole night here alone after that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so miserable and frightened . I 'm better now . " They both looked at her and for a minute they did n't speak . Then Charlie said , " Well , I do n't blame you , Angela . I 'm glad if we could help . I probably wo n't see you again , so I 'll say good-by . " Sam went right out the hall door and toward the stairs while Charlie was speaking . " It 's been wonderful knowing you , Charlie , " she said . " I wish you could stay longer . " She followed him to the door , and she could see Sam 's head and shoulders vanishing downward . Charlie was on the way after him , and she was afraid he was n't going to turn and speak to her again , but he did turn . He stopped and looked at her and seemed about to say something . She smiled and took a step out into the hall to be close to him , but all he said was , " Well , so long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it easy , and good luck . " If they 'd been on a date together , he would have kissed her good night at least . All the other apartments had their doors shut , and even if someone opened a door and looked out , why , she 'd just be saying good night to her date . It had been a date in a way ; it was a date . Charlie 's plump little face was looking at her and smiling as though he liked her , as though he understood , as though he were kind . She put her arms out and put her hands behind his neck and pulled his head toward her , and she had to stoop a little . Her eyes went tight shut , and she felt two sudden bumps of contact , her hips against his and then a feeling of bristled warmth and moisture on a corner of her mouth . " Thanks for everything , Charlie , " she said , and turned around and ran through her door with her head down and shut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears werep203coming on top of everything else , and she was hot and sick , she did n't know why . There was n't a sound as she leaned backward against the door just as she had when  --  but after a minute a voice came through just the way  --  only this time it said , " I 'll be damned . " Then steps were finally going off again across the hall and down the stairs . It could n't be shame she was crying for ; she had n't done anything to be ashamed of , had she ? It always ended the same way ; how could she help crying ? The same way . She could n't understand why ; she had so much to offer . As Thad walked from his boardinghouse toward Aiken 's Hardware and Sporting Goods , the problem of answering Sister Hatty 's letter troubled the bottom of his mind like a sneeze that would n't come . Last week , he chided himself , he had n't even sent Hatty his usual Thursday envelope , enclosinga line or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was tired of writing her that he hoped the Indians had n't raided the settlement lately , but jokes came hard these days ; he could n't seem to think of a new one that might help take her mind off the rheumaticsand the trouble she had getting anyone to do for her in times when a man expected a dollar an hour for mowing the grass or carting the ashes out . He had n't seen Hatty for so long that he did n't know what she was like any more , except from her letters , and the letters complained increasinglyof the pain she felt from rheumatism and of the failure of the couple who lived with her to pay their rent or keep the house up and of the price of the simplest articles of food . It cost so much just to heat the old house in winter . It must have been two years ago that Hatty closed off the top floor , and now she was afraid she might have to close the wing where the couple lived and take them right into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , and she had her doubtsp204about that , because they were notional . They acted sometimes as though they owned the place and paid precious little attention to any wishes of hers . If she had some member of the family , Hatty pointed out , who would come and live with her , they could reopen the top floor and take in more tenants . With the machine-tool factory bringing business to the town , young people were coming in , and they had a hard time finding places to live . Rents were going up , and of course if one of the family moved in , Hatty would have somebody to do for her . It did n't take much gumption to guess what memberof the family she had in mind . Ratty and he were the only ones left . Thad felt himself nominated by acclamation on the first ballot . Flow old was Hatty ? Four , no , three years older than he was himself . They 'd both have a long time to live unless the Lord was making other plans for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself how badly off she was , but how could he leave the store with no one but Sam and his complexion to take care of the customers ? The trouble with Sam , he was above a small matter such as selling an egg beater or a dozen clothespins , and then seeing to it that a flour sifter left the store with the egg beater and a hank or two of line with the pins . But with dealers threatening to withdraw credit and the month 's rent on the store overdue , Thad could n't afford to let even a minnow get off the hook . Rounding a block of store- and office-fronts , Thad came to the open space where the small park with its dolefully heroic statuary made a center surrounded by the whirl of Monday morning traffic . The grass was coming up vigorously , bright green and rank , not yet cut . The municipal tulips in their oblong and circular formations were just getting ready to open . It was an in-and-out day , Thad saw , looking up ; first sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver more than a drizzle if that . A good day for fishing , supposing a man could get back on a stream and the water was n't too high . Early in the season ; the brooks would n't be fished out , and with this overcast weather anyone who knew how to drop a fly in the right place ought to be able to get his limit.  |p205As  he turned the last corner , he was glad he did n't have to walk past the new hardware store only a few fronts beyond his own . A man who might have been the owner came out at that moment , took a puff or two on a cigarette , thipped it into the gutter , and stood on the sidewalk briefly , sniffing the weather . As he stood there with his back toward his business , another man , walking up the block toward Thad , saw something in the window that caught his attention , stopped to examine it , pulled thoughtfully at his hatbrim , and turned in through the door . Then Thad noticed , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of his employee , Sam . Lateness was n't one of Sam 's main vices ; the boy was reasonablypunctual , it was only fair to say that for him . Still , turningup before Thad himself ! Giving the boy credit for a mind , he must have something on it . " Good morning , Sam , " Thad said , taking his key from his pocket . " Up bright and early for blue Monday , I see . " " Good morning , Mr. Aiken , " Sam said , swallowing and hanging close , like a dog expecting a meal , as Thad opened the door and went in . " Something on your mind , Sam ? " " Well , I wanted to talk to you , Mr. Aiken . " " All right . just let me put some papers I 've got to attend to on the desk , and then you can tell me all about it . " Thad walked up the north aisle , between counters , and Sam paralleled him along the south aisle . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , " Thad said , passing the first of the buttons that dangled down on the end of its cord from the globe under the ceiling , and pulling the second . He reached his desk at the back of the store , turned the switch on the green glass shade above the blotter , and seated himself . He started to take Hatty 's letter from his pocket ; it was burning a hole , like an unspent dollar bill at the fair . But he felt Sam 's face leaning over his shoulder and looked up at it regretfully . " Go ahead , Sam , what is it ? " He 'd have to reconcile himself to a conversation with Sam . The boy probably wanted the day off or thought he deserved a raise . It was just as Hatty said ; everyone in these times wanted a bricklayer 's wages without laying any bricks.  | " Well , " said Sam , swallowing again , " I wanted to tell you , Mr. Aiken , that is , I ought to let you know  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my boy , " Thad said . " I hope you had a cake with  --  let 's see , how many candles ? Nineteen . " " Well , no , Mr. Aiken , not exactly . " " You did n't have any cake ? " " Well , I mean , it would n't have been nineteen  --  I pass for nineteen , all right , Mr. Aiken . Everyone thinks I 'm that if not actually more . But my family did n't want me to go to work , really work , I mean , until I was  --  well , till after Saturday . They said I was growing so fast  --  " " I 'm glad you think I have n't overworked you , Sam , " Thad said . " But I want to get this matter straight . You were eighteenwhen you came to work for me a year ago . Eighteen and one , when I went to school , made nineteen . Perhaps they do n't any more ; there are so many newfangled ideas about education . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it would make too much difference how old I was , in here , I mean , where there is n't  --  well , Mr. Aiken , I 've thought about it , and I should think you 'd sell out to that new store down the street , I mean while you can . " " Sam , " said Thad , " have you ever gone fishing ? " " Fishing , Mr. Aiken ? " " Fishing , Sam . You know , you tie a hook to the end of a line and put some bait on the hook , an earthworm will do , and then you drop the line in the water and wait for a fish to bite . " " Sure , I know that all right , " said Sam , " but what 's it got to do  --  " " I just thought that if I had you back in the country on a trout stream , I could teach you a thing or two , Sam . " " Well , I guess you could , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to tell you , Mr. Aiken , now that I 'm  --  well , since Saturday , the family have to let me work , and I 've got a job in a place that deals in radio and television sets . I 'll be a service and repair man , or I will be after a while . " Sam 's worm-bitten face gazed down with an unaccustomed light . He shook back the claw of oily hair that hooked for/ward almost to his pale eyes , and stood waiting expectantly , as though he had made everything clear . " When does this job begin ? " Thad asked him . " Well , " said Sam , " I ought to be there right now . I thought I 'd come in and get the pay you did n't give me last week , Mr. Aiken , and I 'm sorry to quit cold this way , but I 've got this other job and it pays pretty good and there 's a future in radio and television . " " Sam , " said Thad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of a bright young man and his prospects but we all have our obligationsin this world . Now I 've got to see that the new stock we took in last week is moved up to the counters , and I ca n't do that and wait on customers at the same time . And I believe it 's customary to give an employer some notice  --  " " I 'm sorry about that , Mr. Aiken , but I 've got this other job  --  " " Now I tell you what , Sam . You put in the day moving that stock the way I told you to , and at five o'clock I 'll see that you get your wages . " " I hoped you give me the money now , Mr. Aiken . I told them over there at my new job  --  " " I 'll add in wages for today , of course , " Thad said . " I do n't see how I can do that , Mr. Aiken . " " Just how old are you , Sam ? " Thad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes , " Sam said . " Well , I 'm sixteen , I guess . " " Really , Sam . You 're getting to be quite a man . Let 's see now , that means you must have left school and started working  --  well , you came into my employ , shall we say , at fifteen ? " " I was n't getting anything out of school , " Sam said doggedly . " English and civics and that stuff . I 've been studying nights , taking an extension course down at the Polytech , radio and electronics . It 's for addults . " " I commend you , Sam , I really do . You 've got more ambitionthan I thought . But there 's no getting away from it , you 've lied about your age . Now I should n't be surprised if you 're in trouble in all sorts of quarters in these days of social legislation , trouble that might be serious for you . And it might have been serious for me as your employer . What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were only fifteen ? " " I do n't see what difference it would make , " Sam said . " Anyway , I was born in Chicago , and the family never could get a birth certificate for me . The record was lost in a fire or something . " " All the same , Sam , you 've put yourself in a false position , and there were people who could make it hot for you if they found out . But I 'll forgive you if you start shifting that stock for me , and at the end of the day I 'll give you what I owe you . And do n't fall downstairs , Sam , whatever you do . " Thad swung his chair around and faced his desk . He reached toward the pigeonholes at the back and began raking with his fingers among the wedged stacks of bills and letters . " Well , okay , Mr. Aiken , " he heard Sam saying behind him , " if you wo n't give me the money  --  Can I use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the radio and televisionplace . " " All right , Sam . " " Honestly , Mr. Aiken , I should think you 'd sell out . I mean , with that new store just starting , you 'd have a good chance  --  " " Sam , you let me run the business , will you ? " " Sure , Mr. Aiken , I was only making a suggestion . " Sam hesitated , then bent forward and reached across the desk for the telephone . Thad leaned back in his swivel chair to avoid the proximity of the boy 's face . It was clean , and his neck and shirt were clean ; it was only fair to say that for Sam . Still , he did n't crave actual intimacy with Sam 's countenance . He got up and went toward the front of the store while Sam was making his call . An open box of wire brads lay on a counter . He put the lid on and restored the box to its rightful place on the shelves . He wondered whether pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tempt a customer in . The weather seemed to be closing down outside ; perhaps more light would help . That new store down the street . While he had the chance . If only the idea had n't been Sam 's , he would n't resent it so much . Sam had finished with the telephone . He was crossing thep209store toward the cellar stairs to begin moving the stock . It would serve him right if he tripped and broke his neck or dropped a keg of nails on his toe . No , anything but that ; troublesenough without Sam hurting himself on the premises . Thad told himself it was just as well he had n't written Hatty his regular Thursday communication . If he had said , as he always did , that she would find enclosed a small contribution toward the household expenses , he would n't have been able to pay Sam his final wages without going back to the boardinghouse , getting his bank book , and withdrawing more money from his savings . He went back to his desk , relieved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeonhole , and took a sheet of his own letter paper from a drawer . He placed it slantwise on the desk blotter , and now that it was settled what he had to say , found that he could write quickly . " I 'm sorry , Hatty , that I could n't send my usual small contribution last week . I hope you were n't counting on it too much and have n't been inconveniencedby the omission . Business has been slack and competitionseems to grow keener all the time . I 've thought of giving up the burdens of Aiken 's Hardware and Sporting Goods  --  " He stopped at that ; the words were coming harder now . The thought that he did n't want to face was forcing itself on him , like Sam 's complexion , at close range . Well , there would n't be any Sam after five o'clock ; he did n't know what there would be . " But of course , " he made his pen say for him , " I could n't close out overnight a business that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . I realize that things have been hard for you , Hatty , and when I can take a few days from business , I mean to pay you a visit . " The pen ran into another obstruction at that point ; it stopped leading his thoughts along for him , and stuck in his fist , stiff and motionless . What he could see ahead was not the way he wanted to end his life . Doing for Hatty in the old ark of a house , big enough for Noah and all his menagerie . Finding tenants , collectingrent , mowing the lawn , carting the ashes out until he was no longer able to take care of them himself . He could n't teach Hatty to fish , not at her age and with the rheumatics that she complained about . But there would be the house ,  |p210Hatty  's house , a roof over their heads , and they were brother and sister . He felt as though he were getting rheumatism himself ; his joints ached , and a spot of pain , sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead just between his eyes . His neck was so tired carrying the weight of petty shifts and anxietiesthat he could scarcely lift it . There was nothing to do but sign his letter , " Affectionately your brother , " and then , as he read it through to be sure he had crossed all his is and dotted all his i 's , it seemed to him intolerably cheerless . Not a word in it to make Hatty perk up for a minute and forget her troubles . " P.S. , " he added . " Tell the town fathers to keep the militia on the alert . The Indians may come whoopingout of the woods any minute in war paint and feathers and scalp the settlement . " Connie looked at Angela sitting across the lunch table and wondered what the girl would eventually do with herself . Angela had so many good qualities , quite exceptional qualities ; it was nothing less than tragic that they should be crossed and defeated by her special vulnerability . Think of all the women who married , many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really want to but were just pushed along in the common current . Why could n't Angela manage it when she wanted to so desperately ? She was far from unfit , far from seeming the least likely . For one thing , she knew how to dress to advantage  --  the dress she was wearing today , for instance , a well-chosen shade of subdued green to go with her grayish eyes and light brown hair . It was too bad she could n't help sucking her cheeks into eggcup hollowswhenever she was upset ; too bad she was so unmanageablyput together . Yet actually she moved and sat well enough when her composure was n't disturbed . The trouble was , her self-training showed through and robbed her of the creditp211due to her for discipline . Attractiveness was a total thing ; it was often hard to say what spoiled it . " I 've just loved having lunch this way , " said Angela . " It 's been like old times . It 's lovely the way you 've arranged the forsythia and the tulips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point the quiet and order of her house that she was only just recovering . It seemed impossible that two whole days had gone by since that hideous night with Badger and Muriel and the ensuing morning and afternoon that were if anything even worse . She still expected Dr. Holsberg to pop out in his purple robe from behind every door , his bottle of pills in hand . What would they have done without him ? " The forsythia has begun to droop , " Connie said . " It 's the warmth of the room , but I could n't bear not to have some in the house . " " I used to see so much of you and Andy , " Angela said , " before these last two years . " Connie looked at the empty sherry glass by Angela 's plate . A chip interrupted the smooth highlight along the rim . Under the pressure of presidential entertaining , it seemed as though china and glass were chipping right and left . " Andy thinks he 'll be just a private citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think , " Connie said . Angela 's hunger for intimacy made it impossible to avoid any topic with her . Perhaps , as a matter of fact , a word or two about the presidency would make a useful steering point for the conversation . " Well , I do hope the trustees are n't out of their senses , " Angela said . " If they really knew what Andy has done  --  " " Andy does n't like the subject discussed , as you know , " said Connie . " He 's afraid of putting himself forward as a candidate . He does n't want to look political . But however that comes out , I 've been thinking about you , Angela , and I 've decided that you ought to get another job . " She might as well come to the point and put it bluntly for a start . " Andy would never say that to you , " she told Angela , smiling , " so I 'm taking it on myself to say it , as one woman to another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herp212cheeks . " What 's the matter , Connie ? Are n't I  --  does n't Andy like me any more , like my work , I mean ? " " Of course he does , Angela . I do n't know how many times he has told me that you 're the ablest secretary he 's ever encountered . But that 's exactly it , do n't you see ? You 're of tremendousvalue to Andy and the college but in a way you 're wasting a lot of ability . I feel sure you could get a position somewhere that would pay you far more than the college ever could . And you know , Angela , you 've got to decide about your life , which way you want it to go . If you 've got to depend on your job and career  --  " Enough for the moment ; stop and see how Angela was taking it . " Well , of course , I 've thought of that myself , and I 'd almost reached the same conclusion , " Angela said . Her other look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgmentwere uppermost now , not her emotions . Then a struggle began between the two forces . " I 'd never find anyone else to work for as nice as you and Andy , " she said . " I just could n't bear  --  Of course there are jobs in a lot of industries now , and if Andy would give me the kind of recommendation I used to think he would  --  " " Andy certainly would . You have so many invaluable qualities , Angela . He would n't know what to do without you for a while . He 'd just have to learn . " " A working girl does have to think about money , " Angela said , " and about  --  well , how she means to live her life . I 'd like to have enough to get an apartment in a nicer building . I 'd like to share an apartment with a girl friend , if I could find one to go in with me . " " Exactly , " said Connie . " It would make entertaining much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . And there 's another thing , Angela . I 'm not sure that the kind of men you meet around a college  --  I 'm going to come right out with it and say perhaps they are n't the right type for you . That does n't mean you are n't intelligent . I 've heard Andy say he wished some of his faculty had half your brains . It just means there are different kinds of intelligence and people need each other in different ways . Of course since the warp213most of our new young teachers have been married anyway . If you got some other position , perhaps in some industry , as you suggested , you 'd be meeting other kinds of men . Though I do n't think you ought to make the decision on those grounds . I think you should just look for a job and a career that would pay you handsomely and use your ability to the limit . " Connie hoped she had n't wounded the girl or cheated her with delusive encouragement . Perhaps , in another context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for her , the man she could manage and strengthen , and from whom in turn she could receive a measure of affection and stability . If not , she could at least put her energy and force of mind into a career that would make her financially secure and reward her innate ambitiousness . " I 've never thought of it that way , Connie , " Angela said . " But it makes a lot of sense . You 've helped me a lot . You always do . " " Andy and I would always be glad to help in any way we could . " " Do you really think there 's any chance that Andy wo n't be elected ? " Angela asked . " I 've just felt so sure the trustees would recognize  --  " " I 'm following Andy 's wishes , " Connie said , glancing at her wrist watch . " I 'm trying not to think about it . I want what 's best for his sake , that 's all . " Angela looked at her own watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Andy will be wondering where I am . " " I 'll drive you part way over , " Connie said . " I 'm going to look in on Mrs. Richardson before I meet Sally 's train . " " That would be awfully nice , " said Angela . " It was awfully nice of you to ask me , Connie . I 've had such a good time . " She exclaimed again how nice it had been , with the sherry and all , when Connie stopped the station wagon at the cornerthat led to Faculty Row . She got out and started off , brisk , disciplined , and straight , heading for the President 's office . Poor Angela ! Andy really made too much fuss about her , but Connie knew how he felt . Visualizing her route to the Richardson house as she put thep214car in gear , Connie wondered how long a woman could be indefinitely sick before the doctor did something about it , or if not the doctor then her husband . That physicist or whatever he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife alone to suffer quietly day after day . If it were Andy who had been sick so many weeks , she would certainly want to do more about it herself than just accept the college doctor'sword that it was a stubborn virus infection . Andy was right when he said that the college needed an up-to-date medical department . Of course it was hard for a man who relied mostly on the routine of college practice for his income and position to keep himself alert and abreast of his profession . She told Andy the college ought to have a staff of part-time doctors who were mainly practicing outside and had assured positions at the hospital downtown that everyoneagreed was excellent . Not that the college doctor could n't take a patient there , but it seemed that he seldom did . He prescribed rest and gave penicillin shots in an emergency and he 'd discovered the term psychosomatic , which he invokedas an excuse for his own incertitudes . Connie stopped in front of the Richardson house , went up the unkempt walk through which grass was poking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell . While she waited she looked about at the discouraged forsythia bushes , badly in need of cutting back , jackstraw heaps of dead stalks with only a scattering of yellow star points . Around the bottom of the old lilac clump the suckers had spread into a waste thicket . Mrs. Richardson was a long time answering the doorbell . Could she be out ? Possibly she had taken a turn for the better and gone for a visit or an errand . Connie rang again . Two clawlike fingers parted the door curtains , making a gap in the shape of a lozenge , and a face , alarmingly pale and pinched under dull half-done-up hair , looked through . Then the door opened . Mrs. Richardson , with a gaunt wrist , was holding a wrapper together under her throat , and her feet were in slippers . " Why , Mrs. Aiken , " she said , doing her best to smile . " It 's kind of you to look in this way . I 'm sorry I 'm in such a state.  |p215I  've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , and I was upstairs resting . " " I 'm so sorry I brought you all the way down , " said Connie . " I 'm on my way to the station to meet Sally 's train , and I did want to stop and see how you are . " " I hardly dare to ask you in , I 'm so untidy , things are in such a mess . " " Perhaps I could come in for just a minute , " said Connie . " I could help you back to bed and see whether there is anything I could do to make you comfortable . " Mrs. Richardson backed away from the door and Connie followed her across the threshold . She could see the woman begin to tremble as if with a severe chill as they crossed the hall . Connie took her arm and felt the thin frame relax and grow dependent , like a child committing itself to someone else 's charge . " I 'm so ashamed of myself , " Mrs. Richardson said . " I seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interminable climb up the stairs . When they got to the bedroom and Mrs. Richardson lay down , she was unable to speak or ceased trying to speak . She shut her eyes and merely breathed . Finally she roused herself , and said hoarsely , " I 've been nauseated all day . I do n't know how many times I 've got up and gone  --  " " I 'm going to get the doctor right away and have him take you to the hospital , " Connie said . " You ca n't go on any longer without finding out what the trouble is , that 's obvious . " Mrs. Richardson tried to prop herself up and protest . " I do n't want to upset my husband , " she said . " It interferes when he worries about me  --  his work is important  --  " " It will interfere much more , " Connie said , " if we do n't find out what 's wrong with you and make you well . " " I suppose so , " Mrs. Richardson said faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the hour for the doctor to be in his office handing out aspirin or whatever he did with his college cases . This time Connie would have to see that he took action . She 'd have to rout the woman 's husband from his lab , too , and impress him sufficiently so that he would hold the doctor to his part.  |p216She  found the telephone in the lower hall and looked at her watch while she dialed . Precious minutes went by while she was trying to blend tact with firmness . Well , if she was very late for Sally 's train , Sally would simply have to put up with neglect for once . Connie climbed back to Mrs. Richardson in the bedroom . The best thing , of course , would be to confront the doctor with a decision ready made . " Now I 'm going to pack you a bag , " she said , " so that you 'll be all ready to go to the hospitalwhen the doctor and your husband come . You just lie there and tell me where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on . " The information came in croaks and whispers . It was astonishing , when Connie began opening drawers and moving hangers in the cupboard , how few things of her own , nice things such as a woman of her age and position might expect , Mrs. Richardson seemed to possess . But Connie finally assemblednightgowns , a faded silk bedjacket , and a set of comb , brush , and mirror in cracked tortoiseshell . She took the bag down to the door with her when the doctor 's ring sounded . " I found your patient so miserable , " she said , " that I felt sure you 'd want to take her straight to the hospital where you can give her X rays and blood tests and all the other things you do . The poor woman has been nauseated all day , and she 's just about reached the point of exhaustion . " The doctor looked doubtful , a little incensed . Connie followed him upstairs to the bedroom , where he squinted at Mrs. Richardson with surprise and began taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Connie , bending over the figure on the bed . " I 've told your husband not to be anxious , but he 's coming right home to take you in charge . He 'll drive you to the hospital himself , and I 'll visit you there as soon as I can . " She caught a hoarse murmur of thanks . " You 'll excuse me , wo n't you , Doctor ? I really must get to the station and collect my daughter . " Connie felt unsatisfied , abandoning the woman at this point . But for Sally , she would have stayed and seen that they got the patient safely off . But if Mrs. Richardson did n't summonp217up a spurt of strength and persuade them that they could postpone action still another time  --  So far , she was cooperatingwell , just lying on the bed and painfully existing . As she left the college region and wound toward the station downtown , the traffic slogged along in spasms like a river half mud heaving itself through a succession of lock gates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a change of clothes . It might have been easier for Sally if she had n't been an only child , brought up all her life in an academic household and with such a good head on her shoulders . At least Sally had always done well without effort through school and college , though it never seemed that she would distinguish herself professionally at music or fashion designing or any of the hobbies she worked at from time to time so excitedly . Perhaps her growing-up had been too direct and successful , at least until that fraud of an intellectual  --  After that the child seemed confused and unsure of herself . Beforelong it would be time for her to know her own mind . The only vacant slot Connie could see for parking near the station was a gap at the rear end of the space reserved for taxis . It would take only a minute to extract Sally . She slid the station wagon gratefully in behind the line of cabs , got quickly out , and pushed through the heavy station door . Sally was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking aggrieved . " This is a fine way to treat the returning prodigal , " she said . " Whatever happened ? I was afraid you 'd been in a smash-up . The train came in hours ago . " Connie smiled at her . A little thin , Sally seemed , a little tense , looking as though she were glad to be home again . " I just stopped on the way to see how Mrs. Richardson was doing , and I found her in a state of collapse . It took time to deal with her . " " Well , I 'll forgive you , " said Sally , " but honestly , Mother , I was worried . I could n't imagine what happened . " " I did the best 1 could . Have you a redcap ? " " I had to let him go . I could n't keep him waiting . Here , I 'll find one . "  | " I 'll take your hatbag , and you can take your little handbag , " Connie said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many quarters on him . " When they came out , Connie saw that a taxi had crowded in behind the station wagon , almost in contact with the rear fender , and another was jammed close in front . She looked at the squirrel-faced driver of the cab behind and said , " How am I ever going to get out ? " " This place here is reserved for taxis , lady , " the driver said plaintively . " Oh , " said Connie . " I 'm sorry . I was so late meeting a train I did n't know what else to do . " A pair of furrowed eyes looked at her and looked a little longer at Sally . " It 's okay this time , " the face said , and while the redcap stowed Sally 's bag in the back seat and Connie paid him , the taxi twisted out in reverse and gave her room to swing away from the curb . Connie decided on the longer way home , turning right toward the river drive and then left along it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal park , rather than the more direct route through traffic . " Well , tell me about it , " she said , when the pushing bull herd of vehicles began to straggleout . " How are Ruth and her baby ? " " Oh , Ruth is the most contented cow you ever saw , " said Sally . " The baby is cute . I got quite expert at oiling and butteringand powdering it , though Ruth would hardly let me touch it at first . I guess she was afraid I 'd drop it and break it . " " Let me see , did she have a boy or a girl ? I ca n't remem-ber . " " Boy , " said Sally . " Ruth really manages him very well . He sleeps most of the time , but he can howl like a demon when he wants to . " " Did you have a good time ? " " At first I did . It got awfully tiresome toward the end , though . They do n't do anything , Ruth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby or go to a movie now and then if Ruth can get Bill 's mother to come in and sit for them . Bill watches the television all the time . They have it right in thep219middle of the living-room wall in that tiny duplex they live in . I had to spend a whole evening watching prize fights with Bill when Ruth got a headache . Honestly , Mother , I do n't see the sense of having a mind or going to college if you never use it . No music  --  " Sally halted suddenly . From the corner of her eye , Connie could see that she was frowning . " It does sound rather dull , " Connie said . " But they 're only starting out , after all . " " But if they start out that way  --  " Sally said . " I thought starting out was the time to do things . Of course they did n't wait to have the baby . " Sally was evidently turning things over in her mind . " Did anyone call up while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , just after you left . I told him when you expected to be back . " Connie paused . " Not a word from Jack Richmond . " She might as well out with it . " Jack wrote me a long letter , " said Sally . She spoke as though disclosures were coming , but then she dropped back into reticence . The antennae of communication advancedand retreated , reached out and quickly curled away again as if afraid to expose themselves to a contrary breath . " It was a nice letter , " Sally said , beginning again , deciding to go through with it , perhaps . " He 's in some kind of volunteerreserve unit , and he 's afraid he may be called up for activeduty , though it would probably be just training recruits , he thinks . " Connie had to wait again . They were just reaching the river drive . The river looked muddy and greenish under overcast sky ; a rowboat was hacking valiantly across it against wind and chop . A plane , homing toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling . " He thinks we 're wasting time , " said Sally . This was the opening ; now was the moment for a word , if Connie wanted to hazard a word . " It is possible to waste time , " she said . Glancing cornerwise , she could see a spot of color come into Sally 's face , could see her mouth tighten to avoid smiling . Then her profile sharpened , staring straight ahead , and she made a restless motion on the seat beside Connie.  | " I know I 'm just  --  I 'm only treading water and not swimminganywhere . But I 'm not sure I 'm ready to commit my  --  myself yet . To a lot of things . " It was enough if Sally recognized that much and could say it . Chronic indecision was n't natural to her ; it would n't last . " Now tell me what 's been going on at home , " Sally said . Connie felt suddenly oppressed , as though a dog-day mass of heat had settled abruptly on the raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Muriel had been going on . She could think of nothing she wanted less than to relive those Thursday and Friday scenes , but of course Sally had to know what happened . She had to know why Andy was so eager to spend the week end at Amsdentown for a change and a breath of country . " How awful , " Sally said . " To have Harry the one ! He really amounted to something , did n't he ? " And again : " That abysmal woman ! How does a woman get that way , Mother ? " It was the same question Andy had asked in the same words in the midst of the Friday morning frenzy , coming into the kitchen and grabbing at her , his face screwed up as if he meant to break the china . Muriel did arouse a kind of insane incredulity ; you could n't believe her even while she was in full swing , though of course the explanation was completely obvious . " Muriel is an utterly spoiled , utterly empty woman , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . She has no interests , no work to do , no responsibilities that she 's willing to admit or knows how to meet . She tries to get other people to fill the emptiness for her , but that means she 's never really thinking of anything but herself . " " I suppose that 's it , " Sally said . " We were afraid for a while that we 'd never get her out of the house , " Connie went on . It came to her that Muriel had not made a single allusion , oddly enough  --  and yet of course it was n't odd after a moment 's thought  --  to her performance on Thursday evening , no word of apology , no sign of remembranceeven . Just incessant demands as soon as the sleeping pills wore off and she began to come to . Get me some breakfast , Badger ; see whether someone wo n't get me something top221eat . No , do n't , I could n't touch a bite . Well , perhaps a softboiledegg just to keep my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , Badger , and a cup of tea with a piece of toast and marmalade . And then when Badger took the tray up after Connie cooked the egg herself because Norah had other work , the edged voice that made itself heard all through the house rejected it , of course . Muriel could n't touch a thing . How could Badger imagine after what they had done to Harry ? The pain in my head is awful , Badger , take me away . But then she could n't think of getting up , she would n't even be able to roll over without splitting her head in two . Poor Badger ! Connie would n't have blamed him if he 'd walked out then and there and left her for good . His faithfulness was pathetic . Carrying trays up and down , clumsilytrying to put an ice pack on Muriel 's head himself . Of course he too was trying not to think of Harry , but at least he was n't thinking solely of himself . And young Badger . He kept appearing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could he do , how was Dad , guessing he 'd go back to the house , they could get him by phone , very much the man with his handsome sullen face . Muriel finally pulling him down over the bed with a fierce hug , calling him my baby , all I have left . Dr. Holsberg to manage , Andy to manage . To get them out from underfoot , she packed Andy off with the doctorto an early plane and then insisted on his going to the office for a few hours despite his unwillingness to desert Badger . " It was such a relief when we finally got them on a plane in the afternoon . It 's dreadful to think of it as a relief , but it was . " " My God , I should say so , Mother . " Sally was silent a moment . Then she asked , " How is Muriel going to live the rest of her life ? What 's the future of a person like that ? " " Exactly , " said Connie . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she and Andy  --  but of course they had n't ; she 'd been foolish and overstrained herself that time when they were young and just beginning , though any woman could expect a miscarriage or two somewhere along the way , and it might have been a baby that did n't start right and was far better lost , or it might have been an older sisterp222for Sally . Living in the year i951 , she could almost be glad she did n't have a son of her own . He might be of army age right now , and if he were , she would n't want him to avoid or miss out on what all the other young men of his generation had to go through . But suppose he should be sent to Korea , suppose what happened to Muriel 's Harry  --  would she herself behave like Muriel ? She knew she would n't ; but how should a woman behave ? It was necessary to fight and to be ready to fight , she did n't question that , if what everyone said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too horrible to think about . In this age , there should be enough wisdom somewhere to prevent it . How many more generations ? Would Sally 's children too ? Would there never be an end ? " Your father is in such a state be wants to spend the week end at Amsdentown before he goes off on his speaking tour . We hate to desert you so soon , " Connie said , " when you 've just come back  --  unless you 'd like to join us ? " " Well , " said Sally , " I guess Jack wants me to do things with him . He wrote about a concert on Friday night and a dance on Saturday . I 'll survive . My , but home looks good ! I 'm just dying for a bath after that hot train ride . "  | " Read that back to me again , would you please , Angela ? I 've lost the thread . I 'm afraid I 'm just woolgathering this after-noon . " " You 've had a lot to tire you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wonder , " said Angela . Andrew allowed himself to luxuriate in her sympathy for a moment . Bask was the word . Sympathy from the woman , any woman ; what the male always craved and never got in quite the degree he wanted , not with that fine exactitude of response that would leave him flattered and warmed to the very small of his back and at the same time would stop delicatelyshort of excess . Sympathy from Angela who irked and embarrassed him at times to the point of aching ; bought and paid for to make it worse ; sympathy on hire . No , not altogether . The girl would give it to him freely , even eagerly , and of course when she got to doing that , he hated it . Fortunatelyshe had her other side ; already her face had turned businesslike , bending over the shorthand symbols , hooks and eyes in winter-twig penciling that intersected the ruled purplelines of her stenographic pad . " And though I appreciate the fact that the time is short , ' " she read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so pompous about it ? " Andrewinterrupted . " Make it , Short as the time is , I 'm afraid I 'll have to ask '  --  is that the way it goes on ? " " Ask you to report back to me when I am back in my office on May  --  ' " " Too many back 's , ' " Andrew said . " This office has had a horrible effect on my style . I used to think I could dictate ap224fairly clean-cut memorandum . Let 's see now : ask you to reportas soon as I 'm at my desk again on May whatever-it-is . ' You have the date . " Angela crossed out a number of symbols , put in a star or caret , and recorded the substitution at the foot of the page . She looked up inquiringly , and he said , " Go on , how does it wind up ? " " To summarize , ' " Angela read , " Professor Dorion 's contract will terminate as of the end of this academic year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Angela hesitated , and Andrew said , " Prepared '  --  was n't that it ? " " Prepared in case of necessity to carry Professor Dorion 's assistants for one year at their present rank if they can not find other jobs . But I think that as chairman of the departmentyou should make it unmistakably clear to them that under no circumstances can the University offer more than one of them a position beyond such a possible year of grace . I shall be prepared  --  ' " " There we are with prepared ' again , " said Andrew . " Make it I 'll be ready '  --  no , that 's too informal . Just I will consider ' ought to do . " " I will consider a recommendation for the appointment of one of the three contract assistants to a regular position in the University if the department wishes to make such a rec-ommendation . " " An awful mouthful of language , " Andrew said . " Will it do ? " Angela 's face took on its administrative look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the three men , " she said . " It sounds as though that 's all they had to do to get the appointment . If that 's what you mean  --  " " You think so ? " Andrew said . " Of course you know why I 'm doing this . I thought it might give that young Delano just an outside chance . I do n't know what the department thinks of him , and of course it 's their decision , but he has characterof some sort , and I do n't gather that the other two are very highly regarded , or that they 're eager to stay , for that matter . "  | " Well , " said Angela , considering , " it just depends on what you want to do . If you virtually tell them they can have an appointment , they 'll grab it , wo n't they ? " " You 're right , Angela . Just add this . Let 's see , now : It is understood that any man recommended for a regular positionmust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela  --  ' all the usual standards of appointment to the department and the University . I shall not forward to the Board of Trustees any recommendation that does not satisfy me on this point or is not accompanied by all the usual supporting evidence . ' There , does that do it ? " " I think that makes it much clearer , Andy . I thought that was what you meant . I hope Sam Delano gets in . It would mean a lot , with all his family and his responsibilities . " " Well , all I can do is hold a cranny open . I do n't know whether he should be appointed or not . I ca n't take a positionabout that . " Delano 's direct young face , pale , taut , and earnest , came before his eye . Amusing , to be so taken with a man who popped in to tax the administration with injustice . But of course it was n't the accusation ; that slipped out of the affair somehow , except as an abstractly comic memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . " Is there anything else you wanted right now ? " Angela was asking . Andrew tried to bring his mind back to his desk and its problems . " My heart 's in the highlands , my heart is not here , " he said . " All I can think of is that I want to get away , get to Amsdentownfor a while . " " You should , " said Angela . " I do n't see why you changed your mind and took that chapel speech at Brampton when you had it all arranged with John Abner that he should go instead . " " Well , " said Andrew , " it will actually enable me to get away a day earlier . I did n't dare think of leaving before Friday , but then it occurred to me that we could drive to Pramptontomorrow and drive back to Amsdentown Friday morningafter chapel . I 'll be out of the office at least , and maybe it'sp226more appropriate for me to play the ambassador of Rowley , now that it looks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't thought of that , " said Angela . It might still be mud season in the hills west of Amsdentown . He and Connie might have a struggle getting the stationwagon up the last pitch to the house . They would be all right as far as the garage , even on the dirt road that wound up from the village , but the last couple of hundred yards up to the house itself  --  even in midsummer the gravel was apt to wash out in wet weather on that final stretch looping among the old spruces like a snake wriggling up a bank . Well , he could tote their duffel by hand if he had to . It would be good to flog through the mud , good to feel the gripping-muscles ache in his wrists and fingers , good just to exist physically for a few hours , to be reminded of tendons and pores and the breath of leaf buds on skin . The rock maples would long since have yielded their crop of sugar sap for the year . The shad bush might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be belling their treble chirp in the swamps and pools , Chinese swarms of them , a mob of pouting little bladdersfilling the air with the crisscross tension of their shrill life-chorus . A sound in his ears was contesting his reverie , trying to bring him back to work and application . Angela 's voice , askinghim something . He had n't heard , but then he found that he had . Some part of his mind had recorded what she said and was able to serve it up to him . " Do you want to answer Mr. Bratten 's letter this after-noon ? " Andrew looked at Badger 's letter as it lay there on the desk in front of him . It was written from Badger 's office . Leaning back in his chair , Andrew saw the foreshortened letters of Bratten Chemical and Allied Products at the head of the sheet . But it was not a dictated letter ; it was written in Badger 's own hand , the pen jumping and sputtering points of ink in a spray around the large loosely formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to ask him whether he meant to answer it this afternoon . Sometimes the most correct questions were those a man resented most intensely . Well , perhaps hep227did n't really resent it . His mind had been edging around Badger 's letter even while it seemed to be thinking of other things , presenting him with images of Amsdentown , defendinghis lethargy on the plea that he was nervously exhausted . If he did n't answer Badger at once , he 'd find it hard to make an opportunity until he came back from his speaking tour , that was the trouble . To postpone his reply so long would be intolerably rude , unthinkable callousness to a man in grief . And again , he hoped to return with money for the library in his pocket , or at least in pledge , and simply to confront Badger with that as an accomplished fact would look like a reply of calculated cruelty . " How cart I answer it , Angela ? What can I say ? I cut a lunch date and took it home to talk over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " " Well , I know how you feel about it , " said Angela . " Still , you are n't going back on your plans , are you , Andy ? " " No , certainly not . And of course it would be easy enough to write and say , Dear Badger : Much as I sympathize with you , I ca n't retreat from my position . I must remember that I speak for the college and the trustees , not merely for myself , et cetera . ' My God , I ca n't do it . I ca n't be that much of a stuffed shirt , not knowingly , at least . You did n't see Badger while he was getting the news and afterward . I did , Angela . " " It must have been awful , " Angela said . He wished she could have found some other way to put it . Still , Angela was someone with whom it was possible to talk . She would listen , and she would feed in those little commonplacerejoinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him think out loud , perhaps to some useful end , if it was only to shake down his feelings and settle them in position . He did n't want to encourage Angela 's predilection for the intimate ; he did n't want to grow completely dependent on her . But probably that danger would come to an end in a few weeks anyway ; why not allow the peculiar virtue she had for him to serve its purpose while it could ? And while he talked and thought about Badger , he would n't be blundering through an answer to Badger 's letter.  | " Awful is a mild word , " he said . " Any word I can think of would be mild . The awfulest part of it is Muriel , of course . If it were n't for her , it would be easier to answer his letter . If it were n't for her , he might not have written as he did . " It was an odd letter , look at it any way you like . It resolved itself , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , academic , into three main strands . The first was the breadand-butterthank-you strand , effusive gratitude for all you and Connie did for us at Rowley , and terribly sorry on your account , would n't have had it happen that way in your house for the world . Then there was the strand , concealed in uneasyhints , of apology for Muriel . Badger was afraid she always did show her feelings pretty openly , and this was an awful blow for a woman ; she 'd just have to learn to adjust to it . She 'd really been almost out of her mind since they got home , on the verge of a nervous breakdown or something like that . And then there was the really unanswerable element . No threats now of a body of alumni , Badger at their head , ready to mob him into the presidency if he gave them their Pialph house and to mob him out of it if he stood stubborn . Badger was alone ; the gang , if it had ever existed , had deserted him . Connie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter at noon . He 'd noticed himself , but wanted his feeling confirmed . Nothing left but the invocation to friendship and personal loyalty and auld lang syne . Pathetic , to see Badger powerless and helpless , reduced to naked appeal . Well , Andy boy , I 'm relying on you to see it my way . I know you wo n't let me down , boy . This thing has become more important to me than ever now , Andy . I guess you know how I feel . I see that new Pialph house now , Andy , as a kind of a memorial to Harry . I 've just got to have it , boy , and I 'm counting on you . " I 've never seen a man in such a state , " Andrew said . " I mean such a state as Badger when he came downstairs after Muriel  --  Connie told you about Muriel , did n't she ? " " Yes , " said Angela . " I ca n't imagine how awful  --  " " He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking a blue streak , walking up and down with his nerves so tight strung I expected to hear a snap any minutep229and see him come apart as if he 'd been made of wires and thumbscrews . He kept saying what an awful blow it was for a woman , but she 'd learn to adjust to it , and then he got going on Truman 's war and the goddam socialist administration in Washington and how could the economy stand the amount of foreign spending and so on . Then he suddenly thought of young Badger and realized that the boy would have to be told . He was for telephoning and telling him to come over right away . Then he thought that would frighten the lad , and I offered to drive him to the Pialph house . As soon as we were there , Badger got cold feet . The excitement went out of him , the manic phase , you know . His face looked as though all the blood had suddenly been sucked out of it by a syringe behind the ear . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make it . Each time he propped himself back on the seat and began to wonder whether we should n't wait till morning . I did n't know what was the right thing to do , but I finally thought the boy had to be told and it would n't help to put it off . So I got out myself and went up the steps and roused one of the brethren from a poker game . They finally got young Badger down from upstairs in his pajamas , and I told him his father had news for him . He got some clothes on and we drove halfway down the block and Badger told him . " " You did that , Andy ? I think that was wonderful , " Angela said . " Wonderful ? It was painful . I admit it took all the resolutionI had , but it was the least I could do . But when we got there , Angela , and the boy had to be told , Badger could n't get out of the car and walk up the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face  --  the poker games and the all-night bar and so on . For once Pialph let him down , I 'm sure of it . Now he sees the new house as a memorial to Harry . " Angela made no comment . This time she lacked a feeder line to keep him going . " Perhaps I could write him just a line or two . I feel for you and wish there were more any of us can do , but all I can say at the moment is that the librar  --  ' No . That what you want is never out of my mind and I 'm thinking what can be done . ' "  |p230As  he tried out the words , they seemed miraculously good ; at least he 'd never be able to do better . Relief and exhilarationlifted his lungs for the first time , it seemed , all day , all week indeed . " Well , " said Angela , " it sounds as though you might be giving in or holding out a hope , and if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , hating her briefly , hating Badger and himself and the whole mess of a world . " I guess l just ca n't dictate an answer to this one . I 'll have to take it away with me and write an answer by hand from somewhere , perhapsfrom Amsdentown . " He had a vision of Badger sitting alone in his office , paying no heed to his deals and his promotion plans , his profits and his taxes in a world of war and armed truce ; brooding instead , seeing in the emptiness of a fifteenth-story windowpane or in the vacancy of unfocused air a house of loyalty and brotherhood rising as a memorial to his son . Andrew wondered how close to the truth his vision might in fact be . Angela was getting up . " Is there anything more you want , Andy ? " " No , I guess not . You 'll get that memorandum over to the Psychology Department . Do you think of anything yourself that I ought to tidy up before  --  " A soft hand-tap sounded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andrew could see her vaguely bendingforward , her face at the crack . " Come in , Myrtle , " he said . " What is it ? " " I did n't want to interrupt , but Professor Holsberg is here , and he says he has something you ought to know right away . " Andrew laughed at the expected disapproval that Angela did not fail to show . Something new , something different , to take his mind from the treadmill of Badger and the library . And it was always amusing to talk with Maurice ; what was important to Maurice could be relied on to have its comic aspect . He liked Maurice , anyway . " Do n't look shocked , Angela . An interruption is just what I need . "  | " You 'd better wait till you find out what it is , " Angela said . " True enough , " said Andrew , laughing . " Well , I 'll find out . " He got up as the two girls retreated into their cells . The way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was lucky , though , that his door swung inward . Maurice was crowding it closely , waiting outside ; he took a startled step back as Andrew opened it and held out his hand . " Come in , Maurice . I have n't seen you since we passed each other on campus last week , " Maurice was holding , not a student theme this time , but what looked like the early afternoon street edition of the local city daily . His heavy long-fingered hand grasped and bunched it by the middle . If Maurice had made the papers , it might well mean trouble . Maurice had the look that always accompanied his crises . It was part ingenuous , just wide-eyed innocence of surprise at the way the world treated him , part anxiety , the look of the suppliant in need of some dispensation outside himself . But he was n't in a funk , he was n't desperate , Andrew felt . Maurice was waiting to see the effect of his latest plight ; he could be tipped one way or another by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling as though his head had been removed and shaken out over a trash heap and then put on again thoroughly empty . He felt incapable of any responseat all except an irrelevant and dangerous jocularity . " You know , " Andrew said , trying to be sober , trying to ready himself for what might well be a grave test , " I 've been subconsciously expecting some kind of backlash from Dorion since I had to deal with him about his research contract with Business Services . I even had a couple of hints . I might havep232foreseen  --  but I never imagined he 'd try to get back at me by making a public victim of you . " Public victim . Scapegoat . Sacrifice . He regretted his phrase , but Maurice showed no offense , no consciousness of it , even ; he was merely looking mystified . " I do n't want to rob you of any glory , Maurice , but Dorionis really using you , if you do n't mind my saying so , as a way of taking a double-barreled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important to the national security , and sympatheticto Communists who try to undermine it . There 's a specimen of paranoid cunning for you ! Of course his research contract was strictly a profit and prestige enterprise with a private company . He wanted the army to patronize it , but they would n't . And I could tell you things about his methods of operating , but it would be improper , at least at this time . " Andrew looked again at the photograph in the newspaper Maurice had handed to him . It caught Dorion in his disarming attitude , the helpless child with the bottomless and beseechingeyes , ingratiatingly small and frank-looking as he sat in a round-backed chair in the committee room of the state loyaltyboard . No suggestion of the cornered animal , no smoke of ectoplasm leaking from his skull like spores from a tree fungusto say , " I have enemies , I am watched . " A believable face , a face incapable of deceit , as the news photographer caught it , ringed by legislators looking on while Dorion denouncedRowley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most notorious Communist on the campus . " How on earth did he ever choose you as a target , Maurice ? Do you know him well ? What have you ever done to arouse his suspicion ? " " I do n't know , " said Maurice . " I 've hardly spoken with him except once , and that was when I heard he was doing researchon communication through language and I went to his lab to ask him about it , because communication through languageis the only way of implementing philosophy and I thought he might have found out something that would help me with my teaching . He would n't let me in. "
