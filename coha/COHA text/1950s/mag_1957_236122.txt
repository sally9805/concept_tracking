In Calcutta 's filthy , fly-infested streets it is often hard to tell the living from the dead . Thousands of the area 's 4,500,000 people , hungry and unemployed , huddle day and night in dank back alleys or sprawl on the sidewalks splotched red with betel spittle . The dead sometimes lie where they are for days before police vans cart them off to the burning ghats . The dying , picked up and carried from hospital to crowded hospital , used to be dumped back on the streets ; there was simply no room for a hopeless case . <P> Last week a slim , grey-eyed woman in a blue-bordered sari was briskly going about the business of making Calcutta a better place to die in-and to ward off death when possible . Mother Teresa and 62 sisters of the six-year-old Roman Catholic Order of the Missionaries of Charity are running one of Asia 's most remarkable missions at the very gate of the temple of Kali , Hindu goddess of destruction . <P> Pure Heart . Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu was born in Yugoslavia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went to Ireland to join the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary , and six weeks after being admitted , set sail for India to teach in the order 's schools and convents there . After 20 years of teaching , she asked permission to work among Calcutta 's poor . <P> Mother Teresa ( the name she took when she became a nun ) studied nursing and moved into the slums . She organized outdoor schools and set up a dispensary , petitioned the municipal authorities for a shelter to which the dying destitute could be brought . She was given the pilgrim hostel at the gate of Kali 's temple in Kalighat , the most ancient quarter of the city , named it Nirmal Hriday ( Pure Heart ) and went to work . <P> Two years later , in 1950 , Mother Teresa received canonical sanction for her order . Today the sisters run nine day schools , 15 Sunday schools , two commercial schools , two technical schools , and seven dispensaries , which treated 49,000 patients last year . Mother Teresa has adopted Indian citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the sari - to identify them with the country and because it is the most practical dress in Calcutta 's humid climate . ( No sister possesses more than two saris ; in teaching hygiene to the poor , they are able to point out that it is possible to dress neatly and cleanly with only one change of clothes . ) Friendly Subsidy . At first Indian authorities , traditionally antimissionary , were as suspicious of the new order as were the priests of Kali . But by now , both have become friendly ; the municipal government has even granted Mother Teresa a $200-a-month subsidy . <P> Nirmal Hriday has nursed more than half its 6,363 admissions back to health . But it is still intended primarily as a place for those beyond helping . One day last week Mother Teresa watched a new arrival , who , when he felt the thin , cotton pallet that covers the iron bedsteads , clutched it fiercely and said : " Thank God ! Now I can die like a human being . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
