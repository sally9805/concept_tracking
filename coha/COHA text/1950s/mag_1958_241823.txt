Three days after the Associated Press 's manned missile landed in oblivion , the United Press staged its own excursion into the wild blue yonder . Panted a U.P . bulletin from Helsinki : " The state radio here picked up signals early today which indicate Russia may have launched a moon rocket . " European radio stations , said U.P. , had picked up a " mysterious beep-beep-beep " which lasted three times as long as the signal from an orbiting Sputnik and " suggested the Doppler effect* that would be produced by a transmitter speeding away from the earth . " <P> The space-singed A.P . waited 42 minutes , then filed a carefully sublunar story reporting that a ham operator near Columbus . Ohio , had now picked up the beep . " He suggested , " said the A.P. , " that it might be a signal from some kind of space vehicle . " In A.P . ' s second story British Broadcasting Corp . engineers pronounced that the signal was probably earthbound . The A.P . finally traced the beep to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20-megacycle band used by the Sputniks . ( The teleprinter was on 20.025 mc. ; the Sputnik frequency is 20.005 mc . ) <P> The rocket-to-the-moon got a big early-morning play on radio newscasts , but its short life began after U.S. morning newspapers had gone to press , ended before afternoon papers started rolling . More than seven hours after its first moon-rocket bulletin , the U.P . mentioned the teleprinter theory among others , concluded later : " It was anybody 's guess . " Said a British engineer quoted by the A.P. : " We get strange noises constantly . A noise might be a hair dryer in Cornwall . " <P> <P> * According to the scientific principle named for Austrian Physicist Christian Johann Doppler ( 1803-53 ) , the speed of an object moving toward or away from the observer can be accurately measured by changes in the length of the radio waves it transmits.
