To the simple , rugged men of mountainous Nepal , the word " muhammad " means great and strong . It seems a fine name to give a faithful dog . To the touchy Moslem minority in the state of Uttar Pradesh near New Delhi , however , the same syllables , no matter what their spelling , mean only one thing : Mohammed , the Prophet . One day last month a Nepalese traveler named Maganlal Shah came to Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh and lost his dog , a dog so beloved that he led it with a silver chain . Maganlal advertised in the Lucknow Pioneer : " Lost , from the Hindustan Hotel , one fox breed dog , brown color , long hair , answers to name Muhammad . " <P> The ad succeeded in restoring the lost Muhammad to his owner , but that was not all . It aroused the ire of some 100,000 affronted Moslems who claimed their Prophet had been insulted . Some 5,000 of them jammed the streets in front of the Pioneer 's offices shouting " Shame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A protest meeting was held in the city 's biggest mosque . In the state assembly , a Hindu Communist took advantage of the situation to decry the government 's " indifference to the resentment of the Moslem minority . " The Pioneer published an abject apology for having run the ad , and Dog Lover Shah was arrested for offending the public . <P> Last week , as the battle continued to rage , Muhammad and his baffled master , out on bail , fled back to the mountain fastnesses of Nepal . After all , as Maganlal said , " A man can change his name but a dog can not . No dog will answer to a different name . "
