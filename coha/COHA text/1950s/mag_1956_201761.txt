The football season 's on the wane , December doth approach , The frost is on the pumpkin And the blast is on the coach . <P> <P> Thus Sportswriter Lenny Anderson described the grim days when losing coaches quail before alumni complaints and . in their wishful dreams , head south for a job at Georgia Tech , the school that has yet to fire a coach . But if the Yellow Jackets have a happy habit of hanging on to their coaches , the coaches have a happy habit of fielding winning teams . Last week , just to keep the record straight , Coach Robert Lee Dodd 's unbeaten engineers eased past Duke 's Blue Devils , 7-0 . <P> Brought up on the self-confidence of hard-driving John Heisman who taught Tech football in 1904 , the Yellow Jackets mellowed just a bit under domineering Bill Alexander , who ran the Tech squad from 1920 through 1944 . But neither Heisman nor Old Alex was proper preparation for Bobby Dodd . <P> Wives on the Bench . Born in Virginia , Bobby Dodd , 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's General Bob Neyland . For all the hardscrabble competition of the big-time college game , he never lost his stubborn notion that football was meant to be fun . <P> As Old Alex ' backfield coach in the early 19303 , Dodd taught the Yellow Jackets a hipper-dipper type of crowd-pleasing ball that he kept right on polishing after he took over from his ailing boss in 1945 . Tech backs threw the ball around with gay abandon-forward passes , laterals , double laterals , pass-and-laterals . Everybody got a kick out of the game , especially the alumni who now count 97 regular-season victories , only 27 losses and three ties in twelve Dodd seasons . <P> The squad itself gets the biggest boot of all . Once the season starts , practice sessions seem to be mildly organized periods of horsing around . Scrimmages are out of the question . " You work too hard during the week and you leave your best on the practice field , " says Dodd . While backs brush up on their assignments , linemen horn in and take a crack at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Groups wander off to play volleyball , using a goalpost crossbar as the net . Touch football is a favorite time-killer . Every few minutes the routine is changed so the boys will not get bored . <P> " I have only two rules , " says the relaxed coach . " All players must go to church on Sundays and they must all wear coats and ties on road trips . " Other coaches , hard-put to keep their musclemen in line , stare goggle-eyed when Dodd takes players ' wives to games , seats them on a sideline bench near the team . <P> Ore in His Pocket . Opposing coaches insist that the one indispensable part of that system is Dodd 's luck . " If an atom bomb went off in this room , " said Georgia 's Wallace Butts at a football banquet last winter , " Bobby Dodd would come up with a handful of uranium in his pocket . " <P> Tech rooters knew it was more than luck last week when Fullback Dickie Mattison came through in the clutch with a fourth-quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst worrywarts in the stands watched their coach calmly chewing on a blade of grass , relaxed and remembered their mildly irreverent motto : " In Dodd we trust .
