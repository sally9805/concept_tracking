txt LONDON , Dec. ** Prime Ministers of Britain , Australia and New Zealand have reached agreement on " certain fundamental propositions " relating to the defense of the Pacific and Southeast Asia that will be discussed with the Republican Administration in Washington next year . The understanding between the Prime Ministers , who conferred during and after the recent British Commonwealth Economic Conference here , was announced tonight in a communiqu ? from 10 Downing Street . It is believed in informed quarters that one of the " fundamental propositions " is that Britain should be associated in some way with the Pacific defense alliance of the United States , Australia and New- Zealand . Question Raised Twice Twice the British Government has raised the question of having British observers attend meetings of the alliance . Attendance is a matter of considerable concern and pride to Britain , and especially to Mr. Churchill . Twice Britain 's request has been rejected on the groun0 that her admission would open the door to others and that it is too early to extend membership . Australia and New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviated from that view . However , it - is thought that their two Prime Ministers , realizing how much store Mr. Churchill places in rectifying the omission of Britain from the alliance , do not wish to oppose an approach to the new Washington Government , which may have different ideas from the old .

The British view is that the defense of the Pacific and of Southeast Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are inseparable and perhaps should be safeguarded by an arrangement of broader scope than ANZUS . Mr. Churchill conferred on these defense problems with Prime Ministers Robert Gordon Menzies and Sidney G. Holland last Sunday , and again on Friday evening after the economic conference had adjourned . Another conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers is expected to be held next year at the time of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . Meanwhile , a concerted attack on the communiqu ? of the 1952 conference is being made by the British Labor party . Herbert Mor rison , the deputy leader , opened fire yesterday and today Hugh Gaitskell , former Chancellor of the Exchequer , declared that the communique was " exceedingly vague and ambiguous . " However , the party 's National Executive Committee , which has been working for the last two days on a. new party program , broadly endorsed at least one of the fundamental aims of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers . Morgan Phillips , the party secretary , said the committee had agreed unanimously that Britain needed a plan for the rapid expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
