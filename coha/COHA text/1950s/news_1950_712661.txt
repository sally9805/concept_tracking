txt City and Federal operatives joined yesterday in futile search for Alfred Turiano , believed to have been done away with by fellow-members of a New York counterfeiting band . Turiano was indicted just before Christmas on charges of conspiring to manufacture and distribute $1,000,000 in American Express Company travelers ' checks . Among seven others , named as co-conspirators , is George Gillette , who is married to a daughter of Joseph ( Joe Adonis ) Doto . Adonis is one of the richest and most powerful gamblers in the United States . Government officials said they considered Turiano one of the- key figures in the check plot , second only to Gillette . When arrested in November he was held in $100,000 bail . His lawyers succeeded in having this reduced later , over bitter opposition from the Government . William D. Dunne , a former Federal Bureau of Investigation man , now an attorney representing Turiano , confessed before Federal Judge Samuel H. Kaufman yesterday that his client , who was due to go to trial next Monday , has not been seen nor heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Dunne told the court , " that my client has met with foul play . " " You mean , " Judge Kaufman asked , " that this man has been done away with ? " " Yes , " the lawyer answered . " That is my opinion . " Mr. Dunne , it turned out , had conducted a search on his own after Turiano had failed to show up for a conference at the lawyer 's offices . Mrs. Lucille Turiano , the wife , who lives with three children and a 5-month-old grandchild at 107-38 117th Street , Richmond Hill , Queens , told Mr. Dunne she had no idea of what had happened to her husband . When Mr. Dunne passed this information along to Irving H. Saypol , United States Attorney who is to prosecute the suspects , Mr. Saypol brought the matter before Judge Kaufman . He asked for a bench warrant for Turiano and moved that bail of $60,000 , posted for Turiano , be held forfeit on the ground that Turiano had left the court 's jurisdiction . Must Produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manufacturer 's Casualty Insurance Company of Philadelphia , which put up Turiano 's bail , to produce its client before him at 10:30 A. M. today . It was at this point that Mr. Dunne expressed the fear that Turiano had been done away with . Mr. Saypol , Mr. Dunne and James Walsh , another Turiano lawyer , immediately went before a Federal grand jury to tell all they knew about the circumstances surrounding Turiano 's disappearance . Mr. Saypol said later that the grand jury would sit again today and that an important witness , whom he would not identify , was flying in from the West Coast to be heard this morning . Word leaked out that Turiano was last seen in Newark , N. J. , on the night of Jan. 10 , only a few hours after he had left his home . He was with John Mellen , 62 years old , of 101 Hawthorne Street , Brooklyn , an associate . Mr. Saypol reluctantly conceded that he was working on this information . Mr. Saypol made it clear that Mellon was not involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone had traced Turiano and another man , possibly Mellon , to a rendezvous with one or more strangers in Newark . Theories as to what may have happened to Turiano seemed to branch into various directions . One was to the effect that since he was the first man : aught in the alleged counterfeit plot , the men subsequently arrested may have blamed him for disclosing their identities . The- second theory was that only he knew the exact whereabouts of some $250,000 worth of the spurious travelers ' checks the band had had printed , and would not . share this knowledge . Both Men on Probation Both Turiano and Mellon were Federal Court probationers in the Eastern Federal District in Brooklyn , according to assistant United States Attorney Frank J. Parker of that jurisdiction . Mellon 's probation stemmed from a conviction on a charge of conspiring to forge a Government appeal bond . Turiano was put on probation after conviction on a charg4 of giving fraudulent information to obtain a Federal Housing Administration loan . Both men reported monthly to a Federal probation officer in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last appearance before that official on Jan. 3 . Turiano was to have gone to trial last Wednesday in Federal Court in Brooklyn on a fresh charge of violation of the FHA laws . His counsel then told Mr. Parker that Turiano was missing and Mr. Parker passed the information to Mr. Saypol . The Turianos live in an old-fashioned eight-room gray and white house in a middle-class neighborhood in Richmond Hill . It is owned by a brother of Mrs. Turiano 's who is in the Army . He is on the way home to help his sister search for her husband . The Turianos have three children . The oldest is a son in the early twenties , who lost his job after Turiano 's arrest on the counterfeiting charge got into the newspapers . The other children , both teen-age girls , are in high school and one was prepared to enter college . The Turianos were married twenty-two ' years . Last night , after she had carefully locked the front door , Mrs. Turiano told a reporter that she and her husband had lived an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contractor who went to work at 8 o'clock each morning , always returned around 5 P. M. and usually retired four hours later . Left Family Watching Video At 7:30 the night of Jan. 10 , when the family was clustered around the television set , Turiano left the parlor , went upstairs for his hat and coat and came down within a few minutes . He slipped up behind his wife , kissed her cheek and said , " So long , kid . See you later . " Mrs. Turiano thought he was merely going down the street for cigarettes , as he often did . When he had not returned within an hour , her son went out to the porch and noticed that the black 1942 automobile his father had borrowed from a friend was gone from its parking place . The family had not heard Turiano drive off in it , if he did . Mrs. Turiano explained that her husband had borrowed the car because he had to sell his own automobile to- put up money for the $60,000 bail bond . Mrs. Turiano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own free will because he left behind a spinal brace which he must wear when he is gone even a single day . The spinal defect is an old one , she said . Mrs. Turiano knew nothing about Mellon ; said she had never so much as heard the name . On the other hand , she said , her husband brought friends or associates to the house only rarely . Turiano is five feet , nine inches in height , stocky , weighs about 180 pounds , and is black-haired except that the peak of his head is balding . He wears rimless glasses and a horizontal scar splits his chin . The scar came from some childhood accident . His eyes are black . When he left the house he wore a tan gabardine coat , a brown felt hat and a white shirt . The family could not recall what shoes he took . " He never left us of his own will , " Mrs. Turiano said . " We never fought . We were happy . He loved us all . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
