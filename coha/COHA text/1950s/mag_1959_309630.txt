Lounging in his $120,000 home one Sunday last spring , a tough-faced , balding Indiana builder named James Robert Price decided to get ready for the building boom of the 19603 in the fastest way possible . Though he is the boss of National Homes Corp. , the world 's biggest maker of prefabricated houses , Jim Price felt that not even National was big enough for what lay ahead . That week he walked into the company 's Lafayette , Ind . executive offices , pointed to a map and said : " I want a plant here , here and here . " <P> This week National announced that Jim Price had got his plants-nine of them in as many states-through a merger with seven other U.S. home suppliers . Seven of the nine plants are in areas where National formerly sold no houses ; they put National 's network of twelve factories within a 200-mile radius of almost every major market east of the Rockies . With his new acquisitions Price this year expects to boost National 's sales to $100 million , its production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. <P> 600 Variations . The key to National 's success is Price 's head-on approach to both his problems and those of the U.S. homeowner . A creative , hard-driving businessman , Price has transformed the prefab from a poor cousin into a respectable member of the housing family . To rid the prefab of the boxy , cheap look and boring sameness that once plagued it , he has hired top architects to give his houses style , turns out four basic models in 600 different variations ranging from a three-bedroom $7.900 home to a $150,000 custom-built one . Price also has another valuable asset : his brother George , National 's president and a hardselling salesman who travels four business days out of five . <P> What has enabled Price to transform the prefab is intensive automation of his factories . IBM machines control quality and monitor shipments . Nailing machines pound nails into interior and exterior sections with a single bang , and machines automatically cut , sand and paint every section . Overhead cranes move parts down a long assembly line , hoist them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on a house every seven minutes . <P> Aluminum House . Price 's most radical house to date is made of aluminum . Though he introduced it only seven months ago , the house , which has only a few parts made of wood or Masonite , accounts for 30% of all National 's sales , and Price expects it to hit 70% by 1960 . He hopes to make it even more attractive with a 1960 model that has an exterior of aluminum , including roof , doors , window frames and exterior trim . He paints his aluminum houses with the same shiny baked enamel used on automobiles. ( it lasts three or four times longer than ordinary house paints ) , this year will use a flat , baked Lucite finish especially developed for him by Du Pont . Says he : " Our 1960 aluminum house is the greatest technical advance in housing in 100 years . " <P> Price never forgets the housewife in planning his houses , has introduced countless innovations to save time , labor and space .
