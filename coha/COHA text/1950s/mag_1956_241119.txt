As it prepared to clear the Suez Canal ( if not its clouded title ) , the U.N . ' s next and much tougher task is to establish its Emergency Force along the Egyptian-Israeli 1949 armistice line , some 120 miles to the east . To judge by the beginnings , this may take a long time . In Jerusalem Premier David Ben-Gurion announced that " under no circumstances " would Israel agree to return the captured Gaza Strip of Palestine territory to Egypt . And in the Sinai desert , advancing Yugoslav elements of the UNEF found that the retreating Israelis had skillfully scorched the earth . <P> As the Israelis pulled slowly back along their three invasion roads , they tore up or blew up the shoreline railway tracks , chopped down telegraph poles , and dynamited even railworkers ' huts . The most awesome destruction they wrought on the roads themselves . At a point ten miles east of the canal , the blacktop central road abruptly changed into a jumble of shredded rock . Giant-pronged Israeli machines similar to the " rooters " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World War II had ripped the pavement to a depth of 12 to 18 in . Last week gangs of Egyptian workmen moving up behind the Yugoslavs had put some 40 miles of railway back in service-but only one mile of highway . <P> Across desert marked by the charred and twisted remains of Nasser 's routed armor , the Yugoslavs churned slowly forward in their shiny , U.S.-built trucks . Because the Israelis had sown the roadside with mines ( and neglected to provide any maps ) , the patrols seldom made better than two or three miles a day . One burly lot of Yugoslav Communists pitched their U.S. Army pup tents beside the road over which Joseph and Mary once fled with the Christ child into Egypt , and played volleyball in the freezing gale . Beside their tents they laid white-pebble signs in the sand : " Zivio Drug Tito . Zivio OUN " ( Long Live Comrade Tito . Long Live the U.N. ) . <P> At his canalside headquarters UNEF Commander General Eedson L.M. Burns noted that the Israelis had agreed to withdraw 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back 15 miles a week from then on . At that rate , which Burns called " not conformable with the U.N . resolution , " Gaza was five weeks away . " There 's nothing to prevent their going right back to the line immediately , " he added tartly .
