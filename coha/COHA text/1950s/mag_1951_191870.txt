Hamburg captains dressed their ships in gay signal flags , beaming teachers gave school kids the day off . The cause for rejoicing was a letter from the Allied High Commission which lifted several restrictions on shipbuilding . German ships up to last week could not be larger than 7,200 tons or faster than 12 knots . Now Germans can have ships as big and as fast as they want , although a limit on overall tonnage remains . ( Within two days North German Lloyd and Hamburg-Amerika ordered 14 new 16-knot vessels . ) <P> The same letter erased almost all restrictions on German industry . It authorized production of synthetic oil and rubber , aluminum , chemicals for peacetime use , and , in effect , wiped out the quota on steel output . Still verboten were atom bombs , heavy munitions , certain optical instruments , airplanes , warships .
