txt Ten tremendous years have passed since that terrible Sunday of Pearl Harbor which President Roosevelt described as " a day that Evill live in infamy . " If we are thinking in terms of Eastern standard time we may clock the anniversary of the entry of the United States into the Second World War at approximately twenty-five minutes after one this afternoon . At that moment the hurrying tide of history washed over the last pinnacles of our isolationism . It was no longer possible , and has not since been possible , for , us to deny our historic mission in modern history . When the American people woke up on Dec. 7 , 1941 , they were living in an age in which there still lingered some of the easy-going optimism of the nineteenth century . They still believed that without too much effort and too much pain things might be made to turn out all right . They knew about Hitler but many of them did n't quite believe that he existed . They knew about Japanese imperialism but they could n't quite get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite their foul record in China , would n't get far in an up-to-date war . These illusions perished along with many hundreds of men on Sunday afternoon , Dec. 7 . Pearl Harbor was the prelude to Guadalcanal , Tarawa , Midway , the Coral Sea , the North African landings , D-Day , the arrival of Allied armies amid the rubble that had been Berlin , the solemn ceremony on ? the deck of the Missouri in Tokyo Harbor . Pearl Harbor signed the death warrant of many thousands of men who did not die that day . It changed the whole lives of countless others . Pearl Harbor showed that freedom must be bought and kept at a great price . That lesson sank in . It remained in people 's minds even after Hitler 's ashes were buried , after Mussolini 's mutilated body was shown in an Italian market place , after Japanese and German war criminals had been executed and the Emperor of Japan had been undeified and walked the earth like a common man . The war was still going on  --  indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received Russia 's newly appointed Ambassador to the United States , Andrei Gromyko , on Oct. 4 , 1943 . Said the President : " I fully share your confidence that the unity of purpose which binds our peoples and countries together in the prosecution of the war will be translated into a close and lasting collaboration together with other like-minded countries in the establishment of a just and enduring peace . " But the last of the war dead were not cold in their graves before suspicions began to arise that the Russians and other Communists did not want a " just and enduring peace " except on terms of their own devising . They did not want liberty for the world 's toiling masses , for whose welfare they were cynically solicitous . They wanted to impose their own kind of tyranny in place of that which had just been overthrown . Today we can not look back to Pearl Harbor as men do " to old , unhappy , far-off things and battles long ago . " We lack the tranquillity that might soften the ten-year-old tragedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . People in this city had an air-raid drill a few days ago . The conceivable enemy was not the Japanese and not the Germans . As we commemorate the dead of Pearl Harbor we may hope and pray that no such commemorations of a new Pearl Harbor will be exacted of our descendants or of ourselves grown older . But after ten years the struggle against absolutism is not yet , finally won . Over vast areas where hundreds of millions of people live the human spirit is still enslaved and the conspirator and the aggressor are as furious as ever Hitler was at all who dare speak up for the dignity of man . But this we do know : come peace or come war , freedom can not perish from the earth . It showed its strength in desperate circumstances between 1941 and 1945 , and if need arises it will show its strength again . The best hope is that the new enemies of mankind have learned the lesson exemplified by the fate of Hitler , Mussolini and Tojo , that they have measured the determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spill millions of lives in another vain effort to strike freedom down .
