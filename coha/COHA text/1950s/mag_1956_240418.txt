Steamy Iquitos , Peru 's chief Amazon River port , was sleeping under a velvet equatorial sky when military boots first began to scrape along the streets . Tough little soldiers in suntans deployed briskly . In less than an hour , without firing a shot , they occupied the city 's radio stations , telegraph office , and the big , grey prefectura building , Capitol of the jungled , Arizona-size department of Loreto . <P> Soon after sunup the rest of the garrison was standing at attention in the treelined Plaza de Armas . Brigadier General Marcial Merino Pereyra , their commander , read off a manifesto explaining to his men why he had led them into rebellion against Strongman Manuel Odria . They would , he promised , " open the front door for democracy in Peru , and guarantee absolutely free elections . " Townspeople gawked , then drifted off to work . <P> Waiting Game . General Merino , 51 , an able infantry officer , then sat back to wait . His boondocks uprising was shrewdly conceived . By merely proclaiming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongman 's prestige . But Odria was denied any chance of easy attack . Merino claimed the whole Second ( Jungle ) Division of 12,000 men ( the whole army numbers 55,000 to 60,000 ) . He also claimed the navy 's Amazon fleet : seven 200-to 500-ton gunboats , and about thirty 10-to 50-ton river patrol craft . Moreover , most of the troops were inaccessibly camped in scores of jungle outposts , and even the Iquitos headquarters was isolated from Lima by 700 miles of mountains and jungles . Merino 's strategy obviously was to sit tight , with an impressive force-in-being that other garrison commanders all over Peru might decide to join . When and if rebels outnumbered loyalists , Odria would fall . <P> General Odria got the point fast ; his first act was a doublecheck on other garrisons . Apparently reassured , he slapped on a state of siege , denying Peruvians the right to travel or hold meetings . <P> <P> Then the President set out to round up the political leaders presumably linked with the revolt . His eye lit on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distinguished Prisoners . Aristocratic Pedro Beltran , businessman , cotton planter , publisher , and onetime Ambassador to Washington , paid the bills for Odria 's successful 1948 revolution , but soon broke with Odria . Lately , Beltran has been booming a wealthy fellow businessman , Pedro Rosello , as an anti-government candidate in elections set for June . Beltran 's newspaper La Prensa has loudly accused Odria of plotting to steal the elections for a hand-picked successor . To the dictator , this charge was suggestively reflected in Merino 's manifesto . Cops raided and closed La Prensa . They arrested Beltran , Rosello , scores of others . <P> The dictator then turned back to military problems . At week 's end he was reportedly concentrating his eight Thunderjets and 20 Hawker Hunters at northern bases in readiness for an air strike at the rebels . With Merino still sitting tight and hoping for the time factor to operate , it was clearly Odria 's move .
