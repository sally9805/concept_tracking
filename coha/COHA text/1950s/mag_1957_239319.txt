Concernmaster During most of the season Richard Burgin , 64 , sits unobtrusively at the violin section 's first desk of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , as he has for the past 36 years . At the end of a performance the conductor or guest soloist will shake his hand ; if the guest happens to be someone as impulsive as Leonard Bernstein , he may even kiss his cheeks . For the rest , the concertmaster 's job is done out of the public view , preparing the violins for the effects the conductor wants , marking the bowings , in general setting the tone of the orchestra . <P> But unlike most other concertmasters in the U.S. , Polish-born Richard Burgin gets two or three weeks a year on the podium . Last week he led the Boston Symphony at Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall , in a concert of Vaughan Williams , Beethoven and Shostakovich , which he delivered with craftsmanship and no melodrama whatever . " I know what I want , I know how to tell them what I want , and they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afterthought : " just as they give it to any other conductor , only maybe to me a little quicker . " <P> The first violinist did not always play second fiddle to the conductor . In the small 18th century ensembles , the other musicians often took their lead from the first violin , but growing orchestras , complex scores and the public 's demand for a good show have made the conductor virtually irreplaceable . Still , the concertmaster has far more to do with running the orchestra than meets the eye . <P> Under Conductor Charles Munch , who used to be a concertmaster himself , Concertmaster Burgin 's job moves along well-established grooves , but it was different under the late Serge Koussevitzky , whose famous , poetic perorations had to be translated into technical terms , e.g. , how to make the violins sound like first love or the flutes like ice breaking . <P> lthough Burgin is forgetful in his private life ( once he even left his Stradivarius on his commuter train ) , he has a legendary memory for music . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his place-by simply playing on until the maestro found himself again . In the words of the late Felix Weingartner , Burgin says : " As long as even one piccolo is playing , we do n't give up . " <P> Many concertmasters are tempted by a virtuoso 's career . But Burgin says : " I know many virtuosos and I do not envy them . They tell me what it 's like to play the same few pieces over and over and know they have to go here and then be there . Not for me . I like the orchestra . " <P> Next week , after his spell in the limelight , Concertmaster Burgin will be back at his accustomed chair in Boston . He will mark the bowings efficiently , play his passages beautifully , and go home to Brookline on his usual commuter train , where trainmen have instructions to see that he does not lose his Stradivarius.
