The Rev. William Wright , 48 , rector of St. Clement 's Protestant Episcopal Church in El Paso , lives in an area where Christian belief is strong and fundamental . Wright himself prefers a more intellectual approach toward religion , and says so . Recently , in a speech to the El Paso Bar Association , he declared that reason is as good a guide to religion as faith is . He denounced fundamentalist camp meetings , popular in West Texas , as " emotional whingdings that provide a vacation from thinking . " Added Episcopalian Wright , attacking belief in Biblical accounts such as that of Jonah and the whale : " Who does believe those stories that has any mind at all ? " <P> Fundamentalists replied quickly and in anger . Said the Rev. Harold W. Morris , preaching to his First Church of the Nazarene congregation : " We believe all that he makes fun of . " Pastor David Calhoun of Immanuel Baptist Church warningly quoted St. Paul ( I. Timothy 4:1 ) : " Some shall depart from the faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter writer to the El Paso Times , in a flood of protest mail : " I may not have as many college . . . degrees to my name as Wright , but I have one degree , a God-conferred degree of B.A. ( Born Again ) , which man did not give . " <P> Rancher Joe Evans , a Baptist layman who has organized some of the Southwest 's most successful camp meetings ( TIME , July 30 , 1951 ) , was especially shocked . Camp meetings , said he , represent " real , undented religion . " He added : " If the Episcopal Church endorses the things Wright said in his address to the lawyers , I think they are fundamentally unsound in their belief and doctrine . " <P> This week , while El Paso 's fundamentalists still fumed , the Most Rev. Henry Knox Sherrill , presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church , announced Pastor Wright 's appointment as director of the home department of the church 's National Council . Wright 's new job : developing Episcopal missions in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
