Coming around the far turn , Calumet 's great colt Tim Tam was making his move . The Belmont Stakes , brightest jewel in the Triple Crown of the turf , seemed safely in the bag . Bets on the odds-on favorite seemed safely in the bank . <P> After winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness , Tim Tarn figured to take the Belmont in a walk . Last hope of the hunch players was a barrel-chested Irish colt named Cavan , who had come from nowhere to win the Peter Pan Handicap just the week before . And suddenly it was Cavan who was getting a call . Aboard the favorite , worried Jockey Ismael Valenzuela went to the whip . Tim Tarn wobbled badly . His fine stride suddenly looked awkward ; he was in trouble . Snug on the rail , Cavan was reaching out and running away . The liver-colored Irish import breezed under the wire with ears pricked , winning by an easy six lengths . <P> Behind him , Tim Tam hung on to second . But Jockey Valenzuela was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own courage , and his jockey dismounted far down the track rather than make him carry weight a step more than necessary . Later , after an ambulance had helped him to his barn , X rays showed that Tim Tam had chipped a bone in his right foreleg . The Triple Crown was gone ; his brief , bright career was probably over .
