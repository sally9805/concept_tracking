The Frogs of Spring ( by Nathaniel Benchley ) concerns two Manhattan families who live in adjoining houses-or , for stage purposes , adjoining backyards . Both the husbands ( Anthony Ross and Hiram Sherman ) are boyishly irresponsible ; and having , in sudden Blutbrderschaft , removed the fence between their yards , they go in for endeavors involving more bourbon than brainwork-helium tanks , portable swimming pools , stilt houses for their reluctant young . This way of living leads in time to a loss of jobs and temporary decline in brotherliness . <P> Robert Benchley 's playwright son Nathaniel has a nice share of the family wit , both wacky and urbane . The Frogs of Spring is full of bubbly moments and gaily nonsensical projects . But there is nothing-not even the proverbial thread - to hold its good things together . The going gets increasingly harder as the play more and more stands still ; its pranks are never mobilized into a plot , its fun displays no foresight . The play has its rewarding oases , but also its drowsy camel rides over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dorothy Parker &; Arnaud d'Usseau ) are the widows who lead empty , unanchored , lonely lives in a quietly handsome Manhattan apartment hotel . At their most obvious , they advance from one daily major crisis to another-from switching to a new kind of nail polish to deciding which novel to doze through . And when not personally agitated , they haunt the lobby to sniff the crises in the lives of their more adventurous sisters . <P> Of the more adventurous ones , there is middle-aged Lulu Ames ( Edna Best ) , who moves east from Akron to see more of her family . She gets caught up in an affair with a younger man ( Walter Matthau ) and then , from loving and handling him too possessively , loses him . There is elderly Mrs. Nichols ( Frances Starr ) , who rules her greying son from a wheelchair and , when he starts to rebel , blackmails him back into submission . There is Mildred Tynan ( Betty Field ) , whom an ill-made , broken-up marriage has driven to drink . <P> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrated Parker wit ; they reveal , with a sudden bite , insight into women . A populous play , The Ladies of the Corridor gains from Harold Clurman 's clean , vigorous direction . And its best and most stage-center story , that of Lulu Ames , has also its finest and most life-charged acting-a genuinely brilliant performance by Edna Best . But despite its virtues , the play comes , somehow , to make too much of a bad thing . As its half-dozen makeshift , rootless lives pile up in number , they seem to decline in significance . <P> Perhaps the trouble lies in the very setup . The women , seen a little symbolically from the outset , have a kind of prefabricated , sometimes even preshrunken , air . Rather than revealing the fluid , inconsistent , tragicomic nature of life , they are observed through steadily satiric or sentimental eyes . Also , though the usual hotel offers a vivid cross section and possesses variety , a hotel awash with lonely women is a specialty shop and provides excess . The play offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar type through one full-fashioned individual ; created , say , a Lulu Ames who might become much the same kind of symbol as a Lulu Bett , a Jay Gatsby , an Alice Adams or a George F. Babbitt.
