The sign on the office door read DO N'T KNOCK . COME IN . Inside , a small , spectacled man leaned back in his chair and surveyed the walls , decorated heavily with rowing memorabilia . " I am satisfied to retire , " said Carroll Ebright , 65 , the University of California 's head rowing coach since 1924 . " I have seen our crews reach worldwide acclaim ; I have been down , and now I see us coming back again . It is time for a younger man . " <P> When " Ky " Ebright retires in June , he can look back on one of the most successful records in rowing . His crews have been national college champions six times , took Olympic titles in 1928 , 1932 and 1948 . Last week , attired in his traditional battered hat , stubby ( 5 ft. 6 in . ) Ky Ebright was still bustling around the California boathouse on the Oakland Estuary , roaring instructions and encouragement as he drove his oarsmen through his last season . <P> Conibear &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strenuous sport , though there is no jarring and no contact . It requires persistence and mental courage . Those that stay with it acquire some of that mental courage . " <P> Ebright started early and stayed late . At the crew-conscious University of Washington ( class of 1917 ) , he was a fine coxswain under the great Hiram Conibear , father of West Coast rowing , and developer of the upright stroke with short layback that became the trademark of West Coast crews , differentiating them from Eastern oarsmen , who took their style from the British . California picked Ebright in 1924 to raise the Golden Bears to Washington 's lofty level . Results came quickly . In 1927 , 1928 and 1929 , California crews , newly tutored in the Conibear stroke by Ebright , left mighty Washington trailing in their wake . <P> Bigger &; Better . Unlike Washington , California attracts few experienced rowers , and Ebright must build his men from scratch . Twice a year he looks over the registration line of incoming students , studying them like a chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles . " Usually they 're flattered when I single them out , but some of the skeptics wonder what 's the catch . Most of them never held an oar in their lives . " He puts the selected candidates to work , builds their bodies , makes extensive use of movies in analyzing their form . Though crew is a spring sport , Ebright works his men on the barge and rowing machines each fall , has them ready for the eight-oared shells when the season rolls around . <P> Though rowing styles have changed little in his 36 years as coach , oarsmen have . Today they are bigger and row faster . " It 's harder to get into school now ; yet the enrollment is larger , so our selection is better in all ways , " he explained . " The boys are generally taller and stronger , too . The 6-ft. 4-in. and 6-ft. 5-in. guys in the middle of the shell are common now . In fact , it 's getting harder all the time to find little coxswains. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
