On her last night out , the Italian Liner Andrea Doria sliced through a gentle ocean , and an awesome wall of North Atlantic fog closed in around her . But the ship 's mood as she neared the U.S. was fog-free and gay . A movie ( Foxfire ) was running in one of Andrea Doria 's four theaters ; in the plush , boat deck Belvedere lounge , dancers swayed to the rhythms of an eight-piece orchestra . Their last song : Arrivederci , Roma . In the cardrooms , bridge foursomes pondered hands . On deck late strollers tasted the mist and sniffed for land smells . Below , passageways were lined with baggage already packed and prepared for customs . Some passengers had retired early , and were already lulled to sleep by the soothing roll and the sea sounds . <P> Eight days earlier the fast and fancy three-year-old Andrea Doria- had departed her home port of Genoa and headed for Cannes , Naples and Gibraltar . Leaving the Rock , the 29,000-ton liner raced westward on her 101st Atlantic crossing . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . For the businessmen , the priests and nuns returning from Rome , the Italian-Americans ending old-country visits , the immigrants bound for the golden shore , the crossing was an event . <P> On the Upper Edge . Not many miles away , passengers aboard the Swedish-American liner Stockholm were testing their first night at sea . The 12,644-ton Stockholm , more tourist than tony , had sailed shortly before noon that day from Manhattan for Copenhagen . After she slipped out into the Hudson River , she idled in the stream while the larger ( 44,356 tons ) lie de France swung from her pier down the Hudson . Then in file the two ships moved past Manhattan 's towers , out through the Narrows into the open sea . By 11 p.m . Stockholm , lie de France and Andrea Doria were all churning through the busy , often angry water south of Nantucket , known as " the Times Square of the North Atlantic . " <P> Through the stretch of the Atlantic , from Sheepshead Bay to the Nantucket bearing and beyond , runs Track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal transatlantic shipping lanes . By routine but not rule , westbound vessels follow the northern side of Track Charlie , eastbound ships the southern . But that evening the eastbound Stockholm was holding to the northern edge . On a clear night the course holds no serious hazard . But for three days fog had covered the sea from Newfoundland 's banks down to Nantucket . The view from a ship 's bridge was scarcely farther than the bow . Radar sets searched the seas ahead , but longtime masters with tight schedules reduced speed only slightly for foul weather . <P> Out of the Darkness . Shortly after 11 p.m. one of Andrea Doria 's card players looked idly out of a starboard window and gasped . The cause of her sudden shock : eerie lights of another ship glinting and sprinting out of the darkness towards Andrea Doria . A moment later , with a grinding , crunching roar , Stockholm 's knife-sharp prow ( reinforced for ice in northern ports ) ground 30 ft. deep into the starboard quarter of Andrea Doria , just abaft her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sparks , the shivering vessels jerked apart .
