NOT many people ever fall hopelessly in love with a mountain , which undoubtedly is a good thing for the human race . Such a romance is bound to be one-sided , apt to be disappointing , and certain to divert a man 's energy from safer and more profitable pursuits . My considered advice is to resist the temptation , hearing in mind that the courtship can be fatal to the suitor . I suppose I should know this better than most Americans . having had some experience with mountains of dubious repute . Still , it was love at first sight when the drifting clouds drew back , two yearn ago , and I looked up at the sheer nom h face of Nevado Salcantay. 20.551 feet tall , one of the loftiest unclimbed summits in the Peruvian Andes . I knew this was one mountain f had to climb . Translated into English , Salcantay means " the most savage mountain , " a gross understatement when applied to a tower of granite rising 6550 feet above the sun-baked meadows at its base , armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive with h the roar of avalanches . Seldom before had 1 seen such a mass of towering precipices , hanging glaciers and fluted ice slopes , pierced here and there by a spiny ridge and loaded with the most monstrous aggregation of tortured cornices and shattered pinnacles to lie found outside a nightmare . But the average man 's nightmare mountain is apt to be the very one with which a climber falls in love , particularly when most people say that it ca n't , or wo n't , be scaled . The Peruvian Indiana insisted that a brooding spirit lived up in the clouds on Salcantay , ready to send down an avalanche on any more man who sot foot on the mountainside . The city dwollere in Cuczo , leas than thirty air miles distant , were less mystical . They simply regarded the mountain as impossible . As a theoretical physicist , Ire med to examine evidence with n skeptical eye , I found neither of these opinions to he convincing . People told us in 1950 that nobody could climb Yerupaja , a 21,758-foot summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us laid siege to Yerupaja , and two of our party reached the summit . When we heard that Snlcantay was equally forbidding , three of us took a fifty-mile trip around the base of this massive mountain . Needless to say , we sighted a breach in its frosty fortifications , a seemingly feasible route up the great north face . Above this route towered huge seracs ? thousands of tons of glacial ice broken into house-size blocks as the glacier moved down steep slopes . Tremors could send the blocks roaring down . An ominous-looking chute crossed the only logical climbing track . Now and then , boulders and tumbling blocks of ice scoured it clean . There was no " easy " route up Salcantay , but with time , patience and the luck every mountaineer must have , 1 knew we could reach the summit . IL took two years to prove that estimate correct . For days on end , the mountain veiled itself in storms and forced us back . An avalanche big enough to swallow up a regiment swept down a gully within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with pulverized ice . But late on the afternoon of August 5 , 1952 , kicking steps up an almost vertical slope of frozen snow , I came out on a knife edge so narrow it had to be straddled . A numbing wind tore the clouds to shreds , and opened a vista toward the brown valleys below . With one climbing boot hanging down over the headwaters of the Amazon , and the other dangling over the Peruvian plateau , I was sitting on top of Nevado Salcantay . One of the last and most remote mountains of the Western Hemisphere had been climbed . Six of us reached the summit of Salcantay that afternoon  --  four Americans and two French climbers , comprising the first Franco-American expedition in mountaineering history . It was one of the first expeditions of such difficulty to include a woman . To me , the finest moment of the whole climb took place when Claude Kogan inched her way out on the summit ridge  --  Claude , a tiny Frenchwoman only five feet tall , weighing less than 100 pounds , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective members of our entire party . I suspect that Salcantay represented a debt of honor to her . In 1951 , after climbing another huge Peruvian mountain , her husband died of a gastric hemorrhage . In her early thirties , when most women might prefer to lead a quiet life , she carried on for him on Salcantay. - , 1 1-1HE ascent of Salcantay was a vindication in more ways than one . Merely reaching the foot of the mountain took us seventeen days , for snow blocked the high passes , and storms made a mockery of the " dry " season which usually desiccates this part of Peru between July and September . Wind , clouds and storm chased us off the north face three separate times . It seemed that we never would reach the summit ridge . Until we did , we could never be sure that we were first up the mountain . Two Swiss , residents in Peru , went in to Salcantay just ahead of us , and came out proudly claiming a first ascent . They actually climbed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vantage point . Darkness and flagging energy turned them back less than a mile from the true summit , a cone of snow on the far side of a deep gap , scarcely fifty feet higher in altitude than the spot they reached on the ridge . What they accomplished was stupendous for a two-man party , but it was n't a normal first ascent . In retrospect , it amuses me to realize how close we came to omitting the French from our expedition , for reasons which seemed valid enough at the time . The big question was : Could we get along with these strangers , jammed night after night into tiny tents high on a mountain ? Many a climber , galled by his tent mates , has seriously contemplated murder in the still hours of an Alpine night . We wondered whether they might be reckless , a trait that can send a whole climbing party tumbling to its death . I had some personal misgivings about Claude Kogan 's ability to withstand the strain of the climb , even though she had a magnificent mountaineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , " the term once applied to the customary route up the Swiss side of the Matterhorn . I am happy to acknowledge that I was wrong on both counts . When I saw Claude , crouched on a slope as steep as a mansard roof , chopping steps by the hundreds while merrily trolling a chanson , it was evident that she had both emotional and physical stability to spare . In 1951 she established a world 's altitude record for women by climbing ' Quitaraju , a Peruvian peak 20,130 feet high , with Mme. Nicole Leininger . Bernard Pierre , thirty-two , who shared a climbing rope with Claude on Salcantay , proved also to be one of our most reliable climbers . A third Frenchman , Dr. Jean Guillemin , thirty-seven , backstopped the expedition from base camp , and guided the four Peruvian porters who carried supplies up the north face to a point below high camp . The only difficulty with the French was a linguistic one . Among us all , we spoke four languages . 1 knew a little Spanish . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke Spanish and French only ; Pierre was fluent in English , and Guillemin spoke English a little . The porters spoke only Quechua. an Indian language . which none of us knew . The Americans in the party were all old climbing friends . Graham Matthews , a lanky , bespectacled thirty-one , was with me on Yerupajn . When not on a mountain , he teaches geography and history in West Newton , Massachusetts . Fred Ayres , still a fine climber at the age of forty-five , left a job as an industrial chemist in the East to teach at Reed College , in Oregon , close by the great snow peaks of the Pacific Northwest . David Michael , twenty-four , is an art student in New York , and a climber with experience in the Coast Range and Alaska . Two other members of the party had to leave us before we reached the summit . Austen Riggs , thirty-one , a research biologist , Flew me down ? a 3700-mile trip from New York . He had to go home some days in advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us until we were well established at high camp . Then his vacation time ran out and he returned to a law practice in Cleveland . Compatible though we were , the mountain tried our patience sorely , and made us wonder a few times if the Indians might not be right . We spent twenty-four frustrating days stumbling around in snowatorma and clouds ; set up three separate camps , the highest at approximately 18,200 feet ; and chopped 1500 steps up ice slopes that reached a maximum gradient of sixty degrees , not far short of a sheer cliff . As if irritated , the mountain grumbled angrily at us . Every now and then , rocks and ice spun down the gully that cut through our climbing track at two separate points . One unusually jagged boulder whizzed by within a few feet of Graham Matthews . The gully was 600 feet wide at this point , too steep and glassy to be crossed except with crampons , a steel framework adorned on the bottom with ten sharp spikes and strapped to the sole of a ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? O. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . .4 , ? ? ? climbing boot . We made probably two dozen crossings of the gully , going up-to high camp or retreating to base amp , Each time we sprinted madly across , arriving on the far side ready to collapse from lack of oxygen , for the air at high altitudes is more rarefied than at sea level . Running in crampons is a delicate business at best . Unless you watch your feet , it is easy to trip  --  which , in our case , would have involved a cartwheel fall several hundred feet down the mountain . Shortness of breath slowed us down . It took several minutes for each crossing  --  and no chance to steal a look at the 200-foot ice wall that crowned the top of the gully , occasionally letting loose a lethal shower of ice chunks . We were lucky not to be caught in an avalanche , a fact borne in on us July twenty-ninth , when Salcantay produced an unmistakable warning of its power . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were perched on a ridge of snow , another gully split the side of the mountain . We had just settled down at sunset when , from above , we heard a sharp , cracking sound . Then came a heavy , grating noise , followed by the thud of dozens of blocks of ice , any one of them big enough to sweep away a whole climbing party . Pulverized ice showered the tents . Stray chunks boomed within twenty-five feel of high camp . Miscalculations can wreck the best organized of climbs , which may explain why we dealt with Salcantay HO tenderly . Our reconnaissance started in the summer of 1950 . We had just come down off Yerupuja after paying a heavy toll to that magnificent peak . Dave Harrah and , Jim Maxwell , the only men to reach the top , froze their toes and had to undergo amputations . Obviously , they could not come with us to look at Salcantay . I sow my brat pictures of the mountain in a book about the Andes published in Switzerland . A little later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Yale University , who made the first practical estimate of its difficulties . Around 1915 after discovering the ruins of the Inca fortress of Machupicchu , Bingham walked in to the base of Salcantay . It is , he said . a magnificent peak " which someday will prove a challenge to mountaineers . " It was more than a challenge to me , that summer of 1950 . It was a hopeless passion . We walked almost completely around Salcantay , photographing its sheer faces , its icy ridges twisting skyward . One by one , we noted down these ridges as " too dangerous to justify an attempt , " or , more simply , as " impossible . " One night , about two A.m. , Gra ham woke me and pointed upward . We were sleeping in the open , without a tent . Through a rift in the clouds , by the dim light of a waning moon , we saw the upper slopes of an ice wall and the summit ridge thousands of feet above us . We agreed that this was it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . In the fall of 1951 , when we began to formulate our plans , it suddenly developed that everybody wanted to climb Salcantay . This was understandable , since the virgin peaks of the western world dwindle in number year by year . All the great summits of Alaska , the Canadian Rockies and the Alps have been climbed , some by half a dozen different routes . In Peru , less then a dozen summits over 20,000 feet remain , with Salcantay one of the most challenging of them all . By 1951 , the aspirants included Americans , French , Peruvian-Swiss , Austrians , Italians and Swedes . The prospective Italian party Was to he captained by an indomitable seventy-three-year-old named Piero Ghiglione . In my bleaker moments , I could vision the summit of Salcantay as crowded as the 6288-foot summit of Mt . Washington , New Hampshire , which is served by a motor highway and a cog railway . An expedition from California willingly gave way to us and climbed Nevado Huandoy , a 20 , - 000 footer in the Cordillera Blanca of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedes arrived too late to precede us to the mountain . The French joined with us , but the Peruvian-Swiss two-man party set out before we learned of its existence and could arrive at some compromise solution . We planned the expedition with the utmost care . It does you no good to reach for an essential piece of equipment , halfway up a mountain , and then to discover that you 've left it back in New York . John Oberlin collected some 357 different items , including such essentials as tents , ropes and other climbing supplies . He also made sure of our supply of waxed thread , potholdera , shoe grease , gloves for cooking over an open fire , safety pins , mosquito dope , marking crayons for our maps , photo hags for changing camera films , and even clown white , a grease applied to the lips to reflect the sun and forestall blister . I made up a food list to cover 300 man-days of climbing . Expeditions to Mt . Everest , highest in the world , have written learned tomes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stomach being unpredictable above 15,000 feet . We dined like gourmets on such things as pci/c , de foie gels , furnished by the French , and chile con carne . The master plan called for all members of the expedition to reach Cuzco by June eighteenth . A strike in the American oil refineries shut . down almost all transatlantic plane travel . Bernard was stranded at Dakar ; Claude arid Jean could n't even leave Paris . Austen and I , on that day , were being paddled by dugout canoe across an Ecuadorian river to our tiny plane on an air strip . Only Graham , David , Fred and John were on schedule . It was June twenty-fifth before we all arrived in Cuzco and met for the first time with the French . We liked them at once . Claude , who designs bathing suits , was bubbling aver with humor . Bernard was serious and intent . Jean . who was invaluable on the mountain , had a doctor 's true enthusiasm for healing . " Ah , " lie would say , beaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good . ' On June twenty-ninth we motored from Cuzco to the trail lending in to Salcantay . Ahead of us wore two 15 , - ( 100-foot primes . That is no trivial height , when you consider that Mt . Whitney , California , the tallest peak in he continental United States , has an altitude of about 14,500 feet . The trip in , which should have taken two days , look more than two weeks . Fog and snow engulfed the mountains . The closest . and easiest pass was hopelessly blocked until the snow melted and we crossed on July ninth . While we were waiting , the worst blow of all fell on us . A bearded mountaineer , his lips cracked and ' Metered by I he Hun , came hobbling into the little Indian village where we had bivouacked . His name was Felix Marx . " Believe me , gentlemen , " he told us , " I have climbed Salcantay . " With Marcus Broenniman , an engineer , Marx scaled the east ridge  --  no mean feat , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We took Marx literally , which left us with a grave decision to make : Should we climb Salcantay regardless , even if it proved to be a second ascent ? The decision  --  a tough one for any mountaineer ? was that we should go ahead . 1 felt this strongly . The others concurred . After all , we were footing the bill for twenty-nine pack horses , ten mules , four porters and four drivers , not to overlook the costs of our trip to Peru . There was always the possibility that Marx might be wrong . Before we left our first bivouac , John Oberlin went out to Cuzco and returned with a newspaper clipping that seemed to prove it a gamble worth taking . The clipping was an account of the Marx-Broenniman ascent . An accompanying photo from the Summit ridge plainly showed in the distance a cone of snow that was higher . On the haiiis of the photo , we doubled that Marx and Broenniman had climbed Salcantay . The evening of July thirteenth , at base camp at last , we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected to climb . Before us Lay the north face , a frozen cascade more than a mile high and three miles wide , seamed by hundreds of rifts in the ice , and for the most part impassable . The Swiss route near the east ridge seemed incredible . Above it towered a spire of ice about the size of the Woolworth Building , ready to tumble at any moment . Our route had to he farther to the west . Because of the snow and clouds , it took us until July eighteenth to establish Camp I at about 17,000 feet . The figure is an estimate , as are all figures dealing with Salcantay , whose altitude has been variably estimated from 20,000 to 22,000 feet . The closest " official " figure , based on a rather casual survey , is 20,551 feet . Above Camp I. our troublCs began . A band of cliffs crossed the route , from which great masses of ice toppled . To make things more awkward , it was boiling hot . Salcantay is only thirteen degrees , a few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enowfields can shoot the temperature up to 100 above during the day and yet it may drop to a chilly fifteen above at night . Baked by day and frozen by night , we hacked away at the mountain , and finally found a site for high camp on a tiny snow-and-ice promontory . Our Peruvian porters , still cherishing n healthy respect for the spirit of the mountain , refused to be cajoled higher than a point about half that distance . There they dumped their loads in a shallow crevasse  --  a split in the ice  --  and climbed down the ice slopes , using a fixed rope as a hand line in the steepest places  --  carefully belayed by one or more of the climbing party . Above us , the next morning , we could see ii storm closing in . Claude , Bernard , Fred and I had spent the night at high camp . We worked our way up pest two huge crevasses , at which point Claude took over the lead and proved her merit beyond cavil . She chopped away at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on poor Bernard . He was crouched far below her , at the other end of the rope , holding her secure in awe of a slip , When I relieved Claude , the clouds closed in and I was atone in an eerie setting , solitary on a smooth ice elope , out of sight of people , rock and tents , with nothing but clouds and smooth ice for companions . An advance was impossible , and by midday of the twenty-fourth all of us retreated to base camp as a blizzard wind moaned high above . It was July twenty-eighth before we regained high camp , exasperated and this time half frozen . We just managed to pass a third crevasse above high camp when the clouds swept in again . Above us , we could just make out a precariously balanced cornice and an ice tower over it . We began to feel like Yo-yos , an impression heightened on the thirtieth , when David and Fred worked their way into the very top of the ice gully , only to be turned back by a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient incentive to send us all down in the fog and snow to haw camp again . It was August second before Fred and I climbed hack up . This time , as before , we had to clean out the old steps we had chopped , and sometimes chop new ones where avalanches had filled them in . On August third we passed the three guardian crevasses and climbed to a point where the summit ridge was visible . The ice wall sloped sickeningly up to meet it . There were still hundreds of steps to be cut , but the end was in sight . That afternoon Claude , Bernard , Graham and David joined us at high camp . We drank our toast to victory in tea , and dined on pate aux truffes . The mountain , however , had different ideas . Storm clouds swirled around the ridge and warned us against climbing any farther the next day . By August fifth we were thoroughly disgusted and determined to finish the climb , even though the sky still was ominous . We cut steps on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my knee as well as a place for my feet . Fred , at the other end of my rope , enlarged each step with his ice ax , an instrument designed ( or just such occasions . The ice ax has a point at one end , a wooden handle and a curved head shaped like an adz on one side and like a pick on the other . The pick is used to chop out steps in ice ; the adz , to clear and enlarge them . The clouds closed in as we inched our way upward , but by two PM. the worst was over . We emerged on the ridge . Ahead of us we could see the stump of a wooden flagpole the Swiss had planted there  --  and knew that our days of struggle and defeat , of painful inching into the mist and fog , were more than worth the effort . The true summit was still quite distant , poking its head into the clouds . The Swiss had told tie that they went no farther than the flagpole . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first the ridge was flat and level , but then it dropped precipitously into foggy gap . We drove a stout three-foot stake into the snow , tied the rope to the stake and descended to the gap . It was a scant . 200-foot climb from the gap to the summit . Fred led the way . Ho was first on top . I followed him . A bitter wind keened around the knife edge . The clouds broke just enough to show us a few brown hills below . 1 was gasping for breath , trying to inhale enough air to fill my lungs . It was difficult to be very triumphant , and all too easy to be tired . Because the rooftop of Salcantay was too tiny to hold us all , Fred and I descended to the gap . Graham and David , then Claude and Bernard , passed us , on the way up to share the heady feeling of a first ascent . The conquerors of an untrodden mountain deserve , at the very least , the amenities of a hot bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet dreams . We slept that night in a two-man tent at the base of the Salcantay pinnacle , six of us wedged into that cramped space . To say we slept was an exaggeration . We dozed , tossing and turning , waking dozens of times during the twelve hours of darkness . Not until four hours after dawn were we able to face the self-evident fact that what gaes up must come down . Graham and David went ahead , putting in fixed ropes for hand Lines . Most of them we left on the mountain . Al the high camp , everybody was there to greet us , including Abel Pacheco , the owner of our pack horses and mules , and Sefiora Mayalay Fleury , a Peruvian friend of the French climbers . Even the porters were on hand , grinning and chattering , apparently convinced that the spirit of Salcantay could be successfully challenged . The Case of the Unsuccessful Swiss was finally solved to everyone 's satisfaction when we came out to the highway and back into Cuzco . Marx and Broenniman , who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their use of the term was a trifle loose . Most mountaineers do n't claim to have climbed a peak unless they reach the summit . Marx and Broenniman were satisfied to reach the ridge . Broenniman himself admitted to us that from the ridge he had seen the final cone at a distance . " We restrained our desire to attempt this needle , " he said in a newspaper interview , " realizing that it would first lie necessary to Lee tablish a camp on the summit ridge . " In a manner of speaking , considering the effort involved , I could underatnnd why they stretched the facts just a little . Not only did they have a gruelling climb but on the way down a fixed rope gave way , and Broenniman fell hundreds of feet down the mountain . It was sheer good luck that fetched him up close to the tracks that led to their high camp , Marx was marooned for the night on a rock promontory . Broenniman 's feet were so badly frostbitten that he was unable to walk without pain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fall short of the goal , is an adventure of the spirit , a test of the soul and a challenge to the human will . From a distance , almost any great peak seems impossible , yet few of them actually are . But even after a climb such as the one we made on Salcantay , it is possible to wonder if it really happened . On the way out from Cuzco to the Peruvian coast in a Faucett Air Lines DC-4 , the pilot obligingly flew far off his route and circled around Salcantay . As he put the plane into a steep bank , dipping his wings over the cliffs and ice pinnacles of Salcantay , I could make out below the faint and melting path of our climbing track . In a few weeks all the evidences of our visit would be obliterated , and the mountain once more would be a lonely fortress standing guard over the high divide between the Peruvian plain and the jungles of the upper Amazon . My finest memory was of the last day at base camp , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Salcantay was hidden by clouds . Usually it could be seen fleetingly at dawn . That final day I rose very early . In the deep valleys and over the silent jungles there was a brooding mantle of dark-neat ' . But far above , limning in I he first rays of the sun . I could see the summit ridge of Salcantay , master of itself no longer . Now the mountain belonged to six of us.
