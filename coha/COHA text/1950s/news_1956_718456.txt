txt Not in many a long year , if ever , has the " Christmas spirit " found itself so much a Stranger on thiti earth as a does this year . for , probably , never has the earth nourished so large and so deadly a brood of hatreds as it harbors today . It is not the temporary " hatreds " of warring people6 that are the matter , although these are deeper and fiercer than usual . The terrifying thing is the hatreds within the peqple themselves , especially the " occupied peoples , " the " kroup " hatreds , and worst of all , perhaps , the personal hatreds of man for man in these countries , the hatred of the " patriots " for the Quislings. and the " collaborationists " who live in their midst . These are of the old murderous type which waits only an opportunity to wreak total vengeance . This sort of thing has existed before , sporadically , locally and temporarily , but never on today 's scale . Today it wraps the European continent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaked deeply into the very earth and water of life . How shall the Christmas message of " peace and good will toward men "  --  or if one prefers it , " Peace on earth to men of good will " ? penetrate that pall , which seems to have all the stigmata of a direct exhalation from Hell itself ? If any reader thinks that this is wild and whirling rhetoric all he has to do ' is to listen for five minutes to any one of the refugees among us from those countries speaking out his full mind . ? ? ? R. is difficult for us in our present mood to still our passions and to try to understand what has happened , and how it has come about . But the effort is not merely worth making but , indeed , is necessary to make . In making it , the first step is to look back over the ' facts in as cold a spirit of analysis as we can muster , and try to discern when and where this diabolism first clearly made its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these our days . Let us draw a line at the end of the last war and forget all the atrocity stories of that time . A few years ago , Mr. Maurice Hindus published a book here entitled " Humanity Uprooted , " dealing with Russia in the formative years of " the Bolshevist Revolution . " Stripped of all possible exaggeration , the story is one of cold-blooded extermination of human beings who had committed no crime other than that of being innocent obstacles to a political reconstruction of their country . Also , for the first time in recorded history , the rulers of a great people formally declared war upon Almighty God . That did startle a good many of us here and a good many in other countries where it web going on . But we did not clearly recognize it for what it was , and it is to be feared that it was the economic revolution of the Bolishevist regime , rather than th &t; regime 's treatment of human- beings , that had much to do with the attitude of other nations beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hitler and Nazism , the smell of brimstone seemed first to be discerned by our nostrils . Perhaps the reason was that whereas a good many of our people had viewed the economic side of Bolshevism with sympathy , indeed with approval , the Nazi deviltry was devoid of this or any other adventitious attraction and the facts of that deviltry were more clearly observable in detail . The story of the Warsaw Ghetto , for instance , lacked little , if anything , of the infernal characteristics of the Bataan story . It shocked us , yea ; but not as Bataan has shocked and angered us . We have witnessed the process of extermination as applied to the European Jews  --  as truly devilish in its character as anything that has so far happened  --  with nothing like the excess of angry heat as that in which we are today . ? ? ? If we are bent upon analysis , we must discard as beat we can all the emotional elements from the equation and look only at the remaining fundamental facts . The one fundamental fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good two centuries of " humanitarian " progress  --  as we imagine it ? we find ourselves suddenly confronted by the spectacle of something which 16 more , much more , than a reversion to something which we call " barbarism . " It is something much worse . It is " barbarism " stripped of all its youthful freshness and vigor , which contributed to European civilization ( as Count Coudenhove-Kalergi has reminded us ) the idea of " chivalry "  --  and not merely stripped of these thingS , but infused with a positively evil spirit . The question that faces us is : How did this happen ' Whitt has gone wrong ' We had a " civilization " that in its mores was by all odds the most " bumanitarian " in all history , yet there has appeared this monstrous thing which , in its negation of human nature . itself makes the Aztec human sacrifice look almost like a noble conception . What opened the door to the thing ? Through the centuries what men have called the law of right and wrong has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to furnish its first formal denial . That law barred the door to the spirit of evil . If that does not point to the answer to the question , where else are we to look for it ?
