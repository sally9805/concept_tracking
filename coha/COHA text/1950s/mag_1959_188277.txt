In a vast concrete hangar at Wichita 's Municipal Airport last week gathered city officials , businessmen and workers to pay homage to " the Henry Ford of the light aircraft industry . " His name : Dwane L. ( for Leon ) Wallace , 47 , president of Wichita 's Cessna Aircraft Co . A skillful management pilot with a frame ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 160 Ibs. ) as spare as a wing spar and a face as weatherbeaten as a crop-duster 's , Dwane Wallace was celebrating his 25th year with Cessna . There was a great deal to celebrate . <P> This year , for the first time , Cessna is forging ahead of rival Beech Aircraft ( " across the street " in Wichita ) as the No. 1 maker of private planes . Cessna announced first-half earnings for fiscal 1959 of $3.92 a share v. $2.45 last year , declared a 25% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 50 . The company 's conservative projection of the year 's earnings : $7 a share v. $6.18 in 1958 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sprouted like a teen-ager after 1951 ( TIME , Feb. 17 , 1958 ) , has finally matured . Last year , despite the recession , U.S. private-plane manufacturers delivered 6,416 planes , up 300 over 1957 , raked in $101.5 million v. $99.7 million in 1957 . In January , the latest month reported , they sold 100 more planes and grossed $2,500,000 more than in January 1958 . The recession proved that for the businessman , the private plane is not a luxury but a necessity . U.S. businessmen have taken to the air in such numbers that business plane operators now account for 50% of general aviation 's flying hours , logged 1,500,000 more flying hours in 1958 than all U.S. domestic scheduled airlines . <P> During the first quarter of 1959 , Cessna sold more airplanes ( 958 ) than the rest of the Big Four manufacturers ( Beech , Piper , Aero ) together . Today Cessna accounts for 53.9% of this market . This fall Cessna , which now manufactures seven private planes ranging in price from $7,000 to $60,000 , will introduce an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even bigger share of the market . The 210 is the first high-wing , single-engine private craft with a retractable landing gear . It cruises at 190 m.p.h . Price : about $22,500.
