txt LONDON , Feb. ** Minister Attlee concluded the series of campaign broadcasts tonight with a defense of the Labor , party 's handling of . domestic and foreign affairs . Planning for full employment and fair shares for all had been the keynote of domestic riol : icy , he declared , and patience had been the watchword of Labor 's foreign policy under Foreign Secre- , tary Bevin 's direction . He had little to add to the answer he had given ? already to Winston Churchill 's proposal of a new approach to Premier Stalin for settlement of the issues that divide the East from the West . Russian intransigence rather than British stubbornness , he said , had been responsible for the failure // thus far to reach agreement on control of atomic weapons . " The fault does not lie on this side of the Iron Curtain , " he said . " We are ready at all times to cooperate with Russia on equal terms in the comity of nations . But it must be on equal terms . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life at the behest of others . " After telling of his ownlefforts and Mr. Bevin 's to find some way of saving the world from the horrors of atomic warfare , Mr. Attlee said that the machinery of the United ' Nations was still ready to provide a formula . " We are ready and eager , " he added , " to discuss with Russia , the United States , Canada and all other nations , ways and means for dealing with this menace . The difficulty does not lie in the method or in the choice of persons to discuss these high matters. - All that is required is the will . We on this side of the Iron Curtain have the will to discuss with the Russians this , with all other outstanding difficulties . " That was as far as the Prime Minister was willing to go in meeting the issue that Mr. Churchill tossed into campaign in Edinburgh last Tuesday . How important that issue will be when the people vote on Thursday remains to be seen . It waa the subject of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Conservative candidate in Horsham , Sussex , said it was a pity that Mr. Churchill 's statesmanlike proposal should have been " pooh peohed " by Mr. Bevin . Fenner Brockway , a Labor candidate , while agreeing that perhaps another approach should be made to Russia , expressed doubt that Mr. Churchill was the man to make it . Lord Strabolgi , Labor peer , asserted that no matter what the complexion of the next Government , there must be an attempt to reach an accommodation with Russia . Mr. Attlee 's defense of British foreign and Commonwealth policy was secondary to his insistence that in domestic affairs the Labor Government had done at least as much for the welfare of the British citizens as any government could do . Under the British election rules Mr. Attlee 's speech was the last that can be made over the British Broadcasting Corporation network by any political party. - This is one reason that both party leaders have warned their followers against the introduction of any new and extraneous issues by whispers or any other means . There is no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only are no more polit'ice ' broadcasts permitted but the radio here- does not report in its news broadcasts what happens at political meetings . In his final appeal Mr. Attlee divided his talk into three parts . These were Labor 's record in its relations with other nations and the Commonwealth , the problem of economic recovery , and the whole field of social services . He argued that the Labor Government had handled all three better than the Conservatives could have done . Churchill Defends Proposal While he was speaking Mr. Churchill , who is off the air for the rest of the campaign , was speaking in his own constituency without benefit of microphones . He concentrated his fire on the issue of one more attempt at finding a formula of peace with Russia . Declaring that Russia and her satellites were maintaining a " gigantic army " and had more than 25,000 planes in commission , Mr. Churchill warned that only the possession by the United States of the atom bomb in " great quantities " and the " courageous readiness ' of the American people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian forces to the Channel coast of France , " protected these islands from Russian domination . " That is , he added ironically , if one were to exclude their " goodwill , good faith and genial outlook upon mankind . " After he had finished his prepared address , Mr. Churchill was asked if he believed in an international agreement outlawing the atomic bomb as a weapon of warfare . He said : " I certainly think it would be a great mistake for the Americans and the British to . give up this great weapon of defense until there has been an agreement for careful inspection in other countries to make sure that they have not got it and are not making it , and until there is some general process of disarmament that will not leave us at the mercy of the enormous * * * , , Mr. Churchill 's next words were drowned in applause .

But the Socialist leaders say : ' Why should you raise these matters now at an election ?
