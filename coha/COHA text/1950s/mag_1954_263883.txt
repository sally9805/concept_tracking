Like the members of almost every other profession , U.S. educators have a human proclivity for presenting one another with plaques , medals , scrolls , certificates and testimonials . But not often do such honors find their way to the level of the ordinary classroom . Last week , as a part of its bicentennial celebration , Columbia University paid tribute to six teachers who were selected for special honor in a nationwide canvass of schools and colleges . In so doing , it also painted a vivid portrait of the vast variety of theory and practice in U.S. education itself . The honored six : <P> <P> &gt;Miss Ada Shockley , 43 , who teaches the first grade in the College Elementary School of the Central Washington College of Education in Ellensburg , Wash . A shy , quiet woman , Miss Shockley started her career in a country school at $50 a month . She toted ten gallons of water to school each day , made new , child-sized furniture , decorated the windows with bright cretonne to make school look " homey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her little charges , leading them through song and play until they are ready for books . Dedicated to the proposition that adjustment is as important as subject matter and that a child should not be forced to study until he is ready , she was chosen as a perfect representative of the " primary teacher who first unlocks for our youngest citizens the treasure chest of books and pictures and ideas . . . " <P> &gt; Miss Helen Trask. 58 , modish but motherly mistress in the third and fourth grades at the Munsey Park School in Manhasset , N.Y . A disciple of the learning-by-doing philosophy , Miss Trask keeps her classroom humming with activity . Most mornings begin with a " report period " in which her pupils exchange ideas or tell each other stories . After that , the class 's regular work-social studies , science , reading , arithmetic-flows along with something of the ease of a stream of consciousness . Through spontaneous " poems , " pupils begin to learn the power of words ; through reading and trips around the community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildering array of projects ( e.g. , wiring the classroom bell , building a weather station ) , they pick up the essentials of science-while also having a good deal of fun . <P> &gt; Miss Lennie Green , 41 , a Negro , daughter of a Pullman porter and a seamstress . As a child she fell in love with Latin and music , eventually won her master 's at Atlanta University with a thesis on the letters of Pliny the Younger . An accomplished pianist , violinist and violist . Miss Green now teaches music at Atlanta 's Booker T. Washington High School , also gives piano lessons at home . Over the years she has set hundreds of students to playing string quartets , singing chorales , attending symphony concerts in the city ( " They come around to see her , " says her mother , " just like she was their own mama " ) . But in spite of her popularity , Miss Green retains some ideas with a refreshingly old-fashioned flavor : " There is never a time when I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of studying , and always hold to the belief that one can not be a successful teacher unless she devotes herself to a life of study as well .
