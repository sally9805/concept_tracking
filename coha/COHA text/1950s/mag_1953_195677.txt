Many of the most alert minds in U.S. medicine were assembled in Atlantic City last week for a give &; take on what 's new . As usual , much that the researchers had delved for would not make much differ ence to ailing mankind for years to come . But a report to the American Society for <P> Clinical Investigation , whose members are dubbed " the Young Turks " ( TIME , May 19 , 1952 ) , bore directly on the current treatment of breast cancer . <P> Surgeons have been removing the ovaries of women with advanced cancer of the breast on the theory that the ovarian hormones ( estrogens ) favor the growth of the cancer . But Dr. Olof H. Pearson of Manhattan 's Memorial Center found that this surgery seemed to slow the spread of such cancers in only 30% to 50% of the cases . With two other doctors , he conducted a close study of cases to learn why . <P> Their conclusion : what has seemed to be a single type of cancer is really two . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female hormones ( ovaries and sometimes adrenals ) and perhaps by giving male hormones ; the second requires the opposite treatment-leaving the estrogen sources intact , perhaps even giving extra estrogens and cortisone . To type a patient 's cancer and decide whether the ovaries should be removed , the doctors have only to trace her pattern of calcium excretion through a single menstrual cycle . <P> At another meeting in Atlantic City , the Association of American Physicians ( dubbed , willy-nilly , " the Old Turks " ) heard about a new disease with a name like a Greek railway station : agammaglobulinemia . This is the condition which exists , said Dr. Charles A. Janeway of Harvard Medical School , when a patient lacks his natural share of gamma globulin , the immunity-carrying element in human blood . So far , all such patients have proved to be male . <P> The new disease , discovered in an Army dependent by Colonel Ogden C. Bruton , is rare , fortunately , and is probably a byproduct of the antibiotic age . " Before the days of penicillin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succumbed to the extremely severe infections which either caused the condition or first brought it to light . " Nobody knows yet whether agammaglobulinemia is present at birth or is picked up later in life . But its discovery may help to explain why some patients never seem to develop resistance against normally mild infections , and may die as a result .
