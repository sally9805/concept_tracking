txt Ay a Ste If TVritcr of The Christian Science Monitor The Ambassador of Nationalist China came to Boston this week to give local Chinese groups , as well as other Bostonians , a look at what is happening on the island of Formosa and his estimate of the situation behind the Bamboo Curtain which shrouds the rest of China from American gaze . Hollington K. Tong said last night that fully 95 per cent of the more than 7,000 Soviet technicians now working in Com-munist China : would defect to I the West " right now , " if asylum were granted them in Hong I Kong or elsewhere . This information , he observed , comes from reliable sources and i was confirmed " by a Russian ' technician who arrived in Hong Kong the first part of September . " " The Russian escapee , " he I continued , " reported widespread discontent among the Chinese people living under communism . This discontent is evident amongl Chinese and foreigners alike . " ' Warning ' Recalled Mr. Tong 's remarks were made during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel Statler , commemorating the 46th anni- 1 versary of the founding of the I Republic of China and the inauguration of the Boston chapter of Sino American Amity . I More than 1,200 persons ati tended . , The Ambassador jokingly de6Iared that before he came to the United States " well-intentioned friends earnestly warned me to look out for Boston . " One of them told him that Boston " ' is the citadel of pro-Chinese Communist liberals . They wo n't give you a hearing . ' But he was wrong . " It has been my pleasant experience to find that these advisers were quite wrong . I have been here in . Boston half a ' dozen times and have been treated with the greatest courtesy , " he added . This afternoon , the Ambassador spoke to a luncheon meeting of the Women 's Republican Club of Massachusetts on the role of women on Formosa . " I would be deceiving you if I told you that the status of women in Taiwan is as fortunate as that of women in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you , " Mr. Tong commented . But he explained that the Chinese women exert " tremendous power " in their society . Important Roles Played " The Chinese male , " he went on , " has long accustomed himself to the loss of most of his authority as soon as he passes the threshold of his home . Although the idea may seem strange , I think the important status of Chinese women is strikingly borne out . by the abundance of stories about henpecked husbands in China . " For Mr. Tong , the rising status of women in China has been a " welcome event . " " Chinese women live and work side by side with men . They play an important role in our government . . . . They have become lawyers , judges , journalists , college presidents , professors , social workers , artists , doctors , and whatnot . " Their scope of activities , " he concluded , " could never have been visualized by their grandmothers or even ; heir mothers . " On the same platform with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent Roman Catholic churchmen . Both had something to say about Communist China and its oppression of their church , and the link between Communist China and the Soviet Union . The Most Rev. Richard J. Cushing , Roman Catholic Arch bishop of Boston , said the idea that Communist Chinese leaders Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai , or other Chinese leaders , " can be weaned from the Kremlin is an illusion of the most dangerous character . " The Archbishop said that " through many years of defeat , the Chinese party has never wavered in its loyalty to Moscow . " For Archbishop Cushing , the current discussion of trade with Communist China is " dangerous . " " It will , " he said , " open the door for recognition . Hence the constant campaigns conducted by the Soviet powers to bring pressure on us and other nations to let down trade barriers . " The Roman Catholic bishop of Nanking , the Most Rev. Paul Yu-pin , echoed the remarks made by Archbishop Cushing.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
