txt Republican leaders are mov , lag swiftly to unite their factionsplit forces in the Massachusetts Senate to block Senator John E. Powers ( D ) of Boston , Senate minority leader , from turning the GOP split to Democratic advantage . GOP chieftains arc eager to bring Senator Newland H. Holmes ( R ) of Welmouth , new Senate president , and Senator Philip A. Graham ( R ) of Hamilton , leader of the anti-Holmes GOP faction , together to form a solid GOP majority to block any Powers maneuvers for Senate control . Senator Holmes 's election as Senate president through a coalition of 5 Republican and 15 Democratic Senators is the cause of the GOP split . Senator Graham lost the presidency even though he won the vote of the Republican majority caucus and polled 16 Republican votes on the Senate floor . The Holmes supporters generally were the Senate Old Guard Republican group , while Senator Graham attracted generally the " young Turks " plus new members . Senator Holmes moved toward GOP unity today when he said he now plans to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tradition . He explained that for years he has felt that with the party division so close in the Senate and with Democrats numerically dominating joint committees through Democratic House control , Democratic senators should have some of the joint committee chairmanships . However , he added that " some people feel differently about it , so my plan now is to appoint only Republican chairmen . " Redistricting Barrier It is known that some GOP leaders have cautioned Senator Holmes that a departure from custom would be interpreted by some persons as the price paid for Democratic support for the presidency . Senator Holmes today renewed his insistence that he made no deal with Senator Powers for Democratic votes . Furthermore , he classed as " fantastic " any thought that he would go along with h Democratic plans to redistrict House and Senate seats . When the Republicans held onto their 21 to 19 Senate margin in the Nov. 6 election to prevent a Democratic sweep of the governorship , the House and Senate , the Senate became the one barrier against Democratic plans to force through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some observers ' had interpreted the GOP split over the y.residencv as opening a wedge which might lead to passage of a Democratic redistricting plan . However . Senator Holmes made it clear today he will stand in the way of any such move . Another GOP leader outside the Legislature expressed the firm conviction that no redistricting plan would be adopted , that the 21 GOP Senators would stand firm on this issue regardless of their feelings on other measures . Statement Confirmed Senator Holmes also disputed contentions that by receiving the $10,400 salary paid the president of the Senate he will reap a big pension harvest when he retires . He said the salary , double that of the rank ?  - -  I file legislator , would actu. give him only about four t. liars a week more in pension , based on his contribution , if he retired . State pension authorities confirmed the Holmes statement . They pointed out that on the basis of his 32 years ' service , Senator Holmes , now 65 years of age , would qualify for a pension of 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ' service , plus 2 per cent a year for each additional year over 20 years plus 40 per cent of his contributions into the pension system on that part of his salary above $5,000 . His total pension would thus be $3,916 a year , or $216 more than if his salary were only the $5,200 a year paid rank-and-file members , if he retires after two years ' service as president . Republican leaders seeking to unite GOP forces after the presidency fracas arc hopeful of preventing a situation similar to that which developed in 1935 when Senator James G. Moran ( R ) of Mansfield won the presidency in a 21 to 113 Republican Senate , with ' the votes of the 19 Democrats , another Republican , and himself . After that election , which ended a long deadlock , Democrats assumed working control of the Senate . Senator Holmes insists such will not be the case this year , that no deals have been made and that his votes will be strictly Republican .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
