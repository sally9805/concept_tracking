EX-PRODIGY : MY CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH ( 309 pp ) - Norbert Wiener-Simon &; Schuster ( $3.95 ) . <P> At seven , Norbert Wiener was already interested in chemistry and physics , so his college-professor father set up a small laboratory for him in their home in Cambridge , Mass . But since Norbert was not the kind of lad to lose himself in sterile specialization , he also looked into zoology botany-particularly into " structure and the problems of growth . " It soon became clear that little Norbert was a scientific prodigy , one of the most brilliant ever to appear in the U.S. At nine he entered high school ; at eleven he was enrolled at Tufts College , a dumpy little boy with thick glasses who found the classroom seats disconcertingly large . <P> Ex-Prodigy is Norbert Wiener 's memoir of his difficult years as a child genius . Now a mathematics professor at M.I.T. and a pioneer in the development of machines to do the work of men ( Cybernetics-TIME , Dec. 27 , 1948 ) , he has written a book that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the recollections of such other youthful prodigies as John Stuart Mill and Samuel Butler . <P> Fool ! Donkey ! Ass ! " Papa Wiener was a character in his own right . Omnivorous scholar , fanatical Tolstoyan rigid vegetarian , amateur farmer and heterodox Slavic philologist , Bialystok-born Leo Wiener was an austere and aloof yet somehow lovable paterfamilias . Papa was dissatisfied with ordinary schools and instructed Norbert personally until the boy went to high school . Papa , a good teacher was also an irascible man , and whenever Norbert stumbled , there would come streaming down upon him a flood of invective in German : " Fool ! Donkey ! Ass ! " <P> Even when Norbert started going to school , the parental tyranny continued . <P> At this time , in addition to teaching his regular classes at Harvard , papa had undertaken to translate 24 volumes of Tolstoy in 24 months , and in the evenings , while scribbling furiously and peering into proofs , he would hear out Norbert 's lessons . And though he was listening with only half an ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes . <P> Inevitably , little Norbert turned out to be something of an infantile monster . Once , when a Latin tutor annoyed him , he turned the garden hose on the fellow . Another time , when his parents sent him to a Unitarian Sunday school to give him some contact with other children , little Atheist Norbert got into debates with the minister on the existence of God .
