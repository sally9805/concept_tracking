Auto-insurance rates , which have risen sharply since World War II , appear to be on the way down . Rates have soared because 1 ) courts have been handing out sky-high judgments in accident cases ( TIME , Aug. 27 , 1951 et seg. ) and , 2 ) the accident rate itself , notably among young drivers , has gone up alarmingly ( 28% of all drivers involved in fatal auto accidents in 1951 were under 25 ) . But as the rates went up , independent auto-insurance firms began cutting their rates and snatching business from the large companies . Last week a number of big companies got ready to meet the competition by concentrating on the worst traffic offenders of all : young drivers . <P> The Mutual Insurance Rating Bureau , which represents some 30 companies , filed new " preferred risk " rate schedules in eleven Midwest and western states . Adults who drive less than 7,500 miles a year will get a 20% rate cut ; parents who keep their youngsters ' part-time driving down to 25% of the yearly mileage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young drivers who take out their own policies arid have no parental supervision will get a 30% hike in rates . <P> Chicago 's Allstate Insurance Co. , a Sears , Roebuck subsidiary and third largest of the independents , also chopped its rates . Premiums on cars driven by high-school youths in 44 states will be shaved 15% , provided each youngster completes an auto safety course of 30 classroom hours and six hours behind the wheel ( while more than 6,000 of the nation 's 25,000 high schools offer such courses , only 350,000 of the 2,000,000 students who come of driving age each year take them ) . <P> Said Allstate President Calvin Fentress Jr. , " If we are honestly interested in making our streets and highways safer , then we must see to it that more and better driver-training programs are installed in our secondary schools . . . There is only one man who sets automobile insurance rates-the man behind the wheel . "
