Cosmopolis , Wash. , which became a ghost town in the mid- ' 20 's when loggers cut the last stand of nearby virgin fir , was coming back to life last week . Roaring through the long-silent streets , construction gangs completed the main building of a $20 million plant in which Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. will next year turn second-growth timber into pulp products . <P> Cosmopolis is only one of many logged-out forest towns throughout the U.S. where lumber companies are stirring into new life , inspired by the technological changes that have put the long-depressed forest industry up among the nation 's fastest-growing industries , along with oil and chemicals . Woodsmen have learned that lumber is among the least of the tree 's end products . The industry now squeezes marketable products from as much as 75% of the tree v. 30% in 1935 . It has developed more than 4,000 wood derivatives , which are being used in an ever-widening range of products from asphalt shingles to vanilla ice cream . <P> Fast Grower . Plywood , for example , is the fastest-growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors and do-it-yourself buffs who are nailing up 4.8 billion sq . ft. of plywood a year , plywood sales have increased 20% faster than even those of the booming aluminum industry in the past 15 years . Manufacturers have also pioneered a host of new products , from low-priced particle board , made of chips and shavings , to weatherproof , plastic-coated plywood and porcelain-faced colored panels ( choice of nine ) for bathrooms or exterior remodeling . The biggest push for wood products , in an era of self-service selling , comes from U.S. industry 's heightened awareness of eye-catching packaging , and a wide range of new products , e.g. , wet-proof , rodentproof , flameproof paper bags are now widely used instead of drums , fiberboard cartons in place of wooden crates . So great is the demand for paper and fiberboard containers that many big manufacturers , e.g. , Crown Zellerbach , have had to ration some products . <P> In 1956 , lumbermen will pry valuable industrial products from more than 2 billion bd. ft. of left-over wood ( enough for 200,000 homes ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Million in Chips . The forest industries have been forced to branch into new products as per-capita lumber consumption has dropped ( down to 256 bd. ft. in 1955 from 504 in 1904 ) and timberland prices soared ( up as much as 1,700% in 18 years ) . Many companies have also diversified to make full use of their tim ber reserves , e.g. , western alder , long bypassed when redwood and Douglas fir forests were logged solely for lumber , is now widely cut for wood pulp . <P> At the same time , the small , one-product companies that once ruled the woods are yielding to corporate Paul Bunyans . To make the most of every shaving and splinter , lumber companies are branching into paper and pulp production ; paper companies are pushing into lumber manufacture . Georgia-Pacific Corp. , No. 2 plywood producer ( after U.S. Plywood ) , recently broke ground for a $20 million pulp and paper mill at Toledo , Ore . Georgia-Pacific President Owen Cheatham , who has increased the company 's timber reserves and cutting rights 1,000% since 1953 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood chips we sell to paper companies each year into a $10 million paper business .
