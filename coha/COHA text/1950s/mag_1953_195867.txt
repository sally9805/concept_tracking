For Old Soldier Douglas MacArthur , the job of presiding over the annual meeting of Remington Rand in Buffalo , N.Y . last week was his first such assignment since becoming chairman of the board last July . MacArthur soon found his position under fire from a brash stockholder named Lewis D. Gilbert , who claimed to represent 3,800 shares , and makes a business of heckling at annual meetings ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) . <P> Spokesman Gilbert , a World War II Army corporal , stood up to say that he was " seriously concerned " because MacArthur held no Remington stock . " We think . " said Gilbert , " that all directors , including the distinguished American who is presiding , should own stock . " General MacArthur snapped : " Will you sit down ? " Gilbert sat down . <P> MacArthur then explained that the company 's bylaws do not require its officers to own stock . " I wish to state , " he added , " that I am an employee of the company and its servant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate as you , Mr. Gilbert . Such money as I am able to invest I have placed in defense bonds to help protect our beloved country . What I do with future funds is neither your business nor that of anyone else . " The 70 stockholders in attendance applauded . <P> Almost completely routed , Gilbert reformed for a final thrust . Noting that Remington 's annual report gave MacArthur 's salary as $45,533 and not $100,000 as the press had estimated , Gilbert asked : " What happened to the rest of it ? " That , said the general , was all there was ; the rest was " newspaper talk . " At meeting 's end , MacArthur thanked the stockholders for coming , singled out Spokesman Gilbert for an individual citation . Said the general : " It constitutes democracy when we do n't agree on everything . "
