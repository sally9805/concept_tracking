The rumble of discontent in the bleak , brown Rif mountains of northern Morocco ( TIME , Dec. 22 ) grew so loud that King Mohammed V and his politicians in Rabat could no longer ignore it . Last week gunshots , artillery fire and rocket explosions echoed through the Rif in the most serious challenge to the King 's authority in the three years of Morocco 's independence from France . <P> At first , the uproar had not seemed much more than the complaining of a few free-spirited tribal chiefs aroused by the tax collectors . A Royal Commission sent out from the capital in Rabat reported that the trouble was mainly economic and social-the tribesmen felt they were being treated like poor relations by the " city slickers " in the government . But privately , they warned that the problem was serious . Tribal leaders were " in touch " with the Algerian rebels , and spoiling for trouble . Their quarrel , insisted the tribesmen , was only with the politicians , not with King Mohammed . <P> The King could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rebels , and Moroccan air force planes showered reprints of the speech on the mountain slopes . Using the term " mutiny " and quoting from the Koran to warn of " cruel punishment " to come , the King gave the dissidents 48 hours to come down from the hills and surrender . <P> Some came out waving white flags of surrender . But in the Rif , warriors in brown and grey djellabahs , armed with old German Mausers and French muskets , swept down from the hills , cut the muddy coastal road leading to the city of Tetun , surrounded a royal army barracks near the port of Alhucemas and seized an airport near by . <P> The King moved 20,000 troops-two-thirds of Morocco 's army-into the hills , under the command of his son Crown Prince Moulay Hassan , 29 . He sent tanks and artillery against rebel roadblocks and used six rocket-firing Morane jet trainer planes against rebel holdouts . <P> In one day 's clashes , 150 rebels and 60 royal soldiers were killed .

Commercial aircraft of Royal Air Maroc were pressed into service to transport supplies , despite the protests of the French pilots who were forced to fly them . <P> The siege around Alhucemas was relieved , the airfield recaptured , the road to Tetun reopened . On a visit to Tetun last week , new Leftist Premier Abdallah Ibrahim borrowed a phrase from France 's famed pacifier of Morocco . Marshal Lyautey : " The government had to show force to avoid using it . " <P> Actually , the government was using , as well as showing , force . Some Moroccan leaders dramatically likened the trouble in the Rif ' ' to the U.S. in 1860 . " Explained one : ' ' We must preserve the union . Central authority must be imposed .
