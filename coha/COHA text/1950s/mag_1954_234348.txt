Indiscretion of an American Wife ( Vittorio de Sica ; Columbia ) takes the moviegoer far across the sea to " the Eternal City of Culture , of Legend , and of Love . " The customer is set down in Rome 's bareboned , modern Stazione Termini . About him lies all the grandeur that was Rome , but he never gets out of that railroad station . And whether it be in the City of the Caesars or at the switchtrack in Wawa , Pa. , an hour wait between trains is an hour wait between trains . <P> In this case , the boredom is surprisingly unrelieved by the fact that Vittorio de Sica ( Shoeshine , Bicycle Thief is directing the crowd in the waiting room . Jennifer Jones is " a housewife from Philadelphia , " a mother who has taken a brief vacation from marriage .

At one point he lures Jennifer into a darkened train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home .
