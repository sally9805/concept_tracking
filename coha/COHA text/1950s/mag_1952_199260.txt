Before Adolf Hitler came to power , Berlin 's house of Ullstein was the biggest , wealthiest publishing company in Europe . It published Germany 's biggest newspaper , the Berliner Morgenpost ( circ. 600,000 ) , its biggest illustrated magazine , the famed Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung ( circ. 2,000,000 ) , and its most influential weekly , the Grne Post ( circ. 1,000,000 ) . The House of Ullstein also published three other Berlin daily newspapers , two weeklies , ten monthlies and some 2,000,000 books a year . Its headquarters occupied a city block along Berlin 's Kochstrasse , and it employed 10,000 workers , made yearly profits of some 20 million Reichsmarks ( then $6,200,000 ) a year . <P> Leopold Ullstein , a Jewish paper dealer , had started the company in 1877 when he bought the money-losing Neue Berliner Tageblatt ( circ. 4,000 ) . He put it on its feet , bought other moribund newspapers and kept expanding . After his death in 1899 , his five sons-Hans , Louis , Franz , Rudolf , Hermann-proved equally shrewd , expanded more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jew-baiting was merely campaign oratory . When they still had time to turn the tremendous power of their newspapers and magazines against the rise of Naziism , the Ullstein brothers did nothing . When Hitler came to power , it was too late . <P> Doorman into Despot . The company 's doorman turned out to be the head of 150 Nazis among the house 's employees , and soon he was telling the Ullsteins whom to hire &; fire and what to print . After all Jewish editors were fired , the Ullsteins were ordered to sell out to non-Jews . For the enterprise , easily worth $20 million , the brothers had to take about $4,300,000 from a buyer who was not named . He turned out to be Hitler himself . Soon the Nazis milked the Ullsteins of most of the $4,300,000 with trumped-up taxes , special levies , fines , etc . Hans and Louis died , and the other three fled the country-Rudolf to England , Franz and Hermann to the U.S. Ex-Millionaire Hermann came out of Germany with 10 marks ( about $3.60 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allied bombs just about demolished the Ullstein block along the Kochstrasse , but printing presses in a skyscraper near the Tempelhof airport were little damaged . They continued to pour forth Goebbels ' Das Reich and the screaming Der Angriff until the end . The Red army carted off two of the plant 's finest presses , but when the U.S. took over the sector , the remaining presses still made it the biggest printing plant in Europe . It rolled out the U.S. Army 's Allgemeine Zeitung and later five other West Berlin dailies and ten weeklies . <P> In 1949 , with all of his brothers dead , Rudolf Ullstein went back to Berlin to try to get back the property . The trouble was that the sale to the Nazis had been legal , and the city of Berlin had confiscated the plants , as it had all Nazi property . Rudolf fought on anyway , fearfully flitting in &; out of the plant to keep an eye on it , although always using the back door .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
