How lo write your name . " On the way home , Mitch and 1 had a long bus ride across the city . We chatted about scouting and business and the state of the world . When we reached a point on the route where I was to continue eastward on the same bus and he was to transfer to u northbound line , I offered to stop off and put him on the other bus . He would n't let me " put myself out . " At the great summer camp of the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind and the " cries " are accepted as a matter of course . Roy Alm , veteran scout-camp supervisor , told me they 're an asset . " Seeing what they can do spurs the able-bodied boys to greater effort . " The " trips " are by no means without the normal boys ' love of a joke , and some of their pranks hike a practical twist . One night t hey untied one end of the blind boys ' guide rope to the latrine and retied it to the tent of a dignified adult sponsor . The blind boys , known to be the card sharps of Owassippe , took their revenge by inviting the " trips , " one small group at a time , to play hearts . Chicago offers exceptional opportunities in scouting for handicapped boys . In most cities the only available troop is of the normal neighborhood variety . If the handicapped lad gets in at all , he does so on the chancy combination of the troop 's good will , the scoutmaster 's understanding and his own nerve . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with 60,000 new recruits in this category each year , the matter is of more than passing consequence . In the correspondence column of a recent issue of the scoutmaster 's magazine , Scouting , a puzzled troop leader smoked out the real issues : " The other night a new boy came to the troop and I 've been wondering what to do about him . He 's what 's known as a spastic , and a pretty pathetic rase . He gets about with great I LIKE TO FIGHT ( Coat " il from Page 25 ) night because I was sure of my ability and felt certain that I could lick Graziano . Really , if I had been capable of analysis at that moment , it was as simple as that . " So shake hands now , " the referee said finally , as Graziano and I stood face to face in the center of the ring , our handlers close behind us , " and come out fighting . " This is the only part of the referee 's instructions I remember , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the ring always seem to me to be a waste of time , as I think they mtoit appear to most people who watch fights . You know the rules and regulations as they have been discussed at the weigh-in , and now you are anything but a receptive listener . " Now box him , box him ! " Issy Kline , my trainer and chief second , was repeating to me in my corner in the difficulty , rind hard for him to talk . When Ise appeared , pulling himself awkwardly into the room and looking about uncertainly , I wont over and gave him a Handbook . He did n't look at it all evening ; his eyes were on the scouts . I could see he was fairly bursting to be out there on the floor with them . After the meeting he came up to inc and in his halting , Whoring way said he 'd be back next week . I 'll never forget the gleam in his eyes as he limped away . " I 'm as sympathetic as the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like better than to have this gutty lit tle guy in my troop . But would it he fair to put him in with the others , matching his handicap and his frailty against their volcanic normality ? On the other hand , would it be fair to burden a patrol with a member who could n't contribute his full share ? My scouts are good kids : they 'd take him in if I asked them to . But would it be right ? The more I think shout it the more I find myself trying to figure a painless way out . This thing 's got me . " Hundreds of replies urged that the boy be allowed to join . A Minnesota school superintendent wrote : " What 's the purpose of scouting ? to hike fourteen miles rather than twelve , or to practice the virtues mankind has evolved to the present day ? " A Vermonter wrote : " How can you teach a scout to be kind to dumb animals and cruel to his own kind ? " An old-timer wrote : " Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity . " A couple of issues later the puzzled scoutmaster reported : " I took him in . He had his Tenderfoot tests down pat before you could say ' square knot , ' and is well on his way to Second Class . He 's been elected Patrol Scribe and is doing a swell all-round job of scouting . " In many places the issue is resolved in exactly this happy manner . Don Lee , of Salt Lake City , legless from birth , is a ranking scout in his neighborhood troop . A Seattle scout did his fourteen-mile hike on crutches . Ronnie Saunders , of Culver City , California , who is blind , has passed his lifesavingmerit-badge lest and took his turn cooking three meals a day for thirty scouts on a camping trip . Several cities , including Oklahoma City , Van Nuys and Oakland , California , have organized radio troops for shut-in scouts . A neighborhood scout acts as " buddy " to help each shut-in. ten seconds between the buzzer and the first bell . " Box him ! Look him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graziano outweighed me by about ten pounds and is a much heavier puncher than I. I would have to be out of my mind to try to beat him at his game  --  punching  --  and my whole confidence was founded on my belief that I could make him fight my kind of fight . The bell sounded loud in my ears and I moved quickly to the center of the ring . I stuck out my right hand and jabbed hard to his head ? I am a southpaw , which means that I lead with my right foot and right arm extended . For the first time this day , perhaps for several days , I now was completely in control of myself . That is why the fight itself is one of the easier parts of being a fighter . Graziano was moving at me out of a isemicrouch ? as I knew he would from having seen him light . He lunged at . me with his jab , and I moved away from it . Now I was beginning to find I I other places the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of boys who had been enthumineti : scouts of Troop 52 , at . the Newington Home and Hospital for Crippled Children at Newington , Connecticut , while confined there for operations , and who had returned to their homes . I called them all up and asked if they 'd con. tinued scouting in their neighborhood troops . Time after Lime the shattering reply was , " I 'd certainly like to , but I have no way of getting to meetings . " As most states require registry of crippled and blind children , it 's no trick to find out where they 're living , locally . These lads  --  and lasses , for the Girl Scouts also do yeoman work in this field  --  are there , waiting . Service clubs in search of a project for the year  --  for any year  --  please copy . Since Boy Scout Week is coming up , a word about the movement in general may not , he out of place . Nearly every . body knows that scouting was introduced into this country in 1910 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the courteous help of a British Scout when he was lost in London , brought the idea home ; that the Scouts were chartered by Congress ; in 1916 , and that the President of the United States is always Honorary President . To about 20,000,000 of us , though , scouting is more than history , it is personal history . We can remember a time when it was important and exciting in a special way . It opened a new world to us  --  a world of birds and songs and wood smoke , of strange trails and recalcitrant ropes , of contrasts between our own burned potatoes and limp bacon with the easy skill of the scouts shown in the Handbook ? a world where there was a sense of standing , somehow , for something fine and permanent . We can count it one of our major national assets , I think , that we have 2,500,000 boys at least verbally committed to the notion that person is supposed to be trustworthy . helpful , friendly , courteous , kind , obedient , cheerful , thrifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good turn every day . Perhaps the scouts still have something to teach Us . Perhaps those among them who are handicapped are the finest teachers of all  --  teaching the principle that if we 're honest about our limitations , and do the best we can within them , everything will somehow come out all right . confirmation of the beliefs I held when I accepted this match . I mean by this that Graziano is not a natural jabber . He must lunge to make his jab effective . The jab that bothers you is the **25;4306;TOOLONG , lightning-fast thrust of a Ray Robinson . Then your opponent 's band may be quicker than your eye , but when he must lunge , you can see it start with his body and you can move accordingly . Graziano pressed me , trying to get away from trading jabs  --  my high cards  --  and trying to get inside . I refused to let him do it , slowing him with my jab and then hooking behind it or throwing a left when I had halted him enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept circling away from his right hand while doing these other things , and now I was certain that Issy and I had planned the perfect campaign for this particular battle . Of course , he was hitting me with some of his punches . Unless you are Milt . III knock tt man out with the first blows you I brow in ii light , it is inI  --  Vit 111111. ! hal you will he hit . I want , to loll you whet it feels like to be hit , be-4:11U144 .. I think flint o fight viewer knows leas a 1,1 m I lbis than about any other pilafs. of lighting . The good punches I hat hit you are 11w ones you do n't see . I f you saw them you would block them or move nwny from them . When I am hit , I know it only because I feel the shock to my head or hotly . A fighter does n't feel pain because he is concentrating so hard on what he is doing that all his senses are completely wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in my career , and that was in a college bout , but I think I can prove my point by describing what that was like . In t hat bout I was boxing along when suddenly I felt my seat hit the canvas . I had n't seen the punch , I felt no pain and I had no consciousness of falling until I touched the floor . A good punch on the chin or temple will , admittedly , make you feel a little giddy . A good stomach punch may bring a short , quick sensation similar to a cramp . The day after a fight , when the concentration is absent , you may Ise sore and bruised where you have been hit a good punch . However , I want to make it clear that a tight is by no means the succession of painful experiences that , I suppose , it appears to he to the viewer . In the third round of the Graziano fight , for example , one of his right-hand punches cut me over the left eye . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the small trickle of blood . The first time I was ever cut , in a fight I did n't even know what the trickle was , the cutting was so devoid of pain . " Now do n't worry about the cut , " Issy was telling me when I got back to my corner at the end of the round . " We 'll take care of it . " I was n't worried . Many people who have watched a fighter 's seconds patching him up between rounds have asked me about this . They want to know how much it hurts . Again I must say that it does n't hurt . Because of that state of nervous excitement in which you are functioning , you feel no pain when they apply the coagulant to close the cut . I know that some doctors , Dr. Vincent Nardiello , of Madison Square Garden , for one , sew up fighters without even a local anesthetic if they get them right after t hey come out of the ring . Here I should point out that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auto accident . My wife , Pat , who is a nurse and whom I married last October , and some of my doctor friends kid me about my queasiness . I have turned down invitations to watch even such simple operations Hs tonsillectomies . Yet the sight of blood in a ring does n't bother me in the least because I am able , through my own experience , to assess it rationally . By the fifth round of the Graziano tight I could feel him starting to tire . You can tell when a fighter is starting to tire because he does not keep the pressure on you so continually , and because his punching is not so quick . We had figured that this would happen , and so now I could move in more often to land solid left hands to the head or good left jolts to the body , and to halt him in his tracks . " But box this guy , " Issy was saying , lecturing me when I came back at the end of the round . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good shots , gut out of there . Tim t 's when this guy is dangerous and can hurt you with one punch . " The closest , I guess , that he came to hurting me was at the end of the seventh round . He started that big right hand of his , and I was moving back . It hit me , and because I was moving with it , I was propelled toward the ropes . Right then the hell rang . In the tent h round Graziano became desperate and started filling the air with punches . Then it went through my mind that I could move in to take advantage of his wildness and land some good shots . However , I stuck to Isay 's advice . We had reasoned that we could neutralize Graziano 's best punches by moving away from them and toward my strength . As long as I did not take chances , and there was no good reason to do so , I was in no real danger . So I continued to box him and won big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officials . I have gone into this detail on the Graziano fight because I think it is an excellent answer to some of the questions that are asked of me day after day . Then there are the others : Why did I decide to become a professional prize fighter ' ? Are n't most ex-fighters punch-drunk ? Is n't professional boxing controlled by gangsters ? How can fighters who are trying to injure each other during a bout forget it all so quickly and shake hands as soon as it is over ? How long do I plan to continue risking serious injury in boxing ? There is no doubt that I am a natural target for such queries because , in addition to being described as a leading contender for the welterweight championship of the world , I also own that bachelor 's degree in physical education and that master 's degree in educational administration , both from Michigan State College . The presumption is thus that I am better equipped than most fighters to give the answers . I respect these questions because , believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my mind on a professional career . I doubted , for one thing , my ability to succeed . My preconceived notions of the " tight game " were much the same as those of the average person , and derived from much the same sources  --  motion pictures , fight fiction and the criticism to which boxing is so often subjected in newspapers . I was honestly afraid of getting a had name through association with professional boxing if it were as bad as I had been led to believe . You see , I also had to consider my family , and whether my entry into prize fighting would occasion what I might call a loss of face for them . By that I mean only that my father , John Davey. who works in the plant-protection department of the Ford Motor Company , has a degree from the Detroit College of Law . My mother is a graduate of the University of Michigan . My brother , John , who is two years older than I , is a graduate of the University of Detroit and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years younger , has a civil-engineering degree from Michigan State . My sister , Margaret , a year younger than I , left the University of Michigan after three years to merry an aeronautical engineer . You can see the problem that my becoming a professional tighter presented to a family like this . " Who 'd have thought , " an old friend commented to my parents recently , " that you would rear a prize fighter ' ? " I am sure such a thought never entered their minds when I was born twenty-six years ago . I grew up in Dearborn and Detroit nailprel ty nor-mill kid who wanted to he n big-league ballplayer , who made the tennis teem in high school , but alto was different , I guess , in one romped. , I was always small for my age . When you 're small the bigger kids naturally pick on you , and as I have a lot of pride and a quick temper , I had my share of neighborhood scraps . I think the small-man complex must have been a motivating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that I was as good Hsi , or better than , those bigger than myself . When we played sand-lot baseball , for example . I always played as hard as I could to win . Even today , when I play an occasional game of bridge , I hate to lose . One of the reasons I picked Michigan State , after my graduation from high school in 1942 , was that it had a boxing team . I weighed only 125 pounds then , and boxing is one sport where you compete with men of your own size . In college I had good coaches  --  Al ' Sawa ! , Lou Zarza and George Makris . By the time I graduated , in June of 1949 , my formal education having been interrupted while I was in the Air Force from 1943 until 1946 , I was undefeated in thirty-four college fights . had become the first and , so far , the only fighter to win four National Collegiate Athletic Association championAhipa . I had three times been awarded the John S. LaRowe trophy , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , and I had also been a member of the 1948 Olympic team and enjoyed a fine trip to London . I mention this record only to show why I felt I might be good enough to turn pro . It was not until the fall of 1949 that I took the step , but , looking back , I guess it was inevitable . I recall that as a junior in college I considered the move , and in my final year I did n't look fora job , ex almost all the otherseniors MUM doing . So I must have had my mind made up nil along . Then why was it . such a difficult decision ? It was difficult because a fighter has a responsibility not only to himself but else to his family and friends . I do n't suppose the general public is aware of it , but this is n burden a lighter carries into the ring with him every time he tights . In the year or more I was considering the question , I never once sat down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mot her felt from hits of conversation . I knew her opinione and was a ! raid of them , so I never actually talked about the problem in an effort to mettle it . Now that I am in professional boxing I realize my decision was a selfish one . Now that I can see the anxiety it causes those close to me , I realize bow completely preoccupied with myself I was when I made my choice . My mother never goes to my fights , but she does watch them at home when they are on television . My brothers who have sat with her tell me that , as worried as she is about me during a fight , as soon as it is over and I have won  --  and this amuses and pleases me  --  she starts feeling sorry for my opponent . I appreciate the fact that neither my mother nor my father tried to dissuade me , and I shall never forget them before my first pro fight . It was scheduled for six rounds at the Arcadia , in Detroit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave , and my dad was going with me . We Mood in the entrance foyer . " God love you . " my mother said , putting her arms around me and hugging me , " I 'll pray for you . " Many of my best friends tried to talk me out . of turning pro . They told me about crooks and gangsters in boxing . They talked about the chance I was taking of being hurt . They told me that I was a good amateur , but that I would never make it as a pro . That was a mistake . That stung my pride . I wanted to prove to everybody that 1 could win as a pro . My first impressions inside professional boxing were not favorable . I was appalled by the gymnasiums . At Michigan State t hey have one of the finest boxing gyms in the country , clean , well ventilated and with the best - equipment . It took me quite a while In gel used to the grim gray aspect of professional gyms , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters . I shall never forget , either , the day in New York in the summer of 1949 when I walked for the first time into Still-man 's , the most famous fight gym in the world . I had never seen so many lighters in my life . I had not yet turned pro and still was n't sure of my ability to succeed . My first reaction was that there were just too many fighters . When I went back to Detroit , I started lo work out . at the Williams Gym on Woodward Avenue . One day the temperature was zero outside and there was no heat in the gym . However , it was at the Williams Gym that I began to learn other things about the fight game . I got to know professional lighters for the first time , and found that I liked them and the general environment . As I started to get fights , the newspapers began playing up the fact that I am a college grad and that I was working on my master 's degree at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fighters might resent me. did n't try to snow anybody under with my vocabulary , though , and they did n't make me out as different from anyone else . THE 1:1111t11 , Vf EVENING POST wary 7 . Pra I mousse I hill iis.rs as ii Whitt IN.I W04,11 all lighters . On the Olympic team , for example , I noticed Ilint we lightens were a closes-knit group than even the team-sport 11101 . When I turned pro , although t he nee-millirem were WI t ing me apart , I still was , to the other fighters , a tighter . Fighters respect one another because they know what : ill go I'm-nigh before and during lights . Fighters feel a kinship even for the men they 're lighting . Sometimes on t he afternoon of n bout I 'll be sitting in a room , waiting , and I 'll be saying to myself , Here I am , stveating this out . Then I think of the man I nm going to tight , sitting in another room somewhere , and I say , There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconstrue a lighter 's attitude during a light . When I 'm fighting , my mind is n't on hurting the other man . I think of besting him , as in a tennis match . When he hurts me I do n't resent it , because the hurt is merely a by-product of his effort to outdo me . The idea of hurting an opponent is as secondary to me as it is to a football player throwing a block or making a tackle . At the end of a hard tight you will see fighters throw their arms around each other or , at least , shake hands . That brings up the question I am so often asked , " Do you really mean it when you shake hands at the end of a fight ? " Yes , you do . Very few fighters are good actors , and the feeling they express at the end of a fight is genuine . You 're glad the fight is over , but there is also that something between you and the other man . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked him down several times and he 'd taken a good pasting , I admired his courage when the time came to shake hands . If I know anything about a person 's reactions , he did n't feel the slightest hit of animosity toward me . I think that what they say about bullfighting is true about boxing . The only animal is the crowd . I had my first professional fight on October 10 , 1949 , in the Arcadia , in Detroit . Although I managed to knock out my opponent in the second round , few fighters ever had such a rugged introduction to professional boxing . In the main event , which I watched from ringside that night , Talmadge Bussey , a Detroit lightweight , suffered head injuries from which he died in a hospital the next day . I knew Bussey . I had boxed with him in the gym , and he was a friendly guy and I liked him . Of course , his death disturbed me , and I thought about it a good deal . The newspapers were asking if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself that if this was the punishment you had to take in the game , it was n't for me . Three weeks later , however , I was back in the Arcadia for my second fight . " But when you know what may happen in a ring , " people ask me , " how can you go on fighting ? " While I was overseas in the Air Force I did n't fly on a lot of missions , but I did get in a half dozen over France and Germany as navigator of a B-24 . I was as nervous as anyone else , but I never really thought I would be one of those who would never come back . I think a fighter feels and thinks like a soldier going into combat . If the soldier hears a rumor that casualties in this action may reach as high as 80 per cent , he immediately starts feeling sorry for the other four out of five fellows . He does n't think it is going to happen In hint . Furl herinorn , the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly exaggera in public mind . Football and sonic other sports claim more victims than boxing , but boxing deaths make bigger headlines . My manager is Her Knowles , n Chicago salesman and sports fan , and the man he obtained to train me , Issy Kline , is one of I he country 's best trainers . These are men who , I am sure , hove my best interests in heart . Once I have signed for a light , I do n't think much about my opponent , I um interested to know such things as whether he loops a right hand or whether he crowds you or likes to box at a distance . However , my thoughts are basically on myself and on getting into shape . I have that tremendous responsibility not only to myself but to my family and friend " ' and to all those other people who are pulling for me . When a lighter is in training he could easily become neurotic . If I sneeze twice I 'm afraid I 'm catching a cold . If one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fighter is like a man with a speedboat who has the motor tuned to perfection and listens for every lit Ile sound that it makes . A fighter worries more about injuries in the gym than about injuries in a fight . If you get hurt in a fight you get paid , even if the light does n't go one round . If you 're hurt in the gym you are the one who loses money . As the fight approaches , you get tired of hearing everybody around you talk about it . The people who bother you are the ones who say , " Do n't worry ; you 'll take this guy easy . " They mean well , but perhaps at that point what you want more than assurance is understanding . You say to yourself , What are they talking about ? They do n't understand . At the weigh-in on the day of the fight , I 'm playing a part , trying to give the impression that I 'm completely relaxed . At first I was ashamed of my inward nervousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in The Saturday Evening Post in which Ray Arcel , who has worked with more world champions than any other man , said that almost all fighters exhibit some degree of nervousness and that the best fighters are the ones who do . This reassured me , and it has been borne out by my own experiences . I 've seen fighters relaxed in the dressing room who went out and lost because they did n't fight up to the peak of their abilities . It is scientifically true that a little nervousness is a good thing because it increases the flow of adrenal secretion . This acts as a stimulant , attuning the senses and increasing the speed of reaction . The old-timers say that when you stop getting nervous , it 's time to stop fighting . Your reaction toward your friends and family is a peculiar thing too . In my dressing room I 'll show nervousness in front of friends , but when a stranger comes in I 'm all unconcern . If I 'm around my parents ' home the day of a fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I say to myself , I do this to the people I love . I would n't do it to strangers . What 's llw matter with me ? In the dressing room I 'm like n caged lion . I 'm tensed up . Then ell of a ' sudden I feel tired rind weak . I remember once when I was lighting a preliminary in the Chicago Stadium , I had that tired , listless feeling . I noticed another preliminary boy sitting over in a corner , and he seemed completely at ease . I was wondering what kind of man this could he . Just then he stood up , and I had to smile to myself . - Man , " ho said , yawning , " I 'm tired . I do n't know why I always feel tired before every fight . " You get up to ' shadowbox rind you do n't feel like it . You have to force yourself . Again you say , " Why did I have to be a lighter ? It ca n't he worth it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davey , you 're on . " This is it . You have to get that determined feeling , as when you must go to the dentist or have an operation . You simply make up your mind to do it . All this nervousness is n't fear . It 's more anxiety . As I said , you 're not afraid of being hurt . It is just that every fight is so important to you in your career that you are apprehensive about doing your best . It is the same kind of nervousness I used to feel in college before an important exam or before being called on in a public-speaking course . Now comes that long walk down to t he ring . You have now built yourself up to a pitch , and you want to get into that fight . You 're oblivious of the crowd , although occasionally I will recognize a friend who shouts at me , and yet you can sense the crowd . You can feel the tension in it , and it becomes a part of you . Even while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was punishing Ike Williams with left hands to the body and head in the fifth round before the referee stopped the fight , I could sense the crowd rising to it . While I was fighting Graziano I could actually pick out the voices of a couple of friends , and I could hear them hollering . " Jab ! Move ! " Occasionally during a clinch your eyes will even focus on someone you recognize . In a fight I had with Johnny Brown in Chicago , Brown hit me with a good right on the chin in the fourth round and I grabbed . There at ringside I saw a man who professed to be a rooter of mine , his eyes big and mouth open , shouting for Brown to knock me out . I beat Brown in eight rounds , but I must say this sort of animalism is disturbing . Ike Williams , the former lightweight champion , was the first really big-name fighter I fought . I boxed him in the Chicago Stadium on March 26 , 1952 . I respected him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to meet a famous fighter , you ca n't quite picture yourself in there with him . Then in training you develop a positive attitude , so that you just think of him as an opponent by the time the fight starts . I knew he had a good jab and was a terrific alien puncher , but I managed to keep ahead of him from the start . What I remember best was his dead-pan expression . Even when I had him hurt in the fifth round , I could n't tell a thing from his face . That made me realize for the first time that you usually look for some sign in your opponent 's face . When the referee stopped the fight , with Williams helpless , there was still no expression in that face . " How about dirty fighters ? " I um asked . " There must be some , " Yes , there must he some , but I ca n't say I 've ever fought one . The occasional butt or thumb I 've received were , I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might he called n dirty fighter was mild , and early in my career . This opponent kept Haying things like , " You ca n't hit . Who told you you could fight ? " He even curies me , but I realized that these were jut Tactics intended to rattle me . When we shook hands after that fight , I think we 1 both meant ifs When you are a professional fighter , whether or not you have college degrees , people look nt you with a certain umount of suspicion . Because a number of my fights have been telecast as . tionally ? it was reported that the Graziano fight was watched by ap . proximately 26,000,000 viewers-1 find I am recognized on the streets even in cities where I have never been before . Consequently I , like any fighter , have to be on guard at all times . If my heel slips off a curb or I slur a word  --  and even radio announcers do that es . casionally ? this may be interpreted as a result of ring punishment . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people may assume there is something wrong with his mental faculties . That is because there has been so much exaggerated talk about punch-drunkenness . I 've only seen one or two fighters who talked thickly or acted as if they might have been affected by punches . For all I know , they may always have been that way . Similarly I often wonder how many people may think I 'm being soiled by contact with the underworld . In gyms I 've had one or two men pointed out as gangster 's . I do n't know whether they were or not , because they looked just like anyone else . All I know is that they have had no part in my career , and that I have had to win every fight in the ring . I believe that 99 per cent of all professional fights are honestly waged . I have said that I am fighting for the money and for whatever reputation I can make that may help me in a later career . I also think fighting is a means of self-expression . Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many men do , to take s punch at someone who jostles me in a crowd or otherwise exhibits bad behavior . I never have tharu  --  ge , and I doubt if many other professional fighters do . Very few pro fighters ever become involved in street fights . The answer is partly , of course , that you would chance injury and get bad publicity . Basically , though , I think it is because we fighters do n't feel any need to prove ourselves in street fights . Not long ago a friend in Oscoda , Michigan , where my family has a summer cottage , remarked about this to my mother . " I used to think Chuck was real cocky , " he said , " but since he 's become a fighter he does n't seem to be that way any more . " I plan to stay in fighting as long as I can continue to make money without being hurt . I look forward to meeting Kid Gavilan for the welterweight title , and I expect to beat him . Naturally . what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . Every fight is more important than the last one , My view 's on being a professional lighter can beat be wrapped up in my answer to another question . This is the one I am asked over and over again by well-meaning people who arc really trying to tell me to give up pro boxing . " Look , Chuck , " they say , " if you had a son , would you want him to be a professional fighter ? " " Yes , " I Ray , " if he could fight well enough . " I think I fight well enough .
