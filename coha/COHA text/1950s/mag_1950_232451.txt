CHARLES DICKENS AND EARLY VICTORIAN ENGLAND ( 308 pp. ) -R . J. Cruikshank-Chanticleer ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> It may be legal to call a man a Victorian , but it is always safer to say it with a smile . No word in the language is so pointed a synonym for pious smugness and stuffy taste . Victoria became Queen in 1837 , died in 1901 . During the course of her long reign the British Empire reached the peak of its prestige and power ; for much of it the English working classes lived at a level close to brutishness . It was a time of tremendous literary output when many of the great English novels were written , but in 1844 one-third of all English bridegrooms and nearly half of the brides were unable to write their names in the marriage register . A proper lady dared not sew on a button on Sunday , but Queen Victoria , assured by an evangelical lady in waiting that once in paradise she could converse with David , King of Israel , coldly replied : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet . " <P> Robin Cruikshank , liberal editor of London 's News Chronicle , is plainly fascinated by the Victorians and is n't afraid to speak up for them . In Charles Dickens and Early Victorian England he frankly admits their most irritating faults : " Above all , they lack charm . . . They were , on the whole , Philistines , they were , in the mass , barbarians . They could be brutally insensitive to women , children , servants and artists . . . They left their descendants some damnable inheritances . . . " But Author Cruikshank would n't dream of disowning his Victorian background : " Who , in the end , can escape his father and grandfather ? " <P> Author Cruikshank 's title is a casual misnomer for a readable , informed but casually thrown together book . Its promise is interesting and original : to use the novels of Charles Dickens as a reference ground Dickens ' for contemporaries , Cruikshank 's especially comments on the great novelist 's collection of lower-middle-class men aspiring to the solid comforts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medley of disconnected chapters on the Victorian mind and man ners that gets farther &; farther away from Dickens and his world and finally distances him altogether . <P> What it does on the way , with the help of illustrations that often speak more directly than the text , is to catalogue the extremes of greed and generosity , piety and hypocrisy , good humor and smugness that were the bench marks of an epoch . <P> The Bishop of London might go over railway statistics hoping to prove that the Almighty decreed more crashes for Sunday travelers . Proper people might be certain that " Time was money ; amuse ments were sinful . " But Author Cruikshank , taking the long view of history , is also aware that in two world wars the " piled-up richesof the Victorians were prodigally spent . . . that the grand children might live at all .
