( Continued from Page 33 ) on brief trips have ranged further than 1 across this vast country . But none has had the unique advantage of following the day-to-day developments of the Peking government 's policy during so decisive a period . l saw Chairman Mao 's " hundred flowers " bloom , droop and suffer relentless uprooting. l watched the exodus of some of the millions of the government 's critics , who were shipped from the cities to farms , mines and quarries in China 's biggest purge in six years . 1 was in Peking when Nikita Khrushchev slipped in unobtrusively for a secret four-day visit . 1 witnessed the " spontaneous " mass demonstrations to denounce the landing of United States Marines in Lebanon and to celebrate the bombardment of Quemoy . I heard the first rumblings of discontent at the creation of the " people 's communes , " which are swiftly reducing China 's peasants to the status of wageless serfs . It was a snowy December morning in 1957 when I first arrived in Peking . As soon as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1250-mile overland journey from Hong Kong , hurried to the Foreign Ministry . Soldiers in the drab khaki uniform of the " People 's Liberation Army " stood guard at the entrance to the gray-brick office block . In the surrounding park , officials were playing basketball  --  by order of Chairman Mao , who insists that all desk workers take fifteen minutes of organized exercise daily . An usher , wearing the blue cotton boiler suit which is the officially favored uniform of all Chinese workers of both sexes , showed me into the reception room . There I had my first encounter with Mrs. Chen Wei , who was to be my official guardian throughout my stay in China . For our first meeting Mrs. Chen had doffed her blue overalls in favor of a drab brown skirt and jacket . She had been responsible for supervising the activities of visiting western reporters for the past year , ever since the departure of her husband , who filled this post before her . He had been sent to the countryside " to make closer contact with the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Shanghai millionaire , has never been seen since . I introduced myself to Mrs. Chen and to Miss Chiang , her skinny secretary . Miss Chiang giggled , and the three of us sat down in deep leather armchairs to exchange pleasantries while the usher served hot green tea . I remarked that I felt a great responsibility as the only western journalist in China with an opportunity to present a day-to-day picture of 650,000,000 people to the outside world . " I hope that American correspondents will also be able to see what is going on in your country soon , " I added . The atmosphere froze . Mrs , Chen threw me a baleful stare and said acidly , " That depends entirely on Mr. Dulles . We insist that our correspondents shall be admitted to the United States with diplomatic status . We shall not make concessions on any point regarding the honor of China . " I mentioned I had heard that an American television correspondent was planning to sail from Tokyo to Hong Kong , via Shanghai , in the hope that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese port . Mrs. Chen replied sternly , " If any American tries to sneak into China by entering our territorial waters , he will be dealt with by the law of the People 's Republic . " ( When he learned of this threat the TV man canceled his trip . ) As I rose to take my leave 1 thanked Mrs. Chen for the interview , adding , " I hope you will be able to give me all possible facilities to meet your country 's People and leaders , " Mrs. Chen did not answer . A fortnight later I was summoned to the residence of Premier Chou En-lai , bungalow on the shores of Peking 's South Lake . The sixty-year-old Communist leader , taut and muscular , received me in an entrance hall which was crowded with the big leather armchairs beloved of China 's new officialdom and separated from his private apartments by bamboo screens . When we had settled down to sip the traditional cups of tea , Chou told me he had flown back to Peking that afternoon from Anhwei Province , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Yellow River . " But next year there wo n't be any serious flooding , " said Chou . " Every day this winter one hundred million of our people arc digging ditches and building embankments to capture the rain water and irrigate the farmlands . " Chou was right ; when the waters of China 's " River of Sorrows " burst their hanks a few months later , most of the dikes built by the peasants held firm , and a record summer harvest was garnered . Chou speaks little English , but he understands the language perfectly . During our interview the premier frequently interrupted his interpreter , a journalist from the New China News Agency , to correct sloppy translation errors . Much of the two and a half hours which we spent together was dedicated to Chou 's views on the international situation . He harped on the United States efforts to keep Red China out of the United Nations and predicted eventual failure of this policy . But he found time to lecture me on how to carry out my job , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you ca n't pick up scandal and gossip . But 1 ' 11 tell you how to get stories  --  go into the factories , schools and farms and attend the discussion meetings of the workers , students and peasants . That 's how to see our democracy in action . " Chou was referring to the so-called " rectification campaign , " which Chairman Mao launched in the spring of 1957 with an invitation to " let a hundred flowers bloom and let a hundred schools of thought contend . " Many supporters of the Communist dictatorship took the invitation at face value and openly voiced their criticisms . Mao , alarmed by the outburst of discontent among China 's teachers , writers and other intellectuals , ordered a crackdown on the critics . When I arrived in Peking they were being denounced at mass rallies throughout the country . I took Chou at his word and asked Mrs. Chen if she could arrange for me to attend some of these spontaneous " rectification " meetings . Weeks passed without an answer . Then , tired of waiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatting in groups in the recreation yard , criticizing the " bourgeois " teaching methods of their instructors . Next day I was reprimanded by Mrs. Chen for " trespassing . " Premier Chou 's invitation to " see our democracy in action " remained a dead letter . The rectification movement , which , in effect , equated criticism of the regime with treason , was visible everywhere in China during 1958 . The government urged citizens to plaster the walls of the streets , factories and farms with posters denouncing the hidden enemies of Communism . Chinese youngsters told me that their teachers collapsed in the classrooms after sleepless nights spent writing posters criticizing their colleagues . Almost daily I saw crowds of miserable officials , ousted from their jobs because of their " incorrect " attitude toward Communism , huddled in the snow outside the Peking railway station . They were waiting for trains which were to take them to the countryside for " reform through labor . " My own chauffeur , thirty-seven-yearold Liu Tsu-fu , was denounced by is neighbor , apparently for the crime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any charge being lodged against him . The only news I received from Liu was this letter written from a Peking jail : Dew . hfr . Gee , Thank you for paying my wages to my mother . 1 hope this finds you as well as it leaves me . Yours sincerely , Liu . Liu was one of hundreds of thousands , possibly millions , of innocent people who were arrested and shipped off to labor camps during 1958 . Everybody lived in terror of reading his name on a wall poster or hearing it uttered at a rectification meeting . When I attended the opening of the National People 's Congress in February , I noticed about fifty empty scats . " Where are the missing deputies ? " asked an official . " They are rightists ( critics of the government ) and are under house arrest , " was the reply . A few days later 1 reported in a dispatch from Peking that Mrs. Ting Ling , the Stalin Prize winner whom many Chinese regard as their greatest living writer , had been expelled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbing floors at the headquarters of the Chinese Writers ' Union . Although Ting had been a very close friend of Chairman Mao  --  he once dedicated a poem to her  --  her fate came as no surprise to Chinese intellectuals . Similar menial punishments had been meted out to thousands of civil servants and university professors , who were set to sweeping their lecture halls and offices as a penance for criticizing China 's leaders . When I left China , Prof. Ma Ying-chu , seventysix-year-old dean of Peking University , was begging to be allowed to do farm work in order to escape further criticism and humiliation by his students , But my report about Ting touched the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the quick . Mrs. Chen screamed at me , " It 's a lie ! " 1 replied , " I am convinced of the reliability of my sources and the accuracy of my report . But I shall be delighted to publish any denial which the Foreign Ministry cares to issue . " Fuming , Mrs. Chen marched out of the room . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiao  --  New China  --  Hotel , built three years before with funds supplied by Chinese Communist sympathizers in Hong Kong and Singapore . 11 has an American bar which serves 200 types of hard liquor , including passable imitations of most western spirits , and it offers the only night life in a city of 5,000,000 inhabitants . All other bars and cafes put up their shutters at nine P.M. The Hsin Chiao 's three restaurants offer Chinese , Russian and Japanese food . The Russian fare is so poor that a foreign visitor once wrote in the hotel 's suggestion book : " A steak as tough as this would set off a counterrevolution in my country . " I occupied a combination bedroom-sitting room overlooking a new loop road . Coolies were laying this road at the Friuli:sty 21 , 1959 rate of only thirty yards a month , chanting anti-American hymns of hate while toiling twelve hours a day without mechanical aid , Further sound effects were provided by a teletypewriter which the New China News Agency had crammed into my bathroom . It clattered away day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our three-month-old daughter , Francesca , joined me in the spring , the baby 's diapers hung up to dry alongside rolls of Communist propaganda . The hotel 's other permanent residents were East German technicians , most of whom beguiled their leisure hours playing rock-'n ' - roll records  --  banned in China  --  which they had somehow imported from the United States via West Berlin . Occasionally West European businessmen came up from Hong Kong to Peking to sign contracts with the Chinese Government 's trading corporations . Chinese officials took pleasure in keeping foreign businessmen waiting weeks for an interview . Another handicap for foreign businessmen was the knowledge that Chinese trade officials read all the telegrams which they exchanged with their offices in Europe . " Offer to buy at $78 a ton , but settle for 581.50 as maximum offer , " read a cable received by one European trader . When he arrived at the Chinese trading corporation , a smiling official greeted him , " Well , comrade , so the deal is on  --  at eighty-one-fifty a ton . " Each morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. C. L. Tsiang was a sixty-six-year-old Buddhist who had been caretaker at the British Embassy in Nanking during the Chinese civil war . Richard Wang was a twentytwo-year-old graduate of Tientsin University : he worked in a room adjoining my bedroom-sitting room . By the time I had eaten breakfast they were ready with a summary of all the main news items in Peking 's morning press , My cables frequently reached my London office within half an hour of dispatch . They were never censored , but I was regularly summoned to the Foreign Ministry for questioning . Brandishing a copy of my latest dispatch , Mrs. Chen would bellow , " Where did you get this news ? Who are your informants ? I order you to confine your reports to what is issued by the New China News Agency and our newspapers . You will disobey these instructions at your peril . " To reveal the sources of my reports of the mass purges which characterized the " rectification campaign " of 1958 would have placed in jeopardy many of my Chinese friends . Some were members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Peking Government organizations . Whenever I phoned the Information Department with a query  --  for example , how many doctors is China training ? Can you explain this discrepancy in the coal-production statistics ? -1 received the stock answer , " We are not quite clear on that point . " For a while I tried to telephone directly to the ministries cor cerned , but was always referred to Mrs. Chen . There were thirty-five other foreign correspondents in Peking , all representing Communist newspapers and news agencies . Only two of them ever troubled Mrs. Chen with queries  --  they were the Yugoslays ; Pugonovic , of Tanjug News Agency , and Pugeiovic , of Borba . All the rest were content to reproduce Chinese propaganda . When the Belgrade press condemned the Chinese attacks on Marshal Tito , Pugonovic and Pugeiovic were struck off the Peking Foreign Ministry guest list for official receptions and banquets , and Mrs. Chen refused to answer their telephone calls . Even Alan Winnington , who has spent ten years in Peking as the correspondent of the London Daily Worker , lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and haggard , was accused by the British Government of torturing British troops captured by the Chinese during the Korean War ; he risks treason charges if he returns home . To eke out his income from the Communist daily , he edits the English news service of the New China News Agency , and his Eurasian wife reads English newscasts over Peking Radio . A former American journalist , Israel Epstein , who has now assumed Chinese citizenship , produces the English-language edition of Peking 's glossiest propaganda publication , the colorgravure monthly , China Reconstructs . Epstein has married a British aristocrat , who is also a convinced Communist ; they have adopted two Chinese children . The Peking Foreign Ministry never arranged press conferences , but at least once a week my telephone shrilled at three A.M. and the reedlike voice of Miss Chiang piped , " I must inform you that an important statement is to be issued in five minutes . " All over the city , reporters bundled into their cars and hurried down to the ministry . Only once did the communiqu ? justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its troops from Korea . Usually we were roused from our slumbers merely to be informed that a delegation of Rumanian agronomists was to visit China , or that a group of Chinese acrobats was to go on a tour of East Europe . In April the government launched a drive to exterminate sparrows , regarded as a threat to the grain crop then being sown . The Foreign Ministry summoned all ambassadors to tell them that Peking 's entire population of 5,000,000 would take part and they hoped the diplomatic corps would join in as well . For three days all other work stopped while men , women and children , equipped with sticks , stones , firecrackers , gongs and drums , chased the sparrows from tree to tree until the birds dropped dead from exhaustion . At the end of the slaughter government officials counted more than 420,000 dead birds . Many of them had been downed by diplomats . Only the Burmese Ambassador refused to cooperate  --  his Buddhist staff laid cages on the embassy lawns , offering asylum to the quarry . When the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ming-dynasty emperors of China , thirty-five miles from Peking , the diplomats were again asked to lend a hand . They were urged to follow the example of Chairman Mao , Premier Chou and the other leaders who worked briefly alongside 400,000 other unpaid " volunteers " to complete the project . But the only volunteer from the diplomatic corps was the ambassador of the United Arab Republic , Gen. Hassan Ragab . The handsome general , who could double for Clark Gable , put in a full day 's work at the dam , wielding pickax and shovel alongside his staff . In a speech broadcast to the other dam workers , General Ragab said , " China offered us volunteers when the French and British aggressors attacked the Suez Canal , We now repay that debt . " During 1958 , life became increasingly uncomfortable for foreigners in Peking . The Foreign Ministry cut from thirty-five miles to twenty miles the radius around the capital within which they could travel without a special permit . More than twenty cooks , butlers and janitors employed by foreign embassies were arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , but it was noted that all had worked for foreigners for thirty years or more . They were probably regarded by the Communists as inhibited by old loyalties from spying satisfactorily on their employers . Shortly after these arrests , the government decreed that diplomats could no longer hire their own servants , but must apply to a state labor agency . To combat the monotony of their isolation the diplomatic corps gave an unending round of cocktail and dinner parties , featuring the latest rumors about Chairman Mao 's impending retirement as the principal topic of conversation . Most of the food and liquor was imported from Hong Kong . Hub of the social activities of the dozen West European and Asian countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Communist China was the British Embassy . When American and British troops landed in Lebanon and Jordan , the British Embassy was besieged for three days and nights by 1,500,000 yelling demonstrators . They covered the embassy walls with posters depicting G.I. 's and Tommies as ravening wolves , crawling caterpillars , and hogs wallowing in Arab blood . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneous mass indignation , " Peking Radio gave this the lie . The network broadcast a topical play set in a youth club . Every few minutes the telephone rang and a youth leader ordered his companions : " Time for Number One group to parade outside the British Embassy .... Time for Number Two group . . . . Time for Number Three ... . " The roads around the embassy were choked with marchers bawling patriotic songs . British officials were confined to 76 T II E SATURDAY EVENTNO POST their compound . As I stood outside the embassy a Chinese reporter pointed me out to a group of young toughs and shouted , " Get that English journalist ! " I ducked inside the embassy as the youngsters leaped at me , shaking their lists . Most of the demonstrators were students on vacation . Among them I recognized the American Negro G.1. , William White , who was captured in Korea and chose to remain in Peking as a student of " international law . " I often saw White out walking with Chinese girls , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.I. , Scott Rush , of Ohio , introduced me to his Chinese wife in Wuhan , central China , where he works in a cotton mill . Rush . whose monthly wage of S20 is supplemented by a grant from the Chinese Red Cross , is eager to return to the United States , but fears he wo n't be allowed to take his wife with him . ) Nobody suffered much from the demonstration except a British tourist who was hauled off a pedicab by the mob outside the embassy . The demonstration was at last called off at the request of the Soviet Embassy . The Russians , whose mission adjoins the British , complained that they had been unable to sleep for three nights . Diplomaticcocktail parties often proved a valuable source of news for me . Aware of this , Premier Chou told the ambassadors of two non-Communist countries that he would not attend their National Day receptions if I was invited . Duncan Wilson , the British charge d'affaires , left these par-ties as soon as the senior Chinese guest began his speech of thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Some of the conversations which I heard at these receptions cast light on the relationship between China and the Soviet Union . A Scandinavian envoy , commenting on President Eisenhower 's proposal for an aerial inspection of an arctic zone to forestall sudden atomic attack on the United Slates or Russia suggested to Foreign Minister Chen Yi , " Here is an excellent opportunity for China to impress the world . Why do n't you take the initiative and support the American proposal ? " Chen shook his head and replied with unusual candor , " We always follow the Soviet line on these matters . " At the Rumanian National Day reception , on August twenty-third , after making a formal speech praising SinoRumanian friendship and attacking the West , Chen Yi joined in a few rounds of toasts in mao-rai , a high-octane Chinese liquor . Then he lumbered to his feet and called for silence . " Comrades , " he spluttered , " I have just received wonderful news . Today our valiant artillerymen have begun pounding that outpost of the United States-Chiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motherland , Quemoy . The offshore islands are about to surrender . Let us drink to this great victory . " The same evening Peking Radio confirmed that the bombardment was under way , but there was no report of the victory prematurely announced by the foreign minister . At three o'clock the next morning , however , diplomats were awakened by drums , gongs and exploding firecrackers  --  a typical Chinese celebration . They hurried into the streets , which were packed with revelers carrying banners and placards . But the slogans read : DEATH TO THE FOUR EVILS-MOSQUITOES , SPARROWS , FLIES AND RATS . KEEP CHINA HEALTHY AND FREE FROM DISEASE . The year 1958 saw more drastic changes in the life of the Chinese than at any other period since their conquest by the Communists . Scrawled on the walls of cooperative farms all over China I saw the phrase , WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE 'S COMMUNES-a ruthless device for the collectivization of human beings . To give the communes an impressive send-off , Liu Chieh-mci , a thirty-six-year-old peasant who quit a co-operative and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parable of the prodigal farmer who forsook the road to socialism , but finally saw the error of his ways . Accompanied by his plow , furniture and a wagonload of paintings and photographs representing his life before and after Communism , Liu drew daily crowds of more than 10,000 peasants . Visitors were shown the wooden bed , warm padded clothes and wrist watch which he said he could never have afforded to buy before agriculture was collectivized . In contrast , Liu produced a rice bowl , with which he claimed he had begged for food in the old days , and a whip , with which he said his landlord had beaten him . Liu told me , " I am a miserable fellow . I showed no gratitude to the party . I forgot my past hardships and criticized the policy of enforced purchase of my produce by the state . Now I realize I was selfish and behaved against the people 's wishes . Long live the People 's Communes ! Long live the Communist Party ! Long live Chairman Mao ! " But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peking , I heard a different story when I asked a young peasant , recently demobilized after war service in Korea , what he thought of the communes . He replied , " I do n't want to live in a dormitory , eat in a mess hall and have my children cared for in a communal nursery . I want my own cottage , and my wife to cook for me and bring up my sons and daughters . " An announcement of a slowdown in the creation of communes accompanied the publication , in December , of Mao 's decision to step down from the chairmanship of China . Yet in the past six months , nearly 25,000 communes have been set up , and more than 450,000,000 of China 's 500,000,000 peasants have been compelled to hand over to the state the hogs , fruit trees and household furniture which were their last remaining private property . To slow down the fast-rising birth rate ? 15,000,000 Chinese were born in 1958 , bringing the population close to 650,000,000 ? contraceptives for birth control are sold in all stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it reported that its own scheme for a simple contraceptive had failed . Shao Li-tsu , a member of the National People 's Congress , gave the masses this prescription , readily available to anybody who had a stagnant pond in his back garden : tadpoles . to be taken internally once a day after meals . The method was tried out on forty-two mothers in Hangchow . Two of the women were pregnant within four weeks and eighteen others within four months . The People 's Daily reported that the twenty-two other women had reverted to " traditional forms " of birth control . This probably meant abortion : Peking hospital records show that one woman patient out of every three is treated for abortion 's aftereffects . Despite the spate of anti-western propaganda poured out by Peking 's news media , China is increasingly receptive to western ideas . Chinese youngsters , imitating United States teen-agers , dress in brightly colored sweat shirts with the name of their school , factory or athletic team emblazoned on their chests . Peking last summer opened its first supermarket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands . When television sets first appeared in Peking stores , I tried to obtain one . " Sorry , " said the salesman , " but you 'll need a special government permit . " No Chinese could afford to buy a set , because they were priced from 5280 to 5560 , more than a year 's wages for a skilled worker . But the people of Peking flocked on two evenings a week to the Temple of Perpetual Peace , where for two cents they could watch a TV program of old Soviet documentaries and Peking opera on a Russian-made set . The Chinese people are dazed by staggering statistics which tell them they have doubled their output of food and heavy industrial goods during the past twelve months . But the worker and peasant is no better off . Only by standing in line when the butcher shops open at five A.M. can the housewife hope to obtain even a fraction of the monthly ration of eleven ounces of pork . Announcing the ration , the Communist Party 's vice chairman , Kiu Shao-chi , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the historic task of the Chinese people and are a sign of lack of noble aspiration . " The cloth ration likewise insures that the Chinese do not overdress . Cut once more for 1958 , it sufficed for only one suit of overalls , two shirts and two handkerchiefs per person . Meager rations , twelve-hour working days followed by political meetings which leave no time for recreation , a drab uniform of blue cotton , a dormitory bed , communal meals  --  all these are casting the Chinese people into a single mold in which initiative and individualism are outlawed . As Mao steps down from the chairmanshipof the People 's Republic of China , his subjects can look forward to no respite . Still chairman of the Chinese Communist Party , Mao remains the most powerful and influential of his country 's leaders . And someday , perhaps , it may be to this strange figure in Peking , not to his uneasy ally in the Kremlin , that the Communist world will turn for leadership .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
