As a test of cool driving skill and hot sports cars , Italy 's Mille Miglia ranks with the world 's toughest races . The 950-mile course-from Brescia to Rome and back - runs over the hairpin turns of four rugged mountain passes ( one so grim that it inspired some of Dante 's Inferno ) , through scores of towns and villages , and along straight ribbons of road where the racers hit it up as high as 150 m.p.h . <P> This week 's Mille Miglia drew a record 573 entries , and a big reason was the increasingly keen commercial competition among the sports-car makers of Germany , France , Italy and England . With production booming , the makers feel that the postwar sellers ' market is over , that from now on they will have to sell their cars strictly on performance . They saw the Mille Miglia as a public proving ground . <P> The Germans approached the problem with Teutonic thoroughness . They were on the scene three months in advance , going over the course again &; again , measuring gradients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars to hand-test road surfaces . Leaving little to chance , the Germans saturated the entry lists with 23 Porsches , precision-built little speedsters made up largely of Volkswagen components . Britons , noting the Germans at work , did not even bother to make trial runs . Said one Jaguar driver : " It 's a sporting event , not a scientific test . Where 's the sport if you remove the unexpected ? " <P> Putters &; Roars . The smaller classes started first . Italian Fiats ( " Little Mice " ) , French Panhards and Renaults whizzed off the elevated starting platform at 30-sec. intervals and sped away . The din shifted from putters to roars as the bigger cars streaked off in their turn . One entrant who made a rather slow start was Moviemaker <P> Roberto Rossellini , driving a 2,000 cc Ferrari ; he coasted slowly down the incline so that his personal cameraman could take pictures of his take-off ( he dropped out of the race in Rome , the halfway point ) . <P> The news of the race , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of records being smashed again &; again at every checkpoint . Ferrari Driver Gianni Marzotto , the 1950 winner , reached Verona at an average clip of 106 m.p.h . Minutes later , Verona clocked Argentina 's Juan Fangio , in an Alfa Romeo , at 106.6 . Former World Champion Nino Farina , of Turin , also in a Ferrari , raised it to 109.7 . The crowd gasped when it heard about Italy 's Consalvo Sanesi and his Alfa Romeo . His speed : 112.8 m.p.h . <P> Death &; Records . News of another kind was solemnly expected , and it was not long in coming . Two hours after the race began , Frenchman Lucien Descollanges careened off the highway in his Jaguar and his co-driver , Pierre Gilbert Ugnon , was killed . A Fiat hit an Italian youngster , who wandered on to the road , and killed him instantly . Twelve others were injured . Bloody as it was , Mille Miglia hardly compared with when a car plowed into a crowd and killed 23.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
