The spacious , air - conditioned Des Moines Veterans Auditorium was jammed with 3,000 convention delegates and 5,000 visitors last week , but the burnished-copper ashtrays stayed empty . The assembled 8,000 were American Baptists ( Northern ) , on hand for their 52nd annual convention and , as one official explained : " Some Baptists smoke , but never when they gather together like this . " <P> As president for the coming year , the delegates elected Dr. Herbert Gezork , 58 , onetime leader of the German Baptist Youth Movement who fled Germany in 1936 just before the Nazis closed in on him , is now president of Baptist-run Andover Newton Theological School . Delegates went on record against : <P> Recognition of Communist China " until such time as it proves itself worthy " ; <P> " The practice of segregation , whether in country clubs , sororities , fraternities , service clubs , organizations of property owners or cemeteries " ; <P> Public subsidy for church-controlled schools . <P> Sensation of the convention was a speech by a Southern Baptist . Dr. Blake Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , whose topic was the sorest subject in Northern Baptism - the " invasion " by Southern Baptists ( membership : 8,956,756 ) of what the American Baptists ( membership : 1,536,276 ) regard as their territory . The convention press was kept busy running off 3,000 copies of his speech , which sold at 10 each . <P> Southern Baptists , Arkansas-born Dr. Smith pointed out , have 2,600 churches in areas which 20 years ago were looked upon as Northern 's private preserve-mostly in the Midwest and the Southwest . And it is in just these areas that Southern Baptism has been growing fastest . " Although the overall gain in membership for Southern Baptists in 1958 was only 2.7% , our gains in the ' invaded ' states were from five to ten times as large as the average . " <P> Pastor Smith views the resulting friction as threatening " the unity of Baptists on this continent more seriously than the Civil War . " And he blames the cold uncharity of Northern Baptists for the situation in the first place . The 800,000-odd Southern Baptists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were wanted in the churches where they have gone . " They are simple people to whom forms and ceremonies are as strange as a foreign tongue , but they love the Lord . Have you been willing to gather with them in their home or perhaps in a crude storefront building and join with them in singing Bringing in the Sheaves , just because you love them in Christ ?
