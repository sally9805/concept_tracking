William Bergsma is an elfin-faced , cowlicked and unabashed young man who says of himself : " I first took up the violin , did n't practice . Then the viola , did n't practice that either . So I became a composer . " He has practiced that . At 29 , he has to his credit a ballet suite , Paul Bunyan , half a dozen short orchestral and choral works , and two string quartets . His second quartet , composed in 1944 , won him a blessing from New York critics , a National Institute of Arts and Letters grant , a Guggenheim Fellowship , and a job teaching composition at Manhattan 's Juilliard School of Music . <P> Last week a CBS radio audience and a hall full of experts at Columbia University 's Sixth Annual Festival of Contemporary American Music heard the first U.S. performance of California-born Composer <P> Bergsma 's first full-sized symphony . In the program notes , he set about describing it in unabashed terms : " It is not a neoclassic work ; the March is not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . What the symphony is must be heard in the music . My basic aim was a direct , varied and purposeful musical expression . That is , of course , the aim of every honest composer . " <P> What listeners heard from Conductor Izler Solomon and the CBS Symphony was honest and surprisingly modest music . As Composer Bergsma himself noted , it was " quite reasonably diatonic , " i.e. , based on traditional harmony . It also had a quiet , respectful , lyric feeling , expressed in almost Brahmsian lengths of line . It was purposeful and direct . If Symphony No. i fell short of any of its composer 's professed aims , it was in its lack of variety , either harmonic or rhythmic . Even so , grinning Composer Bergsma , sitting in the audience with his young wife " Nickie " got a nice , appreciative hand of applause for a well-made and well-intentioned first symphony . <P> His next ambitious and unabashed proj ect : an opera about San Francisco , circa 1875 . Says he : " I set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough dramatic sense to pull this off . If I do n't , I 'll find it out , and that 's that . "
