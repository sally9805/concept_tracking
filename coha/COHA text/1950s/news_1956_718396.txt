It wms the first regular working day since the termination last Saturday of a nine-day strike by dockers on the two coasts .

Four thousand other men turned out for night work , as many of the piers were kept operating on a round-tl-clock basis . New York , as the nation 's busiest port , was hardest hit by the strike . Trade sources estimated yesterday that $175,000 , - 000 in foreign commerce was held up here during the walkout . While some individual companies in the export-import business were severely affected , the over-all effect of the tie-up on foreign trade was not considered " too serious , " e-xcept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bulk of the nation 's Christmas imports had cleared through the ports before the strike began on Nov. 16 . Some major marine terminal ' operators said it would take about ten days to relieve the congestion On their piers and to get the operations back to normal . They indicated that the abnormal crowding of the docks would make it difficult for trucks to get in and out , and long waiting lines of trucks at , piers would make for even further delays . The Association of American Railroads lifted the embargo it ' had placed on the shipment of export freight to the East Coast and Gulf ports . The embargo had been clamped down on Nov. 19 to prevent congestion of freight cars at rail terminals along the coasts . Fruit importers said that about 150,000 stems of bananas .

But while work on the docks was settling down to normalcy , the problem of the dispute between the International Long ; shoremen 's Association and the Nets York Shipping Association still remained . The likelihood of an , early sumption of contract discussions was eliminated late yesterday when the union said that " any time after Monday , Dec. 3 " would be acceptable . The date was set in a. telegram to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , which had pressed both the union and the New York employers for an early start on bargaining . Two Curt Appearances Slated The union explained the delay by saying that it . must make court appearances in two injunction actions this week . The court actions noted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service are in Federal Court here and both are before Judge Frederick van Pelt Bryan . The union will appear at 2 P.

There is disagreement over what the annual increments ' , should be and whether the new contract should run for two or ' three years . A walkout not connected with the labor dispute occurred at 3 P.
