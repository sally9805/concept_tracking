The Number ( by Arthur Carter ; produced by Paul Vroom &; Irving Cooper ) has faults galore , but one very respectable virtue : it keeps its audience interested . Without offering anything very new , Playwright Carter has built up a good situation for melodrama , thrown in some characters that are tough , some twists that are lively , and even a surprise or two . In more expert hands , The Number might have excited audiences instead of merely interesting them . <P> The play tells of a respectable young woman ( Martha Scott ) who goes to work for a smooth , ruthless bookie ( Murvyn Vye ) . Though his first rule is that employees may not go out with his customers ( to avoid the temptation of putting their interests ahead of his ) , she disobeys and is soon caught up in a heavy love affair with a tough numbers player ( Dane Clark ) . The two are found out , just at the moment when he legitimately wins a big bet , and the rest of the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actors Vye and Clark make persuasive evildoers . And though the evil that they do will not live after them , it carries The Number safely through the evening . <P> Barefoot in Athens ( by Maxwell Anderson ; produced by the Playwrights Company ) has Playwright Anderson once again raiding history for a hero . This time : Socrates. * It is not a very satisfactory sortie . Doubtless Socrates himself is partly to blame : however notable for dialogue , he was almost churlishly averse to drama . But Playwright Anderson is even more responsible . He has twisted Plato 's Socrates into a symbol , thrust him into strange company , shown him off like a Hellenic quiz kid and , at moments , with quite unpoetic license , has wrenched him completely out of character and history out of focus . <P> Anderson 's Socrates , as he moves about Athens , is humorous , misleadingly softspoken , exasperatingly inquisitive , relentlessly logical-so very much a gadfly that it 's no wonder he was made into a scapegoat . And as played by English Actor Barry Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine personality . Raiding history a second time-for a theme-Anderson contrasts democracy in Athens with dictatorship in Sparta , a parallel with modern times that Anderson is n't the first to note . Though the point is well worth making , Socrates has to be lassoed into making it . Socrates ' whole life is too exceptional , his whole method too ironic , for him to be a naturally crusading spokesman . <P> Barefoot has some good scenes and some good writing , but suffers even more from lack of sensibility and of art than from lack of drama . It has snatches of Shavian cleverness jostling scraps of Socratic wisdom and ponderous suggestions of The Private Life of Helen of Troy . A dramatically pointless harlot tags after a comic-strip King of Sparta ; and in direct competition with perhaps the most nobly serene death scene in history , Anderson introduces one all his own . Dramatists rightly take liberties ; but Drinkwater did not have Lincoln assassinated at Gettysburg , and Shaw refrained from having Joan devoured by lions . <P> <P> * On other occasions : Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Washington .
