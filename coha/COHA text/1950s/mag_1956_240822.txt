In the cobblestone capital of Tegucigalpa this week , military officers shouldered aside Supreme Chief of State Julio Lozano Diaz . The framed election , which Lozano staged to transform himself into a legal President ( TIME , Oct. 22 ) , proved too raw for Honduras ' younger , U.S.-trained officers to choke down . All last week Colonel Hector Caraccioli , 34 , a U.S.-trained pilot who commands the air force , and Major Roberto Galvez , 31 , an engineering officer who studied at Louisiana State University , talked it over with aging ( 71 ) Don Julio . Then , lining up support from General Roque J. Rodriguez , 55 , commander of the country 's military academy and an old hand at Central American revolutions , they gave Lozano polite overnight notice to resign for the good of the nation . <P> Sunday morning , air force planes patrolled the skies and troops deployed on the streets . From the military academy on the outskirts of the capital , Colonel Caraccioli telephoned Lozano : the time of decision had come . After holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and his associates , the old man signed his resignation . <P> Dour and crotchety , Julio Lozano never had any noteworthy popular support . He rode into the vice-presidency in 1948 under President Juan Manuel Galvez ( the rebel major 's father ) . In 1954 , when presidential elections ended in a no-majority stalemate , Lozano happened to be sitting in for the ailing President Galvez , and seized power . Last August , hit one-two by an attempted barracks uprising and a case of high blood pressure , he turned over his authority briefly to a junta headed by General Rodriguez , then persuaded Galvez to stand in again as chief of state and went to Miami for a medical check up and long rest . <P> He flew back three weeks ago to supervise the election . Scarcely a ballot box was left unstuffed , or an oppositionist unintimidated in Lozano 's electoral effort . For what it was worth , he won . But when his cops topped off the fraud by shooting into a crowd of demonstrators on Election Day , Lozano 's number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what is best , the general , the colonel and the major eased him out . Said the junta : " We intend to govern democratically . " It was the 13 5th revolution in Honduras ' history-and the first military coup without bloodshed .
