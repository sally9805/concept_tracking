Hungary was a vestigially feudal country when the Communists took it over in 1944 in their sweep toward Vienna . The conquerors ' remedy was the one Lenin had prescribed for Russia : speedy industrialization . With the same ruthless disregard for human life which characterized Stalin 's carrying out of the Leninist injunction , they pursued this end : farmlands were collectivized , workers brutally regimented , living standards depressed . Last week , in a swift move that had overtones of the great Moscow turnabout of the ' 20s , the Hungarian Communists reversed their program . <P> Premier Matyas Rakosi , a bullet-headed Bolshevik with a 35-year record of service to the party ( including 15 years in jail ) and a longtime intimate of Stalin , was demoted to membership of an eleven-man politburo and a three-man secretariat , modeled after the new Russian-type organization . Into his place as Premier stepped Imre Nagy , 57 , a Moscow-trained Hungarian Communist of only slightly less experience . But the significant change was in policy , not in personnel . With a smiling Rakosi taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a stunned Parliament of the changes that would be effected . <P> INDUSTRY : " Nothing justifies exaggerated industrialization . . . The tempo of building heavy industry must be slowed down . The emphasis should be on commodities and the food industry . " <P> AGRICULTURE : " The government wants to liquidate the mistakes of the past . . . The country 's economy is based on the individual farms . The government wants to guarantee the peasant 's crop and his property . The list of kulaks has to be abolished . The movement into cooperatives has to be slowed down . Those members who desire to become individual farmers again can do so ... Fines amounting to 600 million forints approx. $50 million were imposed on peasants for delivery failure . This we cancel . " <P> LABOR : " There were serious mistakes . We have to create an abundance of food and other commodities to raise the standard of living of workers . High prices must be decreased and real wages raised . Disciplinary measures against workers must be abolished . " <P> BUSINESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsmen . Licenses must be issued to enable them to start their shops again . " <P> PROFESSIONAL CLASSES : " The intelligentsia is not respected in the proper way , especially those who belonged to this class before the war . We insisted on university or high-school education in an exaggerated way . We have to be more modest in this respect and not build castles in the air . " <P> BUREAUCRATS : " The rude and heartless behavior of bureaucrats must cease . " <P> AMNESTY : " There are people who suffered injustice . Internment as an institution is one of the abuses . Those who do not endanger the security of the state shall be released in a spirit of forgiveness . . . Interned people may choose freely where to work . Deported people can choose freely where they want to settle down . " <P> RELIGION : " We must be patient in this matter , and I will not tolerate forcible measures .
