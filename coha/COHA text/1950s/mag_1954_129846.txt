In preseason games they looked lethal ( top , opposite ) , but so did such powerful elevens as the San Francisco 49ers , the Los Angeles Rams , the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cleveland Browns . // As the 12 pro teams open a 72-game National Football League season on September 26 , spectators will see brilliant , bruising football , most of it straight T. From the T will come the passing of Otto Graham of Cleveland , Norm Van Brocklin of Los Angeles and Bobby Layne of Detroit . // Layne , in his seventh year of pro football , will quarterback a Lion back-field that includes two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker . The defensive back-field is about as impregnable as can be found , and up front in the line the Lions need no sympathy . Line Coach Buster Ramsey should be a happy man . // San Francisco , only one game behind at 1953 's end , may have picked up that game and more with the addition of John Henry Johnson , back from a year of Canadian football with a terrifying reputation . Quarterback Y. A. Tittle will have plenty of ammunition to shoot with Johnson , Joe Perry and Hugh McElhenny. // The Los Angeles Rams have the best passing quarterback in the league in Van Brocklin and a bright recruit in Billy Wade , Vanderbilt product just back from military service . Tom Fears , Elroy Hirsch , Bob Boyd and Bob Carey give the Rams the best end group in the business . The Rams , with a little luck , could take it all . // The other three Western Conference teams  --  Chicago Bears , Green Bay Packers and Baltimore Colts  --  are improved but not enough .

Still , only an extreme optimist could hope to get the Packers out of the second division this year . // Another new top coach is Weeb Eubank of Baltimore , former Cleveland assistant . Fred Enke will continue to shine as the Colts ' field general . Zollie Toth , a pounding fullback , is ready after a year out for injuries . Baltimore may expect lumps from the power-packed Western Conference . // The Eastern Conference looks like a two-horse race between the Cleveland Browns and the Philadelphia Eagles , with the Browns a whisker favorite to win the privilege of losing to the West in the championship game , as in their last three seasons .

Bob Thomason and Adrian Burk give sound quarterbacking ; Pete Pihos and Bob Walston are ends enough for any coach ; the front line , with Frank Kilroy , Mike Jarmoluk , Frank Wydo and Chuck Bednarik , locks up a defense that can do the trick . The Eagles may do it . // The other four Eastern squads are rebuilding to various degrees . The Washington Redskins went through another emotional disturbance that ended the coaching tenure of Curly Lambeau and put Joe Kuharich in charge . It could be a sad autumn for the New York Giants under Jim Lee Howell , new coach , though they may have a sleeper in Bob Clatterbuck , quarterback from Houston . Pittsburgh is fielding almost the same team as last year with a new coach , Walter Kiesling , and John Lattner of Notre Dame added to the Steeler backfield .
