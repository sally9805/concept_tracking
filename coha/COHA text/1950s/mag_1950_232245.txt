Washington 's Corcoran Gallery , which prides itself on showing the best in modern American art , housed a newcomer last week . The debutant , a shy , gentle man with a Pinocchio-sized nose , was the Washington Post 's cartoonist , Herbert Lawrence Block , 40 . He had won a Pulitzer Prize ( 1942 ) , but he 'd never seen anything like this . Eyeing the 194 cartoons , all signed with the economy-size pen name ( Herblock ) , one dowager gushed to Block : " There 's a complete timelessness about your cartoons . They 'll last , I think , for at least ten years . " <P> It was not his timelessness but his topicality that had made Herblock one of the most widely syndicated editorial cartoonists in the U.S. His daily cartoons combine impact and ideas , the technical simplicity of the drawing school with the political sophistication of the drawing room . <P> This month , Herblock will add another laurel to his balding pate when the National Gallery of Art 's Rosenwald Collection buys several cartoons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. living cartoonist in the Rosenwald group of prints and etchings . The only other : Britain 's David Low ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) . <P> 151 Bosses . Herblock has been cartooning for 21 years . A Chicago chemist 's son , he won a scholarship to Chicago 's Art Institute . In 1929 he quit school to start cartooning on the Chicago Daily News , later moved to Cleveland and the Newspaper Enterprise Association . In 1941 , Herblock drew the cartoon for N.E.A. that won him a Pulitzer : a German soldier searching the sky for a British bomber while Parisians look on and grin . <P> Then Block joined the Army and put out a G.I. information sheet . In 1945 , ex-Sergeant Block had lunch with Washington Post Publisher Eugene Meyer . Said Herblock : " I 'll send you a batch of my cartoons so you can get a line on me . " Replied Publisher Meyer : " And I 'll send you some editorials so you can see how you like us . " The liking was mutual . <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the European Herald Tribune , the Rome Daily American and the . At the Corcoran opening , the gallery favorite was a Taft-faced cat ( see cut ) that had just swallowed an Administration canary . One runner-up : an unhappy Republican elephant consulting a psychiatrist because of a feeling that he is " not wanted . " In more bitter mood , e.g. , challenging the Un-American Activities Committee 's qualifications for purging textbooks ( " Now to find somebody that can read " ) , Herblock sometimes has the deadly point of a poisoned dart . <P> At the Post , Herblock works behind the closed door of a cluttered , dusty cubbyhole . After a morning spent reading the papers , pacing , brooding and doodling , he makes rough sketches of three or four ideas . When he shows them to Editor Herbert Elliston , he always puts his own favorite on top . Elliston usually agrees . Block 's ideas come hard . Says he : " Cartooning is n't inspirational at all . It 's more like laying bricks . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
