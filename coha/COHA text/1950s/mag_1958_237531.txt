Older citizens , if they search their memories hard , can still remember when Elizabeth Taylor appeared opposite Roddy McDowall in Lassie Come Home , was seen around Hollywood playing with rabbits and turtles , and wrote a story about a pet chipmunk entitled Nibbles and Me . Ah , youth ! Today every movie fan from Pomona to Pago Pago knows that when Elizabeth Taylor nibbles , it is n't chipmunks . And so when Liz got involved with a laddie who would n't come home and a lassie who would n't stand for it , Hollywood was in the midst of one of those major , publicity-churning crises . Trouble was that she had picked on two absolutely living dimpled dolls-Eddie Fisher , that wholesome , bubbly Coca-Cola boy , and his child bride , Debbie <P> Reynolds ( who is actually the same age as 26-year-old Liz ) . <P> Still legend is the public bliss that surrounded the wedding of Eddie and Debbie three years ago in an enchanted castle named Grossinger 's , a famed Catskills resort . At the time , pressagents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had embroidered sweaters for her with the initials N.N.-for " non-neckers . " Eddie , while never one to be stopped by initials , seemed to behave , at least for a while , and did not chase around a bit more than he had as a bachelor . <P> When Mike Todd , Liz Taylor 's third husband , was killed in a plane crash last May , Debbie and Eddie were on hand to help console her . The Todds and the Fishers had been good friends ( although in retrospect last week , Debbie made a fine point to the effect that perhaps they had not really been " good friends " but only " just friends " ) . When Eddie and Liz were in New York two weeks ago , consolation continued in nightclubs and during a weekend at Grossinger 's . After Liz and Eddie finally returned to the coast , there followed a barrage of press releases - soothing , aggressive , clinical , statesmanlike . Liz went into hiding . Eddie and Debbie had a fight within earshot of newsmen ( " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ) . Everybody was retroactively psychoanalyzed-Eddie had never been close to his father , had always been wild , but now he felt guilty ; Debbie was really domineering ; Liz-well , Liz was too beautiful for her own good ( " I 've the body of a woman and the emotions of a child , " she had said once in a moment of self-analysis ) . <P> As the drama developed from " misunderstanding " via " separation " to " I 'll file for divorce , " the Greek chorus of the Hollywood columnists was in full chant . Hedda Hopper got through to Liz , and when she asked the Widow Todd what the whole thing was about , the answer was unp-nt-le . <P> Back in the borscht belt , Jennie Grossinger sorrowed : " Debbie is adorable and so is Eddie . Two nicer people they do n't come . I hope it 'll blow over like little grey clouds . " But the clouds kept darkening-as far away as Miami . There , Artist Ralph Cowan was stuck with a life-size portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now she does n't want it , " said Cowan . He also had a portrait of Liz on hand . " The man who ordered it never finished the payments . " So Cowan shipped it to an eager buyer , Eddie Fisher . It seemed like the most sensible maneuver of the week .
