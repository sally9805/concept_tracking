THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW PATH ( 245 pp. ) - Honor Tracy-Random House ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> When it comes to pulling legs , the Irish have a natural preference for the leg to be English and themselves on the pulling end . In defying this convention , Novelist Honor ( The Deserters ) Tracy , herself part Irish , and a Catholic at that , has shown a distinct preference for legs that protrude beneath the cassocks of Irish parish priests . <P> To borrow the book 's idiom , The Straight and Narrow Path is the tale of a great haroosh*in the village of Patrickstown , and it may be said without fear of successful contradiction that neither Barry Fitzgerald nor Spencer Tracy nor Bing Crosby nor John Wayne will bid for the role of the priest , if the book , by some unlikely chance , is made into a film . <P> Upstairs Bathroom . Honor Tracy , for her first novel published in the U.S. , has written the farce of the year . But Catholic readers , especially those of Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also highly scandalous . Patrickstown is all right in its own way-only an hour 's jaunt out of Dublin , with good fishing , cozy drinking facilities , its inhabitants ( now that Lord Patrickstown , the last of the Protestant gentry , is a convert ) sleeping peacefully under the benign but totalitarian rule of Roman Catholic Canon Ignatius Peart . The canon 's only worries are the prevalence of love in the hayricks and the difficulty of raising funds to fit his parish house with an upstairs bathroom ( which the local water pressure will not reach ) . <P> At least , these are all his worries until Dr. Andrew Butler , an English anthropologist " with a class of hair like an old nest , " puts up at Mangan 's Hotel for some rest after a breakdown from overwork on the tribal customs of the Congo . All might have been well had Dr. Butler not written a feature article for the London press . Butler included a description of nuns from the Patrickstown convent jumping over fires on Midsummer Eve and made some unfortunate references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with these innocent goings on . <P> As spiritual director of the nuns , Canon Peart decides , under the prodding of the local legal shark , to sue for libel and defamation of character - he needs the money to pay for that dry bathroom which was necessary for the dignity of the parish . Suing the Sassenach and his newspaper seems the answer . <P> The Watery Mind . At this , " a number of bees quietly biding their time in the national bonnet sprang to life with an angry hum . " Everyone , including the canon , knows that the nuns did skip over fires on Midsummer Eve , but this is nothing to the big fact that no Englishman - and a writer at that - can " put down " an Irish priest in his own parish . The Englishman , of course , can not see the logic of this , and takes the unreasonable attitude that his own good name is at stake ; he will not let the London newspaper pay off . The case sets all Ireland roaring . Resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anonymous letters flood the mails and editorial columns . <P>
