In the spotless Basel laboratories of the Swiss drug company Sandoz A.G. a short , trim scientist of 52 performed a strange experiment . Research Director Albert Hofmann meticulously dissolved five milligrams of white crystals in a test tube of water . Then , while tense assistants looked on , he swallowed the potion , lay down on a couch and waited . Within an hour Hofmann began to report : " I am losing my normal bodily sensations . . . My perception of space and time is changing . . . Your faces appear strange . . . " Finally : " Now , as I close my eyes , I see a wonderful but indistinct kaleidoscopic train of visions . They are vividly colored . " <P> Alone with his visions , Experimenter <P> Hofmann stayed on the couch three hours until the drug 's effects wore off . He got up feeling fine . After two years of delicate lab work , he announced last week , Hofmann had managed to isolate a mysterious substance-the chemical that has caused men of many races , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain kinds of mushrooms . <P> For Hofmann , such chemically induced visions are not new . He is famed among the world 's biochemists and psychiatrists because in 1943 , by accident , he absorbed ( probably through the skin of his fingers , he now speculates ) an infinitesimal amount of a potent chemical . For a while it made him wacky . He identified it as lysergic acid diethylamide , now universally known as LSD-25 . It has proved an invaluable weapon to psychiatrists seeking to reproduce symptoms like those of schizophrenia ( TIME , Dec. 19 , 1955 ) . <P> Researcher Hofmann moved from LSD to mushrooms thanks largely to Ethnologist ( and a J. P. Morgan vice president ) R. Gordon Wasson and his Russian-born wife , two dedicated , medical-minded mushroom eaters . The Wassons have voyaged all over the world seeking ritual devotees of exotic mushrooms and sharing their hallucinations , reported on their experiences in LIFE and in a $125 book ( only 500 copies printed ) . Mushrooms , Russia and History . A French companion on their travels sent Hofmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mexicana . From its little brown umbrella , perched on a delicate stem , Hofmann isolated the pure chemical ( he calls it psilocybin ) that induced his experimental hallucinations . <P> Sandoz will release psilocybin only to highly reputable medical investigators . To them , it means that they can now use a third chemically pure substance-in addition to LSD-25 and mescaline-to induce controllable symptoms like those of uncontrolled mental illness . From such studies they hope to find chemical cures .
