A decade of high-gear progress was proudly reported last week by the American Heart Association as it celebrated the tenth anniversary of its reorganization from a narrow-based group of medical specialists to a broad-based outfit with national public participation . In this period , said President Robert W. Wilkins of Boston at the commemorative meetings in San Francisco , surgery on the heart itself has leaped from a hesitant , tentative approach to one of great confidence : there is now nobody with acquired or congenital heart disease who can not be considered as a prospect for surgery , and many cases can be helped . Equally important has been the successful attack on rheumatic fever , achieved mainly with penicillin . Ranking next , Dr. Wilkins listed ground gains against high blood pressure , now controlled with drugs in most patients , so that surgery is practically disappearing . <P> For the next decade , Dr. Wilkins predicted , hardening of the arteries and its fatal effects-heart attacks and strokes-will be the prime target , demanding 80% to 90% of researchers ' efforts in the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already evident in the tenth anniversary scientific reports , which devoted increasing attention to the causes of arteriosclerosis and the treatment of its severest effects . <P> Who Gets It ? Diligent researchers offered more facts and fewer theories on the importance of stress and diet as shorteners of life . Main trouble has always been to find two groups of people similar in all but a few respects , then pinpoint the variations as causes of differences in patterns of disease . Doctors from the Medical Col lege of South Carolina and the University of Haiti picked on their local Negro populations as ethnically indistinguishable , then did post-mortem examinations of the hearts and aortas of 139 South Carolinians and 128 Haitians of equivalent ages and the same sex distribution . <P> From the Charleston area , Dr. Dale Groom reported , the hearts studied showed twice as much atherosclerosis ( the form of arteriosclerosis that affects the coronary arteries ) as did the hearts collected in Haiti by Dr. Vergniaud Pan . Why ? Their diets did not differ significantly except in two respects : the Haitians got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the poorer classes were underweight , while as many as 30% of better-fixed Charleston Negroes were overweight ; also , the Haitians had practically no cholesterol in their diet , while the South Carolinians had six to 20 times as much ( mostly from eggs ) . <P> At first glance , such data would fix the blame on the diet . But South Carolina 's Dr. Groom was not to be stampeded . Pathologist Edward E. McKee ( who did all the autopsies , did not know where a particular heart came from until afterward ) had checked the aortas with equal care , found surprisingly that just as many Haitian as South Carolinian aortas were diseased . To Dr. Groom , this indicated that something besides diet was to blame , though he did not rule out the possibility that a dietary clue might yet be found .
