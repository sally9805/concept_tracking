A top woman vocalist is one of the music trade 's most valuable properties . The smaller labels , long envious of the majors ' near-monopoly of tried-and-true stars , have been scouring the boondocks of musicmaking , in a search for new talent they can call their own . Result : the biggest crop of new names in years . So far , none of their finds is likely to jeopardize the record sales of such old reliables as Jo Stafford and Dinah Shore , but some are well worth a listen . Bethlehem puts its money on Helen Carr ( Why Do I Love You ) and Terry Morel ( Songs of a Woman in Love ) ; EmArcy displays the modern phrasings of Helen Merrill ; Storyville has uncovered a sweet-husky voice on Introducing Milli Vernon ; Liberty 's Lonely Girl exploits its success with Julie London , a talented miss who spends most of the record breathing down the listener 's neck . As for the majors , they are currently raiding Europe : RCA Victor backs the susurrant , suave and seductive tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Languages , while Columbia has been pushing Paris ' Juliette Greco , whose contralto voice sounds alarmingly like a tenor 's . <P> Other pop records : <P> Born to Be With You ( Chordettes ; Cadence ) . The girls give out their tender message with ringing fervor ; in fact , this group sounds like Aunt Alice 's hymn-sing gone pro . <P> Hot Dog Buddy Buddy ( Bill Haley &; His Comets ; Decca ) . Rock ' n ' roll at its gosh-darndest , with something that goes off like pistol shots on the offbeats , a recurrent crash of someone ( apparently ) smashing dishes between harmonies , and , out front , Haley himself , exuberant with thoughts of his own vitality . <P> Hello , Baby ( Fred Astaire ; Verve ) . A song that slips in amidst the hurly-burly of modern pop songs about as unexpectedly as a soft-shoe dance in a rock ' n ' roll show-and brings as much relief . Astaire , who helped write the relaxed lyrics , sings them with nice feeling , as always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dot ) . A winning voice that can make even the most inane lyrics acceptable . Boone gives the blues-about his lost love-a swooping hillbilly flavor . <P> I 'm in the Mood for Love ( Amru Sani ; Grand Award ) . East Indian Entertainer ( New Faces of ' 56 ) Sani begins this oldie with a series of racking , echoing groans , but then picks up a twinkle of humor that makes everything all right . <P> Mind if I Make Love to You ( Len Dresslar ; Mercury ) . A Cole Porter song , from the forthcoming film High Society , that sounds like one of the old ones , with its well-mannered melody , its discreet rumba rhythm , its inner rhymes . Only the sentiment grates . <P> Picnic ( McGuire Sisters ; Coral ) . Country-style harmony applied to the theme music from the film Picnic , with rather touching results . <P> Tell Me Why ( Gale Storm ; Dot ) . One of those concoctions that bear the inscrutable features of a hit . This one may have a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener would never know ; Songstress Storm 's voice skitters around it , slides under it , swoops past it , does everything but sing it straight . <P> Whatever Will Be , Will Be ( Doris Day ; Columbia ) . More about the mystery of life , but with a fatalistic twist and a helpful touch of peasant philosophy . The answer to all queries : " The future 's not ours to see ; Que ser , ser. "
