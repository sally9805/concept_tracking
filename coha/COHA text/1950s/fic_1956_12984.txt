The woman is tall , slender , middle-aged . KOLOTI I saw no one . But as I passed through the woods , I heard voices and the break of dry twigs . Perhaps she is with the others gathering wood .

' T is said his power and greatness lie not so much in the things he has done , but in the wonderful way he has done things . KOLOTI You speak the truth . You ought to know more about it as your own father is so clever also . TEBOHO Yet when he speaks of the King or tells of their conversation together , you would think both were mad men . Father says it is only he himself , Makoanyane and a certain wanderer Mohlomi , who know the King even better than the King understands himself . He says strange things such as this : that the little boys who rest under the shade of a spreading fruit tree and eat of its delicious fruit , not only claim to know it , but think it stands there to satisfy their needs and plans . But the tree grows on , silent and fruitful , keeping its power to create a cool shade , its secret of producing living fruit , its mystery of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , he suddenly ends , The King is the tree , the little boys the men who hang round him for favour . p. 5 KOLOTI Your father is a bard , and bards can say anything .

TEBOHO Mother says it is the ever-restless sea water in his stomach . KOLOTI Do bards possess such wonders within themselves ? TEBOHO When father was young he travelled far and came to the mystic land of the Zulus where he learned much , and saw the sea of which he is never weary to speak . Mother says the ocean , whose water father drank and still drinks for health , infected him with its restlessness , and now he can talk as madly and as ceaselessly . KOLOTI Strong beer and the sea must be the same thing , then . TEBOHO Truly . The sea is mad magical waters encasing the chaos of a formless void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness .

It is n't said . What we know is that we are Basothos of Moshoeshoe , of Mokhachane , of Peete . KOLOTI I think both Mofokeng and Tladi hunt for you , and . . . . Oh here comes Tladi .

TLADI ( Seizing vessel . ) You wo n't go , I tell you . I speak . TEBOHO ( In solemn warning . ) He-e-e-m-m-m ! Truly ! TLADI I suspect that fool , Mofokeng , wants you . You would be a fool to accept that fat stomach . TEBOHO Is that your affair or mine ? TLADI Would you be a fool ? TEBOHO Leave me alone . You are not my father . Ca n't you hear ! TLADI No one speaks thus to Tladi . ( Seizes her arm . ) TEBOHO What are you doing , he-e-e ! What 's this , truly ! Take your hand . . . . TLADI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . TEBOHO I ? TLADI I have medicine . TEBOHO ' T is not me you will drug into loving you . You drug yourself into believing what is not . p. 8 TLADI Medicine will make you love me .

TEBOHO People diminish , not grow , by impatience . TLADI You will not listen ? TEBOHO When you speak I will . ( Mad , Tladi pounces on her and locks her in a brutal embrace , but as suddenly releases her at the sound of approaching intruders . Enter Mofokeng and Koloti . The newcomers stand apart and go on talking as if no one else were present , although the girls keep eyeing and tonguing one another , and smiling . Tladi draws back and pretends to be drinking and taking snuff . ) KOLOTI ( Playful and teasing . ) So you say you love my friend , Teboho ? MOFOKENG ( Jolly and childlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , as eyes love sight . I would work for her as an ox labours for man ; I would treat her as a boy handles the richest honeycomb ; I would follow her as a dog its owner . Only help me to win her . Speak for me , and I shall get you a fine husband , too . p. 9 KOLOTI He , he ! Who told you I want a husband ? MOFOKENG You . KOLOTI I ! When ? Where ? MOFOKENG Always . Everywhere . Even now . KOLOTI Your lies ! What do you mean ? MOFOKENG Your mouth says nothing , but your nature speaks . Your being a woman means you need a husband . If woman was not made to have a husband , what sense was there in creating sex ? KOLOTI You have saved yourself by saying that . But about Teboho , I think if you told me what love is so that I could tell her , she would accept your proposal . MOFOKENG If I told you I would not know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MOFOKENG I do . KOLOTI Art mad ? You said you can not tell me what it is . You know things you know not . MOFOKENG It can not be explained . Only its ways can .

Love , you are ugly ! MOFOKENG The spirit of summer comes clothed in thunder , dust and lightning , but brings beauty , song and glory . KOLOTI Hmmm ! You ! MOFOKENG Yes . KOLOTI Oh , no ! MOFOKENG Of course . KOLOTI ( Teasing . ) But why do n't you give her a love potion ? MOFOKENG ' T is fools would kiss and caress a somnambulist . KOLOTI Then why do n't you speak to Teboho yourself ? MOFOKENG The lover , like the bee , flies round the flower of his choice , hesitating to enter the heart of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belated discovery . ) Oh ! I see we have spectators witnessing this game . MOFOKENG ( Rising to the challenge . ) Let me dance , then . They 'll enjoy it . ( He dances , and the two girls , all smiles , clap their hands and sing . Annoyed , Tladi comes forward. ) p. 11 TLADI Why is that fool dancing ? MOFOKENG Did you hear a monkey speak ? ( Dances on . ) TLADI Do not think you are clever , man . You may get hurt . MOFOKENG By Seepheephe ! When dealing with people like you , I do not want , fly-like , to buzz round noisily before I settle on the spot . Like an arrow I fly to the mark . Fight ! ( He takes his sticks and flies at Tladi . Several young men rush in and part them . The two girls walk out . ) MAKOANYANE A race of fighters is a race of singers . ' T is either song or fight . Now ' t is time to sing . ( Sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beast and rustic ! Of rushing elephant Of buck that run to pant And huntsman triumphant ! Of roaring wilds and Rigour ! Of crouching brave and Vigour !

Hear the yelping And the shouting ! The dogs do bark , The men all shout . Tshona , Tau ! Thiba , Monna ! Qiti ! Qiti ! Qiti ! ( Enter Moshoeshoe who is given the royal salute . He goes and sits on a large stone near the mouth of the well , and the young men sit in a semicircle before him . Before the pitso begins , Moshoeshoe rises as a stranger enters , and shouts , Hail , thou Wanderer ! Hail , Father ! The stranger is Mohlomi , an old man with a weird look , dignified bearing and charming personality . He carries a skin bag. ) p. 12 MOSHOESHOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my father over there . While we speak , you may go and give the horses drink and get them ready , or rest and eat away matters of interest . Makoanyane , see that all goes well . PARTY Pula Morena ! Pula Ntate ! ( The party goes out . Moshoeshoe and the Wanderer sit and talk . During the course of the conversation several refugees pass by and are given water to drink by the local girls who come to fill their vessels . As the girls come and go , they point nervously  --  not using fingers  --  to the two great men , and whisper excitedly . ) MOSHOESHOE Ah ! So you have come . I greet you , father , and am happy to see you . Are you well and not worn out by travel ? MOHLOMI I have not come . I pass by only . You have come . Those who have nothing to do on earth are passers-by and strangers who see neither the beauty , meaning nor truth of life . But you have come to build , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry and laugh ; to know joy and pain . Only of a great man can it be said , He has come. And in inquiring after my health , you speak as if health depended on the body . Health is spiritual . The body can suffer from old age and disorganisation only . ' T is the mind and the spirit know health and disease . MOSHOESHOE The witchdoctors would laugh if they heard you say that of disease . And these witchdoctors are powerful , wise . . . . p. 13 MOHLOMI They are fools . MOSHOESHOE You do not mean that witchdoctors with their powerful charms . . . . MOHLOMI Son , I said you have come to build . You will not succeed in your work if you waste time and thought on witchdoctors . Leave them alone to play their game . Play yours  --  and make them leave you alone to play it . I am old and wise , and am a great traveller . I know . Witchdoctors are impostors ; I am a herbalist . I know . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will respect and fear you , and pretend you are the greatest witchdoctor among them . The ambitious like to claim the mighty as of their kind . In pretence lies their safety . MOSHOESHOE You surprise me . I thought witchdoctors and medicine bring success . MOHLOMI The spring of success lies neither in medicine , in doctors , nor in kingship . Success is not that . It is a thing as beautiful as words , as sweet as music , as strong as genius . It is wisdom . Always seek wisdom . MOSHOESHOE I hear you , father . But when I 've found it ? MOHLOMI Seek it . MOSHOESHOE Seek what I 've found ? MOHLOMI Those who find it do not know it . p. 14 MOSHOESHOE I do not understand your words . I must turn them about in my head when I am alone . But what else should I seek ? MOHLOMI Seek to seek . MOSHOESHOE Seek to . . . I do not hear you , father . MOHLOMI Always seek to find , but never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek . MOSHOESHOE The things you say puzzle . But they are beautiful and wonderful . Is it because you travel much ? MOHLOMI Of travel much can be said . To one who travels the world travels ; to one who sleeps it sleeps ; to one who dies , it is dead . Some proceed faster in life than in years : others in years , not in wisdom . Some move far without walking ; others walk far but never move on . Some journey far to see little ; others see little to venture forth . Some march forward to happiness ; others are too happy to advance far . Some seek to escape ; others rush to pursue . I 've seen them all . Travellers sad and lonely , wanderers happy and in company ; wayfarers weary and hungry , roamers and saunterers fresh and full ; pilgrims overburdened and bent , vagabonds erect and burdenless ; pioneers and refugees robbed and bleeding , crusaders bouncing with spoils and smiles . This is the life of the way , the soul of travel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen many wonderful things . MOHLOMI Who are those ? MOSHOESHOE There is an unseen thread between spirit and spirit . You have just spoken of refugees , and here I see these homeless travellers . ' T is the magic of the web of life wherein we all flutter . They look tired and hungry , these refugees . I see the girls give them water to drink . It is good . MOHLOMI Good , but not enough . They thirst for water of life . MOSHOESHOE Who ? MOHLOMI Men such as these . They search for a land they know not . They seek not the land they know . MOSHOESHOE You speak the truth . MOHLOMI Not long ago I visited Mapolane and Maphetla , heads of tribes that are a combination and mixture of people of different tribes . There I learned the magic of unity . These men have built and strengthened and increased their tribes by taking over and keeping helpless refugees . MOSHOESHOE You utter words that can be understood now , father . You speak of great things . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled on the secret , and do their work without plan and consistency . I know you can do it thoroughly . p. 16 MOSHOESHOE And the homeless travellers ought to make a thankful , peaceful , loyal population . You have helped me , truly . You speak of what I understand . MOHLOMI What one understands Hardly stands . What 's puzzling to know E'er will flow . However let me leave the matter aside . Here is something else . It is good policy to marry as many Chief 's daughters as possible , even if you do not actually take them to wife . It gives you healthy connections with other Chiefs . MOSHOESHOE That is wise . But I fear . Yet , who knows ? MOHLOMI The coward . MOSHOESHOE I do not understand . MOHLOMI The coward knows and fears . The brave man dares to know . The fool fears to know , and never does . The wise man knows to fear , fears to know , knows to dare , dares to know . MOSHOESHOE You want to lose me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand . MOHLOMI You insult yourself . MOSHOESHOE Why ? MOHLOMI ( Ignoring the question . ) Build your new kraal on a mountain because it is a fortress . It gives unbridgeable space between you and your neighbours who often prove more menacing than strangers . The air is young and vigorous . Height will lengthen your eyes , and make you see men as dwarfs . The mountainsides and the valleys will be good pasture land and tilling soil . Stones will be your armour. p. 17 MOSHOESHOE Again you speak of great things I can understand . O father ! What would I have been but for you , always my help , my guide , my lord ? MOHLOMI A great man worships no hero save he himself . He may safely and profitably worship and reinstate a dead hero . But I lie . MOSHOESHOE ( Insistent . ) You are my lord and father ! You are the spirit of my ancestors . You spoke of the menace of neighbours . Let me ask this : what do you say of war ? As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . MOHLOMI A nation that is constantly at war dissipates its energy and genius in militarism . Its best brains have neither the time nor the encouragement to sing , love , build . All other forms of occupation are neglected and even despised . Constant warfare turns the mind and the soul of a people , not to its own internal needs and affairs , but outward to other races who must be conquered , kept in subjection , and jealously guarded . It drives away from a race many of its most gifted sons whose ambitions and visions give trouble . A militant policy can be pursued and maintained only by means of severity in law and administration . This makes the people and the leaders suspicious , restless , insular , cruel . No one dares to do what others do not . None refrains from what others do . Others do n't , or do becomes the beginning and the end , the reason and the law . Other tribes come to regard such a people as blood foes , enemies decreed of the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange girl , crying and wild. ) p. 18 STRANGE GIRL Save me ! Oh save me ! They have found me out at last . Oh ! MOSHOESHOE Who have ? What is it ? Who are . . . . ( He and Mohlomi have risen . Enter members of Moshoeshoe 's party shouting and questioning . Enter Mokhothu 's men doing the same . ) MOSHOESHOE What is all this ? MOKHOTHU I am Mokhothu . We want that girl . Kopano , come ! KOPANO Save me ! Do not let them take me away ! MOFOKENG Trouble dances round us ! MOSHOESHOE Why , what 's happened ? MOKHOTHU Give her to us ! MOSHOESHOE But why ? MOKHOTHU Have you no ears ? MOFOKENG These words tickle the muscles ! MOSHOESHOE Tell your story first . MOKHOTHU I tell nothing . I want the girl , now ! MOSHOESHOE Do you know where you are and to whom you speak ? MOKHOTHU I am here ; I speak to you . I 've come to get the girl , and will get her even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he does not know where he is and to whom he speaks . KOPANO They are sent by Chief Leroti . They wanted to mutilate me alive and to murder me for a ritual to strengthen the chief . I ran away , hid . I escaped . MOSHOESHOE You will not have the girl ! MOKHOTHU A fight will decide that . I see you have company . My men are no cowards . ( Members murmur about Moshoeshoe risking dangers by forsaking custom . ) MOSHOESHOE Why trouble all the men to fight over the matter . Let the leaders of the two parties fight and decide the issue . MOKHOTHU You think much of your leader , but little of his life . Are you the leader of yon other man who gives you support ? MOFOKENG I , the leader ! You are blind ! He 's the leader ! ( Several men laugh . ) I say that not because I 'm a coward , fools , but as a mark of respect to our leader . Who does not see he is the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight the man who dares laugh again . ( Tladi laughs , Mofokeng attacks , Moshoeshoe intervenes . ) MOSHOESHOE I know you are no coward ; let others think what they will . You , what do you say ? p. 20 MOKHOTHU You insist ! Well , if you want your men to see their leader at the feet of a stranger , come . You are no match for me . ( Without a word Moshoeshoe takes his weapons and the two leaders fight desperately . The men murmur excitedly , Mofokeng dances and shouts praises to Moshoeshoe . Kopano whispers , May the stranger ( i.e. Moshoeshoe ) win. Mohlomi strokes her head gently . Moshoeshoe strikes his opponent down and out amid cheers . ) MOSHOESHOE We shall take the girl home . We have won the wager . ( To Mokhothu . ) I am Moshoeshoe . If you and your men want to live with us and make your homes here , and not return to your Chief who may kill you , you are welcome . You are friends , you are brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives the royal salute . Several local girls who had come to draw water and had witnessed the fight have joined the group . ) MOSHOESHOE Father , my party will set out now . Let these girls take you home to my hut . There find rest until I return . MOHLOMI I thank you . I shall go and find rest . I have far to go . MOSHOESHOE What shall I say to thank you ! Let me say this only : be ever so ! ( He divides his party into two , tells Mokhothu 's men to follow a guide to the kraal where , he instructs , food and shelter should be given them . To Makoanyane who leads one division of the party , he gives these instructions. ) p. 21 MOSHOESHOE Go to the highways , the caves , the valleys , the hiding places and gather all the refugees , the homeless , the destitute , and tell them of Moshoeshoe , the king who welcomes all such as they . Bring them all , herds of them . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judge . MAKOANYANE Pula , Seloana ! We shall do all we can . But we can not gather all . MOSHOESHOE Our name and reputation will glean where we reap . In this place you need only call , and the mountains and valleys will echo the cry . ( To the other section . ) Follow me . ( The girls , Mokhothu 's followers , and Mohlomi , all turn and watch Moshoeshoe and his men as they go out to ride. ) 1ST GIRL What fine horses they have ! 2ND GIRL See , they mount ! VOICE OF MOSHOESHOE Stay in peace , father . Throw us a farewell word of advice . MOHLOMI Oh blest are they who loving glorious power , Above that power can rise sheer like a tower ; Whose greatest battle is to conquer self , Who are not slaves to vanity and pelf . And greater who with elephantine power , Can scented sweet remain as flowers in a bower ; Man fierce as death in battle field ; at home As meek as sheep which grasslands rich doth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's ; not for man 's praises cheap and tall . Long ere men came , and long after they die , In might and glory still the earth will lie . True greatness is but greatness for its sake ; The greatness that is so for gain is false . p. 22 SHOUT FROM MOSHOESHOE 'S MEN Hail , Wanderer ! Father of our father ! GIRLS They ride away ! 1ST GIRL How well they ride ! 2ND GIRL But the Chief , how gracefully he rides ! 3RD GIRL The tails of the horses stand upright ! 4TH GIRL So do the heads ! 5TH GIRL Each horse seems to have two heads ! 6TH GIRL See how Mofokeng plays on horseback . He 'll fall ! 7TH GIRL He ! Never ! Truly ! Go , Mofokeng ! GIRLS Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Kwe-we-we ! He-le-le-eeeee !

Enter Tladi and Lebuso . They come and stand near where Mofokeng hides . As the two men talk , Mofokeng keeps bobbing up and down , peeping at them , making faces and shaking his arms violently . TLADI Yes , let us combine and work and fight together . LEBUSO Like you I want to win the King 's confidence and his favour . In that I yoke myself with you . But you hate Mofokeng and want to see his fall . There you must go alone . Against him and his position I have nothing to say . I want to win the King 's pleasure only . TLADI But a fool like Mofokeng to be one of the King 's leading men ! What do you say ! Truly ! It is a disgrace ! ( Mofokeng throws a small stone at Tladi . ) What was that ? LEBUSO Nothing . A broken twig . But why do you hate him ? TLADI Women are fools . Teboho refuses to accept a man like me and shows favour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truly ! He has been lucky in that . But I want to wring him dry and flat as a beer sieve in matters of wealth and position . I will not rest before I break that pig , Mofokeng ! ( Again Mofokeng pelts Tladi . ) This place is haunted . It rains trouble . p. 24 LEBUSO ' T is strange that men who do not fear to commit grim deeds should take fright at sounds and shadows . TLADI Great deeds rob us of those qualities and virtues that help us achieve them . So that men seeing us after their performance wonder how it was done . LEBUSO You can not pursue great deeds and women at the same time . One must come after the other . TLADI Which ? LEBUSO Either . That is , according to the type of woman and the circumstances . TLADI But I love Teboho , and the blind fool cares little for me . Yet that poor Kopano for whom I care little , loves me madly . LEBUSO Be wise and marry her . ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness . TLADI But I want Teboho , man ! LEBUSO Be foolish and marry her . You will be most unhappy and very wise . TLADI Are you trying to puzzle me ? Speak sense , man . LEBUSO In a one-sided love match , I 'd rather be the loved than the loving . TLADI But I want to love and live ! Ah ! I wish I could deceive that girl into being my own . p. 25 LEBUSO Being your own , she would deceive you into believing in her . TLADI What then ? LEBUSO ( Aside . ) What does he know of pain who has not felt the pangs of deceived love undeceived ? TLADI But why would you rather be the loved than the loving ? LEBUSO ' T is the love-sick , the faithful and the innocent suffer in this world . TLADI You say so ? LEBUSO Man , behold yourself suffering ! TLADI I suffer not because I love Teboho , but because I hate Mofokeng . My hatred gnaws my soul . LEBUSO No . ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is goodness not evil causes suffering . Even the most wicked of men at last are ensnared and ruined by their virtues , not vices . We suffer in proportion to our goodness ; and according to the measure of our vices are we indifferent to remorse . The white missionary said ' t is angels weep , not the Devil . How the Devil must laugh ! TLADI But I tell you I hate that pig , Mofokeng . LEBUSO You do not . Men can not hate . ' T is a misnomer . Hatred is selfchastisement . ' T is our own shortcomings we bemoan , our selves despise , when we say we hate . Men are vessels . We love or hate them according to the quality and the quantity of their contents . p. 26 TLADI It means the same thing , then . And I hate that dirty vessel Mofokeng and its putrid contents . LEBUSO That same vessel , robbed of its contents , would excite different feelings . ' T is his achievements , not Mofokeng , you envy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am great ! I will be great ! I ought to be great ! LEBUSO A great mind that hates other great minds and prefers the company of inferiors shows a fatal defect . TLADI Can not the gods find better , fitter vessels for their gifts ? LEBUSO Vessels fit for the gifts of the gods , or for the convenience and pleasure of man ? TLADI Why should a man like this be gifted ? A fool to be wise , a weakling to be strong , a nothing to be something ! How rank the folly of the gods ! It makes men cruel , jealous , pugnacious , mad ! LEBUSO Because he has the gift , Mofokeng no longer is himself . He is his gifts . But enough of all this . We have come here , not to cry against Mofokeng , but to plot how we may win the King 's favours . TLADI Tomorrow is the great day of the Pitso . That is our chance . We must impress the King with our wisdom and sense of duty . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire and show the King we love our country . p. 27 LEBUSO Yes . But how will it be done ? TLADI Let us warn the King against his enemies , real and unreal , at home and beyond , and suggest that he put a heavy yoke on them . LEBUSO ' T is a good plan . Truly . ' T is good . TLADI See what I have ! ' Twill help us succeed . ( Produces roots and leaves , some of which they chew and the others burn . Loud noise is heard . ) TLADI Herdsmen ! Let 's go before we 're seen .

MAKOANYANE ( After a pause . ) If nobody wants to speak , the Chief will speak and decide on the matter . MOSHOESHOE I hear you men . Cannibals are not animals . They are cannibals because they must . Men make cannibals of men , and man-made cannibals prey on men who make them cannibals . Every one has a right to the soil and its blessings . Every person must eat and laugh and play . No chance have cannibals to do these things . Give them these , and they will cease to do what they do and be men like ourselves . Why should we fight them ? To fight is to admit inability . Who fears  --  let him fight . Who 's inferior  --  let him fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life  --  let him fight . Send them cattle . Win them back . Death 's no defeat . MAKOANYANE You have heard the words of the Chief . They will be carried out . We shall now proceed to the important question of our relation with our neighbours , and the menace of the foe . I hear there are some of you who want to speak on the matter . MOFOKENG Be still . The voice of the void speaks . No , ' t is inanity speaks . TLADI Khomo Tseo ! Our Chief grows strong and great . His enemies also grow because the great are envied and hated . We who love the King think his enemies should be invaded and wiped out . I speak as a patriot . O thou mighty Chief , Father , think of what it would mean ; consider the glory of success . p. 30 MOSHOESHOE Yes , there is the glory of success . But there is also the beauty of wisdom . MOFOKENG Are plotters patriots ? MAFAESA The Chief speaks . MOFOKENG I do n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are useful tools . The great are not great in themselves . The weak mother the great . TLADI I await the King 's decision . MOFOKENG Ambition cries for decisions . MOSHOESHOE Decisions enslave . Choice confines . Schemes enchain . I neither choose nor decisions make . I think and feel . Decisions , plans and vows come to an end . Thought and feeling grow on and on  --  and that is power and joy . TLADI These are great words . But does the Chief mean he will not attack the foe ? MOSHOESHOE Are we not a people that cherish peace , industry and wisdom ? Are we not a nation made up of wanderers and refugees , of brave men and peaceful ? How can a nation born of such noble virtues , destructive doctrines embrace ? How can a people conceived in wisdom and greatness sink to vain glory ? How dare break up homes and communities , a nation begotten of wanderers and the homeless ? My task is to build , not to destroy ; to heal , not to inflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this task I now rule . p. 31 ALL Uh ! Uh ! These are great words . Great ! TLADI Morena ! I hear you . Pula ! MOFOKENG I hear your conscience shouting . MOSHOESHOE Here is Makoanyane , son of Ntseke , he our chief advisor and great . From Laake , from the Baphuthi tribe his father came . A stranger he was and homeless ; him we received . To this nation his son , today , stands a mighty pillar . Here our mighty hero , Tsehlo , he , son of Nkenyane , of Tsietso ; Kueeme and Mooyane , he , their son also . From the loins of the Bamooyane , they , originally , the Matebele , our enemies , he sprang . And this our leading counsellor brave , ' t is Mokhothu . Whence he , and how ! ' T is the magic of unity ; the unity of magic . MOFOKENG False patriots are plotters and spies . TLADI O Chief I concur with what you say . Wherever you lead there will I follow . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we be rid ? MOSHOESHOE Not by using our strength , but by exploiting their weaknesses do we conquer men . Get a man against himself to fight and from him you 're safe and free . Our way must be to federate the clans and the tribes , a central overlord for each district . These overlords to me must tribute pay . This will beget contentment , and before our united , happy people the enemy will tremble . p. 32 MOFOKENG ' T is their own wisdom that 's the bane of plotters and fools . TLADI You speak the truth , Father . Only I wish we had more time than we have here . MOSHOESHOE We have time enough . We fail because we need ability , the truth and the light . TLADI But , Chief , do n't we need time to discuss the many affairs of the nation ? MOSHOESHOE Time is achievement . In a flash the lightning traverses the whole earth , but the snail cries for time and yet more time . Life is events lived , work done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tladi 's support , and going round the point . ) A struggling man wants companions to help him achieve success . A successful man wants obedient followers who will do as he directs and . . . . MOSHOESHOE A struggling leader should be backed up by the Wisdom of the Brave , but a successful leader must be maintained by the Courage of the Wise . But speak on and let 's hear what you say . MOFOKENG Plots smell . Wisdom has a sensitive nose . LEBUSO Tladi spoke of the danger of invading tribes . You have answered . We are satisfied . I speak of the enemies within our kraals . The Chief , I think , is too lenient to the people some of whom will , I speak truth , give trouble to the King 's Pitso and to the King himself , mistaking kindness for laxity . To avoid this , we need more and better laws . p. 33 TLADI We have such a case today . MAKOANYANE Be quiet . We shall hear it . MOSHOESHOE Laws corrupt ; loyalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will make no laws , then ? MOSHOESHOE None . I trust and rely on all my subjects . If men are not a law unto themselves , no law is law to them . MOFOKENG How cunningly plotters set traps into which they themselves are ensnared . LEBUSO I hear you , Chief . You speak the truth . I spoke because I feared for your own safety . MOFOKENG Talk in a bush is one thing . Talk in Pitso another . MAFAESA What is wrong with Mofokeng these days ? He not only talks alone when alone , but is alone even in company . What be all this he says ! MOKHOTHU Hurts it anyone ? MAFAESA It hurts he himself . MOFOKENG I bleed myself to cure myself . Myself I tease my soul to ease . ( Enter messengers from Besekake . ) MOKHOTHU These be fellows from Besekake . The Chief greets you . p. 34 LEADER Khomo Tseo ! Pula ! We are messengers from our Chief , your servant . He pays tribute and these gifts has sent . The tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The messengers display the gifts which are a shield , an assagai and karosses . ) MOKHOTHU How stand the affairs in your district ? LEADER The Chief told us to report all goes well . The people love your just rule , and reap much from your wisdom . MOSHOESHOE Ah ! Full right was I when to Tladi , Lebuso and to you , men , of the magic of peace and unity , I spoke . These be the fruits of my policy . Go , we shall see you after Pitso . ( Messengers give royal salute and go out . ) MAFAESA O King , we learn Chief Mtiwane whom we have tried to please and appease by tribute displays an insatiable appetite , and with the many cattle we send him is not satisfied . MOSHOESHOE I know . Mtiwane 's foolish . In asking for more , even what he already has he loses . To one greater than he shall we now tribute pay . Shaka . ALL ( In awed , reverential tones . ) Shaka ! He ! MOSHOESHOE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will protect us. p. 35 MAFAESA Will it be safe , O Chief , Shaka to disturb ? Of him the whole world knows . He 's death . No mortal , he . But a risen Spirit , merciless and revengeful . Is it safe to go near him  --  even with offerings peaceful ? MOSHOESHOE Shaka , like other kings , builds ; does what others do . The trouble 's that he 's too successful . Where others can not , he can . Where some their dreams of desires dream , he the eluding vision answers . Theirs the guilt not his the blame . Shaka 's policy and position do not on himself entirely depend . To his victory our impotence contributes . The measure of pain and disorder is the proportion of the difference in our stature . He is consumed by his power , and him we call a spirit . He is devoured by a fire of which we 're the offending logs . Long ere our work is done , we perish . Shaka , having wonders performed , lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do , he has with ease accomplished . Our littleness makes him great . Our weakness drives him cruel . His career we have shaped . His power we have built . But wisdom he can appreciate . If tribute to him we pay , he 'll understand , feel flattered , and protect us . ALL Pula , Silo ! Pula , Tau . Thou art his match . Avoiding a clash with him , and fight him yet . MOSHOESHOE Morena , Mokhothu , you know . Tell what gift we can to him send . To outplay Mtiwane , this I want to do now . p. 36 MOKHOTHU Father , I suggest ostrich plumes , a jackal skin , and the feathers of a crane . These will please the Zulu king . Cattle , I need not mention . MOSHOESHOE We thank you . Tomorrow I want you to go on this long journey and great mission . We rely on your wisdom in these matters . We shall give you the best men to go with you . MOKHOTHU Ntate ! MAKOANYANE Mafaesa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is an important matter , this affair of the unruly young men led by Lerutle . They molest girls , assault those who try and stop them from doing this , and will listen to no one . They make raids on our people . Our local Khotla has dealt with the matter thrice  --  and have failed . Now we have brought the affair to the great Pitso itself . MOSHOESHOE Let 's see them . MAKOANYANE Come in ! ( Enter Lerutle and his followers . ) Proceed . Question them . MOKHOTHU Why do n't you young rascals listen to the words of your local Khotla . Do n't you know we are old and you young ! LERUTLE ( Unmoved . ) What is the difference between your age and our youth ? p. 37 ALL ( Shocked . ) U-u-u-u-m-m-m ! ! ! What does he say ! How insolent ! A thrashing ! A thrashing ! Order a thrashing ! ' T is customary ! MOFOKENG He wants to know . Answer him . Do n't keep saying u-u-m-m ! MOSHOESHOE Youth is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age finding . Youth is the journey , Age the arrival . Where Youth boasts I know , Age whispers I understand ; where Youth glories in schemes , Age lives in achievements ; when Youth jumps away from stinging troubles , Age feels abiding pain ; when Youth wallows in drunken pleasure , Age lives in peaceful happiness . In its blood Youth carries the germ of Age ; in the blood of Age flows the fusion of thought and event . I 'd like to see Lerutle and his men after this first session of Pitso . But first let Lerutle 's men see me decorate Morake and Mohale . Call them in . MAKOANYANE Come in . ( Enter Morake and Mohale . Moshoeshoe presents each with the decoration of bravery and honour  --  a piece of wood hung by a sinew cord from the neck . The Council hums in praise . Moshoeshoe eyes Lerutle significantly and speaks . ) MOSHOESHOE I like brave young men and strong . Under my rule and arm there 's room for young men who thirst for the most daring exploits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obey me fully . For Morake and Mohale  --  and all who follow their example will reap the same  --  we shall give a special dance , and the bards will sing their praises , the maidens hear of them , the country talk of their courageous deeds . To each a beast will be given . p. 38 LERUTLE ( Broken down . ) O great Chief , Father . I never knew you were so great and kind , wise and . . . . MOFOKENG He knew nothing and was defiant . Now he knows and is humble . MOSHOESHOE You will speak to me alone after this . You and your men may go , and you Morake and Mohale . ( The young men go out . ) MAFAESA ( Aside to an Induna . ) The Chief has medicine . Who does not see that Lerutle and his men have already been overpowered ? ( Enter a messenger , speaks to Makoanyane who whispers to Moshoeshoe who nods consent . ) MAKOANYANE Food is ready in the big kraal . We shall cut off our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been to the kraal . And let me remind you of the great feast of the harvest tomorrow to celebrate the King 's reign of promise . MOSHOESHOE Ere we close , this I want to say : in certain circumcision schools , Sehoere , hear I , is still being prepared with human flesh . Is this true ? MAFAESA O Chief , it is an old custom , and the people are reluctant and slow to give it up . MOSHOESHOE ( Fiercely . ) What is custom ? I am custom ! My word is custom ! Custom is no god ! This thing must stop ! This thing must stop ! p. 39 ALL ( Meekly . ) Pula ! Pu . . . . MOSHOESHOE ( Thundering . ) Pula ! Pula ! What 's that ! I say this must stop ! This must stop ! The Curtain Falls p. 40 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene Four A corner of the royal kraal . Enter Teboho and Koloti . KOLOTI ' T is said that Tladi and Lebuso failed to move the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report about Morake and Mohale , and the talk about Lerutle . KOLOTI How these men must enjoy themselves talking at council . Why national assemblies were made for men and not for women I can not tell . TEBOHO Father says ' t is because man talks himself to greatness , but woman prattles herself into ill reputation . But I 'm glad you 've accepted Mokhothu 's proposal , truly . He and Mofokeng are the King 's favourites . KOLOTI Yet he once fought the King . How are the preparations for your wedding going on ? ( Enter Kopano , upset . ) KOPANO Happy are you sisters who love where you 're loved . I 'm sought where I seek not , seek where I 'm not sought . KOLOTI Alas ! Sister . . . here come Tladi and Lebuso . Let 's go . ( The two friends go out , Kopano hides behind some object .

I 'm no fool . Have I not been trying to get the better of him all these years ? Fortune 's on his side . I 'm tired . Why should I not sleep ? LEBUSO Call not death , sleep . TLADI I know not death . I seek eternal sleep . LEBUSO How will you do it ? TLADI I 'm from a great herbalist . This he gave me . A wonderful preparation it is , and affects no one but the rivals concerned . ' T is put into beer , but of that same beer all people may with safety drink . Only on the rivals does it act , killing one , the power of the other enhancing . Now , this is its most baffling property , that no one knows , not the wisest of herbalists , who of the two rivals ' twill kill . That 's why ' t is known to a few herbalists only , and by desperate men only used . This afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer-drinking . Mofokeng will surely be there .

Enter Mofokeng , obviously pleased and excited about something . He mutters to himself , laughs and pats himself . Re-enter Lebuso alone . Caught napping , Mofokeng pretends to be in pain and examines his foot and whimpers . ) LEBUSO ( Impulsively . ) Mofokeng ! Mofokeng ! ( Checks himself . ) No , I must not . ' T is not my affair . I 'm in no danger . MOFOKENG ( Forgetting his momentary discomfiture . ) Mofokeng ! Mofokeng ! No , I must not . I 'm not in danger . ( Lebuso goes out .

The Curtain Falls p. 57 Act 1 , Scene 6 Scene Six Feast of the Harvest . Music . Beautiful spot near a river . Heap of winnowed corn on the ground . Enter Lerato , hears sounds and hides . Enter Spirits dancing . SongSoft come the Spirits true Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . Immortal O delight , Be our light ; Oh help us rise and shine . . . We are thine . The Spirits go out . Enter four beautiful young girls bedecked with beads and other tribal knick-knacks . They have come to put final touches to the place before the Feast begins . As they touch this and that , soft music falls . Among them is Matseliso . Lerato emerges from behind a tree . LERATO I saw the little people from below . True ! True ! Just a moment ago . True ! True ! MATSELISO You saw your own eyes . ANOTHER GIRL No , Matseliso , Lerato may be quite true . She 's still a child , and ' t is said Spirits are seen by children only . MATSELISO I 've been a child myself . I never saw them . SAME GIRL Ghosts and gods are seen by the chosen few . Not all . ( The girls all walk out . Enter men , women and children . They talk and laugh , and have brought gifts of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to please and appease the Spirits . Enter Moshoeshoe. ) p. 58 PEOPLE Pula ! Pula ! Pula ! Seloane , Pula ! Pula , Sebata ! Helele , helele , Sefabatho ! Ntate as se Chaba ! MOSHOESHOE How great ! How most inspiring ! This glorious tribal gathering . Moshoeshoe , King , gives greeting , He greets with full thanksgiving . I hear the birds all singing , The water 's twist and rippling ! I see the children bringing Gifts from the Tribe 's harvesting . The air so sweet seems dripping With this our tribe 's rejoicing . How long have we been working , And thinking , suffering , bleeding ; How hard has been our toiling , And ploughing , straining , praying ; At last we are receiving What we have all been waiting . By faith  --  by not forgetting Our brave Ancestors lying Unseen and yet not slumbering , Now reap we this rich blessing . Those who keep on complaining About our long dark suffering ; They who still be despairing , Forlorn , and bitter , cursing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating : Guiding poor men by chiding , God knows what He is doing . Hear then the Voice loud calling ! Obey ! Do n't keep on fretting ! PEOPLE Pula ! Pula ! Pula ! ( Enter a band of warriors . Dance . The people play on the tribal instruments . End of warriors ' dance . Enter selected team of virgins , bringing special crops to the Priest . They dance and sing . ) Song ' T is harvest time ! Let 's reap and sing ! And dance to rhyme ! Till valleys ring ! Lazy men 's pits , Oh shame ! stand all empty . The toiler 's wits Now bring him plenty . Fools love to rest , But work is best ; Who go out furthest . . . Reap the best harvest ! Let 's dance and sing And blessings bring . All voices ring , For soon comes Spring ! Toil ! Pain ! Rain ! . . . Corn ! Boy ! Girl ! Love ! . . . Cows ! ' S why man was born ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who have come to pay tribute to the King and his Ancestors . They dance and sing , and the people laugh , shout , and clap their hands . ) Children 's Frolic Song He-le-le ; He-le-le ; He-le-le ! O King , great Chief , O hail ! Do not fail . Kwe-we-we ; Kwe-we-we ; Kwe-we-we ! Papa , Mama , how true We love you . ( Children go out . People cheer. ) p. 59 MAFAESA ( Sitting next to Moshoeshoe ; excitedly . ) Children are the meaning of a home , the makers of wealth , the preservers of our name . MOSHOESHOE A man lives by deeds , not through progeny . I 'd rather have my name live in the minds of men than dwell in the blood of progeny . MAFAESA I , Chief , I 'm the man for children . Man lives again in his offspring . Our children inherit our traits and reflect our character and thoughts . MOSHOESHOE Not as honestly as our deeds . I am father and mother of my deeds , but am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own ; my children more or less than mine . MAFAESA Ntate ! I hear you . But , at least , children are wealth  --  the girls . They beget cattle . They work in the fields and bring in yet more wealth . MOSHOESHOE Wealth is neither work , result , nor just reward , but is returns only . Wealth is the indescribable return of effort . Not all effort has returns , and little effort may have enormous returns . MAFAESA But if a person works hard . . . . MOSHOESHOE He can not be certain of success , of wealth . We are rich or poor in proportion , not to what we put in , but to what comes out of what we put in . Not our efforts , but the will of the Spirits . p. 60 MAFAESA ( Superstitious . ) Forgive , Chief . I forget about the mighty Ones . Let not their hearts be offended . MOSHOESHOE Be not afraid . It is a day for rejoicing . You 've committed no evil . ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest evil ? ( Makoanyane rises and whispers to Moshoeshoe who nods , yes . ) MAKOANYANE Listen , all ye people . The good white man of God had asked to be allowed to speak to the people on this occasion . To this , the Chief agreed . I see the good man has come . Say your say , good white man of God , before we proceed with our rituals . ( Enter Missionary and friend . Greetings . ) MISSIONARY ( To friend . ) It is wonderful how poetic their language becomes on these festive occasions . I must employ poetic language myself if I want my message felt . FRIEND What is more poetic than truth ? ( The missionary asks the people to sing one of the few hymns he has introduced to them . Song . He speaks . ) MISSIONARY What a tiny thing a weak word is ; Yet words breed slander wing 'd like birds ! For words can kill ! But thanks for this : Truth , Beauty , Song , are born of words . Children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of man ; They bring both strength and hope to th ' weak . Child , might and meaning of Life 's plan . Thou eye , our smallest sensory member . . . O eye , interpret , see , do n't weep ! Through thee all sin , all good , may enter ; For thou in hell or heaven canst peep . And after all , what is called thought . . . Thought is the germ of all creation ! In thought God 's Image can be caught . But poisoned thought is foul damnation . Four little things : word , child , eye , thought , Four little things that are a rod . . . Things precious that can not be bought ; They are a rod that helps to God . ( He leads in the Lord 's prayer , salutes Moshoeshoe . As he and his friend walk away slowly , admiring and being admired by the people , they speak. ) p. 61 FRIEND What feeling in their ceremony ! MISSIONARY Yes . And there is a level beyond which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative . These illiterate people have reached that point today . FRIEND One would like to see things remain as they are . But I see trouble ahead . Our own white adventurers and farmers push upwards . Soon Moshoeshoe will be called upon to deal with problems of land-purchase , boundaries , trading , and other matters foreign to his mind . But he is a remarkable man . MISSIONARY He is . Moshoeshoe , a genius and builder ; a man of triumphs and sorrows ; a man consumed by the smouldering and devastating fire of thoughts wishing but fearing to be born , of smaller hopes against the greater Hope , of great expectations unfulfilled , of plans and ambitions whose very attainment would but give birth to plans and ambitions never to be attained . ( The two go out . Enter Mofokeng , dances . Loved of all the people , he receives a wild ovation . Tired , he goes and sits next to Moshoeshoe who knows that the idol has overworked himself and is feeling nasty . ) MOSHOESHOE Dissipate your pain in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smile when I feel as you know I do ? p. 62 MOSHOESHOE Laughter expresses our deepest feelings and burning thoughts . MOFOKENG Br-r-r ! I die ! You say so ? MOSHOESHOE Yes . Animals do not smile because they have no troubles , no suffering soul ! MOFOKENG I think they do not smile because they do not know the joy man knows . Joy ! What joy ? Br-r-r-r ! MOSHOESHOE Animals do not smile because they have nothing to smile about . ' T is the poor laugh more than the rich , peasants more than nobility . Small men must laugh or die . Not joy but pain is the spring of laughter . MOFOKENG Br-r-r ! I hear you , Chief . Br-r-r ! You puzzle me . Br-r-r ! I can not see ! All I know is this : the more I appreciate the beauty of the world the more pain I feel . MOSHOESHOE I know the pain of beauty ; I bleed . I know the beauty of pain ; I sing . MOFOKENG You sing ! I die ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not cry too . They make wailing sounds only . Why ? Crying is spiritual . Crying is man 's protest and his call . MOFOKENG ( Feeling better . ) You speak , Chief . I wish I were as wise as you . p. 63 MOSHOESHOE You should not . Wisdom hurts . MOFOKENG ( Feeling well and almost dancing . ) It hurts ! Wisdom is joy and strength and light . MOSHOESHOE Wisdom is a living flame that burns the souls it enters . Wisdom burns though it does not consume the mind . MOFOKENG You say that because you 're glad you 're successful . MOSHOESHOE I 'm neither glad nor successful . MOFOKENG The whole country knows you are . MOSHOESHOE If one says of himself he is a success and means it , he 's a failure . If one says of his success it is a failure and means it , he is great . Look ! ( Enter Mokuena and members of his family . The result of the family rehearsal is as follows , the first part of each verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dance by the children . ) I 've seen full beauteous green , rich , blooming trees Wave swarming soft with music of the bees ! I 've feasted , worshipped mute at scenes like these As if all pain , all strife , had come to cease . Then swing , swing , swing ye trees ; Swing me bliss ! Seen rugged mountains where rise grim old trees ; Such trees exude pure inspiration 's Song , And burst in declarations sweet and strong ! Strange trees that breathe a Presence as the seas . Then sing , sing , sing ye trees ; Sing of thought ! I 've seen pied trees that grace sweet meadowed grain ; Sad sleepy trees all crowded in conclave , Confirming Life to be no shadow vain ; Tired trees that moan like some shore-weary wave ! Then weep , weep , weep ye trees ; Weep of joy ! Seen trees that scale dark fearful mountain crests ; Yet there pained souls may find some charmed bright pool , Mid scenes with frozen aching spirits cool : Thus joy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rock ye trees ; Rock me Hope . I 've seen great spreading trees rise cleft in twain ; Poor trees upon which Nature plays her game ; Grow they and thrive , and win themselves a name , Yet spite their fruit , to close the cleft is vain ! Then hum , hum , hum ye trees ; Hum man 's plea ! Seen men who grow all twisted  --  cleft in twain ! Poor mortals whom the gods take as their game ! Grow they and thrive , achieve , win fame and name , But all attempt their wounds to heal is vain ! Then hiss , hiss , hiss ye trees ; Hiss man 's cry . I 've seen inviting , cool , rich shady trees That make me feel all lonely , sad , inspired ! Charmed trees that call glad lovers  --  and men tired ! E'er do I bleed and sing mid scenes like these ! Then nod , nod , nod ye trees ; Nod me peace . Seen river trees where birds build watery nests ; Blest trees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us first to learn to bow In thanks , before we make further requests ! Then wave , wave , wave ye trees ; Wave me on ! ( The family finish their turn . The tribal priest comes forward , takes a handful of winnowed corn and gives it over to Moshoeshoe who scatters it about as a sign of gratitude to the gods for their protection , munificence and kindness . But the Priest himself scolds at the gods. ) p. 64 PRIEST Ye gods , what do you want ? We have given you crops . We have made libations . We worship and praise you . In our ceremonies , remember you . Yet you remain sulky , mysterious . You would starve us . You bring heat and drought . You visit us with sickness . What do you want ? What have us do ? You come to us clothed in invisibility . You , all powerful , leave us to be raped by misery , evil , affliction . Will ye not hear nor save ? ( Makes libations , scatters corn about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tone to one of sweet , humble supplication . ) PRIEST Ye Dwellers in the nether lands , Ye great and kindly Ancestors , Ye great bold warriors , godlike souls , Ye Spirits who remain e'er young , Reveal yourselves this day to us . O Spirit of Song and Beauty , come ! Thou Spirit of Rain and Plenty , come ! ( Sprinkles powder over fire . A thick cloud of smoke rises . Suddenly the ground opens . Enter Spirits led by spirits of Truth and Beauty . ) SPIRIT OF BEAUTY When Beauty rises in the Human East , Goodness will swell like yeast , Reborn , the sons of man will blossom fair , And evil cease to dare . SPIRIT OF TRUTH Then shall the rains of Truth , Love , Mind all fall , And rivers long of man 's earth-born sore strife , ( Now deep and grave as thought , now rippling song ) Shall wind like song o'er plains of Time and Test , Down crying falls of human-wrought abyss , Round cool , green meadows soft of Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man 's genius , And lose themselves in the universal sea Of inspired Beauty and Experience  --  Thought . Then shall the sun of Truth our efforts crown , And , wave-like , man will boil with new-born thought , And , like sea-vapour , rise noiselessly still , And purified , and charmed with Light and Love , Return to heaven from whence at first he fell . ( The Spirits go out . The people mutter , Strange and wonderful ! The maidens come and sing and dance again in honour of the Spirits . Priest makes an offering. ) p. 65 MAKOANYANE ( Emotionally . ) Behold ! Here comes the mighty Wanderer , the great maker of our King , the father of the destitute and the orphaned . Hail ! Hail ! ( Enter Mohlomi . Greetings . ) PEOPLE Sing O Wanderer ! Sing to us thou who art mysterious , thou who art magnetic , thou whose beauty is spiritual . Sing , Oh sing , great heart . Pour forth thy soul . MOHLOMI Sing I sweet slow old sad tunes , Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memories untold ! Memories untold ! O life ! Sad sweet smiles they bring ; Hidden thoughts , years , of past strife ! Tears to my eyes spring . ( Silence long and deep . ) PEOPLE Again ! Again O Bard of the Spirit ! MAKOANYANE Peace ! ( To the Wanderer . ) Tell us , Bard , where and how you get your wisdom , charm and inspiration . MOHLOMI My best work finds creation from deep Pain ! Not love , or joy , or worship yield my thoughts ; Throbs of maid love live dead in my pierced heart ; Laughter is nothing save a shield , a mask ; Worship brings hope , not inspiration 's harps . Nature I love  --  the rugged mellow Song Of sky , clouds , mountains , rivers , plants , birds , vales ; Wild scenes are breathing windows for my soul ; Yet all these scenes of life bring tears , not joy ; Love , Song , Truth , Beauty , are but forms of Pain ; Sweet Babes conjure visions of ruined men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise ye people and shout in great Song : Sweet Song ! the ripples of God 's speaking smile ! ( The people burst into the Wanderer 's song. ) p. 66 MOSHOESHOE ( Moved . ) You who have seen this old world wondrous , bold ! Have you not thought a tale it holds to tell ? Stop , list , around you gaze ! and your life mould To nature 's pattern  --  so will all be well ! Dost never think what mean these hidden things You see , you do , you hear , both day and night ? To those whom Nature understands , she brings Not happiness alone , but also might ! Melodious birds , beauteous and fragrant flowers , Unheard , unseen , bring beauty , scent and song ! But Man his little deeds wants sung on towers ! Yet fears the whisperings of his smallest wrong ! You who have seen the ants trail down huge things , Or powerful rivers born of small raindrops , Will you not cease Hate 's strife ? Harmony brings Far greater harvest than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell gloom ! The sun sheds light to varied Life of day ; Even so hatred and greed spell Man 's own doom , But love and peace mean strength , the truth , the way . The seasons come and go : the world moves on . All pain , all joy , birth , death  --  all is but motion ! ' T was not for pain or joy Man came upon This star . Souls came to grow up  --  evolution ! Like as a river . . . so my pain flows endless ! Like unto stars , my thoughts shine far beyond me ! Like wind , I 'm here , there , gone  --  but am ! O sadness ! Fain would my soul soar high to God and be ! p. 67 MOKUENA Thy name like this great mountain , Thaba Bosiu , which overshadows others , shall rise high above the names of other Chiefs and rulers . And generations shall rise and praise thee blessed . For thou art great , thou mighty Chief of the mountain ; thyself a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain mind . And like this towering mountain cold , which will endure when we have departed and our kraals scattered , thy name , like Truth , shall abide  --  questioning , inspiring .
