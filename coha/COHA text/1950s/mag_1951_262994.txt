Advice to Advertisers " It is very common in our society to dislike advertising . " With this blunt observation , Chicago 's Social Research , Inc. last week sent its admen subscribers a comprehensive survey of TV commercials which seemed to say that television was making no progress at all in changing the public attitude . <P> Social Research found that televiewers have come to regard commercials with " the stoical air appropriate to a necessary evil . " Reactions differ considerably by class . The Upper Middles ( 12% ) , if they watch commercials at all , watch just to be critical . Middle Majority viewers ( 65% ) are more sporting , will stay with commercials until they get bored . Lower Middle Class ( 23% ) televiewers are apt to be most considerate . Because the advertiser pays for the program , they feel duty-bound to lend their eyes &; ears to his sales message . <P> But all groups , says Social Research , have common denominators of both tolerance and revulsion . Viewers generally approve of commercials that are integrated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; The Goldbergs ) because integration makes them " seem short . " They are partial to salesmen who inspire confidence or amuse them ( Arthur Godfrey , Sid Stone of Texaco Star Theater , Stop the Music 's Dennis James ) . They will accept , more or less grudgingly , commercials that show them how something is done ( Kraft TV Theater , Garroway-at-Large ) . <P> What viewers do n't like about commercials makes a longer list . They are against <P> 1 ) overcrowding , particularly at station breaks , when there are sometimes four consecutive commercials-one from the concluding show , two spot announcements , and the first plug of the next show , 2 ) jarring interruptions , when a song or action sequence is crudely broken into by a commercial , 3 ) noisy commercials , especially those that are sharply different in mood from the program , 4 ) overworked techniques , which have made viewers indifferent to stars whirling into focus to spell out a brand name ; beer being poured into glasses ; animated figures jumping on to and off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Social Research sees no chance of a millennium when viewers will grow to love commercials . Its only advice to advertisers : search earnestly for ways to " minimize the irritation . " effective collaboration between the network and the Red Cross , mixes film clips of typical disasters with demonstrations by Red Cross volunteers of what to do in an atomic emergency ( " In case of shock , do n't move the victim ; keep him warm ; raise his legs to increase the flow of blood " ) . Actress Joan Bennett was an able guest commentator who took the trouble to learn her lines for delivery without benefit of script .
