hunting the hidden meaning hchind the figures that come to hint on his stock ticker . Both . he says , arc stirred by the same basic human emotions  --  fear and hope . The stock market , he points out , is like every other enterprise that human beings engage in . It reflects the doubts , fears and anxieties that men feel about their own future and the future of the nation . It also reflects their dreams and aspirations , their confidence that tomorrow they , and the country as a whole , will be happier and more prosperous than they have been before . The market , he says , is a barometer of the nation 's emotions . If this is true , the nation 's emotions , at the moment , seem beset by schizophrenia . In a week of ' wandering through Wall Street , asking those who make their living there the simple question , " What makes the stock market behave as it does ? " a reporter : from the hinterlands kept getting the same puzzling reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future holds , Therefore . they are buying stocks . People , on the other hand , are confident of the So , they are buying stocks . At first glance such an answer does not seem to make much sense . It is not immediately obvious to a layman how the play of two conflicting emotions could result in the same positive action . The explanation , though . is fairly simple . It goes like this : There are in Ibis country nearly 9,000 , orx I people who own shares in publicly owned companies whose stocks are bought and sold in the auction market , and their number increases by roughly ; Immo every year Two thirds of them have incomes of less dim tt t a year , but their holdings , at current th  --  h ? t , t values , total some : i- ; : ; 0,000 , ottu , iltx 1 . Nearly Ho per cent of these equities are locked away in strongboxes and are not for sale . The fact that so many people have placed so huge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their holdings every year , indicates that they feel serenely confident . They believe that five years from now , or ten years from now , the United States in the space age will be a bigger , stronger and more prosperous land than ever before . By buying stocks and holding on to them , they are making sure that they will be sharing in the fat dividends and the stock splits and all the emoluments of the golden years to come . Wall Street 's old pros , who for the past ten years have watched the market rise and fall and recover to climb steadily upward , have no disposition to quarrel with this judgment . " The only people who have been consistently wrong , " said one of them , " are the pessimists who bet against this country . " At the same time , the experts say , these same shareholders who ( Continued on Page 79 ) ( Continued from Page .1,11 confidently expect the ' 60 's to usher in the golden age are deeply fearful that prosperity will bring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnings and dividend yields the economy may achieve , The way things arc going , the dollar in 1969 may well be worth only half as much as the dollar of 1959 ? which itself is buying only half as much as the dollar of 1940 . Stock prices , the tables show , historically have tended to keep pace with inflation . Therefore , they seem today to be the best protection against the dwindling dollar of the future . This may or may not be true . Thc market averages , over the years , indeed kept pace with the cost of living . But the averages are deceiving . As this is written , in early January , the Dow-Jones industrial averages of thirty stocks  --  the great blue chips of the market  --  stand at their all-time highs . But nearly two thirds of the stocks on the New York Exchange are selling lower than they sold in 1955 . Meanwhile , the cost of living has shown a slow but steady rise . It is obvious , therefore , that , though some stocks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Stock in companies which manufacture a product which has traditionally sold for a fixed price  --  chewing gum and soft drinks , for example  --  may prove to be poor hedges against inflation . Shares in the great utility companies , whose rates are fixed by Government agencies , are fine to own in times of recession , but when inflation cuts their yield , their prices , usually , do not rise . There are exceptions , of course , as witness A.T . &T.,; whose earnings have outpaced inflation , sending its stock to such highs the directors authorized a three-for-one split . Usually , however , it is only those companies who can easily pass on to their customers whatever wage and price increases inflation brings , whose stocks keep pace with the general upswing . It all boils down to a matter of selection . If the " public individual , " which is Wall Street 's somewhat curious name for the Joe Doe who puts his money in stocks , is rich enough to diversify , buying stocks across the board , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value with the averages . But few " public individuals " have that kind of money . He must turn his money over to one of the huge mutual Funds , whose professional money managers do buy and sell across the whole spectrum of American industry . Or , seeking such counsel as he can get , from men who sell , or give away , their advice , he must pick and choose and hope to the Lord he 's right . The question naturally arises : is the American investor any better qualified to make a wise investment in the market now than he was in the ' 20 's ? Then , as Wall Street still remembers , he plunged joyously in with the rent money , buying on hunch and tip and rumor , and woke up broke and bitterly disillusioned after the crash of 1929 . To get the answer to that question it is necessary to review a little history . A few years ago the New York Stock Exchange decided to try to find out what the American public actually knew about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what image of Wall Street still lingered in the public mind . What their survey showed appalled them . Three fourths of the people questioned did not know the difference between a bond and a stock . They thought the exchange itself owned stocks and sold them to the public , and that drops in the market came when nefarious and mysterious manipulators , hidden away somewhere in Wall Street 's skyscrapers , decided the lime had come to reap a harvest of the little man 's dollars . Since that time the exchange , through a far-flung educational program , has labored diligently to dispel these clouds of ignorance and mistrust . Millions of pieces of mail have gone out , explaining in simple terms the ABC 's of the market , and hundreds of speakers , provided by the exchange or the more enlightened of its member firms , have explained to civic clubs or anybody else who would listen what the market is and what it is n't . A man who buys stock , they point out , is buying a share in America . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , the stock will pay a good dividend , and in the natural course of things its price will rise , and the owner will have a profit if and when he sells . If , on the other hand , any one of a thousand I hings that can happen to a company does happen  --  if its costs and wages rise too much , if a competitor comes into the field with a better product , if its management begins to suffer from hardening of the cerebellum  --  then its earnings inevitably will decrease , dividends will dwindle , and the price of the stock will fall . Owning stocks , therefore , is no one-way road to riches , the New York Stock Exchange 's spokesmen hasten to point out . There is risk involved in stock ownership , as there is in every other human endeavor in which gain is sought . The exchange , of course , does nothing to cause the market either to rise or fall . The price of a stock at any given moment represents what thousands , or perhaps millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth in light of the company 's present status and future prospects . The exchange does not make that decision . It merely provides a market place where those who want to buy and those who wish to sell can meet , through their representatives , the brokers of the exchange . The transaction is fairly simple . In Miami , a man who owns 100 shares in the XYZ Company may decide he wants to sell . He may have any one of a thousand reasons for this decision . The stock may not be paying as good a dividend as he expected . Or he may have a good profit in the stock , and he figures be might as well take it now and reinvest iii something else , or take a trip , send a son to college , buy a car . So he calls his broker . Roughly two minutes later his sell order is in the broker 's office in one of the skyscrapers overlooking Wall Street . Seconds later , on the floor of the exchange . a floor trader 's number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hurries over to the telephone clerk , who hands him a slip of paper which reads , " Sell 100 XYZ . " He goes back to the trading floor , to the " post " where XYZ is sold . " How 's XYZ ? ' . he asks . Meanwhile , in Seattle , another investor broods , while shaving , over what to do with some spare cash he has on hand . He thinks of buying a corporate bond . But most bonds provide a fixed return . He 'd collect his interest , at a given rate , for a number of years , until the bonds matured , and then he 'd get his original investment back . But SIM ) invested in a bond in 1959 might be worth , in buying power , only 5750 in 1964 . A good stock , therefore ; would probably be a better hedge against inflation . But what would be a good stock to buy ? An hour later he dropped in at his broker 's office , where on a big board or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  name of stock , number of shares sold , price paid  --  was being recorded second by second . XYZ , he noted , was selling at 40 's . He knew a little about the company and its prospects , for he 'd read about it in one of the investment advisory services to which he subscribed , and he 'd heard his broker mention it favorably . It had a good dividend record , over the years . He nods to his broker . " Buy one hundred XYZ . " Then began the same process that a few seconds before the man in Miami set in motion . The order flashes by wire to the broker 's office in New York , from there by telephone to the floor of the exchange . A broker sees his signal , goes to the telephone clerk , picks up the buy order , goes to the post where at that moment the broker with the sell order from Miami is asking , " How 's XYZ ? " Seconds later , simultaneously , the record of the transaction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole procedure of buying and selling has taken less than three minutes . On the American Stock Exchange it may have taken a few seconds less . There the floor brokers do not walk to the telephone clerk when their number shows on the hoard . The clerks sit in an amphitheater above the selling floor . They attract the attention of the broker on the floor by shouting or whistling , and give him his orders to buy or sell by hand signals based on the deaf-and-dumb alphabet . He signals back , by the same means , when the order is carried out . Both the buying and selling broker receive a commission , averaging about I per cent of the market value of the stock . Buying and selling stocks , therefore , the exchange likes to say , is as simple and easy as going into a grocery store to buy a can of peas . They arc pleased that the public is no longer afraid of a broker 's 8o A  --  office . and they like to cite the story or the Kansas farmer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lard bucket . Knowing what stocks to buy , or sell , however , is a differeot thing . The transaction described above involved Iwo fairly sophisticated investors , who knew something about the company involved , But how can the average man , busy at his job , find out the things he ought to know before he puts his spare cash in a stock ? How can he know that Company A is paying more for its raw materials this year and that its earnings , and therefore its do Wends , will probably deereasc a little ? How can he know that Company B is planning a big expansion , which should widen its market greatly and thus increase its profits , or that Company C has just developed a new product that should sweep the market and send its dividends to new highs ? How , in other words , can the average man " investigate before he invests . " as the exchange in all its literature urges him to do ? The problem is not particularly complicated . There is more accurate and detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to J. P. Morgan in his prime , and it is fairly easy to come by . The simplest thing is to pick out a good broker , choosing him as carefully as you would choose your doctor , or your lawyer . if he is a registered representative of the New York Stock Exchange , his house will have a research department that spends its time digging into every facet of the business operations of American companies . Nearly anything you want to know about a company he can tell you , or can find out for you . If he ca n't , you can write to the company itself , ask for its annual reports for the past five years , study them and make your own decisions . If , by fortunate mischance , your Aunt Jenny has died and left you 5100,000 , you might want more detailed help and advice than your broker will have time to give you . In this case you can probably afford to hire the services of a professional financial adviser  --  an investment counselor , who spends his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do tomorrow , but analyzing how companies will perform over the long pull . The services of these specialists in market analysis come high . Their minimum fee for advising you on what to buy and sell comes to about $500 a year . They are members of a profession that has grown up over the past dozen years . The best of them are competent men who doubtless give value received to those investors whose purchases are large enough to justify the expense , but it should be added that not every man who calls himself an investment counselor is worth his fees . There are some who are incompetent . The claim of the investment counselors is that their advice is sounder than you can obtain elsewhere , because their counseling is objective . The broker , they point out , is in the business of buying and selling stocks , on commission , and no matter how honorable a man he may be , self-interest might at times just tinge his judgment as to when you should buy and sell . though you can be sure he wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission . The investment banker , they add , is a wholesaler of securities , and his advice might be faintly colored by the fact that he has on the shelf some sound , but slow-moving , securities which he would like to unload . The commercial banker usually is more familiar with loans and discounts than he is with the earnings prospects of any particular firm . If he did have detailed knowledge of a company 's operations , he might be reluctant to divulge what he knew , particularly if the cornpatty was having troubles that night affect the value of its stock . There are , of course , two sides to all these arguments . Few brokers , investment bankers and commercial bankers would be guided solely by self-interest when advising the layman on investment matters . The important thing , therefore , is to Choose a nran of high ethical standards and ability , of whatever category , and then supply him with enough of your own financial background so that he can act intelligently for you . Above all , do n't buy anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone from New York or Chicago or Toronto or Montreal and tries to sell you something that will make you rich overnight . He 's probably operating out of a " boiler room , " calling a sucker list , and the chances are that the SEC , or the Attorney General 's office , will be breathing down his neck within a fortnight . Before you choose any adviser , there are a couple of things the exchanges insist you should sit down and figure out . First , they say , you should n't be dealing in stocks at all until you have an adequate amount of life insurance laid away , plus some savings that you could lay hands on immediately in art emergency . Next , you should figure out what your objectives arc . Nothing causes a broker or an investment counselor deeper anguish than for More men would come to the aid of the party if their wives were n't there . JOE RYAN a customer to come in waving his money , bellowing eagerly , " Hey , Joe , I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is very much like asking a sporting-goods salesman what gun you ought to buy . He has n't the faintest idea until he knows whether you plan to shoot rabbits , grizzly bears , elephants or quail . A young married man , for example , earning an adequate income from his job , probably should be looking for a good growth stock  --  one that may pay no dividends to speak of for ten years as a new company plows its profits back into expansion , but which , if all goes well , should be paying good dividends , and selling at a high price , about the time the kids are ready for college . An old couple , retired and living on their savings , would be less interested in growth . They would be looking for current income , and for safety . Though ideally each man should tailor his stock portfolio to his individual needs , one phenomenon of recent years has been the rise of the " investment clubs , " in which groups of individuals  --  people in garden clubs , bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together  --  pool their resources and invest in stocks . The number of these clubs is growing so fast the exchanges ' statisticians ca n't keep up with them , but there are believed to be at least 15,000 , putting into the market about $2,000,000 in new money every month . One club , in Kansas City , made up of ladies who have time on their hands , sends delegations to visit industrial firms within a radius of 200 miles , where they quiz the management sternly and poke around on the production lines . More widely diffused throughout the economy than the investment clubs are the citizens who invest regularly under something the New York Stock Exchange and its members worked out called the Monthly Investment Plan . By this procedure an investor turns over to his broker a fixed sum ut regular intervals  --  it may be as little as forty dollars every third month . The broker , after deducting Isis commission , buys whatever stock the customer designates . According to G. Keith Funston , president of the New York Stock Exchange , sonic 150,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Monthly Investment Plan , and the exchange naturally is vastly pleased at this broadening of the base of ownership . " The M.I.P. , " says Mr. Funston , " is bringing Main Street closer to Wall Street , which is a good thing for us both . " By buying stocks by the dollars ' worth , instead of by the share , the little investor is able to take advantage of an arithmetical gimmick which the big investing funds find helpful . It is called " dollar averaging , " and it works like this ; Joe Smith decides to invest $40 every month in a stock selling , at the start , at 540 . He buys one share . Next month , unfortunately , the stock has dropped to $20 . But his $40 buys two shares . It falls to 510 . He gets four . It drops to $5 , and he buys eight more , unless by now his courage has failed him . In four months he has spent $160 , and , instead of acquiring four shares of $40 stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value $75 . Obviously he has lost $85 , plus what he 's paid in commissions . But the average price per share is fairly low ? $160 divided by fifteen equals $10.66 . So , if he hangs on grimly , sustained by faith and hope , and the stock does start rising again , he shows a profit by the time it passes 510.66 on the rise . If he clings stubbornly to his original plan , continuing to buy , and the stock goes back to 540 again , he ends up with twenty-two shares worth $880 . He 's spent $280 for the stock , plus some $16.80 in broker 's commissions , and he has a profit of $583.20 , though the experience , no doubt , has left him shaken . if his stock stays at $5 , he 's sunk . He takes his loss and goes back to the savings bank with his $40 ; or he changes financial advisers and tries again . All the methods of getting into the market outlined above require the investor to make a decision as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do n't feel competent to make such judgments . They find it much simpler , therefore , to put their money into one of the huge mutual funds , whose stocks are sold not on the exchange but over the counter at the broker 's office . When you put your money in a mutual fund , you are , in effect , hiring a professional money manager to make your investments for you . The price you pay for stock in the fund is pooled with the millions coming in from other investors all over the country . With these millions the funds ' managers buy huge blocks of stock which their professional judgment tells them will prove profitable , and sell them when the time seems ripe . If they know their jobs  --  and Wall Street looks on the mutual-fund managers as among the sharpest professionals in the Street  --  your stock will show a slow , but steady , rise in value despite the fact that the combined " load , " or charge you must pay for this service , often runs to about 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such funds , the charge is substantially less . The individual investor has no say-so , of course , in what stocks the big funds buy or sell . He does have a fairly wide choice when he tries to decide what investment trust he wants to do his investing for him , for their numbers have grown greatly in recent years and there are now 177 of them listed on the financial pages . Many are conservative , balanced funds , keeping part of their capital resources in such safe securities as Government bonds or high-grade corporates . Others concentrate on growth stocks  --  small new companics that may be the blue chips of to . morrow . The present resources of the mutual funds total some $12,000,000,000 , which indicates they have been getting a heavy play from millions of people who wanted to get into the market and did n't quite know how , or were afraid to trust their own judgment in a time when the future seemed even more obscure than usual , Last year , when two big investment houses , Lehman Brothers and Lazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the staid old Wellington , a balanced trust , started a new fund to concentrate on equities , eager investors poured nearly $500,000 , - 000 into the till in a few weeks . The mutual funds , along with the other huge institutional investors  --  such as insurance companies , pension funds , and colleges and universities who are beginning , cautiously , to build up heavier stock portfolios as a hedge against inflation  --  seemingly have contributed a new element of stability to the market . Managed by the most sophisticated of professionals , they are not disturbed by the temporary and transitory daily jigglings of the averages . They lay out a long-range investment program and stick to it , perhaps for months , buying and selling quietly and carefully , so that the market will not be too greatly disturbed . Many of their larger transactions , which may involve thousands of shares , are made by private agreement , outside the auction market , or through special procedures set up by the exchange . " These boys do n't panic , " one Wall Streeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it shows up in the Federal Reserve Board indexes . When business seems to be heading into a little slump , they move quietly into defensive stocks  --  foods and tobacco , for example , for people have to eat and they are going to smoke , no matter if they are out of a job . If they see a pickup coming , they start moving into the cyclicals , the industries that prosper most at the beginning of a boom  --  steel , building materials , and the metals . " Neither has the individual investor shown any signs of panic so far . Three times , in 1956 , ' 57 , and again in November of ' 58 , the market took sudden plunges from high peaks , and no one could be sure how far the decline might go . Each time , however , the market has halted its plunge and started a slow climb back to new highs . The calmness of the investor , his willingness to squirrel away his stocks , no matter how frenziedly the market may jiggle , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exchange itself is a nonprofit organization , but its members are in the business of buying and selling stocks , and they thrive on volume , whether the market is rising or falling . And , generally speaking , brokers do n't get rich on the customer who buys a few shares of stock and tucks them away in his strongbox , letting them gather dust with his insurance policies  --  although it should be added that some of the brokerage houses are set up for precisely this type of investor . Though the mutual funds and the huge institutional funds may have served to put a floor under the market , their activities have also helped to drive the market to new highs . Money pours into the big pension funds and the investment trusts at the rate of $12,000 a minute , and this money ca n't be hidden away in a mattress . It must be put to work . But it has to be put to work where it will be reasonably safe . which means good , sound stocks . And , with the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not enough good ( Continued on Page 8 : ) 11 X C11111i7flerli 1r-on ! Pwr SO ) stock to go arxlund . The tierce competition for the blue chips , therefore , and for the promising grow Ilistocks has sent the price of a ivlatisely few issues soaring , discounting their earnings for years to conic . Some of the best issues are now selling at twenty to thirty times earnings , which disturbs old-timers. , who believe that when a stock starts selling at more than ten times earnings , it 's time to buy bonds . Wall Street blames the capital-gains tax for the this supply of stocks . The man who bought WOO shares of XYZ at 30 ten years ago , and has seen it rise to 100 , is not eager to sell and take his profit when he knows Uncle Sam will take up to one fourth of the gain , even though he is fully aware that the stock , at 100. is selling dangerously high . He prefers to hold on till he dies . This " locking in " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy a great disservice . Wall Street argues . it has not only driven prices of stocks in circulation to unreasonable highs but it also has starved new young companies that are desperately in need of equity capital . It is also depriving Uncle Sam of revenue , they argue , for if the stock is not sold , no tax is paid . Many plans ; ire suggested by which this situation ' night be remedied . If the tax were reduced by half , millions of dollars . ' worth of stock ma mid become available for trading , the ! Iasial experts say . If the stock who granted the same privilege as the man who sells his home at a profit  --  paying no tax if he buys another house at an equal or greater price  --  there would be a great spate of selling and buying . and young companies would get support for new stock issues they desperately need if they are to grow , There are no signs yet , however , that the tax gatherers are going to grant the investor any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some economists , that the best way to break out locked-in stocks is to start taxing them on their accrued , but unrealized , gains . The thought , of course , causes investors to shudder . Whatever the reason  --  fear of inflation , confidence in the future , a shortage of stocks  --  the market today , many Wall Streeters admit , is higher than present earnings justify . Stocks arc yielding , at the moment , less than bonds , a situation that also prevailed in the bull market of 1933 to ' 36 , and just before the great crash in 1929 . Nobody , though , expects a sudden flight from stocks to bonds : nobody expects a long-sustained and disastrous drop in the market . One reason is that today 's market , by contrast with the ' 20 's , is a cash market , The investor today must put up 90 per cent of the value of the stock , and cash money does not panic as quickly as borrowed money . Also , the mood of the market today is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming in , but he 's not looking for a quick killing , There are a few disturbing signs , however , other than the out-of-balance price-yield ratio . In recent months there has been a rise in short-term tradings , which indicates that sonic investors may be beginning to feel a touch of gambling fever . It is inevitable , the market experts say , that a long rise will generate a speculative fever  --  and this market has been rising for ten years , Even some of the cagey old-timers arc beginning to feel their pulses beat a little faster , and there is ebullient talk around Wall Street that in a few years earnings will be 50 per cent higher , dividends 40 per cent greater , and the market averages will be playing around 1000 , instead of the high 500 's . They haqc their optimism on the surg. ing growth of the United States . The country is growing in population at the rate of a city the size of Omaha every month , a Denmark every year . To pro . vide those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry must push production to the highest levels in all its history , they argue , and the market will keep pace with the upsurge , Here and there , however , a voice of caution is heard , One distinguished old gentleman who , in his years in Wall Street , has seen many a dream of riches wrecked when the market fell , had a word of advice for the eager investor . More than thirty years ago , before the crash of ' 29 , he said , The Saturday Evening Post , in an editorial , addressed itself to the man who was playing the market : Study business first and the tape second. , , , Have a reason , and not an excuse , for buying a stack .... A profit is a profit . If your stock keeps going up after you sell , do n't stew , .. , And do n't take anybody 's word for what the market will surely do .
