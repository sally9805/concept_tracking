Affects 5,000,000 Patrons PLEA CITES HIGHER COSTS Homes Here Would Pay 50 to 75c a Month More  --  Early Decision by P.S.C. Doubted The New York Telephone Company asked yesterday for another state-wide rate increase , which it said would average 7% to 8 per cent and total $44,000,000 a year . The increase would be effective on March 1 . Last May the company received an 11 per cent increase amountine. to $48,500,000 . In a petition filed with the Public Service Commission at Albany , the company defended the proposed rates as " just and reasonable , " asserting they were made necessary chiefly by the rise in wages and taxes since May . The company reserved the right to seek additional increases if the price level continued to rise . The petition requested prompt action , but no immediate decision by the Public Service Commission is expected , according- to an - Associated Press dispatch from Albany . This said the commission usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and review of company statistics . The next meeting of the commission is scheduled for Feb. 6 , when it may set a hearing date on the petition . F. C. C. Investigating Rates On Jan. 19 the Federal Communications Commission ordered an inquiry into interstate and foreign long-distance telephone service to determine whether the rates in those fields could be reduced . The Bell System , operated by the American Telephone &; Telegraph Company , and its twenty-two affiliates in the United States , including the New York Telephone Company , were directed to file a statement with the commission before March 23 . When the inquiry was ordered , an A. T. &; T. spokesman said its rates were inadequate and that greater revenues were needed to meet increased demands resulting from the defense program . More than 5,000,000 telephone subscribers in New York State were affected by yesterday 's petition , including 4,000,000 in New York City and on Long Island . A company statement said its proposed rates would increase the cost of message-rate residential service in New York City , both individual and party line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in outlying parts of Queens would pay 75 cents a month more . Business messagerate service would be increased $1.50 a nionth . These rises were exclusive of taxes . Examples of Its Effect Some typical examples were cited : In Manhattan , a residential subscriber now paying $4.75 for seventy-five messages a month , at the individual message - rate , would have to pay $5.25 for the same number of messages  --  an increase of about 11 per cent . A business subscriber now paying $7 at the individual message-rate for seventy-five messages a month would pay $8.50 , an increase of about 21 per cent . In outer sections of Queens , flatrate individual residential subscribers with unlimited service who now pay $5.25 a month would pay $6 , or about 14 per cent more . The cost of additional messages , over the seventy-five a month allowed for residential and business message-rate subscribers , would be increased in this manner : Present schedule : first 300 messages , 5 cents each ; next 300 , 4% cents each ; next 300 , 4% cents each ; over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 500 messages , 5 cents each ; next 500 , 4% cents each ; over 1,000 , 4% cents each . Under the proposed schedules , // rates for upstate residential subscribers would be increased in urban areas by 50 cents a month , in rural areas 75 cents . Upstate business subscribers would pay $1.50 to $2.50 a month more , depending on the locality . Service upstate is on a flat-rate basis generally , but the messagerate prevails for some subscribers in the larger cities . The company 's petition , signed by Keith S. , president , said post-war increases in labor and material costs , combined with new construction needs to meet public demands for additional telephone service , had compelled it in 1948 to request rate increases to raise $63,500,000 in new revenues . Mr. recalled that last May the Public Service Commission granted an increase of $48 , - 500,000 , or $15,000,000 less than was requested . New Pressure Cited A few weeks after the present rates were put into effect , he said , South Korea was invaded and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company granted wage increases raising labor costs by $16,878,000 a year ; of this , $14,532,000 is plicabIe to operations within New York State . " The revenue required to offset this increase , " he reclared , " is approximately $17,653,000 , of which $15,200,000 is required to offset the higher level of intrastate labor expense . " " In addition to the above differential in labor cost , " he continued , " the new contracts cornmitted petitioner to wage increases based on length of service amounting to approximately $5,800,000 ir 1951 . " He said the new Federal income tax for corporations  --  now 47 per cent  --  raised the company 's 1951 tax by $8,721,000 , of which $7,403 , . 000 is applicable to intrastate operations . " The revenue required to offset this increase , " he reported , " is approximately $17,211,000 per annum , of which $14,610,000 is required to offset the higher level of intrastate lexpenses caused by said charge . " Increased material and labor costs , he asserted , will increase the cost of the company 's 1951 construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended , is just enough to meet additional revenue needs caused by wage and tax increases and the failure of the P. S. C. last May to grant the pay increase requested . This combined need , he explained , would be larger , except 1that it had been offset to some I extent by a reduction in 1951 deI predation rates granted by the Federal Communications Commission . May Ask Even More He said no request for higher rates was being made because of increased construction costs or length-of-service wage increases , but that it might be necessary to make such requests later . " The proposed rates , " he pointed out , " would increase petitioner 's annual revenue approximately 19 per cent over revenues which would have been obtained under rates in effect in 1939 . This is a much smaller increase than the increase in the price of almost every other commodity or service purchased by the public . " In a press statement Mr. said consumer prices in general had increased 75 per cent since 1939 , according to the Bureau of Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked by the company would amount to less than 2 cents a day for most of its residential customers . Mr. recalled that the rate rise received by the company last year was its first permanent rate increase in twenty years . He explained that the proposed new increase was " essential to enable us to keep on doing a good job . " In the last five years , he reported , the company has provided 2,000,000 new telephones in the state , including more than 1,000 , - 000 in New York City . Indicating that the post-war expansion and improvement program had cost $780,000,000 , including $475,000,000 in new investment , he said : " The company plans to go right ahead with its program of expansion and improvement , using every bit of the materials and supplies that will be available to it xt the coming year .
