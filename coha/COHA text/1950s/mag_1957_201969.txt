Within 24 hours after Britain 's White Paper leap into the missile age ( TIME , April 15 ) , West Germany 's Chancellor Konrad Adenauer took a spry leap of his own . West Germany , he declared , must also have some atomic weapons-just like Britain . <P> <P> From one of West Germany 's principal nuclear-research centers , the Max Planck Institute of Physics in Gttingen , came an unexpected rejoinder . Led by four Nobel Prizewinners-among them 77-year-old Otto Hahn , the first man to split the uranium atom-18 scientists proclaimed their " great worry " over Adenauer 's proposal . One hydrogen bomb , they warned , could render the whole Ruhr Valley " uninhabitable . " Worse yet , " the entire West German Republic could be rubbed out " by spreading radioactivity . The hooker : all 18 pledged themselves not to help the West German government in any way in " the production , testing or even use " of atomic weapons . <P> " We side with freedom as it exists today in the Western world in contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " mutual fear of the hydrogen bomb contributes substantially to the preservation of peace " today , but " we hold this way of preserving peace to be unreliable in the long run . For a small country such as West Germany we believe the best defense of itself and of world peace lies in the voluntary forgoing of possession of atomic weapons in any form . " <P> Konrad Adenauer hit the ceiling . In this election year the opposition , Socialists and Free Democrats , have vigorously decried any attempt to equip the Bundeswehr with tactical atomic weapons . Since Adenauer had intended from the start to get his nuclear weapons from the U.S.-Germany is treaty-bound not to produce them itself-he professed not to be disturbed by the scientists ' pledge not to help make or test them . ( " None of these 18 gentlemen , " he snapped , " has been asked by anyone to cooperate in this matter , and none will be . " ) But he was plainly angry to hear a Who 's Who of German scientists declare that nuclear abstention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , was a political matter , and " has nothing to do with scientific knowledge . "
