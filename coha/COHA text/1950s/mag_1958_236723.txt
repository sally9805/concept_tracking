Explaining graciously that business needs " a shot in the arm , " Baltimore 's Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr . last month urged the city council to repeal Baltimore 's tax on newspaper and TV advertising ( TIME , Nov. 18 ) , which Mayor Tommy had himself rammed through last fall . Last week , while the council mulled over the mayor 's proposal ( which would also give a shot in the arm to Democrat D'Alesandro 's campaign for the U.S. Senate ) , Maryland 's general assembly beat Tommy to the gun by passing a Senate-approved bill outlawing ad taxes anywhere in the state . Republican Governor Theodore R. McKeldin assured newsmen that he would sign the bill into law , thus boosting his own campaign to succeed Tommy D'Alesandro as Baltimore 's mayor .
