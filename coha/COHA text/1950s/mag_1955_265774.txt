In deference to a custom of long standing , Canada 's Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent will broadcast a message to the Canadian people on New Year 's morning . St. Laurent recorded the speech last week just before leaving Ottawa to spend the holidays at his Quebec City home . The actual text was to be kept secret until the broadcast , but one of the aides who helped prepare it disclosed what the tone of the message would be .

The decline was due almost entirely to the prairie crop failure , which cut farm production by just about $500 million . Except for that one unavoidable setback , the Canadian economy in 1954 had kept pace with the record 1953 rate , and fully warranted an optimistic report by Prime Minister St. Laurent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
