Recommended anti-shadow techniques : <P> 1 ) Proceed to your objective by a roundabout path . Circle it three times , keeping a sharp watch for enemies . If none are visible , dash suddenly into your objective . <P> 2 ) If you suspect that someone is following you , walk past the nearest police station . When the plainclothesman nears the station , turn back in time to meet him at the entrance , seize him and take him inside . Explain to the police officer in the station that you 've arrested the detective and demand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this phase of the cold war , the detective section of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Bureau last week issued a service handbook with a special chapter on " Shadowing a Suspect . " Salient pointers : <P> 1 ) Wear noiseless footwear and , if the suspect knows you , wear a disguise . <P> 2 ) Policemen are usually distinguished by their attitude , so do n't act like a policeman . <P> 3 ) If discovered by the suspect , keep cool ; act nonchalant .
