Last week the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a new , granary-bulging forecast of crop prospects for 1955 : the harvest for all crops this year is expected to be 6% above last year 's and to equal , if not exceed , the record yield of 1948 . Bumper production is anticipated in corn ( 17% over 1954 , and the second-largest crop in history ) , oats ( 8% higher than 1954 ) , sorghum grains ( up 30% ) , hay ( up 5% ) , soybeans ( up 23% ) , cotton ( 30% above the average yield ) , wheat ( 5% above the latest forecast ) and peanuts ( 50% above last year ) . <P> The huge 1955 yields reflect a growing efficiency on the farm-new fertilizers , insecticides and machinery-which might in ordinary times be cause for congratulations all around . But to a U.S. Government already burdened by $7 billion worth of surplus farm products , they are a thumping new headache . <P> The bigger yields on fewer acres expose a loophole in the Department of Agriculture 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer 's income up : it has dropped 10% in the past year. * As a result , the Department of Agriculture seemed to have a choice of three courses : 1 ) apply more and tougher controls on acreage ; 2 ) adopt an entirely different kind of farm program , e.g. , a subsidy for the agricultural end product ( the old Brannan Plan ) , or 3 ) try to improve the market for U.S. farm products overseas . <P> Last week Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson 's men were hard at work on the third alternative . So far , Benson &; Co. have had only middling success in selling surplus farm products . The overflow of agricultural oils ( soybean and cottonseed ) has been reduced from 1 billion to 55 million lbs . since 1953 , and overall dairy surpluses have fallen by a full 54% as a result of increased U.S. consumption and a giveaway program . But last week Iowa farmers were asked to reseal on their own farms some 50 million bushels of corn , deliverable this month to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no market and no storage space . <P> To step up his sales , Secretary Benson turned to salesmanship . As general sales manager of the Commodity Stabilization Service , he appointed Frank C. Daniels , 59 , of Binghamton . N.Y. , who has spent most of his life selling farm products . Before he came to the C.S.S. as a consultant last year , he was secretary and general manager of Cooperative Feed Dealers , Inc. , of Binghamton , a commercial agricultural supply distribution organization . Salesman Daniels is expected to recruit a staff of commodity sales specialists from private industry , and to begin a worldwide huckstering program . <P> * After the new crop forecasts were announced last week , soybean futures fell about 6 , corn 3 , wheat went down 3 and cotton dropped 32 points .
