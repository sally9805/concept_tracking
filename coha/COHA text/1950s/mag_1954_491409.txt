PART FOUR FTER sessions of sixty-eight , forty-four and shirty-two hours , my communist interrogators and I were exhausted . Then , in an apoplectic outburst , Colonel Kim announced , " ALI right , this is the end . We 're going to torture you . Do you know how we torture people ? " I said , " No . " He described a process in which water is forced either into the mouth or the rectum , under pressure . The latter , he said , " forces everything in you  --  everything  --  to come out your mouth . We wo n't let you die , but it 's very sickening . " I said , " That sounds good to me . I think that 'll kill me quickly . That sounds all right . " Now he spluttered . " Sometimes , " he said , " we drive bamboo splinters up under the fingernails and set fire to them . " I laughed , but perhaps it was forced . " Also , " he said , " we have electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the morning we 'll take you there . You 'll probably die under the torture , but not until you 've given us the information we want ? in detail . Do you want to write a last message ? " I said , " No . " He said , " Then you must sign a statement that you do not want to write a last message . " I said , " All right , I 'll write a last letter to my farn ? ily . " He gave me paper and a pencil , and I wrote : Dear Alddred , done and Boll was physically captured un August 125 and have been a prisoner ever since . I did not surrender , but was physically overpowered . Before I was imp-limed , I wandered in the hills for thirty  --  five days without food . Asa result .

Let that always be your aim . Mildred . remember that for twenty-four years you have made me very , very happy . " ( I .011i ? I on Page 115 ) ( Eton ' . rage 270 When it was translated , Kim said , " What : ' Why did you say you were ill . ' That you 're going to die ? Why did n't you tell them that we 're going to kill you ' ? " I was a little out of patience . I swear too much , but this was a justified occasion . 1 said , " Why , you dumb swine ! I know you 'd neversend out a let tersaying that . If Urn going to write a let ter to my family , I want t hem t o get it 1 didn't. write t hat for your benefit . I wrote that so my family would know I was dead , and what I was thinking about . You 're so damn dumb ! Now you can kill me and it 'll never he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He just looked at me without a word . Then he stomped out . One guard always walked around this building , and another stayed in my room , each with a submachine gun . But they had one extra gun , which always stood in a corner of the guards ' room , against my partition . I could see it through cracks in the wall . The only furniture in that big room was the cot which had been taken from me . It sat in the center . The Morris chairs remained in my room , however . I 'd noticed that when no officer was present , room guards frequently flopped down in one of them . Sometimes they dozed . This morning I thought . Well , this is the day . If they do take me up there , I 'm so weak that I might say something , I might tell them something before I die . I 've got to get that gun . I 'd been watching it previously with an idea that as soon as I was strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I knew that by this time I could n't have made a hundred yards , even if nobody interfered . So I thought . That 's out now . I 've got to knock myself off , and fast , before this torture starts . The guard in my room promptly slumped in the chair and obligingly went to sleep . so I watched the twenty guards in the other room . If t hey went to breakfast in the cook shack next door and the guard on duty did n't waken , the time would be ripe . About five-thirty they all trooped out . Colonel Kim . Choe , Major Kim and Hong all slept in the cook shack  --  or so I thought . The interpreters were in I heir " wit room , with the door shut . So , when these people left , I started crawling . I 'd examined one of those 81111111/101i111 guns with t he drum magazine al . T111011 knew ISION double triggers worked . I thought , I 'll lire one shad burst out the window . If old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running out of the cook shack to see what it 's all about . The second burst will get him . Then I 'll stick the muz. , 71e in my mouth and finish the job  --  but I 'll have Kim 's company when I go . I would n't rrrent la n /SS that . From near I he door , I looked up , and I thought it was Hong sleeping in the chair . I kept on crawling , through the door , past the cot and to the gun . I got it in my hands and came up to a kneeling position . Then I tried to pull the bolt back , but it jammed . I worked at it , and must have made some noise . There was a bellow behind me . From t he cot ? crawling , I had n't been able to tell anyone was there  --  Hong swung down and rushed me . Instead of sleeping on the finer of the cook shack where he belonged , like any good member of the proletariat , this character had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the gun . There was no time for Kim now , but I could get Hong  --  or I could have , if I could have solved that jammed bolt . But Hong was a brave man . He charged right into the barrel of that gun . And the damned thing would n't tire . Hong hit me from the front , the room guard from the side . Then there were Koreans all over me . In seconds it was all over . Nobody heat me , but I was marched hack to my own room and seated in a straight chair . When Lee , the interpreter , came in , the first thing he said was , " Why , general , you would have killed me ! " I said , " No . I wanted to get that sonof-a-gun , Kim , and myself . They said they were going to torture me , and I did n't intend to be tortured . " He said , " Oh , they did n't say that . " Ifle had n't been there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sure.1 " They will never torture you . General , you must never take your life . There 's always hope . But I 'm afraid you would have killed me. general . " I never saw Colonel Kim again . The only thing I can hope is that he did n't drop dead . He and I have a few things I still want , In diecuas . I eat in the chair until midmorning , while guards look away the drawstrings from my shorts and everything else with which I conceivably could commit suicide . Choe came in and said , " I want you to know that there is on increased guard , here and at the village . You 're going to be tried for armed insurrection . You were trying to escape , were n't you ? " I said , " In my condition , I do n't think I could have , but I would have liked to kill Colonel Kim and myself . " " No , " he said . " You were trying to escape . That 's armed insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was terribly sorry to see it was the one man who had been kind to me before , even letting me pick up chestnuts in the yard . Choe said , " Was this man asleep when you went out ? " I said , " No . Colonel Hong was asleep in that chair when I went out . " But Choe shook his head . He said , " Colonel Hong was on the lied in the other room , and took the gun away from you . This is the man who was on guard and went to sleep . " Perhaps I could have covered up for this fellow if I had n't already spoken about the sleeping man . But now it was too late . They led out the poor guard . I suppose they shot him . That night guards brought . back my cot , mattress and bed covers , also my clothing . Choe came once more  --  this time in a d  --  rerent mood . " Colonel Kim is gone , " he said , " and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and we 're going to make you a patient . Before we do anything else , we must make you well again . " The next . morning another doctor thumped my chest , but nobody else bothered me until October first . Then Choe said , " I 'm leaving tomorrow night . I 'm supposed to get some information from you . As a personal favor to me , will you write what you think you could improve on if you were to be military governor of South Korea again ? What do you feel you did well ? If you do this , it will look like I 've done something  --  and I 'll assure you that you 'll go to a POW camp . as you wish . " So I wrote a note . I said that I was proud of our record in agriculture , rehabilitation of mills and communications , and especially of the free popular election of l9-18 . Choe then wanted me to write something about Syngman Rhee , so I wrote : " I feel that he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 41 man who has devoted his whole life to a free and united Korea , and everything he does , he feels is in the best interests of his country . " This satisfied Choe , who departed on October second . So did I , about ten P.M. , on a small truck which also carried a couple of iron safes ; Tal , the interpreter ; a lieutenant ; the driver and three guards  --  U Eun Chur , Pack Chun Bong and Dee Soon Yur . As we pulled out , Lee , staying behind , said , " Good-by , general . Do n't , try to kill yourself . You must live , and soon everything will be tine again , and you will see your family . " We moved north among convoys of trucks . Anyone could tell this was a retreating army , going fast . It 's not far to Huichon , but we were thirteen hours getting there . But on that chilly night I was astonished by the actual tenderness of the guards  --  especially U Eun Chur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'IIE SATURDAY around toe to keep me worm , That trip was the find of many , so similar that they 're difficult to remember individually . U 's kindness was almost my lirst Ansel experience with the many-foiled , kind end cruel , inventive , clever . et lipid , resilient and unpredictable clylirouler of Koreans . A good many things happened to me , hut nothing more important than coming to know these people as I never could have in a lifetime HO an uncaptured general . It may almost have been worth the three years . Korean country-town hotels and ordinary Korean homes have no furniture . 1 mean that literally . I slept that day in a hotel on the floor . And for most of a thousand nights thereafter I continued to sleep on floors ? sometimes on concrete or day hot to the touch from flues imbedded in it . The typical North Korean house is a two-room structure with a kitchen . That is to say , a kitchen about four by eight feet is built on ground level , with a whole side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room side , but with a fiat top broken by holes for three cooking pots . Flues from this fireplace lead under the raised floors of the other moms , each eight feet square , before the smoke escapes up a chimney . The kitchen is equipped with a few rice bowls , a stone water jar and the three stove pots  --  one for rice , one for soup , the third for water . One room may contain a closet , but there is no furniture . Walls are mud , reinforced by corn stalks ; the roof is thatched . There may be some windows , but never glass . In such houses I lived three years . More important , in such houses live the people of North Korea all the time . On those floors they sleep , eat. , work tirelessly and pore , hour after hour , over the texts of communism : Stalin and Engels , the devil 's mixture of fact and half truth , fancy and outright lies . That concoction is beautifully prepared for just such people , with centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death as constant companions , end not the slightest concept of comforts we know . One guard who left Sunan with us stayed with me until a few weeks before 1 was repatriated , and I came to know him well . But if 11 could bring this convinced communist to the United States to try to change his mind . I 'm not sure I 'd show him legislatures at work or even courts where the accused has a chance . Rather , I 'd take Dee Soon Yur first to an American supermarket , past a 100-foot retail meat counter . I 'd like him to see in one minute more meat ? kiwi to him  --  than he 's seen in an entire life . I 'd like him to watch a trainload of chickens leaving a Petaluma , California , processing plant for market , to see milking machines in a modern dairy . Kansas wheat elevators and an Iowa cornfield , a big knitting mill and 1000 sheep in a band . I 'm not sure that he processes of democracy would impress him especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy  --  t his man whose father and grandfather were hungry and who knits beautifully because he must in order to have new wicks or gloves  --  I think I could unmake a communist fast . Of course , / was n't thinking of any of his in Huichon . That night , we walked few blocks to a Korean-Japanese house  --  that is , one which had a room heated by an under-floor undor , also a typical Japanese tatami-mat room with no heat at all . I had two blankets as my only luggage . My guards had one each , but always slept in their clothing ? long EVENINC 14/ST cotton underwear , two or throe pairs of tronusersrindan equal number of el to rt and sweaters . While we were there . the interpreter in chnrge bought fond with a If NV1811 hand ? hog liver , chicken , beef heart , ego end greens in addition to rice . We had no beverage except stihn-aaha , which is water boiled in the rice pot before it has been scraped , full of brown fragments and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken with great elurpings of enjoyment , is t he typical ending for a Korean meal . But . I was still too ill to enjoy much of this food , and even disappointed the cook when she prepared an obvious treat ? sweet potatoes . But in Korea it 's always whole hog or none , so for that meal we had nothing but sweet potatoes . I had difficulty in eating two . Each guard ate the full six allot ted him . We had been at Huichon a few days and I waa ready to decide that . Life as a prisoner was not too bad . / was getting sun baths on a porch . A doctor came to thump my chest , but also lanced my infected left foot , heretofore untreated , and sent medicine which cured it rapidly . To relieve boredom , I killed flies , although I had to pick up each body carefully ? we slept and ate on that floor . But then a major visited us . And in his wake came two of the restrictive orders I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not sleep well at night , I must not even lie down during the day ; and because somebody might see me ? a constant fear ? I could neither take sun baths nor stand up , even inside the house . So for eighteen months , I could not stand up except to make a necessary trip . I think the guards had asked for both these orders . Housing was already at a premium in North Korea , but the communist theory against private property fixed everything simply by making every private home a public place , as needed . Soldiers moved into homes with families or moved families out . Travelers were billeted by police orders . I think the woman who cooked for us in the house at Huichon actually owned it . But we were billeted there , and in the middle of another night the household was increased by a grandmother , two younger women , six children and a major acting as escort for these families of some government officials . These people all crowded into the second room . During daylight I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on patrol . And during this last day at Huichon , an air strike hit the railroad area . The interpreter was downtown when the raid came , and when he returned I asked him what the planes had been aiming for . He said , " The railroad . " I said , " What did they get ? " " One car in the street , " he said , " one house and two women about four hundred yards from the tracks . " Trains continued to run . But that evening I heard a call which was to come frequently , " Paliti , pahl " The rough translation is " Hurry . " I rolled up my blankets , and after we had waited four hours the same truck which had brought us t here picked us up again , but this time the major 's party also tried to get in . There simply was not room , so in the end we pulled away without the grandmother , one two-year-old girl , the interpreter , the lieutenant and one guard . The major , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult males aboard . We joined the jam of north-hound traffic . This was a high , open truck , the cold was bitter , and I wrapped a blanket Febrillir Ill , ( 1St around myself to keep warm . After two hours , blocked by traffic ahead , we slopped part way up a mountain grade with a 200-foot drop to the right . Three men went Fl bead to invest lots , and the at her gunrd stepped off the truck , 80 decided to rearrange my blanket . I stepped on the Front , sent , some seven feet from the ground , then yanked the blanket ? and jerked my own feet right out from under me . I pitched forward , could not free my hands and so landed on my head in the gravel , rolled and went over the cliff . I grabbed for anything  --  and one scrub tree was where / needed it . I hung on . When I looked itiliiii , eIcawnays aonbwo o six ast 2s 10 feet from wtp. the top . The guard , U , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scrambled partially up with his help . When the major also reached down . I assumed that he , too , would help me . But to my amazement , he began slapping me around the head . I swore at him ? it does n't matter what I said ? : end presently he did stop slapping and gave me a hand . My head was bleeding , but I was more scratched than anything else . We got buck in the truck and finally pulled ahead once more . No one there spoke English , so I had to wait until the interpreter rejoined us , five days later , to find out what in the world the major had thought he was doing . The interpreter said , " He just lost his head , and was very sorry . He thought you were trying to commit Suicide , and he would have been severely punished if anything had happened to you . " This was October thirteenth . In the early dawn we passed men in padded uniforms , marching south  --  Chinese coming in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . Aircraft were over us frequently . Thousands of civilians walked north along the roads . From byways came whole cadres of unarmed youths . marching in military formation . It looked like a mass mobilization of every male over fourteen . We finally reached Choesin-Jong , a suburb of Manpo and on the Yalu River border between Korea and Manchuria , that day . The major 's party was taken to a big house , the rest of us to a filthy one-roomer  --  a room seven feet by seven , partly occupied by a closet . The woman who had been moved out by our arrival cooked for us . And once a young man stepped over us while we were trying to sleep , and took from the closet the uniform of a second lieutenant in the security forces . Rank may have privileges in North Korea , but they do n't include keeping a roof over your wife 's head . I 'd been thinking about escape , of course . But the hard fact was , I could n't hope to got anywhere . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house . My only reassurance was the thought , Well , this is all sntItpair lioro:ignate some oehr ekp:rt t making lieutenants  --  whose ggl Hatfitisirhldt eav oiit I'ada ninn e tcyt tag ri " long again- cand ' ot use anystart twenty-five-pound slpeopleonuaru I dntineldrinwpe iwmohasreha s eanosleepingk-mcal mkgefoedelvdxtoe. of moved tpotr eoMmb. uapya a also 1p ayo na c twith a nb u sd e always on guard in an eight-foot-square room  --  and a captain took the other room of our new house . I judged the officers recently had been in Seoul and all had loot  --  American .45 's , cigarettes and six bottles of penicillin . Presently a woman lieutenant , also loot-laden , moved into the room with the captain . rote can be interpreted only as II necessary arrengement . This North Korean army is about as devoid of sex lie Hay group of young men I 've seen . I ca n't explain the Inek of apparent intereat , the dearth of calendar art or sex talk . But none of these t Mugs appeared , except at rare interval/4e At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing along American silk dresses , cosmetics and a bottle of fine French perfume , which she prized . But the moment she left the house , nn enlisted guard went through her luggage , found the perfume end used half of it as hair tonic . The place smelled like seven compressed beauty parlors . This woman did kink familiar to me , but I could not place her  --  and the only English any of these people had came from one lieutenant  --  who had the jerks as well as a leg injured in jumping out of a truck during an air raid . He gave me his entire repertoire without warning , but with a big smile . He said , " Nice O.K. " But Tel , the interpreter , appeared again October twentieth , explaining that he 'd walked all the way from Huichon . He gave the lady lieutenant a chance to ask me a question  --  did I remember seeing her before ? The question made things fall into place . I remembered Chonju , and a woman political instructor trying to hold class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . obviously delighted that I should recall her . We now moved to a larger house , and the guard left at Huichon rejoined us  --  he had walked fourteen days . The interpreter , Tat , spent his days away on mysterious missions , but one night asked me about the 10th Corps and Maj. Gen. Edward iNedl Almond . I told him a few bits about General Almond from World War 11 ? which are in all the histories  --  and myself savored the knowledge that we again had a 10th Corps . I was feeling better all the time , as these people felt worse ? and they were obviously convinced the jig was up . An even more definite indication of the way things were going was provided by one person who came to the house briefly . This individual waited until he could not he overheard ; then whispered to me , " Could you walk seventy-eight miles ? " I knew precisely what he had in mind , and that he was thinking of his fate as much as mine . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can crawl that far . " But he shook his head . ? ' Very cold , " he said . " Much snow . " While I watched , he talked himself clear out of the idea , and the opportunity to escape never came so close again . In-geed , I went to Manchuria . There must he a couple of million Kims in Korea , but the one who took me across the Yalu River under guard was a churlish , English-speaking Captain Kim , whose standard comment was , " It 's immaterial . " He admitted he had learned English at school in Kokura , Japan , my old headquarters , but thereafter I got no information . Wearing no insigne , he said his rank and name were both " immaterial , " and he did n't care if I just called him , " Hey , you ! " Thousands were lined up to cross a pontoon bridge over the Yalu , but the pass the captain showed at each end got us attend of Chem . On the other side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat ? more then I 'd seen in months . Mule-drawn vehicleeeppeared . Venders hawked a sort of corn Hull . I asked Captain Kim if he had been in Manchuria before  --  and got a straight lie . " This is n't Manchuria , " he said . " This is a Chinese section of Korea , " I said , ' " I'hen what was the river we crossed ? " 1 mt . this time got no answer at all . We drove a few miles to a town which must have been Chian. and there went . through a kitchen  --  where a mule walked around and around to operate a corn-fluff press  --  into a sort . of hotel . Here four of us slept on a shelf , while one guard always stayed on watch . That first night we had an excellent Chinese dinner from the hotel kitchen , but the captain and guards decided they did n't like it . So thereafter , one guard brought our food from some Korean source , and I had to eat the usual rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  soup with lots of meat stock , pork cooked in tiny pieces and oceans of gravy  --  was cooking right in the next room . But I passed through that kitchen several times each night , and each time I approached the press , I grabbed a fluff or two of corn . I felt like is small boy sticking a finger in the icing of his mother 's cake . It tasted wonderful . The rest of the time I watched the millions of flies which inhabited the hotel , crawled over our faces as we slept , and quite often got into our mouths with bites of food . With a swatter 1 could have killed a thousand at one blow . At night variety was provided by the captain , who was a pinwheel sleeper . All night long that character pivoted on his head , kicking the other three of us in rotation without ever waking up . The only person not miserable was the guard on duty , who was entertained . I think I was taken to Manchuria because the Koreans intended to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up . So they could not afford to kill me , and even were forced to take a chance that the Chinese might demand my custody in Manchuria . The moment their military situation improved  --  October thirtieth  --  I was hauled back across the river again . This Lime the trip was made in a snow and sleet storm . I was crowded into the back seat of a jeep , and a suitcase with rough edges kept bouncing against my shins . This was more painful than it sounds . and I finally said , " Stop the jeep . " Captain Kim , in front , said , " What 's the matter ? " But when I told him , he used his standard answer : " That 's immaterial . " Well , you can take that sort of thing only so long . I said , " The hell it 's immaterial . Stop this jeep right now , " And I pulled back my list as if I were going to hit him . When I think about it , I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these commies , it worked  --  shoving the police sentry when I was a fugitive ; trying to kill Colonel Kim ; now this business of hitting the captain , who could have mowed me down in my condition with one hand . Perhaps I should have tried such tactics more often . I le At leAS1 1 did gel the jeep stopped and that suite/lee off my shins . We wen ( across the river and into the narrow streets of Manpo . At a corner I looked up a side street . Men were marehing I here in the teem. , their bends hied , heir gall that of I he very weary . I gee . I hem only for a 1110t1Writ , end I hen We had gone past , 1 looked beck frantically , but never got another glimpse of ( hose American prisoners plodding through I he night .

Planes bombed the area . Chinese soldiers passed by , and now and then I glimpsed Russian officers and civilians through the windows . Once , Choe came with more questions . He was fairly pleasant , but wanted to know where the let and 3rd divisions of the United States Army had been stationed . When I told him I had no idea , I also asked why he wanted to know , and he said a broadcast had announced they were coming to Japan . ( Actually , the 3rd at this time was already in Korea , the 1st in Europe. , I asked Choe for news about the war . He said , " You wo n't give us any information , so why should I tell you anything ? " He also asked whether I had seen the light and was now willing to co-operate  --  and in the next breath asked a give-away question : Was it true we were landing two Japanese divisions in Korea ? I told him I knew nothing , but of course there easily were enough trained Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was struck by the expression of outright terror which crossed Choe 's face . Hatred of the Japanese is beyond belief in Korea  --  and so is fear of the small soldiers from t he islands . lived with , but did not recover from , the every-fifty-minute kidney trouble which had suddenly replaced my dysentery . I sat with my back against a mud wall and refought bat-t les of the summer of 1950. 1 worried about my family and others  --  and I began planning and replanning a dinner to he served on my first night of freedom : prime ribs , an artichoke , a baked potato with cheese and butter , quick-frozen peas and a roll , head lettuce with French dressing , ice cream and a big cup of black coffee . Thinking about food helped to keep me warm . So did massaging my bare toes hour after hour . Bare , they were warmer than in socks . We had brief heat when meals were cooked , but at few other times . The temperature flirted with zero . Once I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by building a smoky lire under a Japanese-type tub . I looked forward to one of those parboiling sessions familiar to everyone in Japan . But when I finally went to the tiny bathing room ? accompanied by a lieutenant to prevent . my escape ? I discovered this Korean bath was merely a business of soaping down , then rinsing off  --  never getting into the tub of lovely hot water . It was n't the bath I 'd built in my mind ? and the lieutenant used most of my only bar of soap . I also was permitted to wash once a day , and worked out a system to get a partial sponge bath out ? legman basin of warm water . But it was complicated by the fact that the washcloth 1 laid down beside the pan always froze before I could pick it up again . Mostly I watched the Koreans  --  sometimes ten of us were living in one eight-by-eight room and even were S ATLI 11DAY , dile to sleep Home by synchronizing our position shifts . Usually , there were three guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11111 Soon , to cook ; and assorted officers , U. Eun Chur was the sergeant in charge of the guard , and ell of them kept busy , . One always watched me , and at least one WAS usually off trying to buy food . We had no food issue ; they were given money to buy it . Each of them spent a minimum of two hours a day studying communist doctrine and copying page after page in notebooks . Frankly 1 doubt that they understood ( hose chapters of The History of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union which treated of dialectic materialism . These people had no thread , no nails , no leather , very little cloth of any kind . So they unraveled old socks to knit new ones ; rolled thin yarn strands together to make thicker skeins ; manufactured nails out of wire , and resoled their own shoes  --  and eventually mine  --  with rubber cut from old truck tires . Dee Soon Yur , the most kindly of the trio , was a middleweight above the waist , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a twelve-year-old child and his fingers the shortest I 've ever seen on a grown man . With them , though , he could thread a needle in the dark . IJ , the old army man , could not resist taking apart each new watch he was issued , an that the most rugged of them lasted five days . Pack , he youngest and obviously the brightest , was the favorite of the girl cook , who shared her night cover with him  --  hut in spite of her obvious interest , Pack never did anything about it .. None of these men ever had any time off or received more than an occasional letter . The only variety in their diet or mine was a very rare helping of parched soy beans or , in the evening , a shared bowl of pop-kaythe browned rice that sticks to the cooking pot . Of this kat , I never got a EVENING POST full share because U , for some reason , objected to it . The guard would gather around the howl rind Pack or Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested . So , for live days , in hurt pride , I refused their offerings . Then I saw my refusal was not . hurting U in the least , and pride gave wry to hunger . Thereafter I took what they handed me , like a little child . E. Kum Soon , also kind , washed my clothes and sewed a cotton batting between my blankets for extra warmth . But , one of her habits did annoy me . Each day after breakfast , she would wash outside , then return to our room with her hair damp , sit facing the light and pour on her hair it pink , glycerine us cream , a popular American brand . Then she 'd comb and the glycerin would Hy off intn my face as 1 sat behind her . I was n't permitted to move , so could only duck or shield my face with my hands . The guard always had a real fine laugh . When she left us , I did want to give her some token of appreciation ? and I remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ornamental buttons off my jacket sleeves and gave her the half dozen . I thought she was pleased  --  but later I saw Pack sewing those selfsame buttons on his own clothes . The girl sergeant was replaced by a civilian woman , Pyun , as cook . Meals improved . In her twenties , Pyun had a beautiful face and more figure than most Korean women ? but the scarred and blunt hands of a day laborer . She also had smashed her left-hand fingers somehow , losing the nails and acquiring a bad infection . To my consternation , she squeezed blood and pus from these every night after a full day 's work , I learned later that Pyun woe the wife of a colonel who had been demoted to private for some prewar financial error . But the guards explained that he worked very hard and finally had risen to major again . rebruory 13 , PM For all of us , Manpo was a period of uncertain waiting ; and only the guards had a diversion , a game called Chong. gun ? general officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play is on the line intersections rather than the squares , and that some pieces have slightly different capabilities . Off-duty guards began playing this , and watched until I thought I understood the game . Finally I challenged the poorest player , then began to play regularly , with much help from kibitzers  --  until the night Choe visited us . The next day I challenged one guard , who shook his head . Another also re-Fumed to play me , so I set up the hoard , intending to work out some moves by myself . But U , in a growling mood , took it away . Although 1 could not understand his language , I did understand that there was to he no more Chong-gun for me . Colonel Choe had prohibited it . On January twelfth , I heard the familiar " Pahl ( , pahlt ! " ? the cry to " Hurry ! " ? once more . We went first hack to Choesin-dong for dinner and to he issued padded jackets , trousers and caps with earmuffs . Then we got into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of luggage and twenty-five officers , nine of them women . The truck was so crowded that both Pyun and Dee Soon Yur had to be left behind . We started south . The temperature was six below zero . U insisted that I sit cross-legged in the middle , where knees banged me from all sides and a woman officer screeched as if I were torturing her every time I shifted position . The next night the trip was worse . My position was even more jammed , I could not get the truck to stop when I asked , and was thoroughly miserable and embarrassed . At another house , near Huichon , the soles of my shoes glazed and I fell repeatedly in walking a few yards from the truck . We had one more night of it , a wild ride past the scene of a recent battle , where 1 saw our knocked-out guns , light tanks and prime movers . On the truck , the officers chattered about that battle and their destinations  --  Seoul and Mokpo , on the southwest tip of Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our forces . 1 had been told that 1 , too , was going to Seoul . But at a road intersection about ten miles north of Pyongyang , a waiting officer ordered me off the truck . One guard , the officer and I started out on foot . The night was very cold and the ground slippery ; I fell again and again . They bawled me out in Korean . Finally I became so angry that I shouted at them ? that if they had let . me exercise , I would be able to control my legs now . I cussed them out and they cussed me out , but neither side knew exactly what the other was saying , After a mile , we reached a house being used as some sort of office . And there was Captain Kim , whom I 'd never learned to love . Nor did I now , although he was happy to give me news : United Nations troops , he said , had been decisively defeated all along the line , and the few left were surrounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own airplanes flown by Koreans who have been trained ; and it is only a matter of a few days until there are no more Americans on the Korean peninsula . Your own press and radio proclaim that this is another Dunkirk . What do you think ? " Editors ' Note  --  In next week 's Port . General Dow tells of another .... cape plan  --  and of the remarkable change that carne over his captors in their hamittot of him .
