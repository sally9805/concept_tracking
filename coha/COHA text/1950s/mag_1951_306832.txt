The New Commissioner In a smoke-filled hotel room , traditional backdrop for major decisions in U.S. public life , the owners of baseball 's 16 major league clubs met to consider baseball 's big problem : Who would replace Happy Chandler as baseball 's ruling commissioner ? Since firing Chandler as commissioner last March , the club owners had ranged far afield in search of the right man for the job . Last week the owners found the right man right in their own backyard : Ford Christopher Frick , National League president . <P> The new commissioner owed his new job to one owner in particular , Warren Giles of the Cincinnati Reds . The field had narrowed down to Giles and Frick , but neither could get the necessary majority ( twelve votes ) . After 17 ballots and nine hours of hassling and wrangling , the meeting was hopelessly deadlocked . Then Giles stalked in and declared dramatically : " My first interest in baseball is for the welfare of baseball itself . My second ... is the Cincinnati Reds , and my third is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish to withdraw my name . " Frick was elected unanimously on the 19th ballot . <P> Unanimous Approval . The decision was approved just as unanimously by most of baseball . Frick , now 56 and greying , never realized his ambition of becoming a big league first baseman like his idol Cap Anson. * But even as an English professor ( Colorado College ) , he never strayed far from the game . During World War I he worked with the War Department 's rehabilitation division , then returned to a job as sportwriter for the Colorado Springs Telegraph . In 1919 , after Arthur Brisbane saw some of his stories , Frick was called to New York . <P> By 1922 , when he was assigned to cover the New York Yankees , hard-working Ford Frick kept his fellow sportwriters hopping to keep up with his early-to-bed &; early-to-rise routine . He became a good friend and golfing partner of Commissioner Landis ; in 1934 he was chosen head of the National League Service Bureau , which compiles the league 's statistics . Within the year-a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . <P> " This Is America . " The owners know that they have put no yes-man in the seven-year , $65,000-a-year job . Frick 's biggest problem as National League president came in 1947 when he got wind of a projected players ' strike against the admission of Negro Jackie Robinson into the league . Frick confronted the players with an ultimatum ; " If you do this , you are through , and I do n't care if it wrecks the league for ten years . You can not do this because this is America . " <P> Frick inherits some tough problems-falling attendance everywhere , radio and TV competition , West Coast howls for a third league , and , most serious , Congress ' investigation of baseball 's reserve clause ( which prevents a player from selling his services to the highest bidder ) . Unlike his predecessor , Frick is too cagey to put his foot in his mouth by way of opening it . Baseball 's problems can be ironed out , he feels , but " I do n't want to go saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a reformer . You have to make changes slowly and be sure to have a firm foundation for everything you do . " <P>
