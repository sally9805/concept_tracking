In Cleveland last week a group of presidents and trustees assembled from small colleges all over Ohio set out on a special mission . During the next few days , they will call on 150 local businessmen , and for each they had the same appeal . Its gist : Ohio 's private colleges need the help of Ohio industry if they are to survive . <P> The task force of presidents and trustees actually represents 19 different campuses. * Their Cleveland calls are only the start of a statewide fund-raising campaign to meet the $1,000,000 deficit the colleges expect this year . But far more important than their strategy is their target . Like deficit-ridden private colleges throughout the U.S. , they are seeking help from the last great reservoir of wealth outside the Federal Government-the private corporations . <P> The Battle for Dollars . Last week the battle for that wealth was being fought far beyond Ohio 's borders . The University of Denver had recently installed ex-President Albert N. Williams of Western Union as a special non-salaried adviser on getting and using business gifts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alma , Hillsdale , Hope and Emmanuel Missionary ) had already banded together to raise $500,000 from industrialists . In Indiana eleven more campuses had combined forces for the same purpose . Last week President A.A. Lemieux of Seattle University was trying to set up a similar foundation in Washington . <P> Over the past few years , such efforts have brought promising results . This year Johns Hopkins University was able to raise $650,000 from Baltimore businessmen , and nearby Goucher College ( for women ) was doing almost as well . In its 1940 fund-raising campaign Goucher got only $2,500 from industry-1% of what it was after ; this year it got $280,000 , or 28% . Northwestern University had a similar report : $761,000 in 1950 , compared to $89,000 ten years ago . <P> The University of Pennsylvania has collected $2,250,000 for its development fund from local business and industry since 1948 , including such no-strings gifts as $100,000 from Lit Brothers department store . <P> Even some small campuses are seeing the color of corporate money . Ohio 's Wittenberg College has persuaded nearby businesses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremen and supervisors . Mills College in California has received $150,000 from corporations-and " that , " says President Lynn White Jr. , " would have been impossible five years ago . " <P> Strings Attached . In spite of such indications that corporate gifts are rising , U.S. educators in general are still far from rejoicing . U.S. business has only just begun to give , and it is still nowhere near using up its 5% tax deduction for charitable contributions . Manhattan 's Commission on Financing Higher Education reported that in 1950 business probably gave $340 million for philanthropic purposes , including gifts to higher education . But that was only seven-tenths of 1% of its total income before taxes .
