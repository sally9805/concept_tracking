The Rose Tattoo ( Hal Wallis ; Paramount ) , like the Tennessee Williams play from which it is adapted , is less a show , in a dramatic sense , than a sideshow-a gatherum of Pitchman Williams ' less peculiar freaks . The principal exhibit is Serafina Delle Rose ( Anna Magnani ) , a hearty peasant wench transplanted from Sicily to the Gulf Coast . Since the death of her husband , a small-time smuggler , she has turned into a sort of moral worm crawling in and out of his memory . She keeps his ashes in a gimcrack vase in their shanty parlor , and has long , sweaty daydreams about his body ( " like a young bull " ) . " I was the peasant , " she cries , " but I gave my hosband glory . " One day reality in the improbable form of Alvaro Mangiacavallo ( Burt Lancaster ) , " a bachelor wit ' three dependents , " breaks into Serafina 's dank little dreamworld . Like the smuggler , he drives a truck , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serafina almost unbearably of her husband 's . Hard facts as well as a new set of hard muscles break the husband 's deadlock on her affections-it turns out he had been keeping a girl ( Virginia Grey ) on the side . <P> Like all but the greatest grotesques , The Rose Tattoo sets out so furiously to heighten the flavors of reality that the meat of the thing is soon lost in its seasoning ; and only a moviegoer who can take his peperone straight will be able to judge if the picture is really hot stuff . <P> Burt Lancaster , however , makes a brave try at a part somewhat beyond the means of his talent , and manages at least to convince the spectator that half an oaf is better than none . As for Anna , nothing like her kind of corset farce has come out of Hollywood since the late Marie Dressier delicately tucked a pint of hooch in her grandmotherly bosom . One moment Actress Magnani comes lurching on-camera as shapeless as a burlap bag full of cantaloupes ; the next she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter of a backstreet-walker in Naples . And she battles her way into a girdle of yesteryear with all the fury and desperation of the Royal Welch Fusiliers at Bunker Hill , somehow imparting to her defeat some of the sorrowful majesty of a historical debacle . <P> U.S. dramatists might take instruction from the plight of Playwright Williams , the tiger of Broadway . Magnani , as a result of this picture , will probably become a very hot item in U.S. show business , and she is the sort of lady who , if not closely watched , comes back from the ride with the tiger inside . <P> <P> A guest at a chichi Hollywood hotel stood blinking one recent day at a scratchy note that had just been shoved underneath the door of his suite . " Please do n't use the bathroom in the mornings . " it read . " You are disturbing the world 's greatest actress . " He asked the manager what the message meant . It meant , he was informed , that Italy 's Anna Magnani had come to Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
