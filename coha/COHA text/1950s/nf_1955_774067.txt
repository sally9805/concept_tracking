txt 6o STEINMETZ : a small grocery store on the corner of Commercial and Common Streets . Even Steinmetz , who cared little for physical comfort , realized that the neighborhood was poverty-stricken , but he had no choice . He willingly paid his first week 's rent in advance , returned to the railroad terminal and collected his belongings , which he transferred to his new lodgings . Then he fell across the uncomfortable bed , fatigued and very unhappy . Early the next day he went to the General Electric plant and was immediately ushered into Mr. Rice 's office . Rice , who had reported to his superiors that he had been greatly impressed with Steinmetz ' originality and intellectual power , greeted the newcomer warmly and personally escorted him to the laboratory assigned to the calculating department . There the new employee was introduced to his chief , H. F. Parshall , who was in charge of the staff of ten outstanding engineers responsible for the task of solving all the mathematical problems that arose in the company 's development of electrical power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Steinmetz feel that he was welcome . After some general conversation , the engineers went back to their work and Rice left . Parshall led Steinmetz to a desk and told him that this was where he would work , then took him for a tour of the laboratory . As they inspected the various apparatuses , Parshall told Steinmetz how valuable the " Law of 1 lysteresis " had proved to the Lynn plant . " We 're looking forward to having you in the department , " he said . " If you want anything , just ask me or any of the others . You 'll find this lab a very friendly place . " Immediately most of Steinmetz ' fears and loneliness vanished . " Perhaps , " he reassured himself , " Lynn wo n't be so unpleasant , after all Parshall seems to be as kindly a man as Eickenmcycr , and the engineers in the calculating department appear to be very sociable fellows . There 's a good Maker of Lightning 6i chance I 'll be just as content here as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm ready for work . What do you want me to do first ? " With a quick smile and a welcoming handshake , the head of the calculating department replied , " Design a more practical and efficient transformer . " A transformer , as every boy who has ever owned a set of electric trains knows , is a simple apparatus with no moving parts , which is capable of changing electrical energy from one electric pressure to another . Many have seen the outside of one . The metal boxes on the top of utility poles are a familiar form . The use of alternating current is impossible without a transformer , and until a perfect one could be developed , the newly formed General Electric concern realized , economical distribution of electricity was impossible . Steinmetz had long held the opinion that alternating current could be sent from powerhouses through cables carrying high voltage , for hundreds of miles from where it was generated , if an effective transformer could lie developed . Electrical engineers had agreed for some time that the transformers made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best in the country . Based on the pioneer work of William Stanley , of Great Barrington , Massachusetts , who had built the first transformer , the Yonkers organization had designed and developed transformers capable of converting alternating current from various pressures to the one most suited for a required use . These ranged from the extremely low voltage needed to ring a doorbell , to the high voltage necessary in the electric welding of steel . In fact , the outstanding reputation t hat the Eickenmeyer transformer had earned was one of the main reasons why the General Electric Company had acquired the electrical machinery and patents of the famous hat manufacturer . Steinmetz , of course , knew every detail of the Eickenmeyer technique , and had , for some time , been working to // improve transformers . It was obvious that the task of " stepping-up " voltage at the powerhouse and " stepping-itdown " at the point of use could be done by making a more efficient transformer . But how ? What mathematical formula could be worked out to make the widespread use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discovered , the long-distance transmission of electrical energy was absolutely impossible , and thousands of people could not enjoy its benefits , for direct current could not be transported very far from the place where it was generated . This was the type of problem in which Steinmetz delighted . joyously he set to work with notebook , logarithm tables , a jar of freshly sharpened pencils , and a pocket full of cigars . Some of the papers he had so carefully packed and brought from Yonkers were now invaluable to the mathematical genius as he filled page after page with shorthand notes . Steinmetz had been working on transformer theory ever since his establishment of the " Law of Hysteresis , " realizing that his original investigations were of little value until alternating current was put into universal use . Unless electrical power could be received by the user at no volts , it had little commercial importance , so he had begun his investigations into the mystery of the transformer early in 189o , but now , after three years of research and study , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steinmetz toiled on the problem of designing a more efficient transformer . A lesser man would have admitted the assignment was far too difficult , but he was positive that mathematics would furnish the key that would solve the problem . Page after page of equations filled his notebook , but none of them presented the slightest clue toward finding the answer to the process he was seeking . " If calculating alternating current were only as easy as calculating direct current , " lie complained ruefully one day to Parshall , " how simple this job would be . Direct // current is so elementary . It has direction and a value which can be measured with a meter . My difficulty is that alternating current has no definite direction and no value ; its direction and value are constantly changing , making measuring its flow a terrifically complicated task . I 'll find a mathematical solution to this problem , however ? you just wait and see ! " Parshall was not the only one who waited . The entire electrical industry was marking time , waiting for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed little likelihood that this strange force could ever be controlled . Even Edison had conic to the conclusion that alternating current would never be tamed to do the bidding of engineers . Researchers in the field frankly admitted that alternating current was dangerous to handle , while newspaper headline-writers scared their readers with screaming " banners " above their reports about the users of alternating current being electrocuted . Steinmetz paid no attention to the scholarly opinions of his associates or to the journalists , but continued to carry out his invest igations and write down his equations . There had to be an answer somewhere , and once it was discovered , power plants would be able to send electrical energy thousands of miles across the countryside to those who could use it for turning the wheels of industry or making their homes morn livable and attractive . Others might feel that whatever progress there could be in electrical development would conic through the use of direct current , but not Charles Protcus Steinmetz . So he continued his seemingly useless and time-wasting experiments . Then as the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual meeting , it was rumored in the electrical industry that Steinmetz of General Electric had a most important paper to read . he did . The directors of the Congress were greatly impressed with his modest statement that he had , at long last , reduced alternating cur64 STEINMETZ : rent calculations to a " simple algebraic problem , " and gladly allotted him an hour in which to explain to electrical engineers from all over the world the method he had developed to control this powerful force . On the evening of Steinmetz ' scheduled talk , outstanding electrical technicians representing private firms and governmental agencies crowded the hall . None of them really expected that the speaker would present a workable theory , but , after all , this was the man who had overcome the problem of hysteresis , so it would n't hurt to listen to him . The audience gasped with astonishment when they saw the bulky manuscript Steinmetz carried under his arm . It was over a foot thick ! Their amazement turned to mental numbness as the dwarfed cripple continued to explain his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one the engineers left the auditorium . When the allotted hour was over , Steinmetz asked the chairman for an extension of time , and he was given ten more minutes . When that was used up , he requested , and was granted , ten addit ional minutes . At last he was forced to stop . Picking up his papers , he arranged them in a neat pile on the table , bundled them under his arm , smiled wistfully at the few remaining listeners who had tried in vain to follow his explanation and remarked , " Thank you , gentlemen , for listening to me . I hope you have found what I have had to say of interest . I only wish I had more time to continue my explanation . You see , I am but half way through nay introduction ! " The engineers were definitely interested in what Steinmetz had said . The only difficulty was , they did n't understand one word of it ! Even his fellow-workers in the calculating department of the General Electric plant in Lynn had trouble following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To most electrical engineers , the theory of " The General Number , " or " The Complex Number , " as it is sometimes called , was unintelligible . The very few who underMaher // stood it at all agreed that on paper the theory seemed flawless . They had only one question . Was it workable ? It did not take long for Steinmetz to prove to his associates in the engineering profession that the theory of " The General Number " was practical . Ile used it to design and build a transformer that would work under all conditions , and which was adaptable for every purpose . Now longdistance transmission of electrical energy was assured , and extensive electric systems could be established . Meanwhile , the scientist had gathered together ; all his notes and had expanded them into a manuscript three feet high , entitled Theory and Calculation of Alternating Current Phenomena . He asked the International Elect a ical Congress to publish this work , along with the other papers which had been read at the Chicago meeting of the oat ; anization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; la money ira its treasury to pay for the printing of such a massive report . As a result , Steinmetz ' great discovery did not become available to engineers in book form until four years later , when a private publisher issued the text . By that time the theory of " The General Number " was accepted an every country in the world that knew the benefits of electricity . The high voltage lines that stretched between poles marching up and down the earth 's surface were proof of this ? and Steinmetz ' three volume work sold well . Even today , they are considered absolutely necessary for any good engineering library , and workers in the field consult modern revised editions frequently . Not yet thirty years old , Charles Proteus Steinmetz had solved two major problems in the development of the generation and distribution of electricity . Internationally famous , he modestly continued his work in the calculating department of the Lynn Division of General Electric . Everyone there recognized him now , alt hough for months he was unknown outside the laboratory , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of routine conferences . In fact , until his development of the theory of " The General Number , " Steinmetz was so inconspicuous a person at the works that he almost starved to death ! A short time after he joined the company , one of his associates in the calculating department , concerned with Steinmetz ' appearance , asked , " What 's the matter with you , Charles ? Why , you 're getting as thin as a piece of copper wire and you look as if you have received a violent electric shock . " At first Steinmetz would not admit anything was wrong . Finally , after a great deal of hesitation , he explained his difficulty . He had not received a single cent of salary since coming to Lynn ! As a result , he had been unable to pay his room rent or to buy food . Parshall was immediately informed of the situation and rushed to the accounting office to demand an explanation . A check of the records showed that , through a clerical error , Steinmetz ' name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adjusted at once , and Charles , his pockets bulging with back pay , hastened home to settle his bills and cat his first complete meal in several weeks . Now that alternating current had been controlled , Steinmetz was ready to undertake another assignment . Before he could engage in any complicated research in the laboratory , however , he was drafted to do the routine mathematical work on designs for generators to be used to convert the tremendous water power at Niagara Falls into electricity . These generators were totally different from any that General Electric had ever built before , and the firm was most anxious to get the contract . Steinmetz ' work was satisfactory , but a competitor received the order . Years later , General Electric did get an order to supply machinery for the electrical power project at the Falls , and Steinmetz ' original designs were used . In May , 1893 , an economic depression swept the United // States and a panic resulted . Banks and brokerage houses failed by the hundreds and business throughout the nation drifted to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One by one , the shoe factories were closed and long queues of unemployed men stood patiently in line to receive donations of bread and milk for their children . I n the General Electric plant , only one hundred vital workers were kept on the payroll , and they got only six days of work a month . Parshall 's calculating department was cut to t 1 ree men . One of them was Steinmetz . There was nothing for these experts to do , so the engineers idled in the silent laboratory for hours , smoking , telling stories , and playing jokes on one another . In more serious moments they would sit silently at their desks and wonder how long they would continue to draw their salaries , or which one of thcuu would be the next to be fired . Steinmetz knew that he was not ; ; ( ang to be discharged when the firm sent him to the ul Id 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . This display of Inelnst ry , science and art , from every nation in the world , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Manufacturers from many lands had sent their products to be displayed , in order to show them to the general public and win awards for excellence . Included in the exhibition were many foreign electrical devices , and General Electric wanted Steinmetz to report on any worth-while engineering developments their rivals had made . He wandered from building to building , enjoying the excitement , crowds , music and exhibits , but found nothing of value to report to his employers . To Steinmetz , the most enjoyable part of the whole ( : hicago trip was the opportunity to meet and talk will ' electrical experts he had not seen since his stay in Yonkers as Fickcnmeyer 's assistant . One day , while walking tin ( ) ugh an exhibition hall , he was heartily greeted by his former helper at the Eickenmeyer plant , the young German mechanic ' I'ischendorfer , for whom // Steinmetz and Field had painstakingly prepared the cigar soaked in linseed oil . Tischendorfcr had gone back to Germany shortly after his employer had sold out his electrical patents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbian Exposition displaying a searchlight for a European firm . For a few minutes Steinmetz stood in front of the booth , talking to his old friend . Suddenly the latter said , " Herr Steinmetz , we do n't have to stand here talking . Come , follow me . " Wonderingly , Charles followed the young man to the back of the booth . Tischendorfcr opened a door and led him down a narrow flight of stairs to the cellar . Here the clever youth had fitted up a most comfortable room in which he could entertain his friends , and had , by tapping the electric light wires of a neighboring exhibitor , flooded the room with light ! Steinmetz chuckled as his fellow German explained how he had rigged up the lights at no expense to himself or his firm . It was the kind of joke the engineer appreciated and he began to laugh . Then a thought struck him ? was it possible that his one-time assistant had known that the cigar had been doctored and had turned the tables on Field and himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor would lead him to tap someone else 's electric supply line very well might ? Steinmetz was just about to ask if ' l ischendorfer had or had not known that the cigar had been soaked in linseed oil , when a party of men came tramping down the stairs . Most of them were old New York friends of Charles and they laughed when he told them how he had been trudging from exhibition hall to exhibition hall , looking for them . " Steinmetz , you sit right where you arc , " they told him . " Do n't move , and sooner or later you 'll see everyone in the electrical engineering game in this room . " Charles took their advice and during the rest of his stay // in Chicago , he spent most of his time in the cool , comfortable and cosy secret meeting place underneath the German searchlight display . Steinmetz had a wonderful time talking to fellow workers in the field of electrical investigation from all parts of the civilized world , and the time to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he thought of his dreary boarding house , Charles shuddered with disgust . As the train puffed East , he made plans to find living quarters in a 1IH()rC respectable neighborhood . Steinmetz need n't have worried about more comfortable accommodations , or even about living in Lynn . On reporting to the plant , he was told that the company was transferring the operations of the calculating depart meat to Schenectady , New York . So , once again , Cha , lcs hotel 's Steinmetz was being forced to carry his genius and his baggage to a new home . Although he did not know it , this was the last move he was to make , and the happiest years of his life were still before him . " The mathematician has reached the highest rung on the ladder of human thought " - HAVELOCK ELLIS 6 " COME IN , " called F , ickcnmeyer in answer to a loud knock on his office door . As it opened , he looked up from the papers on which he was working , jumped quickly to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful ? Do n't stand there , magi . Come in and sit down ! Here , take your old chair . It seems twenty years since you last sat beside this desk . Oh , but I 've missed you , my friend , and the long talks we used to have in the laboratory . You 'd laugh if you could hear me bragging that the Steinmetz who is the talk of the electrical industry was once my assistant , but I ant so proud of the fact that you started your career in this plant , that I ? enough of this chatter , though . Tell mc , why are n't you in Lynn ? There is nothing wrong , I hope . " " Everything is perfect , " Steinmetz assured his former employer as he sat down . " I have conic to Yonkers to spend the Christmas holiday season with niy old friends . Between the lack of orders because of the depression , and waiting for the calculating department to be transferred to the Schenectady works the first of the year , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering that I have n't had a vacation since I came to America , I decided that this was the best possible time to take one , and here I am ! " Maker of Lightning ' 71 " You 'll stay with me , of course , " Eickenmeyer declared . " Oh , I know you 'll want to spend a night or two with the Mullers , but the rest of the time you 've got a room at Seven Oaks . Now , tell me all the news . " Between such happy reunions and much gay talk , Christmas week of 1893 passed all too quickly for Steinmetz . Before he realized it , the time came for him to leave for Schenectady . Just before the New Year he boarded a train for upper New York State and his new house . The move did not frighten him nearly so much as the others he had made . This time he was making the change in the company of a group of men he knew and liked . Moreover , he would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Modest as he was , Charles knew that everyone there had heard of him . Legend states that Schenectady was once the location of the chief village of the Mohawk Indians . It was purchased from the tribe by Arendt Van Cn lcr ' l'he price paid was " 600 hands of good Whyte Wampum , six Koates of Duffels , 30 Barres of Lead and Ninc liagges of Powder . " For a great many years the settlement was the richest in the colony , becoming a lively river port with the opening of the Northwest . When De Witt Clinton huilt the Erie Canal , new wealth came to the corm i n i i i t y , and boat building developed into a leading industry . Schenectady grew in importance when , in 1831 , it bccarnic t lie terminal point of the first steam railroad in New York State , and one of the largest locomotive works in the world was established there . Yet , despite the bustling activity of the city on the Mohawk , there was much that reminded Steinmetz of Breslau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with seventeenth-century houses , searching for lodgings , he could imagine , without effort , that lie was in his native city . The quaint Dutch architecture recalled almost forgotten memories , and the Mohawk River , as it wound by the city on its // way to join the Hudson , looked very much like the Oder . Standing on the bank of the Eric Canal , Steinmetz watched the sturdy smiles trudging along the dusty towpath , straining against the traces as they drew heavily loaded barges , and he observed with keen professional interest the workings of the locks . I lc was sure that once he had found a place to stay , he was going to be happy in this city , which in so many ways reminded him of his former home . After searching unsuccessfully for some time for the type of accommodations he desired , and hating the thought of living alone , Steinmetz suggested to a fellow engineer at the General Electric works , Ernst Berg , that they take an apartment together . Berg readily agreed , and the two set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that Steinmetz had a place to live and ? what was just as important to him ? someone to live with , he was ready to go to work . his first assignment was one of time most difficult he ever received in his entire career . Ordered to explain the theory of ' ? I'lre General Number " to the engineering staff of the Schenectady division of General Electric , he set up a classroom and turned teacher . His method of making calculations with alternating current was simple enough to Steinmetz , but terribly complicated to everyone else . So , despite the fact that the pupils in his classroom included the most brilliant engineering minds in the United States , it was necessary for him to repeat his explanat ion of the theory over and over again . Patiently and slowly he would present his facts , outlining every step in detail , pause and ask , " Has anyone a question ? " Every member of the class had one . They were all the same . Ilow did one use the theory of " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alternating current ? Lighting a fresh cigar , Steinmetz would smile enMaher // couragingly at his students and begin his explanation all over again . At a meeting of the class , one of the members , embarrassed at his inability to grasp the theory , apologized for " asking so many foolish questions . " Steinmetz lifted a hand in angry protest and exclaimed heatedly : " There are no foolish questions . No man becomes a fool until he stops asking questions . The science of education is the science of helping people find out what they want to know . Now , let 's go over the whole subject once more . In time the theory was more or less understood , and Steinmetz ' pupils returned to their drawing boards and laboratories . Using their newly acquired knowledge , the engineers developed fresh methods of bringing prover and light to the homes , farms and factories of Auld tea . Often while working on a new design , they would find the necessary calculations too difficult , and go to Steinmetz for help . I le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conic to him any time he could be of service . So whenever engineers in any department of the General l , ; lectiic plant were baffled by seemingly impossible mathematical problems , they would lay them before Steinmetz , confident that he would solve them . They were never disappointed . One day , after many weary and tiresome hours of unproductive figuring , a group of engineers came into the calculating department . Steinmetz greeted them and asked what they wanted . Their spokesman frankly admitted that they had worked unsuccessfully on a pi akin and were no nearer an answer than when they had started . " Would you please help us ? " he asked . " Certainly , if I can , gentlemen , " came the prompt reply . " Tell me , what is your difficulty ? " " What we wish to know , " said the leader of the delegation , " is the cubic content of the metal which is removed // from a cylindrical rod two inches in diameter when a twoinch hole is bored through the rod separating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his visitors , Steinmetz did not sit down at his battered desk and begin to figure . They looked at each other in astonishment . Should they stay or leave ? Steinmetz said nothing , reached into his pocket , stuck a fresh cigar into his mouth , lit it and wrinkled his gnomelike face into a smoke-wreathed scowl . Then , after a moment 's silence , he grinned broadly and said between puffs , " I think I have it , gentlemen . Yes , I am sure of it . The answer is 5.33 cubic inches . Is there anything else ? " No , there was nothing else , excepting their dumbfounded admiration for the marvelous matlienlatical skill of the dwarf who worked in the calculating department . Most of the engineers had once heard Ernst Berg assert that " Steinmetz can do equations in his head that ordinary men ca n't do on paper , " but they had n't believed it . Now they did . In fact , they were absolutely sure that there was no mathematical problem that he could n't solve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzling question ? it should have taken him hours and reams of paper before he figured out the answer ? but he had done it in his head in less than a minute ! Once Steinmetz had graduated his students in the theory of " ' Hie General Number , " he again tinned his inventive genius and mathematical skill to the nnvstcrics of alternating current . His investigations in this field were to continue all his life , resulting in patents covering more than fifty types of electrical apparatus . Meanwhile , Parshall , his immediate superior at the plant , was sent to England by the General Electric Company to supervise the organization of the calculating department of the British division . At the time , it was thought that he would remain overseas for only a short time . However , he decided to stay in England and eventually // became one of the most important figures in that nation 's electrical industry . The officials of the Schenectady works wasted no time in choosing his successor ; Steinmetz was placed in charge of the calculating department the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to return to America . Before he assumed his new position , Steinmetz took a few days off and went to Yonkers on a most important errand . Five years had passed since he had taken out his first papers , and now he was eligible to become a full citizen of the United States . Swearing allegiance to his adopted country was far more important to him than assuming the full responsibility of the calculating department and enjoying the raise in salary that went with the promotion . So he went to Yonkers , appeared before a Fccle 1.11 judge , answered pertinent questions dealing with the ! wanly and constitution of America , and walked out of tl u ' om t mom a citizen of the United States , far more proud tli.in he had been about the high honors given him for his two t ; icat electrical discoveries . No foreign-born citizen had a grimier love for America than did Charles Proteus Steinmetz . I his youthful dreams of a world in which all men 11.1 ( 1 an equal opportunity to achieve fame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . His deep affection for his country is best illustrated by a letter he wrote within six months of becoming a full naturalized American Citizen . It was written to Eskil Berg , brother of his roommate and associate at the General Electric plant , Ernst Berg . For some time Eskil , who was also an engineer , had been writing to his brother , saying that he was seriously t h i n k i n g of leaving his native Sweden to seek his fortune the United States . One evening Ernst handed Steinmetz a letter from Eskil which had arrived in the mail that morning and inquired , " What do you think he should do , Charles ' I think he should come over , do n't you ? " // Glancing at the letter , Steinmetz replied , " I certainly do . In fact , I 'll write him a note and tell him so . After all , I came to America with no brother waiting on the dock to give me shelter and help in finding a job , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can succeed in this country . There 's no reason why he should hesitate ? why , he can get a job right here in Schenectady . " At the plant the next morning , Steinmetz sat down and wrote to Eskil Berg before he did anything else . After reporting what was happening in the electrical industry in America and the many opportunities that awaited a trained engineer here , he urged Berg to make immediate preparations to leave Sweden . In closing , he wrote : " Now the matter is this : come over at once , without wasting any more time in Europe . There is nothing to be got there , everything here . You had better start with the idea that you will never go back except for a visit . I never saw a sensible man who has lived in America a few years who was willing to go back to Europe to stay .

AU of his assistants were exceptionally gifted individuals , but often when confronted with a complex problem , they would be forced to spend hours poring over reference hooks or filling sheets of paper with equations , seeking a solut ion . Their chief would watch them for a while and then ask diffidently , " Can I help you chaps ? " Sighing with relief , the staff ( which had been longing to hear those words ) would tell Steinmetz their difficulty , and usually without any hesitation , he would rattle off the mathematical formulae for which his assistants had been searching in vain . He was the most lenient of superiors , never giving his underlings an order . In fact , he regularly would do himself // the routine tasks that , as head of the calculating department , he should have assigned to others . Steinmetz thought that his men should be as free as he wanted to be , and in the four years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation undertaken by members of his group . He was , however , always willing and ready to help them in any way he could . . About 1897 Steinmetz and Berg moved to a sprawling house on the corner of Liberty and College Streets . It was just the place they had been looking for , with plenty of room , a large stable and a spacious yard . Their house soon became the gathering ground for all the young engineers at the works . One of these who had majored in English literature at college , in addition to studying technical subjects , christened the place " Liberty I Lill. " after the house of Squire Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith 's classic comedy , She Stoops to Conquer . In the play , the Sgtiue 's residence is , through a series of humorous errors , mistaken for an inn when he tells two strangers , " This is Liberty I WI , gentlemen ; you may do just as you please here .

They would meet early and stay until very late , thoroughly happy in the genial company of the man who , during working hours , was held in awed respect . Ernst Beat ; has left a graphic and vivid picture of the activities at " label ty I loll " in a manuscript now in the files of the Alumni Office of Union College : " As I look back on those times , it seems extraordinary that so much real work was done because we played so much . While some years older than the group of young student engineers with whom he associated , Steinmetz was , in reality , the most playful of us all , and one of the chief plotters of our numerous activities . Our mischief took all kinds of forms . Sometimes we would be busy at night shifting signs , so that in // the morning the dispenser of beer would find a dry-goods sign over his door and vice versa . We had all kinds of races on the Mohawk . A swimming race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went swimming dressed in frockcoats and silk hats . ' then we had sailing , rowing and canoe races very frequently , and Steinmetz was the starter and official re-corder . " During the summer months we frequently took long bicycle excursions ? once in a while as far as Lake George , sixty-five miles away . Steinmetz was usually trailing behind a mile or two , but always caught up at the end . During the autumn , he often joined us in our ( luck hunting , although he himself never did any actual hunting . IIe was , however , a fair rifle shot . " Every few weeks we had a small ( lance at our house , and Steinmetz would usually pick out the prettiest girl and , with her , watch our antics in the hall from the staircase . He had an eye for beauty and enjoyed the company of girls quite as much as we did .

Moreover , he disliked the routine paper work that went with the directorship of the calculating department ; all he wanted was to conduct experiments in the laboratory . his attitude toward his helpers and the all-too-frequent waiting for vital reports that he carelessly buried under personal papers on his littered desk were most annoying to the management of General Electric . All of the plant officials fully realized that Steinmetz , the // little wizard of electricity , was by far the most valuable member of their research staff , but they simply could not tolerate the gross inefficiency of the department under his direction . After one particularly important report was " lost " for several days while he worked on a perplexing problem of highvoltage power transmission , the directors of the General Electric Company decided that , much as they regretted the step , they would have to discharge Steinmetz . Determined to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the directors wwwcnt to the calculating department laboratory . Steinmetz was not there . While they were waiting , the pair heard one of the engineers say to another , " I do n't think that it is possible to reduce this to a mathematical formula . There 's only one thing we can do ? we 'll lay our problem before the ' Sulu clue Court . ' " Just then Steinmetz walked into the loom . I lc ( lid not see the men who had come to fire Thin ; 111 ( 1 Stopl ) cd to speak to his confused associates . They told him that they were absolutely stumped . Their chief bent owl the laboratory worktable on which they had spread their calculations , picked up a pencil and looked at the problem . " If you will put your y where you now have your x and place x in place of your y , you 'll be perfectly all right , " he told his assistants after a minute 's intense concentration . The directors looked at each other . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the engineers had called him ? The " Supreme Court " ? That was the solution ! Relieve Steinmetz of the routine work expected of him as head of the calculating dcp ; utnu ? nt and let him do nothing but experiment and find the mathematical solutions to the complicated problems which baffled his associates . So , without saying anything to kiln , or even taking the title of head of the division away from him , they gradually relieved him of most of his former ditties , with the result that the necessary reports were always finished on time and available 8o STEINMETZ : when wanted . Now Steinmetz was free to follow any line of electrical investigation he wished and act as the " Supreme Court " when other staff members required help . As consulting engineer for the entire plant , Steinmetz was given a fully equipped laboratory of his own , and an unlimited expense account with which to buy materials and to build apparatus . This arrangement proved ideal for both the scientist and the firm that employed him . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left Sweden to conic to America . His qualifications as an engineer were excellent and he had no difficulty in securing a position with General Electric . Eskil , as a matter of course , became a permanent resident of " Liberty Hall . " The young Swede soon bccanic one of the most popular members of the lively group who used the house as a meeting place . Although he could give Steinmetz keen competition in a chess game , he was an active young fellow , full of fun and very fond of animals . Steinmetz , who delighted in jokes and the company of pets , considered him an ideal companion and spent many hours with him , engaged in building pens in the back yard to house a private menagerie . The inhabitants of " Liberty Hall " never took a bicycle trip through the countryside , or a boating trip on the Mohawk , without bringing back an animal or two to add to their zoological garden . Soon the back vaid of their house looked like a circus . Almost everyone in Schenectady had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Steinmetz could point proudly to a collect ion of raccoons , skunks , woodchucks , snakes and rabbits . While the horse remained in his roomy stall , the other animals roamed and hopped through the house without any fear . Visitors became accustomed to the routine of pushing a snoring raccoon off a chair before they could sit down . Steinmetz ' favorite pets were two crows , which had been found when fledglings by a neighbor and given to him . ScheMaker of Lightning 8i nectady folk were always bringing him animals of one type or another for the zoo at " Liberty 11 ; 111 , " but John and Mary , as he named the two birds , were Ilk special interest . Through patience and kindness , he had tallied the pair so well that it was not necessary to keep them in c a ; ; es . ' Hwy were allowed to fly freely around the city . This Irecdour was thoroughly enjoyed by John and Mary ? but nut by the residents of the neighborhood ! The birds , like all crows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into open windows and steal watches , keys , scissors , pieces of jewelry and buttons . If they were caught in their thievery , their victims could get back the loot by shouting at them , for the frightened birds would drop what they had stolen and fly erratically to the safety of " Liberty Hall . " Often , however , John and Mary would do their pillaging early irr the nroruiug , before their victims were awake , and carry their plunder hack to their roost . When this happened , Steinmeti. wurdcl wait patiently for a visit from an irate neighbor , hand raver what his pets had stolen , and apologize for their pe ? rhdy . John and Mary were always in a near by tree when Steinmetz came home from the plant , and would caw excitedly when he entered the yard . Ile would wave at them , whistle loudly and the birds would swoop clown and come to him . If he were on his bicycle , they would perch on the handlebars and ride to the stable with their owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and shoulders , and remain there as he catered the house . One day the scientist read a scholarly article by Ernest Thompson Seton in which the wui Id fatuous naturalist stated that crows had a definite language and listed some of their " words . " Steinmetz devoted an us riling to memorizing this vocabulary and practicing the vat ions calls . From then on he would sit at his bedroom window for hours , carrying on a " conversation " with John and lary as they strutted back and forth on the window-sill . ' Hie crows would answer him // and Steinmetz insisted despite the scoffing of the Bergs , that the birds and he understood each other perfectly . This happy association came to a sad conclusion when one of the crows was killed by a prowling raccoon , and the other soon died of grief . The broken-hearted Steinmetz had the birds stuffed and kept them all his life . When not tending to his many pets , most of the engineer 's leisure time was spent in experimenting in the wellequipped laboratory he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the place was not large enough , nor completely furnished to do the advanced type of investigation he wished to conduct , so he aniunniced his intention of converting a section of the stable attached to " Liberty Hall " into a more adequate laboratory . The Bergs agreed that the proposed move was an excellent one , and assured him they would gladly help to set up the scientific apparatus in its new location . They took great care to hide their delight at their roommate 's plan , for it was the best news they had heard in months . Although the Bergs were engineers and quite accustomed to acrid laboratory smells , they were weary of the overwhelming stench that steeped all over the house from their companion 's room , as he mixed acids and burned out the wires on electric motors by deliberately overloading them . In fact , it is extremely doubtful if even patient Grossmutter Steinmetz could have put tip with the stains and burns her grandson made on the floor and furniture as he carried on his adult experiments ! There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a problem to his roommates . Often , preoccupied with his work at the General Electric plant , he would start to leave the house incompletely dressed , and one of the Bergs would have to send hint back for the missing clothing . I.Iicn , too , he might or might not appear at the table at mealtime , to the intense annoyance of the cook , who threatened weekly to quit because " her cooking was n't // appreciated . " And it took both Bergs an entire evening of soothing assurances to keep her from walking out of " Liberty Hall " the night one of the raccoons stole her carefully pre-pared dinner off the dining-room table ! To be sure , after their frantic urging , she had agreed to stay , but made it plain that if " Mr. Steinmetz did n't stop filling the house with those horrible smells and nasty smoke and critters , " she would leave . The brothers , therefore , gave Steinmetz ' plan to set up his laboratory in the stable their full co-operation . Nothing , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat their own cooking ? except to be forced to sit down to a meal prepared by Steinmetz ! The laboratory was soon set up and the oblivious experiiucntcr , the Bergs , and the cook were all happy . Soon , however , there was another problem which de-manded attention . The scientist 's teeth were causing him a great deal of pain , but he refused to go to a dentist . " I doubt , " Ernst Berg once wrote , " that even at twenty-five he had a single tooth that was not decayed . His was a good-looking head except for the teeth wliic h had been neglected since childhood . Yet he got along with them . I tried vainly to persuade him to go to the dentist and get a set of false teeth , but he was afraid of taking gas . " ' I'he reason for Stein-metz ' fear of gas is unknown , but it is entirely possible that , even at this early date , he had been warned by a doctor that his heart was not as strong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steinmetz rarely spent any monev on personal needs , ex-cept for cigars and an occasional suit of clothes . The latter purchase he actually had to be f c aced to make . His gray flannel suits were always cut from the same material and made in the same style . New suits soon looked like the oldest ones in his closet , for he would carelessly wear them while experimenting , and never thought of having them cleaned and pressed . Nor could any tailor make his twisted body // look attractive . " His legs seemed long in proportion to her height , and the waistline was so distorted that to keep t lie trousers in proper place was always a problem and required constant attention . " There was only one thing in which Steinmetz indulged himself . That was the conservatory which he had erected near his stable-laboratory . Malformed himself , he delighted in the outlandish , weird and strange shapes of cacti , and grew hundreds of species in pots and beds . Yet he also had a great love of beauty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heating the conservatory to tropical temperatures when the cold winds roared down the Mohawk Valley from the Rotterdam Hills took most of his surplus salary , but he did not regret a single penny . Money was something to which he paid very little attention . Give him a place to sleep , one simple meal a day , a pocketful of cigars , a pair of baggy pants and a fully equipped labors-tory , and his wants were satisfied . Between his work at the General Electric plant , his in-vestigations in the laboratory attached to " Liberty Hall , " his activities in the conservatory and the care of his pets , Stein-metz was the busiest of men . however , no matter how occu-pied he was , he always found time to act as a kindly guide whenever a group of school children came to the house and asked to be shown the animals . To the rest of the world Steinmetz might be the mathematical genius who was , more than anyone else , responsible for the truly miraculous ad-vanes in electrical engineering , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has so many animals . " In the winter of 1895-1896 , the carefree life of " Liberty Hall " was brought to an abrupt halt when Clara , Steinmetz ' half sister , arrived from Germany . She came to Schenectady " to visit " and before long had established herself as house-keeper . Ilcr open disapproval of the way her brother and the Bergs conducted themselves was never so pointed as // when , on opening a bill from the butcher , she angrily snorted , " What a household ! Your meat bill for your pets is larger than for yourselves ! What kind of way to run a house is that ? " The trio said nothing , but something had to be done . Clara , with her insistence upon careful accounts , spotless housekeeping and regular hours , had completely changed the atmosphere of " Liberty Hall . " In fact , now there was no liberty ! Naturally enough , the Bergs looked to Steinmetz to think of a plan to get rid of the unwelcome guest . After all , Clara was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his roommates that her criticism of their way of living could not he tolerated . For days he thought of various ways to force Clara to leave without causing a breach in their relations . Every plot he devised he talked over wit h the Bergs , but they found a flaw in one after another . Fi na l l y , they agreed on an ideal scheme . One night at dinner , Ernst Berg looked across the table at Clara and solicitously asked , " Do n't you feel well ? Your face appears to be quite flushed . " Clara , who was perfectly well , looked at lher questioner in amazement . Before she had time to reply , her brother and Eskil also expressed their concern over her appearance and suggested that she go to bed immediately . Convinced against her will that she was ill , the bewildered woman went to her room . The next morning , the trio stood at the side of her bed , and woefully shook their heads . There was no doubt about it , they assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some talk , the men " renmenmbered " that in cases of communicable disease , the occupants of the house were always placed in quarantine . Nouc of them could be spared from their duties at General Elect rie  --  they were sure Clara would understand if they left her before the doctor arrived and placed everyone under confinement . With hasty goodbys , the conspirators rushed out of the room . Left alone , Clara Steinmetz lay iii bed , confused and fear86 STEINMETZ : ful . She felt there was nothing wrong with her ; and she was sure she had no temperature , but after all Charles had stud-ied medicine . Perhaps she was sick ! Then suddenly she saw through the plot , packed her bags in amused anger , and took the next train for New York City , where she became a famil-iar sight in the art galleries . Clara was a very competent portrait painter , and once painted an excellent likeness of her brother . With Clara gone , the Bergs and Steinmetz went back to their normal , gay way of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navigation , Transportation , and Exploration Company , Unlimited . " The unlimited in the title of their organization meant that anyone who had the two dollars necessary for the initiation fee was welcome to join ! Most of the engineers at the General Electric plant became charter members and enthusiastically went to work turning out the product which the company had been formed to manufacture ? gliders . This group was , inciden-tally , the first gliding club in the Inited States . Despite the social aspects of the association , Steinmetz had serious plans to market their aircraft , but unfortunately , none of them worked . It was not until the outbreak of World War II that aviation engineers saw the value of gliders to carry men and supplies to otherwise inaccessible places , but Steinmetz ' imaginative genius had sensed their possibilities years earlier . Those members of the " Mohawk River Aerial Navigation , Transportation , and Exploration Company , Unlimited " who had failed to attend one of the meetings of the organization held in Iloffmans , a town just outside of Schenectady , gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gliders in the air . At last , they were going to make their fortunes ! Then one of the absentees remembered that at every meeting Steinmetz had been ac-tively engaged with his camera , and realized that he was playing a joke on his fellow club members . By means of Maker of Lightning 8 , clever trick photography he had produced a picture of a soaring glider ! Another club in which Steinmetz played a very active part was also composed of a group of his associates at the plant . They met every Saturday at " Liberty 1 tall . " The high-sounding name of this organization was " " I'lie Society for the Equalization of Engineers ' Salaries . " Its title was most misleading ; the members met , not to discuss methods and plans by which they could get larger pay cliccks , but to play cards . Steinmetz ' mathematical mind con ! rolled his card playing , and he would never go against the odds . As a matter of fact , lie did n't care particularly if he won or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the company of the other players and feared that , if the host sat on the sidelines , the group would meet somewhere else . Not all of Steinmetz ' social activities were confined to meetings with his fellow workers , all liougli lie enjoyed their company the most . The Krugers , who lived on Liberty Street , were frequent visitors in his hcnisc , having met him through his friendship with their two children , Carl and Gretchen . In the fall of 1900 , when Eskil Berg left " Liberty i-lall " to set up his own apartment , and was followed soon after by Ernst , Steinmetz became very friendly with the Krugers . Although he found plci i t v to do working in his laboratory , as well as caring for his plants and pets , he was lonely at mealtimes and got into l he habit of eating with his neighbors . During this period , Clara came to see him several times and spent most of her visit cleaning house . He saw little of her , as he was spending every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated experiment . Then one night the stable-laboratory burned down . The cause of the blaze was most likely an overheated wire and definitely Steinmetz ' fault . Without the prompt and efficient work of the Schenectady Fire Department , the house would have been destroyed as well . The landlord threatened // to sue for damages , but the scientist paid little attention to his ominous statements . " Let him sue , " he told the Krugers one night at the dinner table . " I do n't care . I really should sue him for not owning a fireproof stable . What if he does collect for his loss ? It is a minor one . I 'm the person who has suffered the most . My scientific equipment is ruined and the valuable notes I had on my desk are completely destroyed . The stable can be rebuilt , but where am I going to get equipment to replace what I 've lost , and who is going to supply copies of my lost calculations ? " When Steinmetz tried to explain to his landlord that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of the stable itself , the situation became even more unpleasant . The landlord was furious at his tenant 's attitude that his troubles were the greater , while Steinmetz was enraged that the man failed to appreciate what the burning of the laboratory apparatus and notebooks meant . The whole affair came to a satisfactory conclusion , however , when General Electric entered the argument and offered to pay for the ruined stable and to equip another workshop for its chief consulting engineer . This generous help was thankfully accepted . Now Steinmetz had only the problem of finding a place to erect his new laboratory . He decided to build a house at the same t inlc , drawing up the plans himself so as to include the features he considered necessary . Then , with a pocket full of cigars , he went walking up the streets of Schenectady , looking for a suitable lot . Charles I'roteus Steinmetz was about to become a man of property and position . THE gnomelike genius of electricity held a con-tinual reception as he hobbled through the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house . By this time , there was hardly a person in the entire city who did not know Steinmetz by sight , and many knew him well enough to call him by name . So , as lie walked along almost everyone stopped to say a few words to hill . Those who did not feel that they knew him well enough to speak to him , or who were on the opposite side of the street , would wave , and he would answer their salutations by raising both arms above his head and shaking his own hands in midair . Steinmetz was not only greeted by those who were walk-ing on the street , but also by the storekeepers , who would pause in their task of sweeping the entrances of their shops or arranging outside displays , to speak to him . Little children always stopped their game of jacks or halted their imaginary ponies to say " good morning , " and ask how Jenny the mon-key and the other animals were . Steinmetz would always answer their friendly inquiries in detail , stopping as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted about his pets . In fact , to the citizens of Schenectady , there was no more familiar sight in the city than that of Charles Proteus Stein " May I a small house and large garden have ? " - ABRAHAM COWLEY 7 // metz , walking along , hands deep in pockets , not appearing to look either to the right or left as he lurched along the street with his peculiarly rapid walk . Yet he never failed to see anyone who waved to him ? and it seemed as if practically everyone did so . Great , billowing clouds of smoke would pour from his ever-present cigar as he stopped to shake hands with one of his countless friends , then , after a brief conversation , he would set out again , only to be halted a few yards further on to speak to someone else . Sometimes Steinmetz would go hunting for his house lot on his bicycle . Often both hands would be off the handlebars simultaneously as he waved to passers-by on opposite sides of the street . If he saw someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his metal steed along the sidewalk curbing , so he could more easily carry on a conversation . At times he would become so engrossed in the subject under discussion that he would forget to turn a corner , or cross the street at the proper point . Completely absorbed , he would continue to ride along , talking , until he discovered too late that he was nowhere near his destination ! Ever since those youthful years in Breslau when , in company with his nature-loving father , he would wander over the hills outside the city , looking for brilliantly colored rocks and birds ' nests , Steinmetz had enjoyed walking , despite his physical handicaps . The long hikes into the country to see the sunrise after the Friday night meetings of the Mathematics Society were among the most vivid memories of his university days . So it was only naliiral that he walked so much in Schenectady , even though he could now afford a horse and carriage . Unlike most of the other engineers at the plant- , he usually walked to work . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he took a streetcar . Once aboard , he would make his way to the front and take the scat nearest the motorman . Everyone in Schenectady recognized the fact that this // particular seat " belonged " to him . If someone were sitting in it , he would get up and ask Steinmetz , " Would you like your seat ? " With a grateful smile , and a gracious " thank you , " the engineering genius would accept the offer immedi-ately . Once in his favorite place , he would lean forward , elbows on knees , and stare intently at the instruments in front of the motorman as they fluctuated while the car 's speed was increased or decreased by means of the controlling handle . Eyes firmly fastened on the vibrating needles , the scientist would think back through the years , recalling the weary months of ceaseless investigation in the laboratory of the Eickenmeyer plant when he had toiled for long hours , hying to design a practical alternating current motor for field to use in streetcars . How simple it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation now , he would think , as the trolley rumbled and swayed on its way toward River Road and the General Electric works . Yet he was not quite sure that the best method of carrying peo-ple to work had been developed . Streetcars were adequate , but something more suitable night he produced if someone would study the problem . Perhaps one of these days he would see what he could do . Meanwhile , he had far more pressing matters demanding his at t ci it-ion . One stormy day Steinmetz hobbled off a streetcar , waved good-by to the motorman , lit a cigar , and walked toward the main entrance of the General Electric plant . As he reached the gate , the uniformed guard of n duty , instead of saluting and passing the engineer in with the usual hearty " Good morning , sir ! " held up a restraining hand . " I am sorry , Mr. Steinmetz , but you 'll have to throw your cigar away , " announced the guard . " ( ) ur instructions are not to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the plant that no smoking is allowed in any of the shops , offices or yards . " Steinmetz came to a sudden stop , took a few quick puffs // on his cigar and blew the smoke through the gate , looked at its guardian and calmly replied , " Very well . " Then , turning on his heel , he retraced his steps to the streetcar stop and rode back to " Liberty Hall . " For three days he did not go near the works . On the fourth day a representative of General Electric was sent to bring him back to the calculating department . The engineer ing division had become stalled on a difficult problem and were unable to continue their work without Steinmetz ' help . The company messenger rang the doorbell , and after a few moments ' delay , Steinmetz came to answer it . " When are you coming back to the plant ? " inquired the emissary . " Never , I suppose . " " What 's that ? Never ? Why not ? " " No smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , anyway . You can smoke if you do . " That afternoon Steinmetz returned to the works and walked through the gate , blowing smoke-rings . Shortly after-ward , he sat down at his desk , listened to a group of engi neers explain what was holding up production and in a very few minutes had solved the problem for them . The next day the directors of the General Electric Com pany posted a bulletin announcing t hat in the case of one employee , and one employee only , the rule against smoking did not apply . That one employee was Charles Proteus Steinmetz . Despite this incident , the scientist was not an absolute slave to the tobacco habit . Visiting him one night , Dr. Ernst Berg watched silently while his associate checked his appa ratus and wrote down some figures . As Steinmetz paused in his calculations long enough to light a cigar , Berg remarked , // " My friend , you are smoking far too much . Since I 've been here you 've consumed three cigars . You ought to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking ! " exploded Steinmetz . " You 're a great one to even suggest such a thing . Why , I 'm sure that you smoke more than I do . What 's more , I could stop smoking , but you never could . " " Oh , is that so ? " came the heated reply . " You know , I think I will take you up on that foolish statement . Meanwhile , you should try to see how long you can make a cigar last instead of smoking like a factory furnace . " " I already know how long I can make a cigar last , " Steinmetz informed his friend . " I experimented with a great many different brands until I found a long , thin , mild one which would burn just as I wanted it to . You see , I taught myself to smoke scientifically , my good doctor . First , I only took a couple of puffs , then a dozen , then a quarter of a cigar , then a half , next three-quarters and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berg laughed . " Charles , you 've reduced everything in life , except friendship , to a mathematical formula . Now let i is tell you something . I 'll bet you a dinner at Nicholaus ' that I can swear off smoking for a year , but that you ca n't . What do you say to that ? " " What do I say ? Just this . You are going to pay for the biggest meal of goose-liverwurst I ever enjoyed in Schenectady ! Swearing off smoking for a year ? what 's that ? It is such a simple thing to do . Look ! I throw my cigar away without even a farewell puff and wo n't smoke again for a year . You , Berg , will be smoking within two days ! " The two engineers shook hands , scaling their wager . Days , weeks and months passed , and by degrees people became accustomed to the sight of Steinmetz without a cigar in his mouth . On the day the year was up , Berg was out of town , supervising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stating that now he had proved he could swear // off smoking , he was going out to buy a box of cigars and begin all over again . Five minutes later , a plant messenger entered the office of the chief consulting engineer and handed him a telegram . It was from Ernst Berg and con-tained almost the identical message ! The lease on " Liberty Hall " bad run out in May , 1900 , but Steinmetz , after much difficulty , had secured an exten-sion from his landlord , who had never quite forgiven him for burning down the stable . By autumn Steinmetz was frantically walking and pedaling up and down the streets of Schenectady , looking for a house lot . At last he found it . The General Electric Company had recently bought a vast area of land in one section of the city , with the idea of sell-ing it off in small parcels for residential use to its employees . In order to accomplish this , an organization called the Gen-eral Electric Realty Company had been formed . Among the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house lots they offered was just what he wanted , but he kept this information to himself . With a sales representative of the real estate office , Stein-metz went out to Wendall Avenue . As the two walked up and down , the engineer casually pointed to a large lot on the opposite side of the street . " ' That 's an attractive house site , " lie remarked , " but is n't it unfortunate that the land slopes so steeply on one side ? " " ' That 's right , sir , " agreed the agent . " We are going to have a great deal of trouble selling it . For , you see , not only does the land slope , but there is quite a bog at the foot , ex-tending the full length of the adjoining lot . I guess we 'll have to lose money on the house lot with the slope and give up any idea of selling the swampy piece . " " W ? cll , " said Steinmetz slowly , " I might be interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no family , I do n't have to worry about youngsters falling into the bog , and buying it will assure me privacy . The slope on the other // piece wo n't interfere with my laboratory . What do you want for them ? " The amazed salesman looked at his companion in bewilderment . Was this man the most brilliant engineer employed by General Electric ? Why , he could n't be ! No person with even the slightest amount of common sense would want to buy a house lot next to a bog . A sale was a sale , however , and perhaps this would be the only opportunity the realty organization would ever have to get rid of the unattractive property . Consulting his papers , the agent named the price . " Frankly , that 's a little more than I feel I can afford , " declared Steinmetz . " I think we had better forget the whole thing . " " I 've a better idea , sir . Why do n't you let me consult my office before you stop considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My superiors realize that not everyone would be interested iii a piece of land that slopes , and they know that a swampy lot has very little value to someone who is planning to build a house . Perhaps they will be willing to make an adjustment in the price , and we can come to an agreement . " The General Electric Realty Company was more than willing to make a concession . The amount of money they asked for the lots was very reasonable , and Steinmetz quickly signed a contract to buy them , afraid that the Realty Company would change its mind , for the slope and the swamp lot were exactly what he wanted ! Tith very little work , the bog could be made into a beautiful glen full of water lilies , swamp grasses , lady slippers , and other marshland perennials . Along the slope he could build a natural rock garden . Little did the sales personnel in the real estate office realize that what seemed to them the two most unattractive lots in the entire development were ideal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got the better of him in the // transaction , but he had a most difficult time restraining himself from bragging to his friends about how he had made the General Electric Realty Company cut the purchase price of " the only two good lots that they had to sell in the whole area . " The money Steinmetz saved on the buying of this land meant absolutely nothing to him . His real pleasure in the negotiations came from the fact that he had played a trick on the men in charge of the sales of the lots . In money matters he was a strange mixture . Wealth meant nothing to him , but at the same time he would go miles out of his way to save a few pennies on purchases . Shortly after setting up housekeeping in " Liberty Hall , " lie wrote to one of the daily papers published in the near-by capital city of Albany , taking a year 's subscription at the advert ised price of five dollars . A few weeks later he again wrote t h e paper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible to have the same journal delivered to his front door each morning by a local newsboy for twenty-five cents less a year ! ' I'liis was the man who graciously and willingly contributed to any charitable cause and never turned down a request for funds from needy individuals . No one in Schenectady was a more staunch supporter of the Christmas fund of the Salvation Army than he , but St cinmetz did not permit a public record of his contributions . On the other hand , he would wait until " double coupon days " at the chain tobacco store to purchase his cigars , in order to get twice as many of the brilli ; nitly colored slips of paper which could be traded in for valuable premiums . Then he would distribute the coupons among the children in the neighborhood who were collecting them to exchange for dolls , bicycles , or sporting equipment ! It was not until some years after his death that the residents of the city of Schenectady learned that the mysterious " Santa Claus " who provided a gift for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a crippled St. Nicholas , whom they all knew and admired . Once he had acquired a house . lot , Steinmetz began to design his home . The plans for the laboratory had been made months before , and constructio- of that building was hcgun immediately . E. W. Rice , who had persuaded the scientist to leave Eickenmeyer 's and join the engineering staff of General Electric , and who was now president of the company , had listened with great interest to Steinmetz ' description of the workshop he planned to erect , once he found a suitable location . Realizing that the electrical wizard would engage in experiments anti investigations of the utmost value to the firm , Mr. Rice suggested that General Electric build and equip the laboratory at cost . Steinmetz wasted no time in accepting this gracious offer . While workmen poured concrete and raised the framework of the laboratory building , progress on the house itself was very slow . The main reason for this was the fact that Steinmetz kept changing his mind as to what he wanted . His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the final brushful of paint was not applied until the fall of 1903 . The results of these three years of constant changing of designs and plans was an ornamental red brick house , with high peaked gables , whose entire interior was finished in dark wood . If the building could be said to fall into any one class of architecture , it was nearer Tudor than anything else . In the rear , off the reception hall , was Steinmetz ' office . This room was com , ipletely filled with treasures , which ranged from an exhibit of the various types of electric light bulbs to cases of Indian arrowheads . Shelves and display racks reached from floor to ceiling , and to make it easy for the malformed Steinmetz to reach these objects , a ladder fitted with wheels ran around the room on a track . // Long before his house was ready for occupancy , Steinmetz had transferred his orchids and cacti to a new conservatory which was built in two sections , one much larger than the other . In the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet square and five and a half feet deep . At first Steinmetz used this pool to swim in during the winter months , or on summer days when he was too busy to go to a favorite spot on the Mohawk River . As he grew older , he changed the swimming pool into a water-lily bed and found the matted roots of these aquatic plants excellent hiding places for the fry of the exotic types of goldfish with which he populated it . He built a most attractive bridge arching the pool , and when weary or confused , would stand on it , elbows on the rustic guard rail , peering for hours into the flower-studded water , watching the flashing forms of the fish as they darted from one end of the pool to the other . Then , relaxed and refreshed , he would ret urn to his calculations . One of his favorite dishes was terrapin soup . A terrapin is an edible species of tortoise which inhabits the fresh waters of central North America . Often after eating a large bowl of terrapin soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Nicholaus ' , he would leave the table , go out to the busy kitchen and look over the cook 's stock of terrapins . He would buy all of the creatures the management was willing to sell , then tricking them into his already bulging coat pockets , hurry home to the conservatory . Once on the bridge , he would pick the terrapins out of his pockets and drop them gently into the pool , observing with intense delight the way they climbed upon the lily pads , perfectly content with their new home . When Steinmetz stood on the bridge above the pool , he was able to reach and care for the baskets of orchid plants that hung iii profusion from the ceiling . There were hundreds of varieties , from every tropic region of the world , including some of rare horticultural and scientific interest . He // liked nothing better than attempting to cross two standard species of these flowers and develop an unrecorded hybrid . As a result , the area above the pool was a mass of brilliant variegated color . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cacti . Unlike the section in which the orchids were raised , this space was kept as hot and dry as possible to simulate the arid regions in which most types of cacti grow . Looking at the beds , one could see succulents of every type and of every conceivable shape ? some of them were ribbed like melons , others were flat as a piece of paper , a few looked like columns , while still others resembled balls . Many of these plants would bloom , displaying large , showy blossoms with exceptionally high coloring , in which scarlet , crimson , rosypink , orange and yellow predominated . If visitors gasped at the sight of the beauty of the orchid room , their host would remark quietly , " This is nothing . Wait until you see my cacti in the other room . " What he did n't tell his callers was tli ; it his planting of the natives of the hot , arid desert regions of the earth was the largest collection of cacti in the world , with the exception of Kew Gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , England . As a matter of fact , Steinmetz was as famous among horticulturists for his cacti collection as he was among engineers for his investigations . Realizing this , newspaper editors would regularly assign reporters to " get a story about that conservatory of Steinmetz ' . " Paul Waitt , one-time Sunday feature editor of the Boston Herald , took this assignment himself when Steinmetz came to Boston to address a meeting of businessmen . In the course of their conversation , which took place in the lobby of the hotel where the scientist was staying , Mr. Waitt asked , " Does n't beauty in a flower have any appeal to you at all , Mr. Steinmetz ? I mean in flowers beside orchids . " // " No , " replied the engineer as lie looked intently at the throngs of people rushing through the convention-jammed hotel . " Take the rose . Most people think it is beautiful ; I do n't care for it at all . I much prefer the cactus , for the simple reason that it has a far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its surroundings ; and we human beings can learn much from its ability to adjust itself to unfavorable conditions . " " Most gardeners keep a record of their activities in order to see how one season compares with another . Do you also make notes on how your garden grows ' ? " inquired the editor-turned-reporter . ' Waving his cigar in a wide circle in response to a greeting from a passer-by , Steinmetz replied , " Mr. Waitt , I never keep any record of my experiments and investigations . My memory files all things away conveniently and reliably . I should say though , I do not encumber it with a lot of useless matter . I remember only the things that interest me and facts of which I intentionally make a mental record . Names and faces , for instance , do not interest mc , so I never remember either . But if a man says anything or asks anything that interests me , that is what I will remember him by , and that will recall his personality . " Steinmetz ' fondness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristles and tufts of barbs , was closely related to his own physical handicap . To him , these plants , capable of surviving without much nourishment and very little water , were a symbol of his struggle to convince the world that his crippled body did not hamper the workings of his mind . For all too often he had noticed the look of pity or dismay on the faces of those who saw him for the first time . Then , too , despite his recent successes , he could remember all too well the surly engineer at the Edison works who had turned him down when lie applied for a job , shortly after his arrival in America , and how that individual had paid no attention to Maker of Lightning ioi his letter of introduction , but had thrown it in the wastebasket . Steinmetz was sure that this refusal to give him a chance to show what he could do had been due to his malformity . While most of his visitors never paid the slightest attention to his infirmities , there were a few who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these folk a lesson , he delighted in planting an ordinary flower in the same pot with one of his cacti . Later on , he would call attention to the plant , now completely withered , and chortle , " Sec , cacti may be ugly and deformed , but they can live and flourish , producing flowers of great beauty under the worst possible conditions . " In this fashion he would express his kinship with the prickly , misshapen cacti . He gave them loving care and attention , finding his reward in the glorious blossoms they sent forth . Perhaps to his kind and understanding friend and former employer , Eickenmeyer , t h e twisted body of Steinmetz may have seemed like a cactus , whose flowering was his brilliant discovery of the " Law of I lysteresis . " Appearance is so often deceptive . It is almost never the measure of a man 's ability . Once his many varieties of plants had recovered from the shock of transplanting and wet ( ' established in their new home , Steinmetz turned his attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a basement passageway , which was later used by the ( builders as part of the foundation of the house . He wanted the laboratory to be big enough for every possible type of experiment , so he had it built two stories high . There were t I i rcc rooms on the ground floor and two smaller rooms above . No sooner had the workmen finished the shell of t lie building than Steinmetz left " Liberty Hall " and moved into his new workshop . He made himself perfectly comfortable with a few odds and ends of furniture , and then set to work installing the scientific equipment he had ordered through Mr. Rice . Although no one else in the world would have been satis102 STEINMETZ : fled with such a collection of household goods , Steinmetz , who never cared about physical comfort , was quite content with the furniture in the laboratory ? a rickety bed , a scarred table , a badly damaged chair or two and an assortment of broken and cracked dishes . When the General Electric Company had installed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been taken to fit up one end of the calculating department with easy chairs , a wide desk and filing cabinets so that the dwarf-like genius could work in comfort . The first time Steinmetz walked into his new quarters , he called for some porters . Pointing to the luxurious furnishings , he ordered , ' Take that stuff out of here ! I do n't care where you take it , but take it out ! " The puzzled workmen stripped the room of the new furniture , and under Steinmetz ' direction carried in a battered desk and a plain wooden chair . At last he was satisfied . Looking around , he rubbed his hands with glee and said , " ' Thank you , boys . Now I can work here ! " He did , however , leave one overstuffed chair in the room . No one ever saw him sit in it , but he insisted that it be kept dusted , and when he died it was in as perfect condition as the day it was bought . So it was natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainest furniture in his new laboratory at Wendall Avenue . He never even considered the need of a stove ? after all , he always could cool , his meals on a Bunsen burner ! What he lacked in the way of household goods he made up for iii scientific equipment . ' the laboratory was a maze of wires , switchboards , armatures , generators , batteries , motors and other electrical devices . Three or four laboratory worktables were scattered through the room , and all of them received ample light from the numerous windows . Within easy reach of the crippled experimenter , on wide shelves above the workbench that ran along the wall , various supplies were stored . At first boxes , vials , cartons and cans were // neatly arranged , but before long the shelves were piled everywhich-way with chemicals , small parts and hand tools . Just before Steinmetz moved into the laboratory to live , his sister Clara came to pay another of her visits . He did not spend as much time with his guest as he did in supervising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , setting up his laboratory and caring for his plants and pets kept him very busy . His collection of animals had grown over the years and it was almost a full-time job to tend them . Feeding the alligator was no easy task ? it had grown old and lazy , and it was necessary to have help to force the ration of raw meat down its throat . The scientist would ask any caller to push the meat down the reptile 's throat while he held its jaws open . This was not , as can well be understood , one of the more popular entertainments at Wcndall Avenue . Then one day the alligator , w ; inued by a few clays of pleasant weather , seemed to regain his vitality . Somehow he wandered out of the conservatory , made his way across the lawn and started down the sidewalk . His progress was seen by most of the neighborhood , but no one had courage enough to capture him . By the time Steinmetz came home from the works , the reptile had completely vanished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of alarm ! Children were warned not to go swimming , and very few citizens dared venture forth at night . At last the alligator was corralled and brought back to Wendall Avenue , seemingly none the worse for his adventure . However , he refused to eat , and in attempting to force-feed him , Steinmetz pushed too large a piece of meat down his throat and the poor creature choked to death . While her brother was engaged in his various activities , Clara was not idle . " Liberty I tall , " where she was staying , had n't had a thorough cleaning since her last visit . When she complained to the scientist , he merely shrugged his shoulders and asked gruffly , " What difference does it make ? // After all , I do n't live here any more , and just as soon as my new house is built , I 'll remove the furniture . So why should I clean it ? for that landlord of mine ? I have n't forgotten how he laughed at the loss of my notebooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothing . To the world at large her brother was a genius . To her he was the same impossible boy who had been such a problem itt the old days in Breslau . So she washed floors , polished furniture , cleaned windows and spent hours trying to convince Karl ? for she still called him by the old name ? that she could prepare better meals than the griddle cakes and eggs which he insisted upon cooking for himself on a Bunsen burner . and eating on a laboratory worktable . It was a hopeless task . In order to soothe Clara 's ruffled feelings , Steinmetz occasionally did come to eat dinner wit Ii her and spend the night at " Liberty Hall . " On one of these rare evenings , the doorbell rang . Two young men had conic to call on the engineer . One of them , a fellow-worker at the General Electric plant , had never met the chief consulting engineer of the firm ; the other knew him well , having often dined with him at the Knigcrs ' . Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the second-floor hallway , which was used by her brother as a sitting room . Ile was playing with one of his parrots when they arrived , but he immediately put the bird back on its perch , thanked his sister , and turned to his guests . The stranger was introduced to him as Joseph LeRoy I layden , an engineer who had just been transferred to Schenectady from the Lynn plant of General Electric , where he had been engaged iii experiments aimed at improving street lighting . Steinmetz was attracted to young Hayden at once . Not only did he like the youth 's personality , but he was greatly impressed with his knowledge of electrical engineering . What began as a short social visit lasted for hours , as the // two men discussed the problem of making city thoroughfares brighter at night . When Clara made it clear that the callers should go home so that their host could go to bed , Steinmetz held out his hand and said , " Be sure to come and see me again , Mr. Hayden . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here , you will find me either in my conservatory or laboratory on Wcndall Avenue . Perhaps , now that you are on the staff here , we can work together on your street-lighting problem . It interests me very much . " Hayden left " Liberty Hall " in a daze . The greatest electrical engineer in the world had suggested that they collaborate ! Indeed he would come again ! The young man soon became a constant visitor , and as the weeks went by , the older man and his youthful associate grew closer and closer together . Steinmetz , the genius witli a warped and twisted body , was essentially a lonely man , and this new found friend gave him the comradeship he had sought iii vain all his life . Roy Hayden , on the other hand , discovered in the experienced Steinmetz an inspiration and a closer kinship than he had ever felt toward any otlici man . ' l'hc time was not so far distant when their relatinlusliip would become even closer , for eventually Steinmetz legally adopted Roy . Their association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crows , parrots , alligators and monkeys who had never heard the voice of a wife or child in his home . Now Steinmetz had a son ! " The night comes down , the lights burn blue " - JOHN HAY LATE in the fall of i9o ; the house on Wendall Avenue was finally finished . Instead of being delighted with the idea of having a home of his own after long years of living in poorly furnished rooms and rented apartments , Steinmetz was not happy . In fact , as he hobbled from one room to another , he wondered why he had ever considered building the house at all . Standing in the downstairs hallway and looking up the stairwell , he asked himself , " Why do I need all this space ? The conservatory was dilfcrcnt ; after all , I had to build a place for my orchids and cacti . I 've no regrets on that score . Nor am I sorry that I accepted Mr. Rice 's friendly assistance and designed such a large laboratory . Those two buildings should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I certainly did n't need this house . Roy and I are perfectly comfortable in the laboratory . " He really did not require a house . With his plants sheltered and a place where he could work , a house was an unnecessary expense . To this devoted scientist , no better place could he found in which to live , sleep and eat , than in his beloved laboratory , surrounded by electrical and chemical apparatus . Everything he needed and wanted was within easy reach iii his spacious workroom , but it was very evident that in this large house that he had so foolishly built , he // would be lost as the glow from a firefly during a thunderstorm . " Now that I have built my home , " he complained one day to Mr. Kruger , " what am I going to do with it ? You can see that it is much too big for my needs . Actually , I have n't enough furniture to put in the rooms ? even if I could use all of them . Surely , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and buy more beds , chairs and tables when I do n't really want them . I 've got all the household goods I want and need in the laboratory , and afterall , when I go to sleep one bed is enough ? there 's another one for Roy , of course . In fact , those extra rooms are of no use to me at all . Frankly , I am afraid I will have to admit that the whole idea of building this house was a foolish one . While I 'm so comfortable in the laboratory , I 've no intention of moving , anyhow , so why did I build it ? " As a result , the new house stood silent and empty while its owner continued to live happily iii his old quarters . From time to time , one of his fellow engineers at the General Electric plant would spend the night wit li him , sleeping on one of the many cots he kept for visitors . Despite the fact that these cots were far from conafoaiable , guests never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by humming generators , was an exceptionally cheap price to pay for the opportunity of spending an entire evening with one of the world 's greatest scientists , discussing complicated theories of electrical engineering . Not everyone who came to call at Wendall Avenue was honored with a cordial invitation to spend the night on a cot in Steinmetz ' laboratory . A visitor had to be capable of two things in order to be welcomed : first , he must be able to contribute something worth-while to the conversation during the evening ; and , second , lie would be wise to have the ability to appreciate a practical joke . Most of the workers at the General Electric plant who I o8 STEINMETZ : were in the habit of visiting Wcndall Avenue were , by training and experience , capable of meeting the first requirement demanded of an overnight guest , but many failed miserably on the second test . As Steinmetz considered a broad sense of humor in a man an even more important possession than vast technical information , callers who did not know how to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how great their knowledge of science might be . For busy as he was pursuing investigations into new uses of electrical energy , Steinmetz always found time to engage in pranks . He had learned to laugh at his own troubles , and found in elfish escapades a relief from the severe mental and physical strain of long hours of calculation and experimentation . Others , he reasoned , should learn to laugh and enjoy life as much as he did . If they did n't know how , he would attempt to teach them . I f they were unwilling pupils , they did not have to come to school . His favorite trick was to electrify every metal object in the laboratory so that when an unsuspecting victim touched one of them , he would get a harmless but startling shock . By means of an extremely clever system of wiring , Steinmetz made sitting in any of the laboratory chairs a very risky process . When those callers who were constant visitors learned by sad experience not to touch anything in the laboratory , and always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully disconnect the wires fastened to it , the impish scientist decided it was time to develop a new system of jolting his guests . After some thought , he placed a small storage battery in one of the pockets of his baggy , gray-flannel pants , and ran an almost invisible wire down the inside of his right arm . n this way he was able to give a shock to anyone with whom he shook hands . The more dignified the caller , the more Steinmetz enjoyed playing a trick on him . One pompous engineer , who was associated with the scientist in a research project at the // General Electric works , took great care to avoid touching anything in the laboratory , always refused to sit down , and pointedly avoided shaking hands with his host when he came to discuss the progress of their investigation . For weeks Steinmetz plotted , trying to figure out some means of upsetting the stiff , unbending manner of his fellow worker . At last he conceived an ideal method . Just inside the door to his workroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When his victim entered the room one evening , Steinmetz slyly turned on the current . Dignity vanished as the caller leaped into the air in shocked amazement . Some weeks later , the same visitor came to spend another evening . Smirking wisely , he stood on the doorsill , gathered his legs under him , and jumped , landing three or four feet inside the room . Pretending that he had not noticed his guest 's unusual and very undignified entrance , Steinmetz greeted him and cheerily asked him to mike himself comfortable . Proud of having turned the t a Nes on the prankster , the visiting engineer strutted tom ' i id t l i e center of the laboratory . Suddenly he yelped witli terror and shot into the air ! Steinmetz had cannily reasoned that his caller would , by one means or another , avoid t l is metal plate placed just inside the door , and had rigged n l ) another n in the middle of the room . Then he had waited for the proper moment to send an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , did not take up all of the time of the gnome-like genius . Isar from it . Both at the Wendall Avenue laboratory and at his desk at the General Electric plant , Steinmetz was devoting long hours to the problem of improving street lighting . Ever since 1668 , when the citizens of London had been commanded " for the safety and peace of the city to hang out candles duly to the accustomed hour , " a workable method of installing adequate lights on city streets had been an objective of civic autbori11 O STEINMETZ : tics . In this country , long before the Revolution , New York and Boston had attempted to find a solution to the problem of providing people with light as they went from one place to another after dark , by passing laws requiring every seventh householder to place a lighted candle in his window at night . As early as 1789 , during the meetings of the Constitutional Convention , Philadelphia had a few street lights , and the first gas-lighting company in America was organized in that city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devote his energy and talents to finding a means of , using electricity to brighten city streets , gas was the accepted method of lighting thoroughfares . Like the boy in Robert Louis Stevenson 's poem , in A Child 's Garden of Verses , youngsters in every large city envied the lamplighter with his torch and considered no public official as important as the man who turned the gas lamps on in the evening and shut them off at dawn . Steinmetz had no such ideas . To be sure , gaslight ing was far better than candles , whale or oil lamps , but it was not good enough . Electrical power was the answer to street lighting . The only question was how to use it to best advantage . Steinmetz had been keeping in close contact with H. W. l lilhn ; ni , who was in charge of the experiments being conducted in street lighting by various specialists at the Lynn plant of General Electric . As a matter of fact , long before Roy Ilaydcn 's first visit , the great scientist had planned an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric arc lamps that were being developed by his firm and which were slowly coming into use in progressive cities ? and thus had welcomed the chance to talk to one of the engineers who had helped design them . These lamps , Steinmetz discovered , were a decided improvement over the original electric arc lights , but they were far from perfect . Dismantling one of them , he found that they consisted of two hard , hollow carMaker of Lightning I l i bon rods baked under high temperature in a die . The hollow core a flow of direct current . ( ) ne rod being positive , the other negative , the electric current jumped from one carbon to the other , causing them to burn brightly in " a most brilliant ascending arch of light , broad and conical in form in the middle . " Research had established that most of this light came from the positive carbon and showed the temperature of the arc to be bet wcen 6000 to 7000 degrees Fahrenheit ? equal to about one-tenth the brightness of the sun ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced at the Lynn works was the constant attention needed to set the carbon rods near enough together to strike the arc , and at the same time to keep them the proper distance apart so as to burn properly and give the maximum light . As the lamps were used , t Ime cam bons were consumed , making the space between then ) greater . WVlicn the distance between the electrodes became too great , the arc would fail and the lamp would go out . By t I lc clever use of an electromagnet , lighting engineers eventually overcame this handicap . Although the electric arc lamp was the latest in a long line of devices invented by mankind to overcome darkness , it was still based on a centuries old technique ? burn something and get light . Because the carbons were exposed to the air , they were quickly destroyed . Edison and other scientists who worked on the electric filament lamp were motivated by this fact . They sought to break away from the traditional method of getting light by developing a means of lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their carbons . The result of their attempt to avoid the rapid burning of the rods was the invention of a light com- // pletely enclosed in a vacuum , thus making the electrically charged filaments glow , instead of burn . This was because the glass bulb prevented contact with the air . From that day late in 1809 when Sir Humphry Davy made the first practical carbon arc lamp in his laboratory , down to Steinmetz ' time , experiments were constantly being carried on to prevent oxygen from reaching the carbons by enclosing them . As early as 184 ( , Staite announced a successful demonstration of restricting the flow of air to the electrodes by covering them with a large glass globe . Through the years , his method was gradually improved . When Steinmetz began his study of the problem of lighting city streets , the General Electric plant at Lynn was producing an electric are lamp which was surrounded by a glass container in which the carbons were consumed ninety per cent more slowly than in the open type arc lamps . This enclosed arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open arc types , because the lack of a free flow of oxygen prevented the formation of a seething " crater " on the tip of the positive carbon . This flaw in the performance of the closed arc lamp was overlooked by cities seeking to improve their street lighting , because these lamps did not require frequent renewal of burned-oiit electrodes . One of the enclosed carbon arc lamps made by General Electric could burn for a period of one hundred hours without adjustment , t ins giving several weeks of satisfactory service before having to be " trimmed " ? as replacing the carbons was called . ' I'lic enclosed arc had another advantage over open arc lamps for in order to be absolutely sure that the latter would provide light when needed , their manufacturers equipped them with two sets of electrodes . The additional pair was so regulated as to start automatically in case the original carbons should burn out during the night . This feature made open arcs more expensive to purchase and more difficult to service . // After subjecting the closed arc lamps developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself perfectly satisfied with their operation . Deciding that he could n't improve on the lamp itself , he set about finding a more suitable material than carbon to use as electrodes . Iie realized that if he could find a substitute for the commonly used carbon rods that would not burn out so quickly , he would overcome the high maintenance cost of street lighting by electric arc lamps ? a factor which prevented many tax-conscious city governments from switching front gas to electricity . Then , too , if his replacement provided more light than did carbon , he would do away with the objection of lighting engineers that closed arc lamps had less luminous efficiency than open arcs . Steinmetz started his work on this problem in his usual fashion . Before beginning any expel intents , the first studied the scientific reports of all those who had ever worked on the problem of the electric arc . I lc did not have to read nearly so many volumes dealing with this subject as he had when preparing for his investigation of hysteresis , for the electric arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into commercial use direr gnarters of a century later . The work of Charles Francis Blush , the pioneer American worker in carbon arcs , was so recent t hat Steinmetz was very familiar with it . Every technical school freshman knew how Brush , experimenting with the possibilities of combining lampblack and ground-up pure coke for use as carbons in an arc lamp , had molded them in ' lie family kitchen , using his wife 's cooking molasses as a binder ; then baked the rods in the kitchen stove , while the rest of the household hungrily waited for him to finish so that dourer could be prepared . The library at the plant furnished a complete record of this experimenter 's successful lighting of the Public Square in Cleveland , Ohio , with arc lamps run by electricity furnished by a dynamo of his own invention . This happened , about // two years before Edison 's perfection of the carbon-filament lamp , and Steinmetz read about it thoroughly . Once he had completed his research , Steinmetz began to experiment . After investigating the possibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substitute for carbon rods in his lamp . Magnetite is a hard , black , opaque mineral with a metallic lustre . Composed of 72.4 per cent iron , it is very magnetic . ' Iiiis property of the mineral had been recognized in very early times , and was described at length in the first century of the Christian era by Pliny , the Roman naturalist and author . After several months of investigation and testing , Steinmetz perfected a magnetite arc lamp that promised to replace those with short-lived carbon electrodes . However , he did not immediately inform his superiors at General Electric of the results of his experiments . He continued to conduct a series of trials and make improvements until he was absolutely sure his lamp would give complete satisfaction under all working conditions . At last , he felt that the bright , bluish light given off by the burning magnetite was as luminous as anything he was going to develop , and he gave an official demnstration . Everyone agreed that he had created a totally different and more efficient arc lamp ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period when all improvements in the field of electrical energy , light and power were dependent on alternating current , Steinmetz ' arc ran on direct current . When one recalls how long and patiently Charles Proteus Steinmetz had worked to advance the use of alternating current by the electrical industry , it seems most strange that he developed the magnetite arc lamp , for , although there was no doubt that his interest in the problem of lighting cities at night had resulted in the best method yet invented of turning dark thoroughfares into avenues of light , it was , paradoxically , a direct current arc . Eventually electric arcs // were engineered to operate on alternating current , but by the time they were placed in widespread use , the perfection of the incandescent lamp made them obsolete . Not all of the uses of arc lamps were taken over by filament lamps , however . They still are used for certain specialized purposes , such as airport beacons , searchlights , in lighthouses and in the projectors of motion picture theatres . Another important use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc lamps are employed by physicians to treat skin eruptions , tuberculosis , bone diseases and other ills . Before arc lamps were discarded , along with candles , lanterns , and gas lights , as a means of lighting city streets , Steinmetz ' improvement over the old carbon electrode arc lamp was subjected to further refinements . In its final form , the upper or positive electrode was made of a solid cylinder of copper , which burned very slowly because of copper 's ability to conduct heat , thus keeping the cylinder relatively cool . The negative electrode was composed of an iron tube containing three parts of magnetite and one part of titanium oxide . Magnetite , being an excellent conductor of electricity , vaporized quickly in the arc , resulting in a large flame made extremely brilliant by the titanium , a very hard mineral named after the Titans of Greek mythology , who were gigantic in size and power . Before long , due to its exceedingly bright bluish flame , the magnetite arc was known among electrical engineers as " the luminous arc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp , Roy Hayden had been closely associated with him , both at the plant and at the Wendall Avenue laboratory . A bachelor , with no family responsibilities , Hayden had gradually changed from a frequent overnight visitor to a permanent resident of the workshop-home of his superior . As their work progressed , the two men took over one of the upstairs rooms for a bedroom , leaving cots in one of the crowded downstairs shops for their overnight guests . Because he had been active // in the electric arc investigations at the Lynn works , Roy was an ideal assistant as Steinmetz experimented with magnetite . Moreover , Hayden had an excellent sense of humor and greatly enjoyed the pranks in which Steinmetz constantly engaged . The young man would keep his face absolutely straight , even though he was bursting with inward laughter while the mischievous cripple explained to someone who was staying overnight for the first time , " This is our hot water heater . We do n't run it all night , because it is n't necessary ? but would you do me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be easier for you to light it first thing in the morning . If you do , we 'll all have plenty of hot water to wash and shave , with enough left over to do the dishes . You do n't mind , do you ? " Who could object to such a simple request ? Nobody . What the visitor did n't know was that the hot water heater was very apt to blow back in the face of whoever lit it , if not perfectly adjusted ? and only Roy or Steinmetz knew how to regulate it . Many an expert iii engineering jumped precipitately back from the exploding heater ; then , wanting to be helpful , tried to light it again ? with the same result . Most of them stopped only when they heard loud shouts of laughter coming from the upstairs bedroom . When Steinmetz was completely satisfied with his magnetite are lamp , he suggested to the directors of the General Electric Company that they secure permission from the city of Schenectady to test the new light on Wendall Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetite arc , " he argued , " if we set poles along the sidewalk and light the area with the lamps . You can use my back yard as the location of the Brush dynamo , and young Hayden can watch it . We 'll make a civic celebration out of the affair . I do n't think you 'll have any trouble with the city officials . After all , they will be getting a section of Schenectady brilliantly lighted at night without any cost ! " // Arrangements were soon completed for the lighting of Wendall Avenue by the new electric arc lamp . Hayden was assigned the task of supervising the Brush power plant , which a crew of workmen set up in Steinmetz ' back yard , between the conservatory and the laboratory . Roy 's job was not a simple one ? the generator was very apt to get out of order and had to be watched constantly . Steinmetz had wanted his young assistant to be iii charge of the . machine because he wished to avoid the risk of a power failure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the night when the lamps were turned on for the first time , a tremendous crowd gathered in front of the scientist 's house . Everyone of importance at the General Electric works and in the city government was there , along with hundreds of sightseers . After a few brief speeches , the lamps were turned on , and a new era in street lighting was begun . Steinmetz was extremely happy . Not because his lamps with their bluish glow made ' Weiidall Avenue the brightest street in the world ; he had known that they would do this . His joy came from seeing so many of his friends all at once . He hobbled through the crowd , shaking hands , handing out cigars , greeting strangers and acquaintances . Before he was through , he had spoken to ahuost everyone on the street . " You know , " he said to Ilavdcn with a grin , " I have n't had so much fun in years . Why , I 've met people tonight that I have n't seen in months . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of engineers at a meeting of a scientific society . The members just sit and applaud politely . These people arc different . They cheer at the top of their voices , and go out of their way to tell me how wonderful they think I am . I do n't know whether I have done anything remarkable or not , but it is very pleasant to have your friends and neighbors compliment you . " " Stay here and listen to the praise , sir , " replied the courteous Roy . " I had better go back to that contraption of // Brush 's . If it stops , there wo n't be any plaudits from the crowd or from the bosses at the works for either of us ! Oh , will I be glad when someone develops an arc that runs by alternating current which can be supplied from a central power station , instead of by a source of direct current that has to be watched every minute . " " You 've not long to wait , Roy , " Steinmetz promised with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem and I feel I have a solution to it . " Waving his hand in farewell , Hayden returned to his power plant . Steinmetz stuck a fresh cigar in his mouth and walked toward the people on the sidewalk . As he went across the lawn he noticed that the shrubs planted in front of the house did not show up to advantage under the magnetite arcs . Immediately he was dissatisfied with his latest creation , and decided to develop an even more brilliant light . He would begin work on it tomorrow . That was the trouble . There were so many things to do tomorrow and not enough hours iii which to do them . There was always some complicated problem at the plant that needed attention , and he was not spending the time he should with his orchids , cacti and pets . Of course , Roy was a most capable assistant and he had grown so used to his com-panionship that he wondered whether he could ever face living alone in the laboratory without him . Yet even with the help of Hayden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not find sufficient time to undertake all the investigations into the mysteries of electricity he desired . All he could do was to try to accomplish as much as pos-sible . " I 'll just do the most important things , " he said to himself . " The other projects will have to be forgotten . The future will have to take care of itself . I 'm not going to worry about it . ' lucre is only one thing I wish I could forget , and that is this house . It is ridiculous to have it standing empty . // Building it was my most unsuccessful experiment . " Meanwhile , Roy Hayden had also been doing some think-ing about the future . The young man had become engaged and Steinmetz was vitally interested in the progress of his assistant 's love affair and liked to discuss it with him . In fact , on the nights when Roy went to call on his future wife , the scientist would wait up for him , anxious to find out whether everything were going smoothly . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a seri-ous talk , Steinmetz giving words of advice as to the best way of winning a lady 's hand and heart ! Roy , of course , was in no hurry to get married as he was quite happy living and working in the laboratory with Stein-metz . There were , however , a number of things about their relationship which Hayden found unpleasant . The scientist 's interest in and knowledge of chemistry gave Steinmetz the delusion that he was an excellent cook . But no one who ever ate a meal cooked by him agreed with this opinion ! Painful memories of meals prepared by Steinmetz had been one of the reasons why the Berg brothers had begged the cook to reconsider when she had threatened to leave " Liberty Hall . " They knew what kind of food would result when their room-mate took over the kitchen . In addition to Steinmetz ' painful efforts with stove and pan , he would often develop a strange fancy about food , and try to convince everyone that his new theory on eating was the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendall Avenue by the magnetite arc lamps , the scientist was insisting on preparing ; meals according to color ! " I 've been doing some serious thinking , Roy , " he announced one evening , " and I have come to the definite conclusion that foods that are yellow in color arc the most healthful . " With that statement came the start of a series of meals consisting of nothing but scrambled eggs , griddlecakes and cornmeal . Just when Hayden was ready to rebel , Steinmetz
