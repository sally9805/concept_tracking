When he was only 13 , Thomas Verner Moore knew what he wanted to be-a hermit . The son of a Louisville insurance man , young Tom Moore had had his imagination fired by a book on the so-called Desert Fathers of the Church who retired from the world in the 3rd and 4th Centuries to devote their lives to silent contemplation of God . But Thomas Moore lived a busy life far from the desert ; he grew up to be a priest and a physician , prior of a Benedictine monastery , founder of a psychiatric clinic for children , and finally head of the department of psychology and psychiatry at Washington 's Catholic University of America . <P> He retired in 1947 , and set out at once to fulfill his early ambition . That year , Father Thomas Moore , almost 70 , was accepted as a novice at the Carthusian Monastery of Miraflores in Spain . This week , after three contemplative years , he was busy in the U.S. on a mission to establish the first house of his order in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carthusian Order , founded at the end of the nth Century , is considered one of the strictest in the Roman Catholic Church . Unlike the Trappists , who live and work together in silence , the Carthusians spend most of their time in complete solitude . Carthusian monasteries , which the British call " charter houses , " are constructed around a cloister , on which opens each monk 's individual house with his private walled garden . The houses are small but include a room for eating , a room for sleeping , a study and a chapel . Each monk has a woodworking shop in which he may spend a recommended half-hour of diversion each day working with his hands . <P> Each monk devotes as much as 14 hours of each day to prayer , including the daily Mass and the offices , some of which he sings with his brother monks in the monastery chapel . Each sleeps some seven hours-half in the evening and half in the early morning . The two daily meals , silently delivered to each house by a lay brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fish , fruit , bread and water or wine is the main meal . From September to Easter the second meal consists only of bread and water . <P> " We all lose weight on our diet , " says Father Moore cheerfully . " I 've lost about 15 pounds since my Benedictine days . But we could n't be healthier . Pope Leo XIII once ordered a less rigorous regime , but a Carthusian delegation , all 80 to 90 years old , changed his mind . If the delegation lived so long , the life could n't be too hard , he decided . " <P> Young Man . The Carthusian Order now has about 750 members in its 26 houses in Europe . Their best known product is the heady liqueur , Chartreuse , which they have made since the 17th Century from a secret formula . But the real Carthusian preoccupation is prayer . Pope Pius XI said of the Carthusians that their special duty is , like Moses in the fight between the Israelites and the Amalekites , to be on the mountain praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
