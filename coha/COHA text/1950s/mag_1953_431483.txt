 | I was midnight , but the old lady from Dubuque showed no sign of folding . She wore a pink satin hat edged with rhinestones , and she rattled the dice in her cagily cupped right hand like an expert from ' way back . " A dollar . " she said . She rolled a six . The night-club dice girl , blond , and looking bored as all dice girls look when the opponent is not promisingly male , eyed the jaunty hat and silver hair with frigid detachment . " A dollar , " she echoed mechanically . She threw out the dice , making them crack against the edge of the little bosom-high green baize table . They came up one and one . " Snake eyes ! " squealed the little old lady from Dubuque . She picked up the two dollars and called out another bet and rolled again . Somewhere in infinity , or possibly just in New York , the bright , slick editor of a bright , slick weekly magazine that made its debut a quarter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shivered inexplicably in a warm room over a cold . correctly made cocktail . For the old lady from Dubuque. 1953 style . is not a comical little doll in black bombazine , carrying a reticule and a tightly furled umbrella . She is not necessarily a stranger to Scotch whisky or baffled by E. B. White . She is no longer ( if she ever was ) an apt , amusing symbol of American provincialism . Why should she be ? Her world is only two hours and forty minutes from Chicago on the Twin City Zephyr . Dubuque is a long , narrow town squeezed between the Mississippi River and the hills . It has high curbs and big five-and-ten-cent stores and dignified pool parlors and old-fashioned barbershops with wide plate-glass windows that look out on Main Street , so that a girl walking by can feel eyes whistling at her above lathered cheeks as customers loll in the tilted chairs on Saturday afternoon . It has plenty of good schools , and a whopping department store , and churches of almost every denomination . People with young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because it is built on seven hills , its citizens proudly call it " Little Ronie . " Dubuque looks across the Mississippi at two states , Wisconsin and Illinois , and it serves all forty-eight . When New York City has a blizzard , its streets are cleared by Sno-Gos made in Dubuque . When a San Francisco lady opens her window to the fog . chances are she is throwing up a sash manufactured in one of Dubuque 's two big sash-and-door factories . Meat packing is the town 's largest industry , to the tune of $135.000.000 a year ; and machines from the famous John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works cut across farms in Maine and Oklahoma and Montana . Dubuque 's toil at the manufacture of furniture , paper boxes , leather jackets , metal tanks , and plumbing goods . When they are not toiling , they play . And this is the story of how they play after dark . @#  | If you want to know the way it is in Dubuque , pretend it is seven o'clock in : he evening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering what to do . It is just a quick stroll to a bowling alley , or to a restaurant where you can get a braunschweiger sandwich for 350 , or to a movie where you can see a double feature . You can buy a beer , which is legal , or ( just as easily ) a rye highball , which is not . Dubuque has no television station , but you can see television , a trifle wobbly and gray. , in many of the taverns ; and you can dance to coin machines or sing to organ music played through the nighttime hours by a female jazz artiste . The people of Dubuque do all these things when they go out . I STARTED my big night in Dubuque in the Tap Room of the Hotel Julien , zuided by Mr. and Mrs. George Freund and their friend Ray Laube Mr. Freund director of news at radio station KDTH ; Mr. Laube , a veteran of Korea , is a newscaster for the same station ; Mrs. Freund the mother of a small boy and girl but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend sorority meetings in the lounge adjoining the Tap Room The Tap Room was comfortable and unpretentious ? pale-tan walls , a darktaupe carpet , round red-topped tables bordered in silver and blue bands , and four bullet-shaped metal ceiling fixtures with red bulbs shedding a Mephistophelean light on the room . Along one wall there was a beige bar with upholstered stools , where a couple of men were engaged in conversation with the bartender ; along another , big comfortable booths . It was after seven , but altogether there .. ere only eight persons in the room ; the Freunds said it was patronized mostly by traveling salesmen , and that local businessmen in the mood for a drink after a hard day were more apt to drop in at the Elks Club , which is conveniently located in the center of town . We dined at eight at the Bunker Hill . Bunker Hill used to be a golf club , but it lost money , so a wealthy citizen combined with some of the local businessmen to buy it and deed it to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conform to the law , and converted the former dining room into a restaurant popular with the family trade . The food concession is leased to Jack and Betty Crane ( Jack serves as chef , Betty as manager ) , and the Freunds said it was considered the best eating place in Dubuque proper . As we entered , hanging our coats in a big hall closet under the stairs ( there was no hat-check girl ) , a gay celebration was just getting under way : the sixteenthbirthday party of Leslie Jane Wagner , daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank L. Wagner . Long tables were arranged like three sides of a square in the main dining room , and on both sides of the tables sat boys and girls of sixteen and seventeen , their faces bright and attractive and somehow touching in the glow of many tall white candles . There were fifty of them , the girls in pastel evening dresses with sweet-pea corsages pinned to tulle bodices , the boys in daytime suits but terribly neat and scrubbed-looking . They all sat  | straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr. and Mrs. Wagner , the only grownups at the party , beamed upon the scene . Mr. Wagner , president of the Dubuque Container Corporation and a past president of the Chamber of Commerce , is an affable , good-looking man ; his red-haired wife , bustling and pink-cheeked in a white lace dress and orchids , appeared to be having a perfectly marvelous time as hostess . Because of the party in the main room , our group ate in what would have been the entrance hall if the club were a private house . The walls were papered in a beige-and-green pattern , the windows curtained in leafy cretonne . The yellow menu was decorated with a sketch of a roaring hearth and a little verse urging , with a certain insouciance of punctua-tion , " Knock gently , Friend , Whate'er betide ? The Kettles on So come inside " I ordered fruit cup ? it was canned fruit , but enlivened by a dab of whipped cream under the maraschino cherry ? and French-fried shrimps , which came with tartar sauce , a baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . The total price for all this was $1.85 . Filet mignon with mushrooms was listed on the menu at $2.65 ; pie alamode , 25c . The most expensive item available was the large T-bone steak , $3.50 with trimmings . Promptly at nine o'clock Gus Fuhrman came in with his accordion and played " Happy Birthday " for the boys and girls to sing to Leslie Jane . Gus by day is an income-tax expert ? a profession that might be considered quite remote from the realm of entertainment ? but he is full of tricks for getting a party rolling . He had the boys and girls sing " Happy Birthday " twice because he did n't think they sang loud enough the first time ; and by the time he was through " Let Me Call You Sweetheart " and into " Jingle Bells , " they were singing lustily . Gus made a game of " Jingle Bells . " He directed the boys and girls to tap on their drinking glasses in tempo and sing , but to stop tapping and singing each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by halting in the middle of a phrase , and always some boy or girl , or a few of them , would carry on helplessly for a note or two . This caused waves of giggling . Gus waggled a finger at one youth . " I can tell you do n't belong to the union , because you 're playing overtime , " he said . They roared at this witticism . The party , thanks to Gus , was really warmed up by the time we left . All the young faces in the candlelight looked flushed and happy and excited . AFTER dinner Mr. and Mrs. Freund went home to relieve Mrs. Freund 's mother , who was baby sitting , and Mr. Laube took over as director of my tour through Dubuque after Dark . It was time , he thought , to cross the bridge . The Julien Dubuque Bridge ( named , as so many things in the town are , for the French-Canadian founder of the city ) spans the Mississippi from Dubuque , Iowa , to East Dubuque , Illinois . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to cross , but it carries Du-  | buquers to a neon pleasureland where hard liquor is legal , and gambling , if not legal , is available . East Dubuque is the chief reason why it is so easy to get a drink of liquor in Dubuque . Theoretically only beer is sold in Dubuque bars and restaurants ; hard liquor may be bought only in stateoperated package stores , and no innkeeper furnishes his guests with dry Martinis . Actually cocktails and highballs are sold in Dubuque hotels , bars , and most restaurants so casually that an uninformed stranger would never suspect they were illegal . There are no peepholes or key clubs or membership cards or " Benny sent me " passwords ; the drinks are simply served without comment from bars well stocked with the standard brands . The natives offer a simple ex-planation : " If the hotels and restaurants in Dubuque did n't sell hard liquor , East Dubuque would take all the trade , and the businessmen of Dubuque would suffer terribly . " EAST DUBUQUE is easy to describe . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the lights go on , its squat buildings huddle in a halation from scores of neon signs ; words written in pink and yellow and violet and shocking red and blinding green beckon the stroller into Eddie 's , The 101 , El Rancho , The Bluff , The Hi-Ho , The Tick-Tock , and The Esquire . When bar doors open , music from juke boxes and hot organs and bass fiddles and clarinets tumbles out into the street , and sometimes a girl sings a ballad in a voice heavy with ersatz loneliness . There are other noises along the strip called Sinsinawa Avenue : Cracked ice sloshing inside metal cocktail shakers . Dice thumping across the tables of the " 26 " girls . Little metal spheres chasing each other around the innards of pinball machines . And laughter . The after-dark , we - might - as - well - have - another - drink kind of laughter . Mr. Laube and I did the main drag pretty thoroughly , starting with The Circle , " Dubuqueland 's Favorite Theatre Cafe . " It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge , lavishly decorated with giant plaster vine leaves across the ceiling and divided into a bar section , a good-sized dance floor , a dining area , and a bamboo-shaded Hawaiian Room with a television set on which the bar sitters were watching a prize fight . As we entered the main room , the floor show was just beginning . It was a Negro quintet , the Dozier Boys ; they worked at two microphones set out on the dance floor , and they played their own accompaniment to " Dry Bones " and " Tell Me , Baby , Tell Me , Please " and " 01 ' Man River . " Two of them played electric guitars ; the others worked on a ukulele , a pearly white cocktail drum , and a blond bass fiddle . They wore lightgreige suits and long dark-green ties with square ends ; and Peewee , one of the guitarists , had a little bop beard on the tip of his chin . They also had a little bop ending on their arrangement of " 01 ' Man River " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good , and the audience applauded them heartily . When they had finished their piece de resistance , the lights dimmed for dancing , and the O'Brien Trio took the bandstand , playing " Tenderly . " Jack O'Brien beat @#  | the drums softly , and Mrs. O'Brien tackled the Hammond organ with a fine jazz style , although she was gray-haired and looked more the type to play " Onward , Christian Soldiers " ; they were joined by Joe Chevalier , a vagabondish young fellow from Dubuque whose happiness is playing golf all day and the guitar all night . They were excellent too . As they played , couples took to the floor and danced , most of them cheek to cheek , with the man 's left arm holding the girl 's arm out stiffly , pointed downward , but a few executing a slow , cool Lindy . Most of the girls wore skirts and blouses or skirts and sweaters ; they looked neat and fresh and pretty . After a chat with Peewee on life at the Dubuque Y.M.C.A. ( he described it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thumbs ) , we pushed on to The Hi-Ho . The Hi-Ho is more typical of the East Dubuque cafe ? smaller and less elaborate , with no dance floor , just booths and a " show bar , " which is a stage built behind the bar , Chicago style . The entertainment works above the bartender 's head , facing the bar stools and the rest of the room . At The Hi-Ho it was a male pianist and a bass player . The pianist , Allan Jones , spends his days doing optical work in the clinic in Dubuque ; the bass player , Buddy Clarke , sells ladies ' shoes at Montgomery Ward . They work at The Hi-Ho on Friday , Saturday , and Sunday nights , which are the gay nights in East Dubuque . The duo played against a background of pink-and-white baroque scrolls , arranged to frame the stage . Opposite the bar there were booths set below silver wallpaper with faded lavender orchids printed on it . Men 's jackets were hung on the posts at the end of each booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American . OUR next stop was The Tick-Tock , a larger place with a dance floor as well as a bar and a low fence at the edge of the dance floor , behind which Hal Block , a guitarist , played hit-parade tunes and sang in a pleasant , relaxed , Crosbyish style . There were four pairs of women dancing together jigglingly , not talking or smiling but doing rather involved steps in a preoccupied way ; and many of the tables had two or four women sitting together drinking . Once in a while a man from another table would ask one of them to dance , and she would get up and they would dance wordlessly , and at the end of the dance she would go to her table and he would return to his . I had not seen this procedure since a night in Frankfurt , Germany , two years ago , when I visited a little cafe where lonely American soldiers gathered to dance with the local Freunden . The women dancing together at The Tick-Tock did not appear to be hostesses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they seem to be looking for pickups . They were just women without men . Our waitress , a plump , pink-cheeked friendly type named Hedy , turned out to be the mother of the owner of the place , Charles Loso . She verified my impression that the unescorted women were bona fide customers , not part of the atmosphere . She did n't know any of them @#  | personally , she said , but she figured they just came in to have a good time like anybody else . It did not seem to strike her that they did n't look as if they were having a good time at all . Locals say The Tick-Tock used to be a trifle wild at one time but since it was taken over by Hedy and sons ( two others are bartenders ) it has become eminently respectable . Hedy verified this new state of affairs too . " We run a nice place here , " she said . El Rancho was the most attractively decorated place I saw in East Dubuque . Some planner had decided on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , wagon wheels , a sky-blue ceiling , Indian totem poles standing on the floor , and brightly dressed Indian dolls propped among the glasses and bottles behind the bar . A solemn-looking piano player in a dark suit did sedate things on the keyboard , and well-behaved customers sat quietly at tables listening . We did n't stay long at El Rancho , because it was time to take the winding drive up to the Hilltop Casino to catch the floor show . THE Hilltop has a view , a dice girl at a " 26 " table , a long bar , and the most expensive floor show in town . We had missed most of the first act ? an elderly gentleman named George DeAlmo , who plays a banjo and tells jokes ? but we caught all of Johnny Verdi , a singing comedian in a gray sport jacket and bright-blue trousers . Johnny was brave , but he was not very funny . He had a lot of one-line jokes culled from the Broadway comics , but the old lady in the pink hat did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only the greatest comedians in the world get funnier as they die . He threw quip after quip into the void , and then he began to sing " Temptation , " and a tall girl in a brief black-fringed costume with one bare shoulder flitted out onto the floor and half danced , half crept around him , making gestures intended to convey the ultimate in enticement . She was his wife . The girl had a beautiful figure and long legs in the traditional black mesh stockings and pretty hair hanging in a long horsetail down her back , but somehow the total effect as she made an orbit around the singer was ludicrous . Still , the audience applauded at the end of the number . The girl ran off and the comedian held up his hand for silence . " Not too much applause , " he said . " It 's an old building . " He then announced he would imitate Gary Cooper . He began to talk slowly and haltingly . He drawled , " I have only one thing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not sound in the least like Gary Cooper . He tried Perry Como . He combed his black , thinning hair and put his hands deep in his jacket pockets and sang " Lies . " Physically he did look quite a bit like Perry Como , especially in profile , but he did n't sound like him . Halfway through the song he took out a package of Chesterfields and lit one and smoked it while he sang . This caused a ripple of laughter and scattered applause , and encouraged him to do his best trick of the evening . He blew a fat , substantial-looking smoke ring , allowed it to float a couple of feet in front of him , then sucked in  | his breath and drew it back into his mouth , where he swallowed it . This brought the house down , and he did variation , retrieving the smoke ring through his nose . It was funny , and the audience clapped . But he lost them again with s song He sang " How Do You Speak to an Angel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player hired that day and a bored drummer ? was terrible . When the song was over , he shrugged at the near silence and said , " I love iat here , I really do . I 've died here so many times , I love it . " He looked unhappy but courageous , with the awesome , unparalleled bravery possessed only by people in show business . It seems masochistic to outsiders , and it is bloodcurdling even to those who understand , and there is no bravery on battlefield or guillotine to compare to it . Johnny Verdi had it . After the show he and his wife came around and sat at our table , and Johnny talked about the act and the piano player and the audience , and he was not defeated . What he had been through was enough to make a normal man quit and take a job in a gas station , but Johnny is not a normal man , he is stage-struck . He sat there talking about the road , and the little joints they play for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the children left at home with his mother-in-law : and without ever saying it was hard he painted a picture of terrible hardship and sacrifice and monotony . Then his eyes brightened and he said , " I know I 'm not ready for it yet , I 'm just getting experience . But someday , maybe ? Broadway . " He smiled when he said it . And his wife smiled too . But you knew they believed it , at least a little bit , at least part of the time . IT WAS getting late for Dubuque when Mr. Laube and I crossed the bridge back to Iowa , but there was still action along Main Street . At the Merchants Lounge in the Merchants Hotel , John Tilp , known to the customers as Gus , and John Dawson , known as Ducky , shoved beer and Scotch and rye and bourbon across the crowded bar ; and from the laughter and table hopping and all-pervading gaiety of the atmosphere it was clear this place deserved the description " a popular rendezvous . " Mr. K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murwin , and Mr. and Mrs. Hal Reynolds ( Mr. Reynolds is a lawyer ) were at their table , and so was vivacious Miss Maurelia Kennedy . They were all pleasant and fashionably dressed , the ladies well coiffed and wearing smart little hats . It was Miss Kennedy who explained the irresistible charm of the lounge . " Everybody comes here , " she said . " You always see somebody you know , or somebody you 'd like to know . " It was almost closing time when we got to the Canfield Hotel on West 4th Street , but the boys from Loras College were still calling out for tunes from Inez Mann , a lively , fiftyish blonde perched high at a small organ opposite the bar . The boys were celebrating because they had received their class rings just that day , and Miss Mann , who has the cozy charm of a belle from Meridian , Mississippi , was inclined to indulge them . The boys were drinking beer and philosophizing and joking and looking down at their black-and-gold rings , feeling happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans ? managed to look neat and sloppy at the same time , and their faces were bright . Any of them could have posed for a monument to Young America . James Burke , a tilt-nosed long-eyelashed movie type from Wilmette , Illinois , was in the mood to be instructive about the town . " Let me tell you about Dubuque , " he said . " Let me tell you about the girls . " A boy from Milwaukee , Richard Fenning , poked his crew cut into the discussion . " I can tell you about them too , " he said . " A couple of dates and they think you 're going steady . " MR . CANFIELD himself was behind the bar , and he was being polite , but quite obviously he wished everyone would go home so he could close . But everyone on the other side of the bar was finding the conversation interesting ; in fact there were several conversations going on at once . Don Kaliban of Lisbon , Iowa , was saying that he came from the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two members of the Loras varsity-football squad , Tom Clancy and John Murphy , were filling me in on life in a mortuary . They share a room over Steuber 's Funeral Home at 15th and Iowa , and make beer money doing odd jobs around the place . " We clean up and move things around . " said John impishly , obviously anxious to be pressed for details . Mr. Canfield turned off the lights aa signal that the evening was at an end Everybody edged a couple of feet toward the door , but nobody actually went through it . " Let me tell you about the girls itDubuque , " reiterated James Burke gravely . " They are very naive . " Mr. Canfield sighed loudly . " But we like them , " said Richard Fenning . " Let me tell you about Dubuque , " said James Burke , as if he were about to impart a secret . " We like it , " said Richard Fenning . The other boy nodded . " Confidentially , " he said , " it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Canfield to lock up , the boys climbed into their jalop - ies and drove away , and the great little town of Dubuque went to sleep at last
