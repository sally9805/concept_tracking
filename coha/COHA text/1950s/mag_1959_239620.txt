Sin has long been an unfashionable word in most analytic circles , but last week the American Psychological Association offered 7,000 members ( jammed into Cincinnati for its annual convention ) a soul-searching symposium entitled " The Role of the Concept of Sin in Psychotherapy . ' ' Upshot : the idea of sin , at least for use . in treating the sick psyche , is making a comeback . <P> The University of Illinois ' famed Researcher 0 . Hobart Mowrer began with vigorous kicks at the moribund body of classical Freudian theory as he defined it ( many latter-day Freudians would not buy his definition ) . " We psychologists . " Mowrer said , " " have largely followed the Freudian doctrine that human beings become emotionally disturbed , not because of their having done anything palpably wrong , but because they instead lack insight . We have set out to oppose the forces of repression and to work for understanding . This leads to the discovery that the patient or client has been , in effect , too good , that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has been unnecessarily inhibiting . And health , we tell him , lies in recognizing and expressing these impulses . " <P> Hell on Earth . As a result , said Dr. Mowrer. " not only have we disavowed the connection between manifest misconduct and psychopathology , we have also very largely abandoned belief in right and wrong , virtue and sin . ' ' The idea that man can have the benefits of an orderly social life , without paying for it through restraints and sacrifices , said Dr. Mowrer , is " a subversive doctrine . " <P> Instead of the " salvationist 's vision " of a future hell . Dr. Mowrer suggested : " There is a very tangible and very present hell on this earth . It is this-the hell of neurosis and psychosis-to which sin and unexpiated guilt lead us . If it proves true that certain forms of conduct characteristically lead to emotional instability , what better or firmer basis would one wish for labeling such conduct as destructive , self defeating , evil , sinful ? " <P> By Freudian theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurotic and psychotic individuals to have led exemplary , yea saintly lives . The fact is that they typically exhibit lives that have been disorderly and dishonest in extreme degree . ' ' And mental hospitals , he charged , are full of patients who have had insight therapy-to no avail . <P> Down With Blame . " I see no alternative , " said Mowrer , " but to turn again to the old , painful but also promising pos sibility that man is pre-eminently a social creature , or in theological phrase , a child of God . " Future treatment of the emotionally ill. suggested Mowrer , " will , like Alcoholics Anonymous , take guilt , confession and expiation seriously and will involve programs of action rather than mere groping for ' insight . ' "
