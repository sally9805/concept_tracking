For months , a flood of complaints about misleading radio-TV commercials poured into the offices of the New York Better Business Bureau and Kings County ( Brooklyn ) District Attorney Edward S. Silver . To nail the offenders , Silver had policemen and policewomen pose as residents of apartments that were wired with tape recorders . The couples would answer the commercials , record the salesman 's spiel when he called on them . <P> Last week Silver charged that at least 15 sellers of vacuum cleaners , food freezers , storm windows , " have gypped . . . our public out of millions . " For example , the decoy couples called a station about a sewing machine advertised at $26.50 . They were visited by a sharper who confided that the machine was not very good ; its needle was apt to snap under heavy strain and could not be replaced . Then he offered a $50 discount on a $189.50 model . <P> By such tactics , said Silver , the sewing-machine agency was able to peddle 3,500 machines last year , for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been able to buy the $26.50 model . In another case , an upholstering firm that advertised a $69 renovating job on the air made an average sale of $160 on responses , for a total $117,000 last year . Warned Silver : " People were just inviting the burglar into their homes . " <P> Last week a grand-jury investigation of the commercials was scheduled by County Judge Samuel Leibowitz . And as a warning , the judge " invited " 22 top radio-TV executives to send representatives to watch the proceedings .
