1 EXT . ANDROCLES TAILOR SHOP - DAY FADE IN It is a tiny shop squeezed into a narrow street now crowded with a motley assortment of shoppers , beggars , idlers , vendors ; amongst them MEGAERA , the wife of ANDROCLES , a slatternly female , too well fed , now in a state of agitation , pushing her way with difficulty to the door of the shop . 2 INT . ANDROCLES TAILOR SHOP - DAY It is a square room furnished with a stool or two and a working table on which are piled several articles of clothing in the process of being mended . There is a fitter 's dummy in the corner and an assortment of finished and unfinished garments hanging from pegs on the wall . A door opens to living quarters in the rear of the shop . Surrounding the table is a somewhat evil looking billygoat , a mongrel dog of much haphazard ancestrage , a grizzled tomcat with a dissipated face and a one-legged duck whose missing member has been replaced by a wooden stilt with which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door is flung open , setting off a friendly bell to TINKLE , as Megaera enters . &nbsp; MEGAERAAndrocles !  --  Androcles !  --  Where are you  --  ? From beneath the table where he has been feeding the duck , Androcles appears , coming up between the goat and the dog . &nbsp; ANDROCLESYes , dearie ? Did you call me ? Androcles is a small , somewhat ridiculous little man with a kindly , beatific expression on his face . Megaera turns on him angrily . &nbsp; MEGAERACome out of there ! - feeding those filthy animals at a time like this !  --  3  --  &nbsp; ANDROCLES ( undisturbed ) Has something happened , dearie ? &nbsp; MEGAERA ( mimicking him ) " Has something happened , dearie !

( starts to weep ) And me along with you ! As if it were my fault  --   --  4  --  &nbsp; ANDROCLES ( consoling her ) But you 're not a Christian , dearie . Though heaven knows I tried to convert you . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( bitterly ) A fat lot they 'll care whether I 'm a Christian or not as long as I 'm your wife !

Do n't you know what will happen to you ? &nbsp; ANDROCLES ( sublimely indifferent ) No happier fate could be mine , dearie , than to be martyred . You be on your way  --  I 'll wait for the Romans . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( shrewdly ) Oh , no you do n't !  --  I 'm onto your little tricks ! You 're just trying to get rid of me. ( cont 'd )  --  5  --  &nbsp; MEGAERA ( cont 'd ) The minute I 'm gone you 'll be off the other way . Think you 're pretty smart , do n't you ? Well , we 'll see about that  --  ( she grabs him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bundle ) Now , then  --  get hold of that bundle ! &nbsp; ANDROCLES ( squirming under her grip ) You 're hurting me , dearie !  --  &nbsp; MEGAERAYou 'll have to get up earlier in the morning to pull the wool over my eyes  --  you  --  you  --  Christian ! &nbsp; ANDROCLES ( plaintively ) But I 'd much rather stay  --  really  --  &nbsp; MEGAERAOn your way  --  She loads the pack onto his back , under the weight of which he bends nearly double . &nbsp; ANDROCLESHow about my pets  --  ? ( he calls to the goat , dog , cat and duck ) Come along boys  --  we 've got to go , now  --  &nbsp; MEGAERA ( interfering ) They stay here  --  and good riddance to them ! Maybe they 'll be fed to the lions . Did n't you tell me they were Christians , too ? &nbsp; ANDROCLES ( under his load ) Even the smallest sparrow .  --  6  --  &nbsp; MEGAERA ( triumphantly ) Good !  --  then they wo n't mind being martyrs ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Megaera interrupts him . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( cont 'd ) Not that way !  --  out the back , you fool ! She gives him a final shove on his way and follows shortly after a quick look around , taking time to stop in the doorway , however , and deliver a final defiant grimace at the animals . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( cont 'd ) ( sticking out her tongue at them ) Nyaa . . . . They reply in kind ; the billygoat baaing , the cat spitting , the dog barking and the duck quacking . FADE OUT FADE IN Section Details 3 EFFECT SHOT - sun rising over mountain top . 4 EXT . FOREST - DAY LONG SHOT . In the tender light of early dawn the forest emerges from the darkness into the morning mist , its trees and foliage metamorphosing from indistinct shadows to familiar patterns and designs against the brightening sky . 5 MED . FULL SHOT dense thicket . From a recess under some rocks where the undergrowth is heavy with full grown foliage , comes the mighty ROAR of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high grasses , sets the leaves to shaking and the very trees themselves to tremble . 6 CLOSE SHOT thicket . Through the heavy , dew-laden  --  7  --  undergrowth comes another melancholy , suffering roar . Suddenly the leaves are parted and the instigator of these blasts , the lion , appears , his face furrowed into a mask of pain , the cause of which is immediately apparent when he limps into fuller view on three legs , holding up his right forepaw in which is embedded a huge thorn . With considerable discomfort he climbs up onto a shelf of rock . 7 CLOSE SHOT lion . He sits down and contemplates his paw . He licks it . He shakes it . He tries to extract the thorn by scraping it along the rock , and hurts himself worse . He roars piteously . He licks it again . 8 HEAD CLOSEUP lion . Tears drop from his eyes . 9 CLOSE SHOT lion .

Androcles and Megaera are silhouetted against the skyline as they struggle on their way . Androcles carries on his back an enormous bundle , Megaera nothing , and has a stout stick to help her along . Even at this distance , it is clear from her gestures that she is scolding and haranguing him . DISSOLVE 12 EXT . RAVINE AND SMALL STREAM Androcles and Megaera come toward camera . He wades across the stream which is only a few inches deep . Megaera halts on the bank . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( testily ) Well  --  how do you expect me to get across ?  --  8  --  &nbsp; ANDROCLES ( without sarcasm ) Walk , dear . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( angrily ) Do you want me to drown ? &nbsp; ANDROCLESIt 's hardly up to your ankles  --  &nbsp; MEGAERAI dare say you would n't care a fig whether I did drown or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I mean , yes , dear . He has dropped his bundle and proceeded to her ; he takes her on his back and staggers valiantly across the stream . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( on his back ) You cruel brute !

Self ! Self ! Self ! Always yourself ! &nbsp; ANDROCLESWe all have to think of ourselves occasionally , dear . Androcles deposits her on the other bank and goes back and fetches the bundle . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( as he returns ) A man ought to think of his wife some times !  --  9  --  &nbsp; ANDROCLESHe ca n't always help it .

You glory in it ! &nbsp; ANDROCLESIn what , darling ? &nbsp; MEGAERAIn everything ! In making me a slave , and making yourself a laughing-stock ! It 's not fair ! You get me the name of being a shrew with your meek ways , always talking as if butter would n't melt in your mouth ! And just because I look a big strong woman , and because I 'm  --  10  --  goodhearted and a bit hasty , and because you 're always driving me to do things I 'm sorry for afterwards , people say : " Poor man : What a life his wife leads him ! " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . But I do , I do . ( screaming ) I do ! &nbsp; ANDROCLESYes , my dear , I know you do . &nbsp; MEGAERAThen why do n't you treat me properly and be a good husband to me ? &nbsp; ANDROCLESWhat can I do , my dear ? She halts , sits down and begins to adjust the laces of her sandal . Androcles pauses , puts down the bundle . &nbsp; MEGAERAWhat can you do ? You can sacrifice to the gods as respectable people do ; instead of having us hunted out of house and home for being dirty disreputable blaspheming atheists ! 14 CLOSE SHOT Androcles . He cuts a hollow reed and begins carving it into a flute . &nbsp; ANDROCLESI 'm not an atheist , dear . I 'm a Christian . 15 CLOSE SHOT Androcles and Megaera . Megaera tightens the laces on her other foot . &nbsp; MEGAERAWell is n't that the same thing , only ten times worse ? Everybody knows that the Christians are the very lowest of the low . &nbsp; ANDROCLESJust like us , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you dare to compare me to common people ! My father owned his own public-house , and sorrowful was the day for me when you first came drinking in our bar ! &nbsp; ANDROCLESI confess I was addicted to it , dear . But I gave it up when I became a Christian . &nbsp; MEGAERAYou 'd much better have remained a drunkard ! . . . She starts to walk out of scene . Androcles tucks the flute in his belt , picks up the bundle , and is about to follow . 16 CLOSE SHOT the tortoise .

She takes a seat on the rock directly in front of the lion . &nbsp; MEGAERA ( cont 'd ) Always threatening me with wild beasts to make me walk the very soul out of my body when I can hardly drag one foot before another . We have n't seen a single lion yet . The tasselled tip of the slumbering lion 's tail swishes through the air behind Megaera 's head , brushing away a fly , then disappears , unseen by Androcles and Megaera . &nbsp; ANDROCLESWell , dear , do you want to see one ? &nbsp; MEGAERAYou cruel beast ! I suppose you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows on his knees . &nbsp; ANDROCLESEven a lion would make a nice change .

Cato , a lean and hungry investigator of the Emperor 's private police , steps out onto the balcony beside him and also watches . He is a man of culture and refinement , but with no feeling save for the perverted joy he gets out of his job . He is carrying a bunch of grapes from which he occasionally plucks one and tastes with sensual delight . &nbsp; CATOWell .

Lavinia giggles . &nbsp; LAVINIACaptain , how can you ? The idiocy of his statement strikes him as comical as it does her , and he smiles for the first time .  --  45  --  &nbsp; CAPTAINThat was pretty silly , was n't it ? &nbsp; LAVINIAYes , Captain , it was . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( earnestly ) Lavinia , what is a patrician woman like you doing amongst these Christians ? &nbsp; LAVINIA ( with mock gravity ) I am a Christian , Captain . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Emperor 's amusement . He is unable to keep his eyes from showing the impression she has made on him . &nbsp; CAPTAINThe Emperor does not desire to persecute Christians morely for the sake of persecution . No Christian can be harmed save through his or her own obstinacy . All that is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods  --  a simple and convenient ceremony effected by dropping a pinch of incense on the altar , after which the prisoner is at once set free . 118 CLOSE SHOT Lavinia .

A flicker of feeling crosses her face . &nbsp; LAVINIAYour jokes are too grim , Captain . Do not think it is easy for us to die . Our faith makes life far stronger and more wonderful in us than when we walked in darkness and had nothing to live for . Death is harder for us than for you .

For then I should perhaps be meek and gentle like him . And yet there seems to be a special providence that makes my trials less than his . I hear tales of the crowd scoffing and casting stones and reviling the brethren ! But when I come , all this stops ; my influence calms the passions of the mob ; they listen to me in silence ; and infidels are often converted by a straight heart-to-heart talk with me .

Caesar will go down in history as the Emperor who eliminated these cranks.

On the contrary , persecution fertilizes it  --  makes it thrive and grow . I dare say I am doing more to spread Christianity than all their preachers , missionaries and gospel writers put together .

Alexander and Augustus claimed heavenly paternity , why not he ? &nbsp; EDITORThat 's different . They were Emperors . &nbsp; CAESARHis followers say he is the Emperor of Emperors . That surely entitles him to the privileges of ordinary royalty . Many of my followers now call me a God , and to tell the truth , I occasionally feel that I am.

Some of them are quite two-faced . &nbsp; CAESARIndeed ? I thought them too dedicated for double dealing . &nbsp; CATOThere are those with a foot in both camps , blowing with each golden wind whither their profit takes them . Romans one day , Christians the next . Thus they may rob the temple today in the name of Christianity and steal from the Christians tomorrow in the name of Rome . &nbsp; CAESARHow opportune for them .

He looks a spoilsport . There are men in whose presence it is impossible to have any fun ; men who are a sort of walking conscience . He would make us all uncomfortable . &nbsp; CAESARFor that reason , perhaps , it might be well to have him . An Emperor can hardly have too many consciences. 318 CLOSE SHOT Caesar .

SHOT Caesar and group . &nbsp; CAESAR ( to the chuckling Retiarius ) These tricks are not wise , my friend . The audience likes to see a dead man in all his beauty and splendor . If you smudge his face and spoil his armor , they will show their displeasure by not letting you kill him . 331 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICEAnd when your time comes , they will remember it against you and turn their thumbs down . &nbsp; RETIARIUSPerhaps that is why I did it , Caesar .

These are to match into our existing scene . Lavinia obeys dutifully . He does an about face and disappears . The Captain finds it rather difficult to look up at Lavinia who stands before him , a picture of submission . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( finally , in an official tone ) I call the attention of the female prisoner to the fact that Christians are not allowed to draw the Emperor 's officers into arguments for which the military regulations provide no answer . Lavinia giggles . &nbsp; LAVINIACaptain , how can you ? The idiocy of his statement strikes him as comical as it does her , and he smiles for the first time . &nbsp; CAPTAINThat was pretty silly , was n't it ? &nbsp; LAVINIAYes , Captain , it was .  --  176  --  &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( earnestly ) Lavinia , what is a patrician woman like you doing amongst these Christians ? &nbsp; LAVINIA ( with mock gravity ) I am a Christian , Captain .

No Christian can be harmed save through his or her own obstinacy . All that is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods  --  a simple and convenient ceremony effected by dropping a pinch of incense on the altar , after which the prisoner is at once set free . Lavinia listens gravely and politely . &nbsp; LAVINIAYes , I know . &nbsp; CAPTAINI suggest to you that if you can not burn a morsel of incense as a matter of conviction , you might at least do so as a matter of good taste , to avoid shocking the religious convictions of your fellow citizens . &nbsp; LAVINIABut what about the religious convictions of my fellow Christians ?  --  177  --  &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( with another expressive glance at her ) I am aware that these considerations do not weigh with Christians , but it is my duty to call your attention to them in order that you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accusing the Emperor of cruelty , when he is showing you the most signal clemency . Looked at from this point of view , every Christian who has perished in the arena has really committed suicide . A flicker of feeling crosses her face . &nbsp; LAVINIAYour jokes are too grim , Captain . Do not think it is easy for us to die . Our faith makes life far stronger and more wonderful in us than when we walked in darkness and had nothing to live for . Death is harder for us than for you . The martyr 's agony is as bitter as his triumph is glorious . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( rather troubled - gravely ) A martyr , my dear young lady , is a fool . Your death will prove nothing . &nbsp; LAVINIAThen why kill me ? &nbsp; CAPTAINI mean that truth , if there be any truth , needs no martyrs . &nbsp; LAVINIANo , but my faith , like your sword , needs testing . Can you test your sword except by staking your life on it ?  --  178  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I test it , I test myself . But you are a woman , Lavinia ; your test is to love and be loved . &nbsp; LAVINIAMy faith is my love , Captain . And for it , if need be , I shall die . &nbsp; CAPTAINCan no man move you from this determination ? Her eyes twinkle . &nbsp; LAVINIAIs that the test ? The Captain is embarrassed . &nbsp; CAPTAINIt suffices for most Roman women . &nbsp; LAVINIAPerhaps no man has found it truly worth while to test me , Captain . Is that all , Captain ? &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( abruptly and stiffly ) Yes , it is . He makes a formal gesture of dismissal . &nbsp; LAVINIAThank you , Captain . Lavinia eyes him with a twinkle , gives him a little formal bow , and goes . Annoyed with himself , he watches her go , then turns away with a little gesture of irritation .
