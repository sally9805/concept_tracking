Like the Hiss case itself , Witness , by Whittaker Chambers ( TIME , May 26 ) , had a troubling effect on Americans . Few books in a dozen years have provoked such a burst of prompt , wide and heart-searching reviews . Verdicts have come not only from the professional book reviewers but from philosophers , historians and freelance intellectuals . They compared Whittaker Chambers ( favorably or unfavorably ) to St. Augustine , Rousseau , Casanova , Lincoln Steffens , Ulysses S. Grant , Lanny Budd . Adjectives chased one another across the pages : " terrible , " " penetrating , " " poignant , " " unbelievable , " " great , " " boring , " " thrilling , " " overwritten , " " embarrassing , " " fascinating . " Whatever their outlook , almost all reviewers agreed that the book was an event in contemporary history , and ought to be read . <P> The one part of the Chambers testimony that most disturbed the liberal intellectuals was his assertion that the great conflict of the age is between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Communist faith can be defeated only by religious faith . Only a small minority of reviewers seemed able to accept this assertion . The majority rejected it , at best as misguided and intolerant , at worst as a damned outrage . <P> Excerpts : <P> Lewis Gannett , New York Herald Tribune : " Witness . . . is the self-dramatization of a soul , haunted by morbid guilt and touched with religious passion , a ' confession ' and one of the extraordinary documents of our time . " <P> Clad Thompson , Kansas City Star : " It is the full and candid view of the most important question in the world today . " <P> John Dos Passes ( one of five reviewers in the Saturday Review ) : " Among the testimonials of the suffering spirit of man I think the book will stand high , somewhere between Dostoevsky 's The Possessed and the narratives of the adventures of the light within like Pilgrim 's Progress ... " <P> Charles Alan Wright , University of Minnesota law professor , Saturday Review : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the author of one of the longest works of fiction of the year . . . " Cf Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , Saturday Review : " Whittaker Chambers has written one of the really significant American autobiographies . The book is written with intensity-with an unAmerican , I was about to say , or at least un-Anglo-Saxon intensity . . . Chambers is a figure out of Dostoevsky , not out of William Dean Howells . . . When Mr. Chambers demands belief in God as the first credential , he is surely skating near the edge of an arrogance of his own . . . " <P> Brendan Gill , The New Yorker : " The tone of Witness jars . . . Chambers believes now , as he did the first time , that there is only one way to save mankind . . . He believes now , as he did then , that opposites are the only alternatives . Everything is either/or . " <P> Irving Howe , the Nation : " If Chambers is right in believing the major bulwark against Stalin to be faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction and courage to take to the hills . " <P> Merle Miller , the New Republic : " Surely a great many of Mr. Chambers ' readers will reject his terrifying , his demeaning thesis . "
