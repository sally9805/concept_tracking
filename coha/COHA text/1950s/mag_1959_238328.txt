If we do not get a proper perspective on the development of science in countries such as China , we shall not be able to act rationally , and will surely suffer a rude awakening in the not too distant future . " Bell Labs ' Walter H. Brattain ( 1956 prize-co-inventor of the transistor ) said that before World War II the U.S. was " a nation that offered asylum to independent and nonconformist thinking individuals , " but after the war the Government went on classifying " anything that might possibly aid an enemy " -a program that discouraged " top scientific men who might otherwise have come to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly that most restrictions done in the name of national security turn out to be foolish . . .
