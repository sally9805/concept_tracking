As far as her eyes could see in the clear winter air , the Alps of the Bernese Oberland stood in their snow-capped ranks , 12,000-foot peaks of glacial ice and stone . <P> Three thousand feet below , terrace on terrace , lay the storybook village of Grindelwald , famed as a skier 's paradise . The girl whose level , blue-grey eyes surveyed this prospect may or may not have been awed by the majesty of the view . What she said was reverent , appreciative , American : " Scenic as hell ! " Last week her interest in the Grindel-wald view was more technical than esthetic . She was looking at a slalom course : a series of precipitous pitches and inclines , outlined by guide poles , designed to test the racing mettle of the world 's best skiers . <P> For the qualified citizens of the world of international ski racing must have two prerequisites : skill - and courage . It takes courage to use skill , or to use it to that utmost which wins races . A watch-tick moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a downhill racer flying off the beaten track at a fatal 60 m.p.h. clip. * <P> Poised near the starting gate , awaiting her turn , the girl showed only one touch of tension : her classically lean features were set firmly as she clenched her jaw . <P> As the starter tapped her on the back , she was off , pushing furiously with her ski poles to gain the speed she would have to check , moments later , with a swivel-hip turn . She swept down the dizzying de scent with the verve and hell-for-leather dash of a man . Crouching , straightening , swinging her slim hips in an almost antic mimicry of a rumba step , she darted and danced through the multicolored flags that outlined the course . <P> The people who watched her snow-clouded rush down the mountainside were all , in a sense , mountaineers . In their world , from the Alps to the hills of Scandinavia , skiing is about the only sport worth mentioning ; it is almost a way of life . And last week , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting close to the climax of the skier 's year . The baggage carrier at St. Anton , the bartender at Klosters , the woodcutter at Sestriere , the gendarme at Chamonix , the hotelkeeper at Oslo were all reading the ski news : the results of the Swiss National championships . And this dark-haired , blue-grey-eyed American girl was very much in the news . Every skier in Europe knew her name : Andrea Mead Lawrence . <P> Andy Mead ( the nick-and maiden names she is best known by ) is the best U.S. Olympic skier . Last winter she won almost every major ski race in Europe-including the Arlberg-Kandahar downhill race , the unofficial world championship . At 19 , she is a veteran of the 1948 Olympics and captain of this year 's U.S. women 's Olympic ski team . <P> " She Waits for Me . " At Grindelwald last week , Andy was not quite the best ; but she was n't trying very hard , yet . While Austria 's Trude Beiser Jochum , 1950 downhill champion , might grind through 50 practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quits . A tall girl ( 5 ft. 7 in. , 130 Ibs. ) , but willowy and slim , Andy does n't take training grimly : she drinks a beer with her meals , and is usually ready to join a friend in a cup of Glwein ( mulled red wine with cinnamon , cloves and sugar ) . She smokes a cigarette when she feels like it .
