 | Stalking Central Africa 's Wildlife @# AFRICA must have looked like this 25,000 years ago , " Walter Weber said in an awe-struck whisper . The National Geographic staff artist and I stood on the shore of Lake Iro , 90 miles northeast of Fort Archambault in French Equatorial Africa , feasting our eyes upon the kind of scene that seldom rewards the student of nature in these days of encroaching civilization . On the far rim of the lake a grass fire smoldered , turning the setting sun into a fiery ball behind a curtain of smoke . Hippopotamuses bellowed and splashed near by , and a flock of West African crowned cranes winged toward their roost ( page 268 ) . Ibises Revered as Earthly Gods Sacred ibises , thought by the ancient Egyptians to be incarnations of the god Thoth , appeared unbelievably homely with their long , curved beaks and naked black heads . But what a transformation as they rose in flight ! White wings , delicately edged with black , became translucent , and the flesh of the underside added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we headed back toward camp , a stuttering scream rose from a tree at the forest 's edge . Throughout Africa , wherever there is a supply of fish , one is certain to hear the voice of the white-headed fishing eagle . To me his call means Africa as much as the roar of a lion or the cry of a spotted hyena . In camp it was always fascinating to watch my artist friend at his painting . Working feverishly to record the fleeting orange hue on the wing of a big-eared bat or the bright wattles of a guinea fowl , Walt would record every nuance of color and form with fast , sure strokes . I doubt whether many artists ever worked under more trying circumstances . Even in the shade of a tent fly the thermometer rose repeatedly to 11.3 ? F. , and perspiration often fell onto the sketches from Walt 's face . There was no lack of subjects . On our first morning in camp a group of marabou storks had walked up and gravely inspected us . These grotesque birds , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " up squad " ( page 269 ) . Strangely enough the marabou is a true stork that has for the ways of its relatives and become a ca eater . Fine Feathers Grace an Ugly Bird With its clumsy walk and dangling pouch , the marabou would make an im sive contender for the title of " earth 's u bird . " Yet it carries beneath its tail a ful of feathers so soft and beautiful that species was seriously reduced a few deca ago to satisfy the whims of fashion . A trout fly still goes by the name Marat but the genuine feathers have long since appeared from millinery shops . I wonder milady would have been so keen about feather boa had she seen the ungainly car eater from which it was plucked . T game authorities recognize the value of the attractive creatures and protect them rigidh Photographing marabous , we learned later , was a simple matter . A chunk of meat is front of a hastily constructed blind promptly brought the birds within range . With the marabous , as if from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These hawklike birds cautiously stay out of range of the storks ' bills when they dart in to steal a morsel of carrion , then dash away to eat it on the wing . @#  | On previous trips to Africa I have often amused myself by tossing bits of meat into the air for the fun of watching these bold erialists snatch them before they reach the ound . Fortunately , central African kites splay less aggressiveness than some of the continent 's other forms . Once in Ethiopia I collected a rare genet , ne of the small spotted carnivores of Africa , and was seated in front of my tent cleaning the skull . Suddenly I felt a wing touch my cheek and a claw nick my thumb . Before I realized what had happened , a kite winged away across a lake with my genet skull in its talons . The bird soon realized that little or no meat remained on its prize and let it drop into the lake too far away to retrieve . And so , because of the audacity of a hungry bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Museum of Natural History has the words " Skin only ; no skull " on its label . Natives Flee from King of Beasts As expedition mammalogist , I had a special interest in lions . We were not on Tanganyika 's game-rich Serengeti Plain , where lions recognize the sound of an automobile and seem to pose willingly in return for an easy dinner . Nor was this South Africa 's famed Kruger National Park , where the tawny animals sun themselves lazily on roads . In French Equatorial Africa the king of beasts still has an alarming reputation for ferocity. * Only two years before we came , an ex- perienced hunter lost his life while guarding a cameraman as he attempted to photograph a lion . In a number of places we saw deserted villages whose inhabitants had fled to escape the beasts ' depredations . To our knowledge , the lions of Chad and Ubangi-Shari had never been successfully photographed . Certainly we knew of no one who had managed to record their full-throated roars on tape . Midget Challenger Outroars Lion One evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lion roared not far from our camp on the Aouk River . Wentzel and I placed the recorder outside the tent and aimed a microphone toward the beast . The sound started again , this time even nearer : two prolonged roars vibrated through the night . Wentzel snapped a switch and the reels of the recorder spun to life . We looked at each other happily . But we were counting our lions before they were recorded . From a near-by clump of grass in front of the microphone came the complacent chirp of a cricket . The insect 's cheery good humor remained undampened even when sticks , and finally shoes , were thrown toward the sound . When we finally quieted the unwelcome minstrel , our roaring lion too had subsided for the night . We played the tape back hopefully , but Leo 's mighty voice came through as a barely audible murmur above the deafening song of the little cricket ! We consoled each other . Maybe we would have better luck with photographs . During an afternoon 's drive Weber and I had collected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the animal was skinned for preparation as a scientific specimen . We set the carcass aside as food for our native carriers ; it lay beside the truck in the very center of camp . First thing in the morning , we assumed , the boys would cut it up . At dawn we awoke to an excited clamor . A lion had boldly entered camp during the night and taken our hartebeest . The big cat 's trail led across a road and into thick thornbush about 500 yards away , where we found the chewed remains of our specimen . Lions often return to a kill . Here , we thought , was the opportunity we had been waiting for . A driver backed our truck into an  | @# opening within camera range of the half-eaten animal . In it we set up a battery of motionpicture and still cameras . Wentzel carefully placed lights at strategic points in the trees and arranged the controls so they could be operated at the camera . As a final touch , everything was camouflaged with branches . Uninvited Guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned , our lion was sure to come back for another meal . The presence of the truck should not disturb him , for he had walked shamelessly up to it the night before when he had entered camp to steal our hartebeest . And the scent of man apparently did not worry him either , for he had come close to us as we slept . Here , we felt , was a lion that would cooperate . By noon the truck with its cargo of cameras was in readiness . Then , late in the afternoon , we checked again to be sure everything was in order . An appalling sight greeted us . The outdoor studio was a shambles . Not a cam was left in the truck . Lights and wires been pulled from the trees , and pieces equipment were strewn about the ground . Not a cricket this time , but baboons . foiled our carefully laid plans . A troop the mischievous animals had spent a riotous afternoon tearing our " camouflaged " equipment apart . Two cameras and two tripods were out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By suppertime we were ready again for our camp-raiding friend . Space in the truck was limited . Mrs. Weeks and Wentzel , we all agreed , should wait for the lion . Walt and I would take the jeep and go after lesser game . We had barely left camp when the lights of our car picked up a huge tawny form in the road ahead of us . " Well , " Walt said , " it looks as if our friend is coming for an early supper tonight . "  | We stopped and watched as the animal approached in the beam of the headlights . It was the largest lion I had ever seen . As the great beast drew nearer , Walt and clutched the shotguns at our sides . It was - mall comfort to remember that we had loaded hem with bird shot in anticipation of much - maller game . The lion came within less than 50 feet of the open jeep . Then he turned and padded noiselessly toward where Wentzel and Mrs. Weeks waited with the cameras. , But once again we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hartebeest carcass , he did not return to his meal . allowing the tracks next morning , we could see where he had made a careful survey and decided things were t to his liking . During our stay in Africa we ade many interesting stops , but . e among them all stands out - idly in my mind . We had  - -  en traveling all day through ... 1st and torrid heat . Tired and thirsty , we topped a last hill and saw before us the new , clean resthouse at Gari , on the Barya River . Built on a high bank hove the water , the camp commanded a superb view of a plain through which meandered the shimmering stream . We had been sleeping under canvas for many nights , and the thought of a real roof over our heads was heartening indeed . With one accord we settled down for several days . Gari surprised us with the richness of its wildlife . Here we acquired many specimens , but most entrancing of all was the view . Seated comfortably on the porch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's bird and animal life on the plain below . Sleek buff-colored kob proved to be the region 's most plentiful antelope . Slightly smaller than a white-tailed deer but a bit more stocky , and with handsome lyreshaped horns , the kob found in the vicinity of Fort Archambault has been described as a distinct subspecies and so was of special interest to me ( page 272 ) . Defassa waterbuck , larger animals with coarse brownish-gray hair , came next in abundance ( page 265 ) . A few reedbuck appeared . These bushytailed antelopes resemble white-tailed deer more closely than kob , but their short horns with forward-pointing tips are distinctive . An occasional buffalo came into sight , and elephant tracks pocked the plain , although the big animals never showed themselves . Birds abounded at Gari . Walt and I spent much time cruising lonely trails or following native footpaths . collecting an occasional  | specimen to help in his painting or to enrich the museum 's collection . But most of the time we observed with glasses . Brilliantly colored bee eaters of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hurled themselves back to the same perch . The carmine bee eater , one of the largest , habitually follows herds of game animals , feeding on insects stirred up by their hoofs ( page 265 ) . Strangely , these vivid birds fearlessly adapt themselves to the presence of visitors . Walt , making his way through high grass one day , counted 36 of them flying about him , attracted by the insects that flew up as he walked . Rollers ( opposite ) appeared conspicuously in a burned-over area near camp , where stark trees , blackened and leafless , stood as reminders of a fire . Occasionally , in the taller trees along the river , plantain eaters hopped , vivid one minute with sun-spangled purple and red , and invisible in deep shadow the next ( page 283 ) . Wildlife Hides from Midday Sun As the thermometer soared , everything took to cover . Antelopes sought the shade of trees or brush patches ; even the birds dozed until the brassy sun sank a few degrees toward the horizon . Exceptions to this rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossoming flamboyant trees when other living things hid from the heat . Darting about in their restless search for nectar and tiny insects , they take the place in Africa of the New World 's hummingbirds ( page 278 ) . Perhaps the most familiar of African birds , the guinea fowl utters a gabbling call that symbolizes the continent for many travelers ( page 270 ) . To Americans the same sound carries nostalgic reminders of farmyards back home , for Africa is the domestic bird 's ancestral home . One of the special requests I had received from the museum was to determine if possible where the range of Numida meleagris major , a guinea fowl with cobalt-blue wattles and small bristles on its nostrils , the common form in French Equatorial Africa , merged with that of Numida meleagris galeata , a bird found in the western Cameroons . The latter wears red on its lower wattles and lacks the hairlike bristles . We determined to solve the problem if possible . All the birds seen were car observed , and a few specimens were col for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fowl near the road took my eye . I had them for only an instant , but felt sure were different . Walt hurriedly climbed the truck and with his usual skill broug down . The bird had red on its wattles lacked the bristles . Later we acquired two more so Walt present them to the U. S. National -M of the Smithsonian Institution , in Washi D. C. Just the day before I had col a blue-wattled bird west of the Logone R ' we had established to our satisfaction that transition occurs between these two poin Zebra Unknown to Native Hunters The vast herds of zebras and gnus so pr nent in east Africa are missing on the covered plains of French Equatorial Af As proof of this , it was interesting to note t the majority of natives we encountered could name all the animals that Veber had pain on our truck cover ? elephant , giraffe , an lope , and the rest ? with the exception of zebra , which was a creature unknown to ( page 274 ) . When we moved deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Def waterbuck and kob became plentiful . R buck appeared in the marshes , and glimpsed handsomely striped bushbuck in wooded areas ( page 271 ) . Roan ante and , on one occasion , giraffes showed th selves . Two or three black rhinoceroses w @#  | reported to inhabit the area , though we never saw them . Of the lesser bucks , the oribi ( page 272 ) and the gray duiker were most in evidence . One of the commonest animals about our camps , although we rarely glimpsed it , was the galago . This distant cousin of the monkey , with large ears , enormous eyes , and soft gray fur , roughly matches our red squirrel in size . One of the lemurs , the galago spends its life in trees , seldom if ever coming to the ground . Its piercing birdlike calls are frequently included in the weird symphony of the African night . Fiery Disks Betray Galago On evening walks Walt and I usually carried a powerful light , which we played ahead of us in the trees and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two big fiery disks would reflect the light back to us . It seemed impossible that these could belong to so tiny an animal . But there was no doubt about it . The reflections would disappear , only to reappear instantly 15 or 20 feet away ; no other animal with such eyes , we knew , would be so active . This was not my first meeting with this little animal . One day while I was camped in Northern Rhodesia a native boy brought me a gourd with a hole in its top , plugged @# by a wad of dried grass . Inside , he told me , were four live galagos taken from a nest in a hollow tree . I tried to transfer the animals to a box , but one slipped past my hand and with an agile leap landed on my table . With only a moment 's hesitation the animal sprang to one of the poles supporting the tent , a distance of about six feet , and from there made another jump of at least eight feet to a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small boy up the tree to retrieve the animal . When the galago was in my hands again , I noticed that its hind legs had been securely tied together at the ankles with a piece of dried grass . Hampered as it was , the galago had made those jumps easily and gracefully , landing each time exactly where it had planned . Much later , in the rain forest of the Cameroons , we were introduced to another of the African lemurs . A Frenchman came to speak to us as we sat on the hotel porch after supper . On a stick he carried a strange-looking pet . I recognized it as one of the rarer forms of potto , a short-tailed sluggish animal with brown fur . Everything about it stood out in direct contrast to the galago . Its slow movements , small ears , and dull eyes made it difficult to believe that the two animals were related . Almost daily baboons foraged about our camps . These large monkeys live on the ground but occasionally climb trees in search of food . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foot . Baboons go about in sizable troops , turning over rocks and tearing rotting logs apart in search of insects , scorpions , and other delicacies . When the animals are suddenly disturbed , they express their displeasure by barking and scurrying about . The males grimace at the intruder , and mothers look frantically for their babies . Very young offspring cling to mother 's undersides , while older ones jump on her back or shoulders and ride to safety ( page 280 ) . Mother Baboon to the Rescue One day as Wentzel and Weber drove along a trail , they inadvertently separated a troop of baboons . One group scampered to safety . but the others , with the jeep between them and their mates , found their escape cut off . At what sounded like a barked command from the old male in charge of the troop , the strag- glers began a frantic end run to swing ahead of the jeep and rejoin the pack . Suddenly a female paused as if she had lost something . Changing direction , she rushed back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its arms around the mother 's shoulders and clung for dear life as she galloped around the jeep and rejoined the troop . Sleep Foils Baby Baboon 's Plans Adult baboons are among the most savage of African mammals , and attempts to keep them as pets have rarely been successful . But for a time the expedition numbered among its members an infant , with the huge ears and the appealing old man 's face of so many baby simians . " Dopey " would have been a first-rate camp nuisance if he could have stayed awake . A dozen times a day he would raid Wentzel 's camera case , get into the kitchen supplies , or try to make off with some of Walt 's paints . But invariably fatigue would get the better of him , and he would nod and fall asleep before any damage was done . Africa boasts a rich monkey fauna . Most of the forms live in or near forests and seldom if ever go far from a tree. * One species , however , provides the inevitable exception . Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the millenniums , and , unlike its tree-loving relatives , spends most of the time hunting food on the ground . Like the baboons , red monkeys often venture far out onto the plains , where they must rely on agility and fleetness of foot to save themselves from predators . Occasionally , however , if the opportunity presents itself , they will take to the trees to foil a hungry leopard or other enemy ( page 267 ) . At Madecongo , one of our first camps after leaving Fort Archambault , Mrs. Weeks adopted a baby red monkey . The little fellow stayed with us throughout the trip and eventually went home with her to the United States . Monkey Faces Peer from Trees Most of the monkeys of Africa belong to a group called the guenons . These mediumsized , long-tailed animals generally live in forests and seldom if ever go far from the protection of trees . This group includes some of the most beautifully colored of all primates . The most common guenons are green monkeys , widely distributed throughout Africa ( page 266 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the west African true green monkey are all members of this group . Intensely curious , green monkeys will scatter and disappear if disturbed . But in ar where they have not been shot at , one only to sit quietly beneath the tree . Soon or later a face will peer down from a maw of foliage , and then another and another . The little animals , relying on their amazing ability to disappear like acrobats into the treetops , can not resist coming back for a second look at anyone who disturbs them . As one tours through Africa , these are the monkeys that most often troop across roa in front of cars . Often they become qui tame and confiding and will even beg f from passers-by . Despite the fact that these monkeys , w fully grown , become difficult to manage , AV acquired a young female green monkey brought it home to his farm in Virginia .

She threw things and bit a delivery man . In self-defense Walt presented her to the National Zoological Park . Hopefully . assistant zoo director Ernest P. Walker assigned Bouba a place in a big group cage , where 26 other monkeys played happily together . Little Bouba promptly picked fights with every inmate of the big enclosure . Bouba ended , lonely and defiant , in the solitary confinement of a private cage . But she still recognizes the man who brought her from central Africa to Washington , D. C. Now , when Walt visits the monkey house and stands before her , Bouba peers quizzically at him , as if not quite sure who has come to see her . Then Walt whispers her name softly , and the little monkey springs to the bars and gently extends an arm . " This is what it was like at home , " she seems to be saying , as Walt fondles her hand . " This is the way it was when we were in Africa together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
