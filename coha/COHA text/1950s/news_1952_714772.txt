txt Attacked as a " ripper bill , " designed to get rid of Rear Admiral William S. Maxwell , retired , deputy director of the Bureau of Smoke Control , a measure setting ' up a new independent city Department of Air Pollution Control was passed by the City Council yesterday by a vote of 20 to 2 . Minority Leader Stanley M. Isaacs , Manhattan RepublicanLiberal , who cast one of the negative votes , charged that Mayor Impellitteri " does not have the courage to lire Maxwell , because he knows the admiral is doing an excellent enforcement job and has the confidence of the people of the city . " Under the proposed Air Pollution Control setup , Mr. Isaacs argued , the Mayor could follow " the easier course " of simply failing to appoint Admiral Maxwell to one of the top positions in the new department . ' Starve-out ' Tactics Charged The Minority Leader declared that the Mayor , in his antagonism to Admiral Maxwell and to William G. Christy , director of the smoke bureau , was trying to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to wage an effective war on smoke . Mr , Isaacs noted that the smoke bureau 's budget for 1952-53 is $200.119 , .. cornpared with . $203,764 for 1651-52 , In 1950-51 , the first foil year in which the bureau was headed by Mr. Christy and Admiral Maxwell , its budget was $158,568 . The reduction in 1952-53 , Mr. Isaacs said , contrasted with increases for most city departments . Predicting that the annual budget of a Department of Air Pollution Control would be about $2,500,000 , Mr. Isaacs charged that a second major purpose of the new bill would be to set up a huge patronage reservoir . Earl Brown , Manhattan Democrat-Liberal , cast the only other vote against the measure . The bill must now be passed by the Board of Estimate , where it is likely to be brought up at the July 17 meeting , and be signed by Mayor Impellitteri . The present Bureau of Smoke Control , operational arm of the Board of Smoke Control , is un1der the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Buildings . The proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , would be headed by a Commissioner of Air Pollution Control who would be trained . in public health , sanitation or industrial hygiene , or would be a mechanical , professional or stationary engineer . The three last-named qualifications were added to the original bill as an amendment so that the terms of the measure would not bar Mr. Christy or Admiral Maxwell " from appointment by the Mayor to any top posts in the new department . Both officials are professional engineers . The Air Pollution Control Commissioner would be empowered to appoint a deputy with the same qualifications . There would be a five-man board of Air Pollution Control consisting of the commissioner as chairman , the Commissioner of Housing and Buildings and the Commissioner of Health , all three ex-officio , and two members appointed by the Mayor , having the same professional qualifications as the commissioner and deputy . Majority Leader Joseph T. Sharkey , Brooklyn Democrat and , sponsor of the bill , hotly denied Mr. Isaacs ' charge that the measure was intended to create a vast patronage reservoir . Scoffing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximate $2,500,000 , Mr. Sharkey said that , except for the five newly created administrative positions at the top , the agency 's entire payroll would be Civil Service . Sharkey Defends Bill " Either we are going to get smoke control or we are not going to get it , " he declared . " We are out of the experimental stage of smoke abatement now and it is time to launch a full-fledged attack on the smoke nuisance . The Commissioner of Housing and Buildings Bernard J. Gillroy no longer wants the smoke bureau ; our most effective action would be through a new department . " We are not , through this bill , firing Christy and Maxwell . The Mayor can fire them both today , under the present set-up , if he wants to . We need action , and this bill offers the way to get it . " In his attack on the Air Pollution Control bill , Mr. Isaacs said it had been the intention of the framers of the new City Charter adopted in 1937 to hold down the number of city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended that the present Smoke Control Bureau could do a good job if it got an adequate staff and sufficient funds . Commending Admiral Maxwell for being " a very able person " and for doing good work , Mr. Isaacs asserted that the admiral had been " too good , evidently , " because he " went after the Consolidated Edison Company , and that is enough to damn any official as far as this city administration is concerned . " " This bill is unworthy of the administration , " Mr. Isaacs declared . " It is grossly unfair to jockey Christy and Maxwell out of office by this legislation . "
