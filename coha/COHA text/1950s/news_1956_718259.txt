txt Mr. Hamilton , who is usually ex tremely well informed , ? is , however in error in asserting that Iran was subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the court in its dispute with the United Kingdom arising from the nationalization of the AngloIranian Oil Company , and that the court 's decision in that case " confirmed the rule that a Government has a right to nationalize a company on its territory . " In its judgment rendered on July 22 , 1952 , the International Court declined to accept jurisdiction . It adopted the argument of the Iranian Government that its acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the court was . limited to disputes arising under treaties or conventions accepted by Iran subsequent to its ratification of its declaration of acceptance ( Sept. 19 , 1932 ) . Since the court found that no treaty had been concluded with the United Kingdom after that date , and that the concession of 1933 was not an international treaty , the court held that it lacked jurisdiction . Consequently , the court was unable to make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made any ruling on the right of Iran to nationalize the property . Actions Brought This question did , however , arise in the courts of three nations in connection with actions brought by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to recover oil extracted from the company 's concessions in Iran and sold by the Iranian Government to foreign purchasers . In the two cases which arose outside of British territory  --  namely , in Italy and in Japan , the courts took the view that the Iranian Government had the right to carry out the nationalization and that the provision in the nationalization law for compensation in principle and the establishment of a procedure for the determination of the amount to be paid sufficiently satisfied any legal obligations imposed upon Iran . However , in the ' case which arose in the British Colony of Aden , the court found in favor of the AngloIranian Oil Company on the ground , among others , that the court need not give effect to a transfer of property where , despite the fact that it was carried out in conformity with the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in depriving ? aliens of their property without adequate compensation . In deterrAining which of these two lines of decisions is in conformity with generally recognized principles of law , it may be noted that one of the leading authorities in the world on this question , Dr. Seidl-Hohenveldern , has criticized the decision of the Aden court . He has referred to the Italian decision as following the traditional line expressed in numerous decisions of United States courts requiring that effect be given to acts of nationalization performed within the territory of the nationalizing Government . ROBERT DELSON . New York , Sept. 10 , 1956 . Mr. Hamilton Replies TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Mr. Delson is making a distinction without a difference . It is true that the International Court of Justice accepted the Iranian argue ment that the court 's compulsory jurisdiction over Iran was limited to disputes arising under treaties or conventions accepted by Iran subsequent to its declaration of acceptance . However , Iran had accepted compulsory jurisdiction , subject to this reservation , and both the legal decision issue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion required Iran to appear in court . If the court had overruled Iran 's contention and decided that it had jurisdiction over the oil case despite Iran 's plea , Iran would have had no other course than to argue the case on its merits . There is no declaration by Egypt to compel its appearance in the canal issue . Other experts on international ' law with whom I ? have consulted tell me that my statement , although of course hot in legal language , was a correct interpretation . They hold the same view applies to Mr " Delson 's further criticism of my statement that the court 's decision confirmed the rule that a government has the right to nationalize . a company on its territory . I had the text of the decision before me : when I wrote , and of course I I knew that ? the court did not make any specific ruling on this issue . However , the British brief against IIran was based on other arguments ' ' than the treaty confirming the concession . The court disregarded these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Iran 's acceptance ' of compulsory jurisdiction the court did not have jurisI diction . I In other words , since no treaty could be invoked , the British claim lagainst Iran 's nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian properties was thrown 1 out of court . Thereby , as I said , the well-established rule of international law , upholding the right of a government to nationalize a Parties ' Similarities Small Choice Between Republican and Democratic Platforms Seen To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : ' - If the Republicans are defeated in November the reason will not be on , the issue of President Eisenhower 's . health . It is recognized that there are millions of Republicans who are conservatives and anti-New Dealers and who have been disfranchised . All one has to do is to examine the platforms of both parties and the record of the present Republican Administration . There is very little to choose from between parties and platforms . Both are New Deal or Fair Deal except for degree . Both parties promise to continue the farm subsidy program that has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpluses or when the surpluses become too great will get rid of them by giving them away to - other countries . Both parties continue to support the foreign-aid . program which is not buying friends but making enemies and does little or no good . Our ' foreign-aid programs have not only : brought on inflation in most coun- ' - tries but helps along the inflation , at home . Both parties have promised more . ? and more public housing  --  subsidized , of course  --  which means that all of us are being taxed for the few who l. benefit . Both parties are still pandering to ' the big labor bosses and promising to give them bigger and better monopolies over the rank and file of labor . In New York State we have been - given the choice of voting for either Jacob Javits or Robert Wagner , , both New Dealers by any standards . Nothing has been said in either ' platform about efforts to stop inflation of the dollar . Nothing has been said in either platform about going , back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of conservative voters who came out in force to vote for Mr. Eisenhower in 1952 ? High and dry and disillusioned as never before . It has been said that the defeat of Mr. Dewey in 1948 was caused by the refusal of conservative voters to vote for him as expected , for he too promised a New Deal ? only he would do it better . If there is a Republican defeat in November , it may very well be that millions of , , conservative voters will have gone , fishing or , weather permitting , to the golf course . The writer of this letter has never failed to vote since 1916 , when he cast his first vote for Charles Evans , Hughes and has considered himself a good Republican by conviction . Those were the days when there were issues to be decided and a difference between the parties . Today T , there is just no choice and after seeing how my party has been taken ' over by New and Fair Dealers , I will not vote on Election Day . NORMAN C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Installment Buying Defended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his letter published Sept. 26 on the subject of installment buying Percy Hughes concludes * " people should be encouraged to place money in banks or buy United States Savings Bonds until they have saved enough to buy what they need . " In my opinion , this would result in a severe curtailment in production of consumer goods , with serious consequences to the national economy . Of course , it is the responsibility of the retailer not to extend credit when , in his opilial , the customer will have difficulty in meeting the terms . However , the public should realize that the merchant selling on the installment plan renders a very definite service . He affords the public an opportunity to purchase goods which , according to Mr. Hughes ' plan , they might have to wait months or years to acquire . As a result Mr. Hughes ' standard of living as well as that of " Mr. and Mrs. Joe Smith " is considerably higher than it might otherwise be .

Qne false step and we can be in another ghastly war . If this occurs , there will be one question for all of us ? who is going to sur ? I vive ? W. DENNING STEWART .

For Quieter Garbage Collection To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES Congratulations to the Sanitation Commissioner , Andrew Mulrain , for installing rubber strips on hoppers of waste-collection trucks to deaden noise and contribute to a quieter city .
