... , ? =1M ? ? ? ? The Man on the Trestle A Story by Hughes Rudd Drawings by James Sentz T HE first feeling he could remember after it happened was relief . As he looked at the bloody tangle of flesh and flew the airplane lie was so glad it was over . He trembled with this unexpected relief , twisting his head to look on all sides for the fighters , not really believing they would come rushing again , monstrous in split seconds behind the oily plexiglass . They would n't do that because it had happened and now it would n't have to happen to him again . He had not been an optimist like the others and so he was entitled to have this happen only once . He was very glad because it was n't as painful as he had expected ; it felt as though the back of his hand had been struck with a hammer and after the first shock of the blow the pain became duller . He held the Cub in a shallow dive until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him and then leveled out , tugging carefully at the black rubber grip on the stick with his middle finger ; he glanced at the thumb and forefinger ; they were swollen and throbbing with numbness . The stick came back firmly , alive , and he flew over the road at seventy miles per hour , eager for the barley field and almost laughing because in fifteen minutes he would be there and it would all be over . Just like that , all the details , the problems , the planning ; the weary effort to keep clean and the search for something to drink each night , all wiped away like a badly written sentence on a blackboard . In its place would be clean lettering , order ; they might even fly me home , he thought , and he pushed the throttle forv% and with his left hand . Down the valley he sailed , detached from the muddy , inefficient earth with its protracted , never completed toil , aloft in his small universe of linen and duralumin skeleton . Blood dropped slowly from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs of his brown gabardine flying suit , but he felt only the numb throbbing and was so happy he spoke aloud . " Jesus ! " he said . He looked around at the mountains and smiled , saying good-by to the valley he knew so well , the splintered villages and the dark green guns and trucks . They 'll be here forever , he thought , it will never change . But I wo n't be here , it 's not my business any more , and he looked at his right hand dangling above the control stick with the thumb and forefinger held delicately apart , the other fingers resting on the tip of the rubber grip . On the inside of the hand , at the base of the thumb , a ball of stark white material stuck out like a wad of medical cotton ; fat from the cushion at the base of his thumb . It nauseated him to look at it and he wanted to push it back into the flesh , to keep it from the oily cockpit air . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . Dirty ; in the fine cracks of the skin he saw grease and dirt , and the rims of the nails were black . He lifted it to his nose and sniffed : it smelled of gasoline and hot sweat . He put the forefinger in his mouth then rubbed it on the warm gabardine of his chest , cleaning it . Carefully , his left arm swaying with the easy lift and fall of the airplane , he pushed the cleaned finger against the ball of white gristle which sprouted from the base of the right thumb . Agony crackled along his nerves at once , like a charge of electricity , and he jerked the forefinger away , bending over the control stick with pain . His eyes went glassy and he looked through the propeller blur into glittering , unfocused sunlight , dizzy and unable to find the mountains . " Oh , " he said . He swung his head , blinking , feeling that he was sliding , that one wing-tip was going down into a slip and that the airplane 's nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes cleared and the vertigo passed ; the mountains appeared again , blue in the haze of altitude . He pushed at the throttle knob , but it was already all the way forward . He wanted to move , to stand bent forward , cradling his torn right hand in his left , to stand first on one foot and then the other , squeezing his muscles against the pain . But the aileron cable rubbed the crown of his cloth flying cap and his knees were jammed against the twelve-gallon gas tank ; his feet were pressed against the rudder cables and pedals , and divided by the fire extinguisher . He could move each foot about an inch . Move , movel his nerves urged him , his calves jerked , but he was fitted into the small airplane Iike a hand in a tight suede glove , trussed by parachute straps and safety belt , walled in by painted linen and smearedplexiglass . He could not move , and for the first time he was outraged by the smallness of his working space . Before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why the hell , " he said . He was furious with someone , the Army , the taxpayers , the designer , the women in slacks and sweaters who had cheerfully glued and wired this box together while they chewed gum and told dirty jokes . The bastards , he thought , and was certain that no one thought of him at all . Frowning , with his mouth open , he looked down at the trucks , tanks , and jeeps hurrying on a thousand errands . He wanted to land at once , but there was no place to land ; there was no place flat enough in the valley , or large enough , or uncluttered enough in all of Italy . God , what a stupid , silly , insolent country , and nobody in it cares about me . S URELY I wo n't make it , he decided . This is too much , you could n't expect me to get through this . They probably hit something , the elevators or the rudder or the ailerons ; the tubing is probably torn like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick delicately , feeling for danger but not finding any ; of course , you would n't know about it until it actually snapped . He looked at the jagged hole in the plexiglass and was weak with fear ; a small hole was torn in the cabane strut near the window , its edges glinting where the paint was gone . It will collapse , the wings will come off , and I 'm too low to jump . And if I try to climb . . . I have n't time to " It 's okay , " said the driver . " They got batteries , lieutenant . " climb and anyway , God , anyway , God damn it , when was the parachute packed ? A month , three months ago , some time in the winter ? Ah , now , he thought , now you 're in it , all those things are catching up , the things you could have done but did n't . He saw a dreadful mental picture of a soggy parachute , creased tightly , refusing to fill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to see strong , dry silk , to feel it slipping through your hands , as dry as hot sand , powerful , perfectly made into a carefully stitched parachute ! Instead he sat on a lump of useless fabric . It was probably mildewed . They expected me to worry about everything , he thought , hating the men at the barley field . They thought I could look after every damned thing , that 's the way they are , that 's all . Selfish , selfish , they could n't even bother to get the chutes repacked . Nobody ever cares a damn about anybody else , that 's just the way it is . They wanted me to fly and spot targets and direct the guns and worry about trying to keep clean , about washing my socks sometimes , and write letters and look out for fighters , and for Christ 's sakes they could n't even get the chutes repacked . If I ever get out of this , if everything works out , they can go fry in hell , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shame them with their frivolity . And the pain increased , rising from the hand through the bones of the right arm , nudging brutally through his body . His neck was stiff , as though he had slept in a cold wind ; his muscles ached as with flu , and a new pain began below his left knee . It was odd : it shifted from a burning feeling like a scald , to a freezing , exposed sensation like a knife slash . When it felt hot he wanted to pull the leg of the flying suit away from the skin , but when it felt cold it seemed he could feel the movement of air around the knife cut , a draught which made his skin pucker with goose flesh . He put his left hand on the kneecap , then slid it over the cloth below it . Surprisingly , the gabardine was torn , as though lie had skinned his knee on a gravel road . What on earth , he thought , fingering the torn cloth , but he was careful not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leg before he put his hand there and it was impossible to look : if he moved his head forward and down it struck the instrument panel . What a box , he thought angrily . You ca n't even look at yourself in the God damned thing , it is n't an airplane it 's a bucket , a phone booth . Then his left hand was easing the throttle knob back and the airplane was nosing down as the engine rattle slowed . He was over the barley field , and he was frightened . I 'm hurt , he thought , I 'm probably hurt pretty bad now and what 's going to happen to me ? He cranked the stabilizer back and dragged in toward the field , settling as the Gradually the pilot saw that all were marked with blood . seen it in the movies . He looked at the driver and was satisfied : the corporal 's commonplace face was set in heroic , determined lines , he drove efficiently and with dash . He needs a siren and a bell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You cheap bastard , am I over here for you ? It was a bad thing to think : he felt swindled and bullied . He looked at his hand with tears in his eyes , disgusted because he had not seen the vicious joke in time . T HE aid station was in a tent , and although the sides were rolled up it was hot under the canvas . It was crowded with soldiers who stood in groups or sat on the ground , men in dirty , ragged clothing who filled the tent with a cheerful buzz of talk . The pilot stood inside the entrance , thinking this could not be the aid station , and then in the crowd he saw islands of medical equipment , trunks which were opened into cabinets , and metal tables . An officer with a stethoscope dangling from his neck moved calmly through the crowd . The tent was filled with infantrymen ; the pilot had never seen them like this , only resting in the villages , shaved and waiting . They laughed loudly now , they offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical aid man passed among them . Some of them lay on stretchers , covered with blankets in spite of the heat ; most of these had their eyes closed , although one , lying on his stomach , smoked and laughed like the rest , supporting himself on his elbows . Gradually the pilot saw that all were marked with blood on their skins or clothing ; some were bandaged , but the bandages were so darkened by blood and dirt they were almost lost against the rumpled uniforms . The pilot hesitated , startled by the happy air of the tent , and the soldiers near him looked up and smiled . " An Air Corps guy , " one of them said , and they looked at the pilot 's zippered flying suit . " No , " he said . " Artillery . " He did n't want them to think he was from the far away Air Force ; it would be an unpleasant note in this happy place , and he wanted to share in their ease and confidence . He looked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait for me , " lie said to the driver . " Maybe it is n't so bad , " and then a sergeant took his arm and led him through the crowd , out MAGAZINE of that tent and into another . The space in between was roofed with a sheet of canvas , he noticed ; everything was neatly done here . He hoped the driver would wait for him , however ; perhaps it could be fixed here and they would let him go back to his own tent , which was very sloppy , and he could stay on his cot until everything was all right . The cot was rickety and the canvas was split , but he had slept on that cot in that tent for a long time ; everything he owned was piled around the cot . He could get somebody to sew up the split . The second tent was n't crowded and he felt conspicuous in it . He looked at the doctor and the sergeant and felt he was being melodramatic , standing there with the blood on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and regretted it at once . How ridiculous ! The doctor smiled , and took his right hand in both of his , looking at it . The sergeant pushed his left sleeve above the elbow and stuck his forearm with a needle . " What 's that ? " he said . He looked at the sergeant , than at the doctor . " Will it hurt ? " " It 's all right , " the sergeant said , and he smiled as the doctor had smiled . Obviously neither of them was paying any attention to what he said , and he felt a little better . Then they had him lie on a table while they looked at his leg . He craned his neck : more powder was sprinkled on the leg and then on his hand , and this time they bandaged the hand with gauze . He looked at it when they were finished and decided it was a careless job . It was too loose . Still , he was in expert hands now , they knew about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better ; when they lifted him to a stretcher he laughed . That was n't necessary , he told them , but they smiled and carried him ' into the other tent . The driver bent down and asked how he felt . " Fine , " he said , smiling at the driver . " It is n't so bad , I guess , " but he wished the man would go away . He was eager to join the happy chatter of the infantrymen . The driver was n't wounded , they did n't want him here . " Come back tomorrow and check again , " he told him . " Maybe they 'll be through with me , or you can bring my stuff , it is n't far . " He was about to add , " You have nothing else get free . With his left hand the pilot held the stretcher bar as hard as he could . The ambulance 's silent passengers frightened him ; he was too aware that he had lost all control of matters now , that he no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over " I 'm sorry to be so much trouble . " the countryside looking for wine and eggs . He rode blindly in the ambulance and it seemed a long time since he had commanded himself ; as he thought about it he was amazed at the freedom he had enjoyed such a short time before , while he was still in the airplane . He kept a tight grip on the stretcher bar and stared at the strained canvas overhead . T HE sun was still up when they arrived at the evacuation hospital . It was a group of long tents like those used as cook tents with a circus . As he was carried from the ambulance the pilot recognized the place and was surprised they had not traveled farther . He had often passed the hospital in the jeep , roaming the countryside when he was not flying . It was n't far from the barley field , perhaps only fifteen miles , but he was n't certain whether that was good or bad . Itwas still in his own territory , but surely his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in an ambulance , he thought , if it 's that bad . They carried him into a tent and put the stretcher down at the end of a row of stretchers filled with men . It was like the aid station , but noisier , and bigger , and busier . A girl in green coveralls bent over him and looked at a paper tag which was tied to the zipper pull at the neck of his flying suit . " How are you , boy ? " the girl said , looking at the tag . She had bright red hair and good teeth . " Fine , " he started to say , but she was gone . A Southern girl , he decided . The way she said boy . What the hell is this , anyway ? Do n't they want to know ? Maybe it 's on the tag , and he lifted it with his left hand and squinted down his chest at it . He made out his name , his rank , and the letters , " AF " ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AF , he thought , that Cod damned Air Force . I 'm sick of the God damned Air Force . " Well when I felt it running clown my leg into my shoe I figured it was blood you know , a big vein or something , and it scared hell out of me all right . I remember I figured it must 've been a slug that flattened out on a rock before it hit me and I thought Jesus ! I just lay there on my gut , scared to move . " The voice came from the ground by the pilot 's head . He looked and saw a man lying on his stomach on the next stretcher , an infantry lieutenant with a faded 1st Rangers patch on his sleeve . He was supporting himself on his elbows , and in his hands he held a silver object with hundreds of tiny silver spears jutting from it . The pilot was reminded of a sunburst frame around an old mirror ; the rays in the metal seemed numberless , the object bristled like an angry silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom of the tent . The pilot saw it had been an aluminum water canteen and he listened as the Rangers officer talked to the infantrymen around his stretcher , telling of the explosion of the canteen when the bullet struck it and of the cascade of water which had run down his leg . It all sounded familiar ; had he heard the same story at the aid station and forgotten it , or was this one of the war stories you always heard ? " I got some pieces in the butt , just in the cheeks , I think , " the Ranger said . " Did you ever hear of anything like that ? It do n't hurt at all . Did you ever hear of anything so screwy ? " " The purple heart and the red ass , lieutenant , " said one of the others , and they all laughed . These people were just as happy as those at the aid station , but it was beginning to annoy the pilot . He closed his eyes and thought about the canteen , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jarred on him ; he felt like hell , he decided . The pain was growing steadily and they all kept laughing , calling out to each other , asking questions , greeting new arrivals . HAT the hell , the pilot thought bitterly , they all know each other , it 's like a locker room after a game . Is it going to be like that all of my life ? For God 's sake , is it my fault ? I should never have learned to read , I suppose , or anyway not so much . Too much but not enough , that 's me . I really knew it all along . The whole world is full of football players . I knew that , too . Damn it , anyway ! He tried to be patient . He lay on the stretcher , waiting , the pain making him nervous and irritable . He no longer had to hold himself against it , however ; it burned and ached at a steady level , seeming to get worse because it just stayed there , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hours passed slowly while men were taken out of one end of the tent and others were brought in the way the pilot had come . The men around him discussed their wounds , they repeated again and again the story of what had happened to them on the mountain or in the valley , they greeted new arrivals with jokes and questions . The pilot lost interest in everything that was going on , but the story of an attack was told and retold , and he heard it all , and discovered that most of the men were Rangers . The lieutenant with the splintered canteen gradually dropped out of the conversation ; he began to consider himself with alarm and to sink into his problem , the pilot noticed . The morphine drained away in the earlier arrivals and they became morose and complaining , but the newer men maintained the high , nervous chatter . And then it was the pilot 's turn . They carried him into the X-ray tent , photographed his hand , and then left him on the ground . That was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was n't ready for the operating business . Now he concentrated , getting ready for it , but before he was really ready they were back and this time they took him into another tent and slid the stretcher onto a table , under glaring , complicated lights which made his eyes water . He looked down the tent at the other tables , each occupied by a prone figure and surrounded by a small group of people in white , masked and not to be denied . Someone lifted him by the shoulders and slid a board under his shoulder blades , and when he lay back his arms were extended on the board and strapped down . It was terrible . It was done so swiftly , without a word to him , and now he was helpless . Ah , ca n't they wait a minute ? He looked at the faces above him , trying to look into someone 's eyes , but he saw nothing but the white surgical gowns and masks , the intolerable lights , and the dark brown rubber gloves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times : he was frightened and thirsty , and there were tears in his throat . He kept telling himself these people were here to help him , but it was hard to believe . " Start counting backward from twenty-five , " a woman said , and he felt the swift stab of a needle in the soft flesh of his left ann . He looked at the syringe , wanting it removed ; my God , the size of it . . . . " Twenty-five , " he said , trying to say it confidently , " twenty-four , twenty-three , twenty-two , twenty-one , twenty . . . . " and the table slid upward , tilted , and began spinning , a cold wind blew through his intestines and he wanted to sit up before he vomited . IV I T WAS eight o'clock in the morning when he awakened and he felt perfectly calm . He looked at his watch and was n't too surprised that he had slept so long , because he was aware of everything as soon as he opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or asleep for more than twelve hours . He was lying on his back with his right arm above his head and it tingled , so he moved it and understood at once the strange heaviness of it . A plaster cast covered his hand and forearm . It was a neat , finished job . Well , he thought , that 's the way to get things done . I do n't even have a hangover from the dope . He was lying on a cot , fully dressed except for his shoes and somehow he knew they were under the cot . Everything was fine , his Left leg was stiff and sore but he was certain it was n't serious . Weil , now this was more like it . " Good morning , " said a voice , and the pilot nodded at the occupant of the cot across from his . There were two rows of cots in the tent with a little open space running between them from one end of the tent to the other . The pilot looked across this aisle at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain , a big man with a large head and thick neck . He was sitting up in bed , leaning back against a full barracks bag , with a cigar clenched between his teeth . He worked his thick lips as he spoke but did n't remove the cigar , and this exaggerated his accent , which was either East Texas or Arkansas ; for some reason the pilot decided the captain insisted upon and received certain privileges in this tent ; was it the cigar ? " You really been knockin it off , " the captain said . He flipped the pages of a flimsy , overseas edition of a news magazine in his lap , then threw it , fluttering wildly , down the aisle . " Damn thing 's six weeks old , " he said . " You mean I was snoring ? " the pilot asked , not believing it ; he was certain he did n't snore . " Like a P-38 , " said the captain . He worked his lips around the cigar and frowned in disgust . " When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and he raised his voice to a bellowing tremolo , " When us old bareassed heroes cai n't even get a good segar , " he roared down the aisle , his voice quivering with mock self-pity , but protesting shouts cut him off , and the pilot was reminded of a college dormitory when the outstanding drunk comes home . " All right , men , " the captain said . " Rest . It 's 1943 , citizens , and every man jack will be home for Christmas . Ah personally guarantee it . Just keep those V-mails flyin , that 's all . " " Keep ' em flyin ! " cried someone at the other end of the tent , making the slogan a jeer . " Now , wait a minute , " said the captain . He looked down the tent reprovingly . " Do n't talk dirty like that , we got ta Air Corps fella in here . " " No , " said the pilot . " Artillery . " " Well , by granny 's crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One of them junior daredevils thrashin around in a Maytag . We seen you was all zippered up and we figured you was a peashooter , " and he raised his voice again . " At ease , menl " he rumbled . " It 's Willie the peeper . Youah wives are safe , Ah personally guarantee it . " Several men turned to look at the pilot , smiled at him , and went back to their letter writing or games of solitaire or poker . " If Ah 'd seen you with your hat on Ah'da knowed anyway , " the captain said , and he reached under his cot for another magazine . The wounded , the pilot thought . Is he one of the wounded ? Is n't there more to it than this ? A ward boy brought him his breakfast : a canteen cup of coffee and a metal dish of powdered eggs . It was awkward , eating with his left hand , and he had n't quite finished the eggs when several ward boys and nurses entered the tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . horrible thing 1 ever heard of ; perspiration broke out over his body and he longed with all his mind for the nurse to go away , for her to stop bothering the man on the trestle . You silly bitch , he thought , ca n't you see him ? The moans continued , shuddering , gruesome ; the nurse 's words failed to interrupt them and she finally left the tent . The man on the trestle was beyond her words , he was beyond everyone in the tent , the pilot thought . It was incredible how far away he was , and yet the moans were the most immediate , unbearable sounds the pilot had ever heard . Their rawness was terrible ; the pilot was shocked and frightened by such naked intimacy , he felt that nothing in his entire life had in any way prepared him for this and it seemed outrageous he had never even had a hint about it . " God damn ! " said one of the men in the line of cots , and someone else laughed and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull his lips into a grin : it sickened him , but he too wanted to laugh . " Shut up ! " yelled a voice from the cots , a strained , anonymous voice , and again someone laughed quickly . - Yes , thought the pilot , gritting his teeth , shut up , shut up , Jesus Christ , shut up . But the moans kept on , hideously loud . The red-haired gin and another nurse came into the tent and stood by the trestle , looking at the man 's damp , slack face . " Listen , sugar , " said the redhead , bending forward over the man on the trestle . " Can you hear me ? I want you to stop that , now , or you 'll hemorrhage . You want to make the doctor mad ? " Sugar , thought the pilot , do you want to make the doctor mad ; I 've got to get out of here . " Listen , honey , " said the redhead . " You 've got to stop that . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the man on the trestle kept breathing and moaning . His face was relaxed , his mouth open ; it seemed the great moans came from him with no effort whatever since the cast hid the rise and fall of his chest , and this appearance of relaxation made the sounds much worse to the pilot . " Oh , hell , he 's started , " the redhead said . She and the other nurse ran out of the tent and the pilot , looking at the man on the trestle , saw a red stain the size of a hand on the plaster over his stomach . As he looked at it it grew slowly , like a drop of red ink on a blotter , and when the nurses came back with the doctors it was no longer a stain : it was wet . If only I believed in God , the pilot thought , or if only I understood everything that is n't God ; one or the other . The doctors and nurses huddled around the trestle and worked ; it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent made no attempt to see what was being done . After a time the moans ceased and there was a rustle of relief in the tent , but in a minute or two the man on the trestle began a wet , thick gargling which increased rapidly in tempo with his breathing and then stopped . The pilot knew he was dead , but he did n't believe it ; the trestle was removed and a ward boy brought cups of orange juice to the men in the cots and then stood at the end of the tent to see that they drank it , since it was prescribed by the doctors . W HAT am I like , the pilot wondered , cradling the canteen cup with his left hand and blowing on the orange juice as though it were coffee . I used to read a lot and then I spent a lot of time looking in mirrors when I did n't have anything else THE M A-N ON to do , making faces at myself , did n't I ? I have n't seen a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shave very often and when 1 do I do n't need a mirror any more . " I 'm glad that 's over , " said the captain . He lighted a fresh cigar and glared at the place where the trestle had been ; it seemed to the pilot that the captain was trying to decide what to say ; he waited . " He was the noisiest bugger , " the captain said , and the pilot let out the breath he had been holding . Still , the captain seemed dissatisfied ; he continued to stare in the direction of the vanished trestle , his news magazine neglected in his lap . Of course , thought the pilot , we do n't even know who he was , I did n't even get a good look at his face ; it could hardly be anyone I knew . Why worry about it ? I 've often thought of getting hit , even of dying , you ca n't help thinking about it ; it 's like being afraid you 'll lose your job . Still , like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'm probably crippled for life . The people back at the field are stupid , but this is worse ; what happened to the way I felt at the aid station ? Where did all those people go ? The redhead came into the tent . She stopped at several cots and finally reached the pilot . " You 're going for a ride , boy , " she said , copying his name from the tag on his zipper pull into a hook . " Where ? " asked the pilot ; he was n't quite ready to think of moving . " Africa , " said the redhead , closing the book . " By air , first thing in the morning . Now hit the sack , you 've got a full day tomorrow . " Oh , no , thought the pilot , but Ow redhead was gone . Back to Africa , where the whole thing started ? He was dismayed at the thought of it , it seemed to undo all the months of war since he had left Africa ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else he wanted to go back to his tent and his cot ; he would lie there until he was well , why could n't they let him do that ? The mechanic is stupid , the driver 's a moron , he thought , but at least we 're accustomed to each other . How terrible to be among strangers from now on ; he did n't think he could do it and he saw with maddening clarity what it would be like in Africa , in the backwash of war : the hospital in a colonial barracks like a prison ; the thieving ward boys grown soft and easy ; the awkward , unattractive nurses as regimented as those at home , jumpy with urges that somehow were never fulfilled , so far from the battle they were no longer even moved by pity ; and the doctors , slowly becoming brutalized by boredom , their work done for them in Italy , taking temperatures and feeling pulses , keeping records , inspecting the beds , no longer excited , spending hours at the beach , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty sea . The war , the world gone elsewhere ; there was - othing to do on the hard edge of Africa . I 'll have to come back as quickly as I can , thought the pilot , and he stirred restlessly on his cot , ready to begin the coming back at once , but then he realized there was nothing to come back to , no one to come back to as there had never been , and the impatience left him as suddenly as it had come . He was not impatient and he felt no pity for the man on the trestle nor , inexplicably , for himself . He disdained pity and impatience in an instant , after living with them for an age and it was a strange , wonderful sensation , as pleasant as morphine : in his mind he saw the billowing , cresting cumulus clouds which hung always over the valley in the north , powerful , solid clouds as mighty as mountains but as light as new bandages , the clouds which always fascinated him because he could never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmed and slowed now in his new disdain , it seemed the clouds explained something to him , he hardly knew what : he thought of their loveliness and of the stinging fighters which sometimes came from their blue and white clefts , of the clouds , towering over the valley and the mountains , and he told himself , I 'm ready now , and went to sleep . And outside of the tent , in the Italian night , where no lights shone that year save the stars and moon , the pineboard skeleton of the trestle crouched with its head lifted rigidly into the wind that blew from the valley in the north .
