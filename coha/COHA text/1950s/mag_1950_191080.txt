The millions of U.S. parents who do n't own TV sets were whipsawed last week by full-page ads in 1,100 newspapers and sudsy commercials pouring from 250 radio stations . The American Television Dealers and Manufacturers Association was spending $2,000,000 to feature the sad plight of a winsome , pigtailed little girl blubbering on the shoulder of her pouting , sad-eyed brother . Warned the A.T.D.M. : " There are some things a son or daughter wo n't tell you ... Do you expect him to blurt out the truth-that he 's really ashamed to be with the gang-because he does n't see the television shows they see ? .. . How can a little girl describe the bruise deep inside ? . . . Can you deny television to your family any longer ? " <P> To this heartbreak harangue , Columnist Angelo Patri , child guidance expert , added his voice of authority : " Youngsters today need television for their morale as much as they need fresh air and sunshine for their health . . . " <P> Protests crackled from coast to coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " blackmail parents into buying a product . " The Washington Star editorially conceded that the ad " was in bad taste " and regretted its publication . Cried the Los Angeles Mirror 's Columnist Hal Humphrey : " How neurotic can you get ? " <P> In Nashville , a convention of 90 Methodist church leaders took time out to denounce the campaign as " a new low " in advertising . Asked one embattled parent in the Nashville Banner : " Should I . . . go into debt ... in order that my children can see highlights of football , an ancient fourth-rate movie followed by a full program of wrestling ? " <P> Angelo Patri 's syndicated column was promptly dropped by the Providence , R.I. Journal-Bulletin , even though Patri himself had withdrawn his endorsement and returned the check he had received for it . <P> By the time the first returns were in and counted , several papers had announced that they would run no more ads in the campaign . Editor Frank A. Clarvoe of Scripps-Howard 's San Francisco News said shortly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up ought to have his head examined . " <P> In Manhattan , ad agency Ruthrauff &; Ryan , which is handling the campaign , was only mildly repentant , admitted that the " negative approach " may have been a mistake . Announcing the withdrawal of the second ad in the series ( a freckle-faced , tearful boy described as " the loneliest kid on the block " ) , Ruthrauff &; Ryan decided to accentuate the " positive , happy approach . " The first " happy " ad : a picture of two smallfry embracing their father over the caption : " You 'd give them the world if you could-this Christmas you can . "
