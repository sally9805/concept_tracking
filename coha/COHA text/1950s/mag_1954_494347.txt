The New Giants of TVA by Michael Straight Tgear OF us-think first of the dams when we think of 1.1/1 TVA . And no wonder . In all the Tennessee Valley region there is no structure more beautiful than Fontana , high in the Smokies , none larger than Kentucky , that spreads the Tennessee River to a mile 's width , none more memorable in the life of the nation than Wilson , none more touching than Norris , named for the gentle Nebraskan who looked at Wilson on behalf of a Senate investigating committee , and saw very much more . In the vision of George Norris that was realized , the dams were part of a far larger scheme . Congress , under . Norris ' guidance , created the Tennessee Valley Authority among other purposes " to provide for reforestation and the proper use of marginal lands in the Tennessee Valley " and " to provide for the agricultural and industrial development of said valley . " TVA followed the directive . It transformed valley agriculture through 30,000 demonstration farms . It developed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley , and a hay drier that saved small farms . It raised and planted 300 million seedlings over 20 years . It brought about a new approach in the valley states to recreation , erosion , the conservation of wild life and the prevention of forest fires . It brought malaria , which infected 65 percent of residents in the flatlands of the valley , down to an incidence of one-tenth of one percent . It brought cheap fertilizer to the farms through a higher concentration of phosphates . It established research departments to develop the valley 's resources and sent traveling libraries through communities where , for adults , books were unknown . All these enterprises were created to inspire , not to replace the state governments . As the state administrations established their own resource development prograrns , as the communities built their own libraries , as the towns took over the boat basins on the lakes made by the dams , TVA moved on to new projects ? that is , to the extent permitted by Congress . The unchanging contribution of the agency remained navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Norris ' words " of what men for want of a better name have called electricity . " Minor projects aside , twenty-nine multipurpose dams have been built in 20 years by the TVA . They have added 3.5 million kilowatts of capacity to the nation 's power supplies , and their contribution is substantially completed . Today , apart from a few sites on the Cumberland River , the hydroelectric potential of the Tennessee River and its tributaries is fully realized . Until atomic power takes over , the future of TVA and the region lies in steam . Within sight of Wilson stands an old steam plant . It was built in 1919 and one kilowatt hour of electricity forced from its ancient boilers costs as much as 16 from Wilson Dam . The boilers are still fired , the smoke from its charred stack still blackens the sky . But the plant no longer is typical . At Rogersville , where the Tennessee Valley starts , at Shawnee where it ends , at Kingston , Colbert , Johnsonville , white stacks rise 250 feet high . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TVA engineers that are the largest and most efficient in the world . Already they provide almost one-half of TVA 's total capacity of 6.5 million kilowatts . They provide practically all of TVA 's planned expansion . Around them rages the central controversy of the future of TVA . Twenty years ago visitors to the Tennessee Valley , myself included , gasped at the enormity of Norris Dam as its concrete shoulders were first braced against the steep banks of the Clinch River . Norris boasted 108,000 kilowatts of electric power capacity , twice the capacity of the average steam plant . Today the Shawnee steam plant has a planned capacity of 1,350,000 kilowatts ; Kingston a capacity of 1,440,000 . The management of the private utilities ridiculed plants of this size when they were first projected by TVA engineers . Once again TVA assumed the risks for risk-taking private enterprise and showed the private utilities the way to lower costs and higher profits . The savings in fuel and labor have brought down the costs at the new steam plants to the levels approaching hydroelectric power , The Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ; Johnsonville for less than 3 . Thus a new yardstick is held up to the private utilities which generate power for five mills on the average in steam plants and retail it for three cents . With this new yardstick is introduced a new claim advanced by the utilities , that the construction of publicly owned steam plants in the valley violates the TVA Act . Under the TVA Act the Authority was directed by Congress to plan , construct and operate a system " to regulate the stream flow primarily for the purposes of promoting navigation and controlling floods , " and to produce electric power " so far as may be practicable to assist in liquidating the cost or aid in the maintenance of the projects of the Authority . " I N THE 18 years that followed the nation invested $1,035 million in the Tennessee Valley . Of this total $638 million was assigned directly to power costs and $397 million divided between power , navigation and flood control . The multipurpose nature of the enterprise , that no private corporation could attempt , provided each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control system would have cost the nation $257 million . The same benefits were gained by TV 's multipurpose system for $178 million . A singlb-purpose navigation system would have cost $232 million . TVA provided the same navigation for $155 million . Beyond these capital costs , TVA 's power revenues amounted to $591 million between 1933 and 1952 . Five percent of the gross was paid in state and county taxes , doubling the payments of the utilities TVA replaced . $66 million Was paid back to the Treasury , amounting to a new return of 4.3 percent on the federal government 's power investment . The cries of " unfair competition " from the private utilities wholly ignored the essential fact about TVA : that it was the multipurpose nature of the system that made possible TVA 's unparalleled performance . The steam plants in contrast are built for power alone . Therefore , the opponents of TVA argue , they violate the spirit of the TVA Act which intended the generation of electric power to be a supplementary activity of TVA . At first sight there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For in 1939 , after extensive hearings and debate , Congress conferred upon TVA responsibility for the power supply of the Valley , by amendment to the TVA Act which instructed TVA to produce its power at the lowest possible cost and for the widest possible use . That action by the national legislature required the integration of all generating plants in the region into the TVA system . The TVA area was then defined by the majority vote of the region as each city and rural district chose to buy out the distribution systems of the utilities or else to continue their services . As the sole supplier of power TVA was compelled by legislation and contract to use existing steam plants to firm up the variable flow of hydroelectric power . It was compelled later to build steam plants when the demands of the valley outran its hydroelectric resources . Those demands were enormously accelerated when atomic bomb construction was centered in the valley . The John Sevier , Gallatin , Widow 's Creek and Kingston steam plants were all built in response to the needs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant was built solely to provide power for the AEC installations at Paducah . Last year , of the 30 billion kilowatt hours of electricity generated by TVA , 12 billion were consumed by AEC and another 10 billion by defense industries . TVA was established for the valley , and is now condemned by President Eisen hower for serving the valley at the nation 's expense . Yet 70 percent of TVA 's power supply goes to the federal government , free of the tribute of overcharges and prof its levied by the private utilities . Of all the steam plants built since the war Johnsonville alone was intended to provide for the normal load growth of the valley . But the valley has additional needs of its own that continue to grow . Conservative forecasts show that its power load , exclusive of government and defense installations , will double from 1952 to 1956 . It takes three years to build a steam plant . Accordingly TVA presents to the government each year its estimates of power demands to be anticipated three years ahead . From its earliest days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as absurdly large . But the record shows that TVA has underestimated its needs since the war . By Summer of 1957 , as the result of capacity authorized before Mr. Eisenhower took office , TVA will have just over 10 million kilowatts of capacity or barely enough to meet foreseeable demands . But 1958 is already upon us in terms of providing for known needs . In the hearings of the House Appropriations Subcommittee held in President Eisenhower 's first year in office , the TVA spokesman , R. A. Kampmeier , estimated that TVA power loads were growing at the rate of at least 750,000 kilowatts a year . " The growth would be more rapid , " Kampmeier added , " if there are any large new developments of the sort that the . Atomic Energy Commission 's program has resulted in . " In their program sent first to the Bureau of Budget in the Autumn of 1953 , the TVA ? directors called for one additional unit at John Sevier , one at Kingston , and two at the proposed new Fulton plant in the TVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the clear responsibility of TVA and of the President under the TVA Act . The logical and honorable course for the President , given his well-concealed attitude toward TVA , would ' have been to approve the immediate budget , and at the same time to call upon the directors to bring back in six months ' time a well-prepared plan to free the ? federal treasury of recurring appropriations for . TVA . Instead the President and his Director of the Bureau of the Budget threw out the TVA requests without even considering them . After casting around for any substi. tute they induced Edgar Dixon and Eugene Yates to submit their ill-considered scheme to establish a utility beachhead on TVA territory . Their proposed plant , RI ulu " c plant , 2510 miles from the nearest AEC installation , was presented quite falsely by the President and his advisers as a replacement " for AEC 's power needs . Their proposal was a mockery of private enterprise since the only way in which they could approach TVA costs was to force upon government the risks of operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of little use . The President and his advisers have claimed that the 600,000 kilowatts to be provided by the Dixon-Yates plant will overcome the pending shortage of power in the Tennessee Valley . That is plain nonsense , as the tables cited show . They have claimed further that the Dixon-Yates plan gives them time to consider the long-range future of TVA . But time is running out as the days roll past in which the future dimout of power in the valley can be prevented . So the refusal of the President to acknowledge his , responsibility has created turmoil in the valley . His obvious and almost mean hostility toward TVA casts the future of the region in doubt . HE doubt still hangs over the valley today . It dominates the calculations of businessmen as they wonder whether to locate new factories in a region where power supplies are uncertain . It justifies the boycott of the valley ' by the manufacturers of electrical appliances who have obeyed the instructions of the utilities in their war on TVA . It arouses Memphis whose leaders are considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in the hands of Dixon and Yates . It worries Nashville whose leaders - argue that if Memphis builds a plant , Nashville must follow suit . The doubt harasses the , Governor of Tennessee whose state is falling behind in the South 's race for industrialization . It frightens the officials of the rural co-operatives who are being told by utility spokesmen that they had better learn to " co-operate " now while they can . Above all the doubt haunts the officials of the TVA itself who have given their best years to the agency and wonder now if their life 's work is to be destroyed . TVA remains very much more than public power . But unless it can provide ample power for the valley all its other services must collapse . In this struggle , to fulfil its responsibilities as a power supplier , TVA stands at a disadvantage , for the rising generation takes for granted the cheap power its parents fought to win , While against TVA remains unchanged the group George Norris called " the irreconcilable , embittered and uncompromis ing enemy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolidge and Herbert Hoover vetoed the first TVA bills in 1926 and 1928 insisting that public power could only fail . Now that it has succeeded , their successor in the ; . White House is determined still that it must fail , like a child that wounds itself to prove its parents wrong .
