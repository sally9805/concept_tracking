KOLMAN.STUART CHASS.PHILIP Letters to The Times Ruling ' the British Rights , Personal Prerogatives of Monarch Reviewed The writer of the following letter was formerly Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of London and Master at Rugby School . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I be allowed to comment on some constitutional aspects contained in Benjamin Welles ' article " Britain 's King a Symbol of Unity and Continuity , " published in your issue of Sept , 30 ? Mr , Welles writes : " The King * " opens and dissolves Parliament and ap . points Prime Ministers , Ministers and a host of subordinate officials  --  always , be it noted , ' with the advice of the Prime Minister or other chief spokesman of the dominant political party . " This is not entirely correct . The King has certain " personal prerogatives " which he may exercise on his own responsibility . It is admittedly anything but clear what they exactly are , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Appointment of Prime Minister There is no doubt whatever , however , that the King does not always need to accept advice as to the appointment of a Prime Minister . Where a Prime Minister dies , or tenders a personal resignation , or where  --  on the defeat of a Government  --  the leader of the Opposition is unable or unwilling to form a Government , the King is constitution'I ally entitled to use his own discretion . The second undisputed personal prerogative of the King is that he can create peers so as to override the opposition of the House of Lords . Actually this has only been done once  --  by Queen Anne in 1712 , when she created twelve new peers in order to give the Tory Government a sufficient majority to secure the passage of the Treaty of I Utrecht . But it was threatened again by William IV in 1832 and by George V in 1911 in order to secure the passage of the Reform Bill and the Parliament ? Bill respectively . There is controversy , however , whether the King can dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to dissolve Parliament without advice , and whether he can refuse to dissolve Parliament when advised to do so . Although no British monarch has refused a dissolution for a century , constitutional authorities are agreed that he has still a right to do so . Lord Russell stated in 1866 : " Should the Government be of the opinion that a dissolution is necessary , Your Majesty would be entirely free either to accept that advice or to reject it . " Lord Salisbury used almost identical words in 1886 ; so did Mr. Balfour in 1905 and Mr. Asquith in 1923 . The King can not , however , dissolve Parliament without advice , although Queen Victoria believed , erroneously , that she could . A dissolution involves the acquiescence of Ministers . For it necessitates an Order in Council , and the Lord President of the Council ( who always is a member of the Government ) accepts responsibility for summoning the council ; and it necessitates a Proclamation and writs of summons under the Great Seal , for which the Lord Chancellor ( who also always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dissolving Parliament How the British Constitution is permanently changing and always full of new problems  --  in spite of its respect for precedents aid constitutional " conventions " ? can best be seen from a very recent example . Ever since 1840 it was a well-established British constitutional rule that the decision to dissolve Parliament was not the Prime Minister 's personal prerogative but subject ? to approval by the whole Cabinet . Every Prime Minister since 1840 seems to have followed and adopted the die- ' tum by Lord Asquith and Oxford : " Such a question as the dissolution of Parliament is always submitted to the Cabinet for ultimate decision . " It is known , however , that Mr. Baldwin in 1935 did not discuss with the Cabinet the question of dissolution . It also became increasingly obvious that Mr. Attlee considered the dissolution as his personal decision . When he informed King George VI two weeks ago as to his decision , the Prime Minister made it quite clear that he had done so without previous consultation with the Cabinet . Constitutional pedants might conceivably argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to the majority of British constitutional lawyers  --  such as myself  --  it will merely constitute a further proof of the never-ending flexibility and the permanent progressive change of my country 's time-honored , unwritten Constitution . PETER F. WIENER . New York , Oct. 11 , 1951 . To Grant Women Equality To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Trims : . Tio3 TIMES of Sept. 21 reported an interview with Mrs. Ethel Ernest Murrell of Miami , chairman of the National Woman 's party , who appeared before the resolutions committee of the American Bar Association meeting in New York City , asking support of the Equal Rights Amendment . The chairman of the committee recommended appointment of a special Bar Association committee to study the proposed amendment , in view of its possible sweeping action on numerous laws which are within the authority of the states . This course is well considered . Many of the laws are beneficial to women . They were enacted to help ' women overcome handicaps imposed on them by unfavorable social and economic conditions . Out of long experience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union representative and later as the director of the Women 's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor for more than two decades , I know that there is need for legislation which recognizes their , peculiar problems and aims to alleviate them . Other laws take into account the particular needs of widows , of deserted wives and of wives with young children . It is fitting that the American Bar Association maintain a judicial attitude toward the proposed Equals Rights Amendment and carefully study its effect on existing laws and on the scope of future legislative action . I would point out that the combined opposition to the amendment represents the bulk of our employed population , and , moreover , that portion of it which would suffer most from a literal , abstract equality under law which ignores actual conditions , however inequitable they may be . The association will , of course , provide ample opportunity for the opposition to the amendment to present its case . May I point out a discrepancy in the numerical strength claimed for the amendment by the National Woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their organizations would represent practically half the population of the country . Actually , the total membership of the principal organizations listed as supporters of the amendment by the National Woman 's party in its organ , " Equal Rights Magazine , " July , 1951 , is not quite twelve million , according to data in the 1949 " Guide to Women 's Organizations , " by Ellen Anderson . Moreover , that twelve million represents both foreign and domestic membership . For example , the reported membership of the General Federation of Women 's Clubs includes the United States and twenty-six for eign countries . MARY ANDERSON . Washington , Oct. 5 , 1951 . Price-Fixing Opposed Danger to Free Enterprise Seen ? In Trend Toward Controls The writer of the following letter is Professor of Marketing at the School of Commerce , Accounts and Finance of New York University . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have just read the article " Countrywide ' Fair Trade ' Units Proposed to Revive Pricing Plan " in THE TIMES of Oct. 7 , which describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sponsor fair trade committees throughout the country at the grassroots level to put the voluntary pricing plan back in business . The article also states that a fund of $100,000 has been provided by the drug trade representatives for this purpose . These days , when business is-'beset with increasing governmental regulations and controls , when statism is making our economy less andlesi free , it is disappointing to find some business men demanding more controls in the name of fair trade . These very same men are , no doubt , active in their opposition to the growth of socialism and communism in this country , but evidently they do not realize that their sponsorship of such price controls is active encouragement of such growth . How can any form of additional controls be sponsored by business men if they are interested in maintaining a free business system ? Are they so blinded by the lure of profit security from controlled prices that they willingly put their necks further in the noose of governmental controls ? The claimed benefits of fair trade can not compensate for the ultimate loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people favor anything that is fair . Calling this control of prices fair trade was a master stroke to lull our citizens into unthinking acceptance . The Supreme Court in its wise decision of May 21 has given the business community and the people as a whole another chance to save themselves from these additional controls . The drug trade could very well use their $100,000 fund to educate druggists to be better merchandisers , to be more enterprising and competitive , to give up this false sense of profit security from controlled prices , and by their initiative and competitive spirit check the lose of drug store sales to super markets , department stores and other outlets . that have ? , not fallen for the fallacy of so-called fair trade . JAMES C. DRURY . New York , Oct. 8 , 1951 . Absorbing the Profit Tax To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK Tams : Under date of Sept. 12 , K. T. Keller , chairman of the board of the Chrysler Corporation , addressed a note to the Chrysler stockholders in connection with the disbursement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this letter particularly held my attention , because it clearly stated that 29 cents out of every dollar that a customer pays for an automobile go for accumulated taxes on materials and services that go into making , distribution and delivery . This statement is further dramatized by one simple sentence which says , " If a customer pays $2,000 for a car , about $584 is for taxes . " This paragraph has impressed me so much that I just ca n't put it out of my mind . I wonder why newspapers , business leaders and all others interested in saving this country from the wreck it is headed for do not use this dramatic way of getting over to the Consumer that in the final analysis he naVs the taxes , and that the tax on profits is a myth . G. A. KOLMAN . BronxVille , N. Y. , Oct. 7 , 1951 , . Guilt by Association Nature of Evidence in Loyalty Investigations Examined The writer of the following letter is the author , among other works , of " Democracy Under Pressure " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE New YORK TIMER : The heresy trial of Philip Jessup is replete with allegations that the policy he advocated in respect to China paralleled the policy of the Russian Government , at the same date , or at other dates , and therefore he is a Communist . This brings up the whole question of " guilt by association " which is now constantly in the news . Judging by letters I have seen in the newspapers , the term needs some clarification . Many people seem to think it means guilt by physical association : the idea that a man is known by the company he keeps . In this sense one should indeed be wary . If the man has been frequently seen in the company of secondstory experts , it is a sound idea to lock the windows . A clearer term , though a clumsier one , would be guilt by verbal association . What is being referred to in the loyalty investigations today is guilt by a linguistic or logical trick ; evidence which any judge would throw out of court . Yet millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dema. gogue 's best friend . The trick CIA usually be cast in the form of a syllogism which helps to expose it . Thum Senator Taft sponsored a bill for public housing ; Communists advocate public housing ; Therefore , Senator Taft la a . Communist . This canard was actually used by the real estate lobby in an attempt to defeat the Senator 's bill ! Again : Communists are against Chiang Kai-shek ; The State Department is dubious about Chiang ; Therefore , the State Department is run by Communists . In essence , McCarthy 's whole case rests on this syllogism . The theory behind guilt-by.verbal. association is very simple , The theory ' assumes that because two character . istics are similar , therefore all charm . teristics are interchangeable . Every person , every organization , has many characteristics , often running into the tens of thousands . Furthermore , they change through time . B is bound to have , or to have had in the past , some characteristics similar to those of A. They may both be Baptists , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as proven that B equals A ; that all characteristics are inter . changeable . The Pope believes in child labor laws ; Stalin believes  --  or did believe ? in child labor laws ; Therefore , the Pope is a Comm. nist  --  or Therefore , Stalin is a Catholic . It works either way . On this mon. strous logic it is possible to prove any . one guilty of anything . STUART CHAIN . Georgetown , Corm. , Oct. 8 , 1951 . Good Security Risks To THE EDITOR or THE New YORK Tweet In all this ' acrimonious discussion of subversive activities it seems to we that the real issue is being obscured . This is not whether one-is an avowed Communist or a loyal American . It to whether anyone in or out of the Qoy. ernment is what has been officially defined as a good " security risk . " While our men are fighting communism abroad is he fighting it on the home front ? The plain fact is that the Most *Hee. tive helpers of the Communists are not the avowed party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooges , the confused liberals and all those whoo , whether innocently or maliciously , " repeat the party line . " The Communists must gleefully wel. come those who fiercely denounce " smears , " " witch-hunting " and " red herrings . " They must derisively cheer those who warn against the danger of surrendering our liberties in the fight against communism . It is also a plain fact that the Com munists in this country and elsewhere are vastly stronger and more of a po. tential menace than their numbers in. dicate . Trotsky demonstrated this fact with amazing technique in the original Bolshevist revolution in St. Petersburg . Their influence in undermining organ . izations and institutions and in foment. ing paralyzing strikes in strategic industries is generally recognised as a sinister menace . In judging investigations into the activities of certain Americans in this time of grave danger , therefore , we should not indulge in any sentimentality even it a close friend or relative may be suspected of being a poor aecUrIty. risk . If anyone , wittingly or unit . tingly , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must suffer the consequences . There is such a thing as criminal negligence . There is such a thing as " guilt by ansocia. tion . " PHILIP MARSHALL BROWN . Williamstown , Mass. , Oct. 8 , 1951.
