Why Parents Call it Quits By DAVID G. WITTELS WOMAN sued for divorce in a Western state recently because , she said , her husband would n't let her cat sleep in their bed . In that state , before a bored and careless judge , that could constitute " mental cruelty , " and so she got her divorce . But the bitterness in her eyes and voice underlined the obvious fact that the trivial incident of the cat was not the real reason for the breakup of that marriage . On the other hand , in a divorce case in Detroit a few months ago , the woman 's grounds ran almost the entire gamut . She said that he drank too much , gambled , failed to support her properly , stayed out some nights without explanation , had struck her during one argument , and finally deserted her while she was pregnant . Everything she charged against him was true , and with such overwhelming grounds even a judge noted for his efforts to make couples try again promptly gave her a divorce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed in the survey on which this series of articles is based , she still was trying to figure out what had happened to her marriage . " Sometimes , " she said , " I wonder what turned the nice guy I married into such a louse . " What are the real , underlying causes of divorce ? The divorce rate in this country has risen 800 per cent in the last few decades until it is the highest in the world and until nowadays at least one out offive marriages winds up in the divorce courts . That is no longer news ; it has widely been viewed with alarm in pulpits , clinics , courtrooms , colleges and the press . The causes behind it , however , have remained befogged ; partly because the grounds which appear on the court records have been tailored to fit legal requirements , and partly because the smashup of a marriage usually is accompanied by bitterness , passionate accusations and deliberate or unconscious perjury . But once upon a time , in practically all those marriages , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vows , most of those people took " until death do us part " sincerely and literally . In each case , the divorce must have meant the shattering of some hopes and dreams and cost some degree of heartache . What happened to make people who had been lovers turn so nasty that they could n't bear living with each other any longer , and divorce seemed the only way out ? Some researchers , basing their conclusions solely on court records , have pontificated that drinking is the leading cause of divorce . Others , looking myopically at the testimony in states where drunkenness or the vague catchall of " cruelty " is not sufficient legal ground , come up with adultery or its euphemism , infidelity , as the main reason . Some have put the finger on in-laws , youthful elopements , poverty , easy money , the movies . A few , digging a little deeper , but not far enough , still argue that sexual incompatibility is the real answer in many eases . Some have laid the blame on lax divorce laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a growing group , trained in psychological and psychiatric angles , which insists that in the vast majority of cases the underlying cause is " emotional immaturity " on one or both sides . And then there are some who , not necessarily contradicting the last group , say that the main reason is that our civilization has changed so that some of the bonds and needs which held couples together in the past no longer exist . In the survey made by Dr. William J. Goode , of Wayne University , in Detroit , the stated grounds ranged from incest down to one woman 's complaint that her husband did n't like the way she set the table . They included all the causes , superficial and basic , cited above , plus a few more . The official grounds , however , usually turned out not to be the real reasons ; at least not the underlying ones . Doctor Goode 's survey supplied answers in terms of actual human experience rather than the usual , and ofttimes unrealistic , academic or Sunday-supplement theories . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems confronting women after divorce , his method of having interviewers sit down and talk it over with the divorcees themselves inevitably led to fascinating background material on why they were divorced . His seventy- . odd interviewers were not only primed with questionnaires shrewdly loaded to bring out subsurface facts but were instructed to encourage the women to talk their hearts out . Most of them did . Having had from eight to thirty months after their divorces to think things over , they had arrived at clearer and in some cases brand-new perspectives on what broke up their marriages . Often they admitted , directly or indirectly , that the fault might have been at least partly theirs . Frequently , the real reason for divorce was very different from what appeared in the legal records . In one case , for instance , the woman 's legal complaint had recited a long list of abuses which added up to general meanness on the husband 's part . But when the woman was interviewed , she pooh-poohed her own charges . " The real reason , " she confided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have married in the first place . By that time my husband was sick and tired of me too . " On the other hand , in another case the stated grounds were so slim that the case seemed to reek of collusion . Instead , it turned out that the husband had been flagrantly unfaithful , and had fractured his wife 's skull when at last she remonstrated . But , for the sake of the children , she had used the barest minimum grounds to get her divorce . Those are admittedly rather extreme cases , but the net result of Goode 's method was that his 425 scientifically selected case histories , amplified by further investigation in many instances , give perhaps the deepest insight into the real causes of divorce ever achieved . Goode put most of the answers he got in other phases of his survey through calculating machines . But some of these cases , seemingly involving up to a dozen causes each , would have wrecked the innards of the most marvelous tabulating machines . They can not calculate how a woman can love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because it was n't his main research purpose , Goode did n't even try to tabulate the causes ; and therefore he is n't to be held responsible for the following attempt to list them . But this writer waded through those 425 cases for nearly three months , with Goode giving him the benefit of his training as a sociologist . When analyzed , checked with court records and other sources , and weighed against modern psychological and psychiatric knowledge , these case histories began to fall into patterns . Without attempting at this point to separate the superficial from the basic , the main causes seemed to be : 1 . Emotional immaturity , including what lately has been popularized as " momism. " 2 . Our modern industrial civilization , which has wiped out many of the material reasons for family life . 3 . The idea that romantic love is the main reason and sufficient basis for marriage . 4 . Parental disapproval and mother-in-law trouble . 5 . Differences in background . 6 . Finances and lack of housing . 7 . Jobs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinking , gambling , cruelty , incompatibility and desertion , though most frequently cited as grounds for divorce , have been omitted because most authorities are agreed that those things are symptoms or end results rather than basic causes . Obviously a happily married , emotionally mature man does n't drink or gamble to excess , beat his wife or desert his family ; nor does a happily married , emotionally mature woman neglect her children and home , run around or nag her husband to distraction . The causes of the breakup of marriages lie not in what people do , but why they do them . It was amazing how many women in Doctor Goode 's survey sensed this , even uneducated ones with only average intelligence otherwise . " My husband drank , gambled and ran around , " one said . " But I guess the real reason was that he was a mamma 's boy and just could n't stand the responsibility of a family . " A little later she added , " I wonder , if I 'd been older and had more sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I guess not . I guess he 'll always be what he is " The first three causes in the above list are by far the main ones in today 's alarming divorce rate , but usually they have to be dug out from behind more obvious factors . Chief among the more tangible causes was parental disapproval of the marriage . Thoughtful people have realized , and experts have often warned , that parental disapproval can put two strikes on a marriage from the start . But the findings of this survey on that point will give even the experts a shock . In 62 per cent of the cases  --  which covered all classes ? the divorcees admitted that one or more of the parents had been against the marriage . Since some of the women lied in an effort to place all the blame on the husband , it is possible that the true figure might run as high as 80 per cent . " My mother , " one divorcee said frankly , " was the real cause of all our troubles . She hated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up to him that he was n't making as much money as the automobile dealer she had wanted me to marry . He liked a couple of drinks before dinner and maybe two or three bottles of beer at night . My mother used to tell him that if he did n't waste his money on liquor he would have more for his family . And . . . oh , a lot of little things . I used to think she was right , and I 'd say things like ' My mother thinks we ought to do this . ' He 'd blow up and yell , and sometimes he 'd dash out of the house and not come home until the middle of the night ; and once he slapped me and knocked me down . He started to do his drinking outside , and started running around . I used to think it was fine of my mother to back me up and bawl him out , but now I wonder how I would have felt if his mother was always picking on me and butting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of telling . the interviewer about the terrible fights she used to have with her husband . " Do you know , " she said , almost as if to herself , " I 've just realized that most of our fights and his meanness came right after my mother visited us ? " Despite the usual pattern of mother-in-law jokes , in most of these cases the deadly interference seemed to come from the husband 's mother ; though that may be because this is mostly the woman 's side of it . " His mother thought no girl was good enough for her son , " one divorcee remarked , and that seemed to sum up quite a number of cases . It was n't necessary for the dislike to be outspoken or otherwise overtly expressed . " The way in which my mother-in-law would give me recipes , and the way in which she explained to me , in front of him , what he liked and how he needed to be taken care of made me look like a dumb bunny and made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorcee compressed a great deal of truth into one succinct , apt remark . " Even the best mother-in-law , " she said , " is still a mother-in-law . " One famous sociologist has even concluded that the chances for success in marriage are highest if both parents on both sides are dead . But that obviously is not quite a practical solution for the in-laws problem . In some of these divorces the husband 's mother was a factor only because the husband expected the same attention from his wife that he got from his mother . Accustomed to being cared for by a woman who knew all the housekeeping tricks , he expected the impossible from his inexperienced young wife . Conversely , there were cases wherein the wives expected too much of their husbands . Comparing the husbands with their fathers , they grew impatient and nagging when their husbands could n't provide the luxuries their fathers had given them . One very obvious example of this was the case of a woman who got a divorce on the vague ground of " cruelty , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her young husband was that he could n't provide her with a maid and summers at a lake resort . " Father was a big man , " she reminisced , " and he always gave us everything . My husband made only sixty dollars a week and did n't seem to care that the baby and I had to do without a lot of things . " Apparently it did n't occur to her that sixty dollars a week was n't bad for a young man of twenty-seven who had devoted four years of his lire to war service , or that it had taken her father a long time to get established . Likewise , examples of what has been termed " the silver cord , " meaning an attachment between mother and son which persisted beyond his childhood , popped up every now and then in the survey . In one case , this factor turned out definitely to be the cause of the divorce , though at first glance there seemed to be no possible in-law angle . Her parents were dead and his mother lived more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town , however , she seemed to take it for granted that her son would drop everything and spend all his time with her . Her letters or wires or telephone calls announcing her arrival invariably were addressed only to her son . The implication was that the occasion would be a get-together for blood relatives exclusively . Every time that happened the son would drop everything , regardless of what had been planned between his wife and himself , and go off alone to see his mother . He saved all his business problems for her , shutting his wife out of that part of his life ; and apparently discussed his marital affairs with his mother and abided by her decisions . This mother also had two married daughters , and her relationship with them was the same . It was as if her son 's wife and her daughters ' husbands were interlopers . At least that is how they felt About it , because both daughters , too , eventually were divorced . Since the chances for friction rise geometrically if the in-laws are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a housing shortage , finances or affection , seems to be about the most dangerous thing a young couple can do . At least a dozen divorcees made practically the identical cry , " If we only could have had our own place ! " " We were confused by the interference of our relatives ; we could n't even have 86 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST Januar. 28 , 1950 ( Coo in urd from Page 81 ) a fight in peace , " said another . Excerpts from the tales of others elaborate that theme : " You ca n't be a wife when you 're only a guest in somebody else 's house . " " I found out too late that it 's true you ca n't have a wife and a mother in the same house . " " My mother-in-law treated me like a piece of furniture . We tried to get along at first , but we were like two strange cats . To her , I was just something that her son brought home to sleep with . When the baby came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's baby and her baby . I was only the store it came from . " This does not , of course , mean that in-laws are always menaces to successful marriage . There were mothers-in-law who tried to patch things up . In one case the divorcee admitted that her own mother had bawled her out for being unfair to her husband . There were even cases in which the mother-in-law sided with the daughter-in-law . One woman said , " My husband was such a beast that if it were n't for the understanding help of his mother , I think I might have turned on the gas and ended it all for the children and myself . " All experts are agreed that differences in background often lead to the divorce courts , and the survey bore this out with numerous cases wherein the romantic story of rich girl and poor boy had an unhappy ending . In one case the difference in economic background affected him more than her . It seemed to give him an inferiority complex . He kept sneering at her rich relatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insisted on keeping their home even more frugal and hare than his income required . Finally , when for the umpteenth time he snarled , " Why do n't you go back to your rich old man ? That 's what you want , anyway , " she did . There were also twenty-six cases in which he and she were of different religious faiths . Though exact figures on the prevalence of religious intermarriages are not available , that number strongly indicates that the divorce rate for mixed marriages is much higher than average . Though only two of the twenty-six women admitted that religious differences had anything to do with their divorces , that may have been because religion is a delicate subject . In any event , there can be no doubt that differences in background , and the irritations stemming from them , are frequently explosive . There was the case of the couple who were raised in the same middle-class neighborhood in Detroit . They had gone to the same high school , church , Sunday school and social gatherings . In most senses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raised to appreciate good music , good books and serious talk . His was an extroverted , earthy family which read the sports pages first and often did n't go any farther . Because at first she thought she loved him , she tried . She learned that Wagner was also the greatest shortstop who ever lived , and she kept her mouth shut when she discovered that to her husband bock was only a kind of beer that ushered in the spring . The odds obviously were against that marriage from the beginning . Though men often marry cute little things intellectually their inferiors , it is extremely rare for a woman to marry a man with much less formal schooling than she has . However , there were a dozen such cases in this survey . That seems proof that such a difference in background is dangerous . But in practically every one of those cases there was what might be called a freak angle which muddied the picture . Take , for instance , the case of a twenty-three-year-old college graduate from a well-to-do , rather snooty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her senior and from the wrong side of the tracks ? a truck driver . Those facts would seem sufficient explanation for the divorce which came five years and one child later . But it developed that she had been inhibited all through girlhood and early womanhood by a very noticeable birthmark on her face . It made her a wallflower ; it convinced her that no boy would ever fall in love with her . When the truck driver said , " Hello , there , " and , later made a pass at her , she fell in love with him . Two years after the marriage , and after the baby was born , she found a surgeon who removed her blemish . The case history indicates that her awareness of his crudities and her regret at having married " beneath herself " started soon after that . There was the case of the city-bred girl , a high-school graduate , who married a lusty , practically illiterate young farmer whom she met during a summer vacation . Soon after the first passion of the honeymoon , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life in which she found herself . But they remained married for nine years , during which three children word born . Then , on a visit to her parents she discovered that the wartime boom offered good jobs even to untrained women . She never went back to her husband . Putting the children in her parents ' care , she went to work and in a few months started divorce proceedings . She later told the interviewer , " I wanted a better life for my children . " That case obviously has tinges of three other factors listed earlier : finances , jobs for women and ambition . Finances seem to be a cause of divorce in two ways . The fact that the nagging , harassing worry of the financial problems of a young couple trying to set up housekeeping can be a terrific strain on the marriage bonds is too apparent to require illustration . But extra money often opens the door to divorce . The statistical charts show that the divorce rate always rises in periods of full employment and prosperity . The all-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war restlessness , but mainly to the fact that more people had the price of a divorce and more women saw opportunities for supporting themselves and their children without depending upon husbands . That , too , was made clear by Doctor Goode 's survey . In case after case the women 's stories showed that for years they had put up with their husbands only because they did n't know what else to do , but that when they discovered that jobs within their capabilities were available , they got divorces . In most of those cases the factor of increased job opportunities was , of course , only a means and not a basic cause . But in some instances it came very close to being a basic factor . In one such case the woman , on the basis of her own story , was reasonably happily married until , partly as a patriotic gesture and partly because the extra money was attractive , she took a half-time job in a war plant . Her husband was an office worker whose salary was little affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen hours a day as a housewife , by doing comparatively easy , pleasant work forty hours a week she could earn ten dollars a week more than her husband had ever made . She parked her children with her mother , and soon afterward filed for divorce . The grounds were " cruelty . " Such cases come close to overlapping the ambition factor . Doctor Goode shuddered at the listing of that as a cause , and this writer would not care to defend it as a basic one . But people do sometimes outgrow each other , and so do their ambitions . Usually that is recognized only in the cases of men who married young and then developed far beyond their wives , whose horizons remained limited to the confines of home . But it happens to women too . One example is the case of the young woman who married a boy from her neighborhood and was satisfied until she discovered that her voice , instead of being merely a parlor accomplishment , might have commercial value . Her husband was a hard-working , honest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as his talents could carry him . On the one hand , she did want to be a wife and mother . On the other , the prospect of a career as a singer was enticing . The ground she cited in her suit was the same old story of " cruelty , " but what she finally confided to the interviewer was : " I also had my own life to live . There were people who could help me , but when they saw him , in the wrong kind of suit and always saying wrong things , they cooled off . " There is , of course , the suspicion that by " people who could help me " she meant fast-talking wolves who admired her figure more than her voice . But she got her divorce and she did become a rather well-known band and radio singer , with movie deals in the offing . There were also freak cases which apparently could n't be fitted into any of the listed categories . A woman with five children was given a divorce because , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always picked fights with her , and a loafer who would n't support his family properly . She gave the interviewer still another reason . The children were scarcely a year apart . " I got tired , " she said wearily , " of being pregnant all the time . " There was the case of a religious fanatic who decided he had to leave his wife and children to devote all his time to God ; there were cases of bigamy ; and there were instances where the sloppiness of the women told the interviewers why husbands had left them in disgust . There was a case which seemed to reverse a familiar pattern . " Our troubles began , " one woman said , " when we got out of debt . Then we had no worries left to pull us to-gether ! " Most of these cases could probably he fitted into the " emotional immaturity " category . But " emotional immaturity " is so general a term . It is almost like ascribing all crime to the S 88 devil in human nature . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus the effect of our modern civilization upon the divorce rate , is to review in detail the early case in which the ex-wife wondered what had turned " the nice guy " she married into " such a louse . " On the basis of the proved charges against him , he apparently was a vicious character who never deserved a wife . But further investigation showed that basically he fitted the ex-wife 's description of " a nice guy , " and at first he acted that way . This is a particularly apt case history because the marriage started without any of the obvious handicaps . He was twenty-four and she was twenty-one . He was working , and she knew enough about cooking and other household duties to make a start . Both came from the same kind of average , decent families , they were of the same religion and both had about the same amount of education . Both were healthy and normal . She was chaste and he was no wild young man . Both families approved . All the ingredients for successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , leaving two embittered people and a baby to grow up without a father . The clue goes away back . They met at a party given by a girl friend of hers , and they liked each other right away . He was a rather good-looking lad with a nice grin , and she was a cute little thing with a trim figure . They danced well together . He took her home . He began calling her for dates . They discovered that they both liked Gary Cooper , bowling and vanilla ice cream . They got a thrill when they held hands , sparks flew when they kissed , and they fell in love . She had , of course , considered him as a possible husband almost from the beginning : But the thought of marriage never seriously entered his mind until 2:30 one morning , after he had brought her home from a dance and they had been saying good night for an hour and a half . All of a sudden these frustrating partings struck him as brutally silly . If they were married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already Bev tttttt tr ? 28. 1450 eral times said , " I love you , " while kissing her . Now he said , " Let 's get married , " and she said yes . They were in love , the mating urge was strong in them , and that seemed sufficient basis for marriage . Their horizons did n't go beyond the honeymoon . Both had always lived with their parents . His forty dollars a week was good money  --  several years ago  --  for a young man . It enabled him , even after paying his mother board money , to dress nicely , buy a small car on the installment plan and have plenty left . over for spending freely on dates . He had never been responsible for anyone but himself . The thought of supporting his beloved made him feel protective , but he had no conception of what that really entailed . Reality set in soon . The bed and the few other articles of furniture they bought for their tiny apartment not only wiped out their savings but put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid his mother for room and board . The delights of the bedroom and the breakfast nook were dreams come true , but the payments on them were nightmares . He had been used to having money in his pocket ; now every time he jingled a few coins a bill or an installment due hit him in the face . He had the girl and the love nest he had wanted , but he discovered that they cost so much that he had to give up practically everything else . She no longer looked so wonderful to him . They had known each other for nearly a year before they were married , but of course they had n't really known each other at all . They had seen only each other 's company and courting manners . Though they had lived only about ten blocks apart , in modern urban life ten blocks might as well have been ten hundred miles so fares allowing them to learn each other 's daily habits and manners was concerned . That may be one reason why the divorce rate in rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more about each other , is only about half the rate in large cities . In the case of this urban couple , she had . never seen him unshaven , sweaty and unbathed . He had never seen her except with her hair waved , her face made up , powdered , perfumed and dressed in her prettiest . The mornings-after were disilluSioning to both . This had less effect on her because women are more realistic and have a greater instinctive feeling for family life . Having a greater stake in marriage , they usually are capable of greater adjustments . But on his part , when romantic love faded , there was no other purpose to that marriage . He felt trapped , and , like a trapped animal , he snarled and blindly sought escape . Romantic love is not a new invention , and it is a powerful factor in successful marriage . But the idea that it is the main ingredient is comparatively new , largely confined to our Western civilization , and most virulently concentrated in this country . The result is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes in marriage . To make matters worse , our modern , urban , industrialized civilization has practically wiped out some of 1 those purposes . To get perspective on why this young couple broke up , it is necessary to go back to why marriage is the oldest human institution , older even than religion , government and law . Prehistoric men and women teamed up , and not only for mating purposes . What made and kept them couples  --  man and wife even if without benefit of then-nonexistent clergy  --  was that a Couple had a better chance to survive than a single man or woman did . A woman needed a protector and provider ; a man could do more hunting if he had a partner to take care of the preparation of the food and clothing and other domestic duties . Therefore , though " divorce " was merely a matter of the man knocking his mate on the head , or kicking her out , or simply not coming back from a hunting expedition , it is likely that the " divorce " rate among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this supposedly enlightened era . The bond of partnership  --  division of labor  --  remained powerful until a few decades ago . A young man could n't run a farm without a wife . When he sought a wife , he knew he was looking for more than a gay companion and bed mate . Even in nonfarm life , a man needed a partner in the business of making a living . The home was still the center of our economy . Most necessary things were fashioned at home , not factory-made and store-bought . B. read had to be baked ; it was not de-livered by the bread man ; most clothing was handmade , and it was cleaned and repaired at home ; butter and soap I were created by female elbow grease . A man was helpless without a wife ; and conversely , about the only way the vast majority of women could make a living was to get married and stay married . It is fascinating to note how the upward curve in the divorce rate follows the rise of industrialization . As things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need a wife for most material purposes . Factories made his Clothing , and stores sold them reasonably . He could eat in restaurants for less than it cost to feed him and his wife at home . A barber cut his hair , and the laundry did his wash , delivering it neatly packaged and ready for use . There are , of course , other reasons , spiritual and emotional , for lasting ' * Marriage . Even in a material sense , the very fetters which now chafed this Young man would have , in the long run , made him better off . But all he Ravi was that instead of gaining perpetual bliss , he had lost his freedom . If the young man had been more mature emotionally , the shock would not have driven him berserk . But comparatively few people are " emotionally mature . " The survey showed signs of that failing in college graduates with strings of degrees after their names and in some people in their forties . It is particularly true at the age of the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realities of marriage . The fact which completely turned a " nice guy " into " such a louse " was her pregnancy . In another era , exactly the same kind of young husband would have welcomed that , even if for only practical reasons . On a farm or elsewhere in the household-economy era , a baby meant that soon there would be another pair of hands to help out in the struggle to make a living . To a factory worker , an accountant , a truck driver , a lawyer , a salesman , a baby means another body to feed and clothe and educate . Again , there are other values , emotional and spiritual ; and an emotionally mature man would realize or at least sense them and greet a baby as a happy event , even if it had no practical value . But again , if marriage were confined to the emotionally mature , this soon would become a dying nation of mostly bachelors and old maids . To this young man , harassed by the unexpected discovery that marriage was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In at least 10 per cent of the cases pregnancy seemed to have caused the break leading to the divorce , and in about 50 per cent of the cases it may have been a major contributing factor . Those are brutal facts , but they must be faced if a way to solve the alarming divorce problem , particularly when children are involved , is to be found . The practical point which can not be overlooked is that nowadays there are fewer bonds for marriage and fatherhood , and more strains upon the marriage ties . People are n't any worse than they were ; the conditions are different and in some-respects tougher . What should be done about it , this writer must leave to wiser men . All he can do is to report what he learned from Doctor Goode 's survey and corollary study . Perhaps if the young man in this particular case history had known the real facts of married life , beyond those taught by the birds and the bees , his might have been a successful marriage . If , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked into his head that the moonlight and roses would n't last , and that romantic love was at best only a bridge into marriage , he probably still would have married the girl . Spring and the mating urge and mankind 's desire for home and companionship will always work the same old magic . But he would have gone ahead with his eyes open , somewhat prepared to wait for the other values to emerge . At least it would n't have been a sudden shock to discover that the old jokes about a wife being a " ball and chain " had considerable truth in them , and that nowadays a wife and children can be expensive luxuries . Because the factor of infidelity occurred so frequently in these case histories , and because the question of whether that is primarily a cause or a symptom is still being debated , sensible discussion of it requires more space than is available in this article .
