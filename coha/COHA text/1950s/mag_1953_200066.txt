Britain 's Acting Prime Minister Richard A. Butler stood up in the House of Commons one day last week and , for all his determination not to , twanged the bowstring of Britain 's royal romance . The Churchill government , announced the dry , donnish Chancellor of the Exchequer , proposes to change the law which designates Princess Margaret as regent should her sister the Queen die before Prince Charles is 18 . <P> The 1937 Regency Act . said Rab Butler , should be altered . The plan is to make Queen Elizabeth 's husband , the Duke of Edinburgh , regent . The Queen feels it proper that Prince Charles 's father , not his 22-year-old aunt , should train the boy for the responsibilities of the throne and shoulder those responsibilities as regent , if need be . <P> Butler 's proposal was adrenalin to the millions of Britons who are busily marrying off Princess Meg to the dashing , divorced R.A.F. ace , Group Captain Peter Townsend : the government , it seemed , was deliberately relieving the Princess of one great obstacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regency change has been in the wind for more than a year . The question of freeing Margaret to marry Townsend-a matter requiring the approval of the Queen , the government and the Church of England-had nothing to do with it . " Such a matter . . . has never come before the cabinet . " said he , " and I think I am voicing the opinion of all members when I say that . . . deplorable speculation and gossip should be brought to an end . " <P> Steadfast Devotion . The Chancellor hoped in vain . The gossip grew even louder ( it has assumed " the shape of scandal , " protested the stately London Times ) . And it seemed likely to continue for months to come . The latest word is that the Queen , the Queen Mother and Margaret herself have agreed to do nothing until the Queen and Philip return from a visit to Australia next May . The royal family apparently hopes that by then Margaret 's ardor for Airman Townsend-now neatly isolated in an air attache 's job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her steadfast devotion to Townsend will be so plain to everyone that a way will be found to bless the marriage . <P> Not alone the de-emphasis of Margaret ( which caught U.S. headline writers ) but the new emphasis on Philip created a stir in Britain . Lord Beaverbrook 's Tory Daily Express and the Liberal Manchester Guardian , which find few issues to agree upon , both agreed that the regency should be kept " in the line of succession " rather than pass to one who is not in the line , i.e. , Princess Margaret should have the regency . There was also a deep undertow of nervousness and grumbling in the starchy back benches of the Tory Party , whose men are properly silent in public and often violently articulate in private . Though the handsome and gregarious Philip takes his job seriously and is increasingly popular with the British public , he is not universally beloved by England 's bluebloods . They mistrust him : his politics are comparatively liberal ; he plays loose with some of the stuffier conventions of the palace ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but above all , he is a Battenberg , and a nephew of the dashing , controversial Admiral the Earl Mountbatten of Burma and his equally controversial wife Edwina.
