For months , T.W.A. and Eastern Air Lines have looked around for a new twin-engine craft to replace the DC-3 on short hauls . This week the Glenn L. Martin Co. won the prize : a $35 million order for 65 Martin 4-0-45 ( 35 to Eastern , 30 to T.W.A. ) . The two-motored plane is a pressurized version of the 2-0-2 and carries 40 passengers , four more than the 2-0-2 . <P> To Martin the landing of the first sizable commercial order in three years was another step in its comeback . Hit hard by the sharp cutbacks in military buying at war 's end , Martin had to borrow $26.7 million from RFC , expanded its operations in such sidelines as plastics in hope of making some money . But in 1947 it lost $19 million , followed that with a $16.7 million loss in 1948 . <P> Things picked up a little last year as the Navy began ordering land-based patrol planes , pilotless aircraft and other equipment . ( Martin 's current backlog of military orders : about $75 million . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aging ( 64 ) President Glenn Martin moved himself up as chairman and brought in 43-year-old C. C. ( for Chester Charles ) Pearson , a onetime executive of Douglas Aircraft and a vice president of Curtiss-Wright , as his successor . With a sharp eye on overhead , Pearson sold off Martin 's sidelines and managed to pay off all but $3,000,000 of the RFC loan . <P> Next week President Pearson will have more good news to report : in 1949 the company got into the black for the first time in three years ; insiders estimated the net at $5.000,000 on sales of $50 million . This year , as it rolls 4-0-45 off the assembly line , the company hopes to do even better . Though such an industry leader as Boeing has lost money on postwar commercial planes , Pearson thinks that the Martin 4-0-45 can pay off .
