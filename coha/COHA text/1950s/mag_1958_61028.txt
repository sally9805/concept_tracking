When a World Series has ended , the record of each game is filed away in a volume appropriately called the World Series Record Book . First , however , the data is scanned closely to see what new records have been made , and these are inserted in place of the old ones , usually under the heading of " the most this " or " the least that . " Here follows a list of some new " mosts " and " leasts , " a few " almost the most " and one or two curious items which , alas , will never make the book . // The 46,367 folks who attended the opening game in Milwaukee set a record before a pitch was made ; most silence by one crowd . It was understandable that they should remain quiet during the reading of the Yankee lineup . ( There was one loud " yea " when Berra 's name was announced , but on the theory that it was made by a distant relative , it may be discounted . ) People in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast silence continued through the reading of the home team 's lineup , it was indeed puzzling . // Even in China they must know that in the second game Lew Burdette had a chance at Babe Ruth 's favorite record  --  his 29 ? consecutive scoreless innings in Series play  --  and that he failed . He failed in the very first inning , even as the first putout was being made , but before the inning was over , Lew Burdette 's name was in the record book anyway , and so was his team 's . He did it with one magnificent swing , pounding the ball over the left-field fence for a three-run homer . It was the first home run by a pitcher in the World Series since 1940 , and it capped a seven-run first inning , the biggest first inning in Series history . If Lew Burdette could n't have Babe Ruth 's pitching record , he might as well go after a few of his hitting ones . // In the third game two curious things happened . Hank Bauer , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the Series . While this was n't a record ( Max Flack managed to get picked off twice in one game in 1918 . You remember Max ) , it was unusual since Bauer is not a fellow taken to wandering casually away from bases . Bob Rush , the Milwaukee pitcher , got his name in the record book when he fielded three ground balls in the third inning . // Undoubtedly the most touching moment of the Series occurred in the second inning when Roy Campanella entered the Stadium to the cheers of the crowd . // In the seventh inning of the fourth game , time was called . It seems a cord was hanging from the upper left-field seats and out across the grass several feet behind the spot where Wes Covington was standing . A grounds-keeper emerged and while a million dollar production waited impatiently , he carefully rolled it up . Someone had evidently been flying a kite on the grounds behind the Stadium and , by accident or design , it had drifted over the ball park , suffered power failure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hank Bauer 's 17-game World Series hitting streak came to an end . It is a record likely to endure for many years , since few players even get into as many as 17 World Series games . As the fourth game ended , Bob Fishel , Yankee publicity man , announced solemnly to the press that if the Series returned to Milwaukee , the Yankee plane would leave shortly after game five . He suggested that those going along either take their luggage to the airport or bring it to the Stadium . It seemed like a complicated arrangement . And Lew Burdette had every intention of making it all superfluous the next afternoon .
