Part II of a Novel in Four Parts by GRAHAM GREENE LOSER TAKES ALL Just before his second marriage  --  to beautiful young Gary , fifteen years his junior  --  Bertram , the assistant accountant of a large London firm , inadvertently makes a hit with Herbert JJreuther , the elderly , eccentric co-head of the company , known familiarly as the Gom ( Grand Old Man ) . The Corn insists that the couple be married in Monte Carlo , with himself as witness , and then honeymoon on his yacht . His secretary , Miss Bullen , makes the arrangements . Bertram and Cary duly arrive in Monte Carlo the day befOre the wedding is to take place , only to find that the Com , who is 011 cruising , has not yet arrived . They visit the game room and notice a hungry-looking young man playing desperately . They quarrel about him and spend an edgy night . 7 A FTER breakfast we took a taxi to the Mairie  --  I wanted to be quite certain Miss Bullen had not slipped up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four sharp . They asked us not to be late as there was another wedding at 4:30 . " Like to go to the Casino ? " I asked Cary . " We could spend say 1,000 francs now that everything 's arranged . " " Let 's take a look at the port first and see if he 's come . " We walked down the steps which reminded we of Montmartre except that everything was so creamy and clean and glittering and new , instead of gray and old and historic . Everywhere you were reminded of the Casino  --  the bookshops sold systems in envelopes , " 2,500 francs a week guaranteed , " the toy shops sold small roulette boards , the tobacconists sold ash trays in the form of a wheel , and even in the women 's shops there were scarves patterned with figures and manque and pair and impair and rouge and noir . Copyright 1954 , 1955 by Graham Greene There were a dozen yachts in the harbor , and three carried British flags , but not one of them was Dreuther 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgotten ? " Cary said . " Miss Sullen would never let him forget . I expect he 's unloading passengers at Nice . Anyway last night you wanted him to be late . " " Yes , but this morning it feels scary . Perhaps we ought n't to play in the Casino  --  just in case . " " We 'll compromise , " 1 said . " Three hundred francs . We ca n't leave Monaco without playing once . " We hung around the cuisine for quite a while before we played . This was the serious time of day  --  there were no tourists and the Salle Privie was closed and only the veterans sat there . You had a feeling with all of them that their lunch depended on victory . It was long , hard , dull employment for them  --  a cup of coffee and then to work till lunchtime  --  if their system was successful and they could afford the lunch . Once Cary laughed  --  I forget what at , and an old man and an old woman raised their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were offended by our frivolity : this was no game to them . Even if the system worked , what a toil went into earning the 2,500 francs a week . With their pads and their charts they left nothing to chance , and yet over and over again chance nipped in and shoveled away their tokens . " Darling , let 's bet . " She put all her three hundred francs on the number of her age , and crossed her fingers for luck . I was more cautious : I put one carre on the same figure , and backed noir and impair with my other two . We both lost on her age , but I won on my others . " Have you won a fortune , darling ? How terribly clever . " " I 've won two hundred and lost one hundred . " " Well , buy a cup of coffee . They always say you ought to leave when you win . " " We have n't really won . We are down four bob . " " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know I think buy a system just for fun ? I 'd like to see just how they persuade themselves . ... " If anybody could think up a system , it should be you . " " 1 can see the possibility if there were no limit to the stakes , but then you 'd have to be a millionaire . " " Darling , you wo n't really think one up , will you ? It 's fun pretending to be rich for two days , but it would n't be fun if it were true . Look at the guests in the hotel , they are rich . Those women with lifted faces and dyed hair and awful little dogs . " She said again with one of her flashes of disquieting wisdom , " You seem to get afraid of being old when you 're rich . " " There may be worse fears when you are poor . " " They are ones we are used to . Darling , let 's go and look at the harbor again . It 's nearly lunchtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I do n't like it terribly . " We leaned over a belvedere and looked down at the harbor  --  there was n't any change there . The sea was very blue and very still and we could hear the voice of a cox out with an eight  --  it came clearly over the water and up to us , Very far away , beyond the next headland , there was a white boat , smaller than a celluloid toy in a child 's bath . " Do you think that 's Mr. Dreuther ? " Cary asked . " It might be . I expect it is . " But it was n't . When we came back after lunch there was no Seagull in the harbor and the boat we had seen was no longer in sight : it was somewhese on the way to Italy . Of course there was no need for anxiety : even if he failed to turn up before night , we could still get married . I said , If he 's been held up , he 'd have telegraphed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's impossible , " I said , but my mind told me that nothing was impossible with the Corn . I said , " / think I 'll tell the hotel we 'll keep on one room  --  just in case . " " The small room , " Cary said . The receptionist was a little crass . " One room , sir ? " " Yes , one room . The small one . " " The small one ? For you and Madame , sir ? " " Yes . " I had to explain . " We are being married this afternoon . " " Congratulations , sir . " " Mr. Dreuther was to have been here . " " We 've had no word from Mr. Dreuther , sir . He usually lets us know .... We were not expecting him , " Nor was I now , but I did not tell Cary that . This , after all , Gom or no Com , was our wedding day . I tried to make her return to the Casinoand lose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the terrace and look at the sea . It was an excuse to keep a watch for the Seagull . And of course the Seagull never came . That interview had meant nothing , Dreuther 's kindness had meant nothing , a whim had flown like a wild bird over the snowy waste of his mind , leaving no track at all . We were forgotten . I said , " It 's time to go to the Mairie . " " We have n't even a witness , " Cary said . " They 'll find a couple , " I said with a confidence I did not feel . I thought it would be gay to arrive in a horse-cab and we climbed romantically into a ramshackle vehicle outside the Casino and sat down under the off-white awning . But we 'd chosen badly . The horse was all skin and bone and I had forgotten that the road was uphill . An old gentleman with an ear appliance was being pushed down to the Casino by a middle-aged woman , and she made far better progress down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear her precise English voice . She must have been finishing a story . She said , " And so they lived unhappily ever after " : the old man chuckled and said , " Tell me that one again . " I looked at Cary and hoped she had n't heard but she had . " Darling , " I said , " do n't be superstitious , not today . " " There 's a lot of sense in superstition . How do you know fate does n't send us messages  --  so that we can be prepared . Like a kind of code . I 'm always inventing new ones . For instance " ? she thought a moment ? " it will be lucky if a confectioner 's comes before a flower shop . Watch your side . " I did , and of course a flower shop came first . I hoped she had n't noticed , hut , " You ca n't cheat fate , " she said mournfully . The cab went slower and slower : it would have been quicker to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes to go . I said , " You ought to have sacrificed a chicken this morning and found what omens there were in the entrails . " " It 's all very well to laugh , " she said . " Perhaps our horoscopes do n't match . " " You would n't like to call the whole thing off , would you ? Who knows ? We 'll be seeing a squinting man next . " " Is that bad ? " " It 's awful . " I said to the cabby , " Please . A Little faster . Plus vile . " Cary clutched my arm . " Oh , " she said . " What 's the matter ? " " Did n't you see him when he looked round ? He 's got a squint . " " But , Cary , I was only joking . " " That does n't make any difference . Do n't you see ? It 's what I said , you invent a code and fate uses it . " 1 said angrily , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be too late anyway . " " Too late ? " She grabbed my wrist and looked at my watch . She said , " Darling , we ca n't be late . Stop . Arthez . Pay bins off . " " We ca n't run uphill , " I said , but she was already out of the cab and signaling wildly to every car that passed . No one took any notice . Fathers of families drove smugly by . Children pressed their noses on the glass and made faces at her . She said , " It 's no use We 've got to run . " " Why bother ? Our marriage was going to be unlucky  --  you 've read the omens , have n't you ? " " I do n't care , " she said , " I 'd rather be unlucky with you than lucky with anyone else . " That was the sudden way she had  --  of dissolving a quarrel , an evil mood , with one clear statement . 1 took her hand and we began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time if a furniture van had not stopped and given us a lift all the way . Has anyone else arrived at their wedding sitting on an old-fashioned brass bedstead ? I said , " From now on brass bedsteads will always be lucky . " She said , " There 's a brass bedstead in the little room at the hotel . " WE HAD two minutes to spare when the furniture man helped us out onto the little square at the top of the world . To the south there was nothing higher , I suppose , before the Atlas mountains . The tall houses stuck up like cacti toward the heavy blue sky , and a narrow terra-cotta street came abruptly to an end at the edge of the great rock of Monaco . A Virgin in pale blue with angels blowing round her like a scarf looked across from the church opposite , and it was warm and windy and very quiet and all the roads of our life had led us to this square . I think for a moment we were both afraid to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing was . We sat on a wooden bench , and another couple soon sat down beside us , the girl in white , the man in black : I became painfully conscious that I was n't dressed up . Then a man in a high stiff collar made a great deal of fuss about papers and for a while we thought the marriage would n't take place at all : then there was a to-do because we had turned up without witnesses , before they consented to produce a couple of sad clerks . We were led into a large empty room with a chandelier , and a desk  --  a notice on the door said Salle des Marriages , and the mayor , a very old man who looked like Clemenceau , wearing a blue and red ribbon of office , stood impatiently by while the man in the collar read out our names and our birds dates . Then the mayor repeated what sounded like a whole code of laws in rapid French and we had to agree to them  --  apparently MAGAZINE they were clauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little speech in very bad English about our duty to society and our responsibility to the State , and at last he shook hands with me and kissed Cary on the cheek , and we went out again past the waiting couple onto the little windy square . It was n't an impressive ceremony , there was no organ like at St. Luke 's and no wedding guests . " I do n't feel I 've been married , " Cary said , but then she added , " It 's fun not feeling married . " 8 T HERE are so many faces in streets and bars and busses and stores that remind one of Original Sin , so few that carry permanently the sign of Original Innocence . Cary 's face was like that  --  she would always until old age look at the world with the eyes of a child . She was never bored : every clay was a new day : even grief was eternal and every joy would last forever . " Terrible " was her favorite adjective  --  it was n't in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her fears , her anxieties , her laughter  --  the terror of surprise , of seeing something for the first time . Most of us only see resemblances , every situation has been met before , but Cary saw only differences , like a wine-taster who can detect the most elusive flavor . We went back to the hotel and the Seagull had n't come and Cary met this anxiety quite unprepared as though it were the first time we had felt it . Then we went to the bar and had a drink , and it might have been the first drink we had ever had together . She had an insatiable liking for gin and Dubonnet which I did n't share . I said , " He wo n't he in now till tomorrow . " " Darling , shall we have enough for the bill ? " " Oh , we can manage tonight . " " We might win enough at the Casino . " " We 'll stick to the cheap room . We ca n't afford to risk much . " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and in the afternoon we looked down at the harbor and the Seagull was n't there . " He has forgotten , " Cary said . " He 'd have telegraphed otherwise . " I knew she was right , and I did n't know what to do , and when the next day came I knew even less . " Darling , " Cary said , " we 'd better go while we can still pay , " but I had secretly asked for the bill ( on the excuse that we did n't want to play beyond our resources ) , and I knew that already we had insufficient . There was nothing to do but wait . I telegraphed to Miss Bullen and she replied that Mr. Dreuther was at sea and out of touch . I was reading the telegram out to Cary as the old man with the ear appliance sat on a chair at the top of the steps , watching the people go by in the late afternoon sun . He asked suddenly , " Do you know Dreuther ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You think he is , " he said sharply . " You are in Sitra , are you ? " " Yes . " " Then I 'm your employer , young man . Do n't you put your faith in Dreuther . " You are Mr. Bowles ? " " Of course I 'm Mr. Bowles . Go and find my nurse . It 's time we went to the tables . " When we were alone again , Cary said , " Who was that horrible old man ? Is he really your employer ? " " In a way . In the firm we call him A. N. Other . He owns a few shares in Sitra  --  only a few , but they hold the balance between Dreuther and Blixon . As long as he supports Dreuther , Blixon can do nothing , but if Blixon ever managed to buy the shares , I 'd be sorry for the Gom . A way of speaking , " I added . " Nothing could make me sorry for him now . " " He 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes when you do n't care a damn about other people . None of us has a right to forget anyone . Except ourselves . The Gom never forgets himself . Oh hell , let 's go to the Casino . " " We ca n't afford to . " We are so in debt we may as well . " That night we did n't bet much : we stood there and watched the veterans . The young man was back in the cuisine . I saw him change a thousand francs into tokens of a hundred , and presently when he 'd lost those , he went out  --  no coffee or rolls for him that evening . Cary said , " Do you think he 'll go hungry to bed ? " " We all will , " I said , " if the Seagull does n't come . " watched them playing their systems , losing a little , gaining a little , and I thought it was strange how the belief persisted  --  that somehow you could beat the bank . They were like theologians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lives a moment comes when we wonder  --  suppose after all there is a God , suppose the theologians are right . Pascal was a gambler  --  who staked his money on a divine system . I thought , I am a far better mathematician than any of these  --  is that why I do n't believe in their mystery , and yet if this mystery exists , is n't it possible that I might solve it where they have failed ? It was almost like a prayer when I thought : it 's not for the sake of money  --  I do n't want a fortune  --  just a few days with Gary free from anxiety . Of all the systems around the table there was only one that really worked , and that did not depend on the so-called law of chance . A middkeaged woman with a big bird 's nest of false blonde hair and two gold teeth lingered around the most crowded table . If anybody made a coup she went up to him and touching his elbow appealed quite brazenly  --  so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 franc chips . Perhaps charity , like a hunched back , is considered lucky . When she received a chip she would change it for two one hundred franc tokens , put one in her pocket and stake the other en p/ein . She could n't lose her hundreds and one day she stood to gain 3,500 francs . Most nights she must have left the table a thousand francs to the good from what she had in her pocket . " Did you see her ? " Cary asked as we walked to the bar for a cup of coffee  --  we had given up the gins and Dubonnets . " Why should n't I do that too ? " " We have n't come to that . " " I 've made a decision , " Cary said . " No more meals at the hotel . " " Do we starve ? " " We have coffee and rolls or perhaps milk  --  it 's more 1 said sadly , " It 's not intended . Bournemouth better . " " Do n't fret , darling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't believe in the Seagull any more . " " Then what do we do when the fortnight 's over ? " " Go to jail , I should think . Perhaps the prison is run by the Casino and we shall have recreation hours round a roulette wheel . " " Could n't you borrow from the Other ? " " Bowles ? He 's never lent without security in his life . He 's sharper than Dreuther and Mixon put together  --  otherwise they 'd have had his shares years ago . " " But there must be something we can do , darling ? " " Madam , there is . " I looked up from my cooling coffee and saw a small man in frayed and dapper clothes with co-respondent shoes . His nose seemed bigger than the rest of his face : the experience of a lifetime had swollen the veins and bleared the eyes . He carried jauntily under his arm a walking stick that had lost its ferrule , with a duck 's head for a handle . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruding , but you have had ill-succesi at the tables and I carry with we good tidings , sir and madam . " " Well , " said Cary , " we were just going .. . . " She told me later that his use of a Biblical phrase gave her a touch of shivers , of diablerie  --  the devil at his old game of quoting scripture . " It is better for you to stay , for I have shut in my mind here a perfect system . That system ' lam prepared to let you have for a mere ten thousand francs . " " You are asking the earth , " I said . " We have n't got that much . " " But you are staying at the Hotel de Paris . I have seen you . " " It 's a matter of currency , " Cary said quickly . " You know how it is with the English . " " One thousand francs . " " No , " Cary said , " I 'm sorry . " " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll stand you a drink for it . " " Whisky , " the little man replied sharply . I realized too late that whisky cost 500 francs . sat down at the table with his stick between knees so that the duck seemed to be sharing drink . I said , " Go on . " " It is a very small whisky . " " You wo n't get another . " " It is very simple , " the little man said , " like all great mathematical discoveries . You bet first on one number and when your number wins you stake your gains on the correct transversal of six numbers . The correct transversal on one is 31 to 36 ; on two 13 to 15 ; on three .... " " Why ? " " You can take it that I am right . 1 have studied very carefully here for many years . For five hundred francs I will sell you a list of all the winning numbers which came up last June . " " But suppose the number does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system until it does . " " It might take years . " The little man got up , bowed and said , " That is why one must have capital . I had too little capital . If instead of five million I had possessed ten million I would not be selling you my system for a glass of whisky . " He retired with dignity , the ferruleless stick padding on the polished floor , the duck staring back at us as though it wanted to stay . " I think my system 's better , " Cary said . " If that woman can get away with it , I can . ... " " It 's begging . I do n't like my wife to beg . " " I 'm only a new wife . And I do n't count it begging  --  it 's not money , only tokens . " " You know there was something that man said which made me think . It 's a pure matter of reducing what one loses and increasing what one gains . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " SHE WAS away for nearly half an hour and then she came back almost at a run . " Darling , put away your doodles . I want to go home . " " They are n't doodles . I 'm working out an idea . " " Darling , please come at once or I 'm going to cry . " When we were outside she dragged me up through the gardens , between the floodlit palm trees and the flower beds like sugar sweets . She said , " Darling , it was a terrible failure . " " What happened ? " " I did exactly what that woman did . I waited till someone won a lot of money and then I sort of nudged his elbow and said , ' Give . ' But he did n't give , he said quite sharply , ' Go home to your mother , ' and the croupier looked up . So I went to another table . And the man there just said , Later . Later . On the terrace . ' Darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried a third time  --  oh , it was terrible . One of those attendants who light people 's cigarettes touched me on my arm and said , ' 1 think Mademoiselle has played enough for tonight . ' Calling me Mademoiselle made it worse . I wanted to fling my marriage lines in his face , but I 'd left them in the bathroom at the hotel . " " In the bathroom ? " " Yes , in my sponge bag , darling , because for some reason I never lose my sponge bag  --  I 've had it for years and years . But that 's not why I want to cry . Darling , please let 's sit down on this seat . I ca n't cry walking about  --  it 's like eating chocolate in the open air . You get so out of breath you ca n't taste the chocolate . " " For goodness ' sake , " I said , " if that 's not the worst let me know the worst . Do you realize we shall never be able to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a system , a real system . " " Oh , it 's not as had as that , darling . The attendant gave me such a nice wink at the door . know he wo n't mind my going back  --  but I never want to go back , never . " " I wish You 'd tell me . " " That nice young man saw it all . " " What young man ? " " The hungry young man . And when I went out into the hall he followed me and said very very sweetly , ' Madam , I can only spare a token of one hundred francs , but it is yours . ' " " You did n't take it ? " " Yes  --  I could n't refuse it . He was so polite , and he was gone before I had time to thank him for it . And I changed it and used the francs in the slot machines at the entrance and I 'm sorry I 'm howling like this , but 1 simply ca n't help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so terribly hungry and he 's got a mind above money or he would n't have lent me a hundred francs , and when I 'd won five hundred I looked for him to give him half and he 'd gone . " " You won five hundred ? It 'll pay for our coffee and rolls tomorrow . " " Darling , you are so sordid . Do n't you see that forever after he 'll think that I was one of those old harpies like Bird 's Nest in there ? " " 1 expect he was only making a pass . " " You are so sexual . He was doing nothing of the kind . He 's much too hungry to make a pass . " " They say starvation sharpens the passions . " 9 W E STILL had breakfast at the hotel in order to keep up appearances , but we found ourselves wilting even before the liftman . I have never liked uniforms  --  they remind me that there are those who command and those who are commanded  --  and now I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the bill We always kept our key with us , so that we might never have to go to the desk , and as we had changed all our travelers ' checks on our arrival , we did n't have to approach even the accountant . Cary had found a small bar called the Taxi Bar at the foot of one of the great staircases , and there we invariably ate our invariable lunch and our dinner . It was years before I wanted to eat rolls again and even now I always drink tea instead of coffee . Then , on our third lunchtime , coming out of the bar we ran into the assistant receptionist from the hotel who was passing along the street . He bowed and went by , but I knew that our hour had struck . We sat in the gardens afterwards in the early evening sun and I worked hard on my system , for I felt as though I were working against time . I said to Cary , " Give use a thousand francs . I 've got to check up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " do you realize we 've only got five thousand left . Soon we sha n't have anything even for rolls . " " Thank God for that . I ca n't bear the sight of a roll . " " Then let 's change to ices instead . They do n't cost any more . And , think , we can change our diet , darling . Coffee ices for lunch , strawberry ices for dinner . Darling , I 'm longing for dinner . " " If my system is finished in time , we 'll have steaks . .. . " I took the thousand and went into the cuisine . Paper in hand I watched the table carefully for a quarter of an hour before betting and then quite quietly and steadily I lost , but when I had no more tokens to play my numbers came up in just the right order . I went out again to Cary . I said , " The devil was right . It 's a question of capital . " She said sadly , " You are getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " " You think numbers , you dream numbers . You wake up in the night and say 7. e'ro deux . ' You write on hits of paper at meals . " " Do you call them meals ? " " There are four thousand francs in my bag and they 've got to last us till the Seagull conies . We are n't going to gamble any more . I do n't believe in your system . A week ago you said you could n't beat the bank . " " I had n't studied .... " " That 's what the devil said  --  he 'd studied . You 'll be selling your system soon for a glass of whisky . " She got up and walked back to the hotel and I did n't follow . I thought , a wife ought to believe in her husband to the bitter end and we had n't been married a week ; and then after . a while I began to see her point of view . For the last few days I had n't been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to meet the porter 's eye , and that was exactly what I met as I came into the hotel . He blocked my way and said , " The manager 's compliments , sir , and could you spare him a few moments . In his room . " I thought : they ca n't send her to prison too , only me , and I thought : the Gom , that egotistical bastard on the eighth floor who has let us in for all of this because lie 's too great to remember his promises . He makes the world and then he goes and rests on the seventh day and his creation can go to pot that clay for all he cares . If only for one moment 1 could have had him in my power  --  if he could have depended on my remembering him , but it was as if I was doomed to be an idea of his , he would never be an idea of mine .

" This , I supposed , was the routine  --  just to show there was no ill feeling  --  one has to do one 's duty . I wished lie would come to an end . " Very much , thank you . " " And your wife too ? " " Oh yes . Yes . " He paused , and I thought : now it comes . He said , " By the way , Mr. Bertram , I think this is your first visit ? " " Yes . " " We rather pride ourselves here on our cooking . I do n't think you will find better food in Europe . " " I 'm sure you 're right . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive me if I am , but we have noticed that you do n't seem to care for our restaurant , and we are very anxious that you and your wife should be happy here in Monte Carlo .

I have great confidence in our service here . I came to the conclusion  --  you will forgive me if I 'm intrusive --  " " Yes , oh yes . " " I know that our English clients often have trouble over currency . A little bad luck at the tables can so easily upset their arrangements in these days . " " Yes . I suppose so .

I could n't find the bold frank words I wanted to use . I said , " Well , " and goggled across the desk . There was a portrait of the Prince of Monaco on the wall and a huge ornate inkstand on the desk and I could hear the train going by to Italy . It was like a last look at freedom . The manager said , You realize that the administration of the Casino and of this hotel are most anxious  --  really most anxious  --  you realize we are in a very special position here , Mr. Bertram , we are not perhaps --  " he smiled at his fingernails " quite ordinary hOteliers . We have had clients here whom we have looked after for  --  well , thirty years " ? he was incredibly slow at delivering his sentence . " We like to think of them as friends rather than clients .

Mr. Drcuthcr is a very old client of ours and we should be most distressed if any friend of his failed to enjoy his stay with us . " He stood up , bowed , and presented me with an envelope  --  I felt like a child receiving a good-conduct prize from a bishop . Then he led me to the door and said in a low confidential voice , " Try our Chdteou Gruaud Larose 1984 : you will not be disappointed . " I opened the envelope on the bed and counted the notes . I said , " He 's lent us 250,000 francs . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a friend of the Gom . I wish I liked the bastard . " " How will we ever repay it ? " " The Gom will have to help . He kept us here . " " We 'll spend as little as we can , wo n't we , darling ? " ? " But no more coffee and rolls . Tonight we 'll have a party  --  the wedding party . " I did n't care a damn about the Gruaud Larose 1934 : I hired a car and we drove to a little village in the mountains called Peille . Everything was rocky gray and gorse yellow in the late sun which flowed out between the cold shoulders of the hills where the shadows waited . Mules stood in the street and the car was too large to reach the inn , and in the inn there was only one long table to seat fifty people . We sat alone at it and watched the darkness come , and they gave us their own red wine which was n't very good and fat pigeons roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next room over their drinks , and soon we could hardly see the enormous hump of hills . " Happy ? " " Yes . " She said after awhile , " I wish we were n't going back to Monte Carlo . Could n't we send the car home and stay ? We would n't mind about toothbrushes tonight , and tomorrow we could go  --  shopping , " She said the last word with an upward inflection as though we were at the Ritz and the Rue de la Paix was round the corner . " A toothbrush at Cartier 's , " I said . " Lanvin for two pajama tops . " " Soap at Guerlain . " " A few cheap handkerchiefs in the Rue de Rivoli . ' ' She said , " I ca n't think of anything else we 'd want , can you ? Did you ever come to a place like this with Dirty ? " Dirty was the name she always used for my first wife who had been dark and plump and sexy with Pekinese eyes . " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I LOOKED at my watch . It was nearly ten and there was half an hour 's drive hack . I said , " I suppose we 'd better go . " " It 's not late . " " Well , tonight I want to give my system a real chance . If I use 200 franc tokens I 've got just enough capital . " " You are n't going to the Casino ? " " Of course I am . " " But that 's stealing . " " No it is n't . He gave us the money to enjoy ourselves with . " " Then half of it 's mine . You sha n't gamble with my half . " " Dear , he reasonable . I need the capital . The system needs the capital . When I 've won you shall have the whole lot back with interest . We 'll pay our bills , we 'll come back here if you like for all the rest of our stay . " " You 'll never win . Look at the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An old man with a heard guided us to our car through the dark arched streets : she would n't speak , she would n't even take my arm . I said , " This is our celebration night , darling . Do n't be mean . " " What have I said that 's mean ? " How they defeat us with their silences : one ca n't repeat a silence or throw it back as one can a word . In the same silence we drove home . As we came out over Monaco the city was floodlit , the Museum , the Casino , the Cathedral , the Palace  --  the fireworks went up from the rock . It was the last day of a week of illuminations : I remembered the first day and our quarrel and the three balconies . ? I said , " We 've never seen the Salle Privee . We must go there tonight . " " What 's special about tonight ? " she said . " Le marl doit protection a sa femme , la femme obeissance a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ? " " You told the mayor you agreed to that . There 's another article you agreed to ? ' The wife is obliged to live with her husband and to follow him wherever he judges it right to reside . ' Well , tonight we are damned well going to reside in the Salle Privee . " " I did n't understand what he was saying . " The worst was always over when she consented to argue . " Please , dear , come and see my system win . " " I shalt only see it lose , " she said and she spoke with strict accuracy . At 10:30 exactly I began to play and to lose and I lost steadily . I could n't change tables because this was the only table in the Salle Privee at which one could play with a 200-franc minimum . Cary wanted me to stop when I had lost half of the manager 's loan , but 1 still believed that the moment would come , the tide turn , my figures prove correct . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I indicated the five 200-franc tokens . She got up and left me : I think she was crying , but I could n't follow her without losing my place at the table . And when I came hack to our room in the hotel I was crying too  --  there are occasions when a man can cry without shame . She was awake : I could tell by the way she had dressed herself for bed how coldly she was awaiting me . Shc never wore the bottoms of her pajamas except to show anger or indifference , but when she saw me sitting there on the end of the hed , shaking with the effort to control my tears , her anger went . She said , " Darling , do n't take on so . We 'll manage somehow . " She scrambled out of bed and put her arms round me . " Darling , " she said , " I 've been mean to you . It might happen to anybody . Look , we 'll try the ices . Not the coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sooner or later . " " I do n't mind now if it never comes , " I said . " Do n't be bitter , darling . It happens to everybody , losing . " " But I have n't lost , " 1 said , " I 've won . " She took her arms away . " Won ? " " I 've won five million francs . " " Then why are you crying ? " " I 'm laughing . We arc rich . " " Oh , you beast , " she said , " and I was sorry for you , " and she scrambled back under the bedclothes . To be continued in the December issue GIT ALONG , LITTLE FRACTIONS R EC ENTLY a ten-year-old boy showed me one of his school books . It had the title Range Riders and showed on the cover a cowboy on a galloping horse . The subtitle was Adventures in Numbers ; it was an arithmetic book . The problems involved cowboys , horses , and so on . The traditional image of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped up in front of him , a book representing the hard and tedious lessons which he wants to evade . And inside the textbook he conceals a book of wild west stories , detective stories , or the like , which he is avidly reading . These two books have now been fused into one . I do not know whether this succeeds in making the arithmetic more interesting . But 1 have a suspicion that it makes the cowboys less exciting . ?
