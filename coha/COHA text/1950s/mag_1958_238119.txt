THE FLEET THAT HAD TO DIE ( 212 pp. ) - Richard Hough-Viking ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> After only four months , the Russo-Japanese war was turning into a Russian disaster . Banzai-shouting Japanese troops were pushing the Russians back in Manchuria ; Port Arthur was cut off ; and the proud Russian ships in the harbor were immobilized by the prowling warships of Japan 's Admiral Togo . At that point in June 1904 , Czar Nicholas II decided on a last , desperate gamble to relieve the Russian forces ; he ordered Vice Admiral Zinovi Petrovitch Rozhestvensky to sail four brand-new Suvoroff battleships at the head of a task force of some 40 ships from their Baltic home ports to the Sea of Japan , by way of the Cape of Good Hope . In this book London Editor Richard Hough tells how a fleet that should never have gone to sea made its way 18,000 miles to its rendezvous with death . <P> How to Die . Drawing on captured Russian letters and diaries , naval attaches ' dispatches and newspaper accounts , Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harrowing , heroic account of the battleships ' most trying hours . " You wish us victory , but there will be no victory , " mumbled Captain Bukhvostoff of the battleship Alexander III . " But we will know how to die , and we shall never surrender . " <P> Watching the barely seaworthy fleet , so top-heavy that the lower guns rolled awash in a moderate sea , manned by semi-mutinous sailors and officered by incompetents , a staff officer groaned in despair : " This is simply nothing but a fraud-an infamous fraud . " It would have been , without Admiral Rozhestvensky , a towering , bearded figure who bellowed crews into submission , fired live ammunition at ships slow in answering signals , bullied Hamburg-Amerika colliers into following the fleet to coal at sea . <P> No Excuse . In the end , Rozhestvensky produced a feat of logistics perhaps unequaled until World War II : an unbroken journey of 4,500 miles from Madagascar to the coast of Cochin China , despite 39 stops to repair tow lines , more than 70 engine breakdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two wallowing columns into battle off Tsushima ( literally Donkey 's Ears Island ) . Maneuvering for position , Togo took his column through a perilous column turn and closed with nearly 500 guns blazing . The Russian ships , which had damaged three major enemy ships , failed to score a single hit after the first bloody half-hour . Only one Russian auxiliary cruiser-a converted yacht - and two small 350-ton destroyers made their way through to Vladivostok . <P> Japan could claim the most decisive naval victory since Trafalgar , ruled as a major seapower until her sun set in the flaming air-sea action of Leyte Gulf 40 years later . Admiral Rozhestvensky. saved when his officers carried him wounded and semiconscious from a disabled turret before the Suvoroff sank , had no excuses and offered none . On his way back to St. Petersburg for court martial ( he was acquitted ) and retirement , he said : " No , there was no treason . We just were n't strong enough-and God gave us no luck .
