txt A twenty-man dairy industry committee has told Secretary of Agriculture Benson that dairymen  --  and , for that matter , all farmers  --  would be much lietter off under a policy of flexible Government price supports , and has urged that such a policy be adopted " as soon as possible . " ( Under flexible , or " sliding scale . " supports the " support " level is raised when a commodity is in short supply , thus tending to encourage production ; it is lowered in times of over-supply , with the purpose of encouraging a more conservative attitude on the part of the farmer . ) The dairy industry 's researches have resulted , apparently , in such a strong conviction of the desirability of flexible supports that It has called for the adoption of such a program " at the end of the current marketing year . " It has also urged that the Secretary consult with advisory committees representing ether commodities , and particularly the so-called " basic commodities . " Unfortunately the Secretary is not in a position to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed the Government to support dairy products at 90 per cent of parity until April 1 next year . As for the basic crops  --  corn , cotton , rice , peanuts and tobacco  --  he is required by law to continue 90 per cent price sup-. ports through the 1954-crop year . The policy of maintaining high , fixed supports for crops may be likened , in its economic aspects , to the now discredited and rejected policy of perpetually easy money . High price supports were introduced to meet the purely emergency situation that was produced by the Second World War . The world needed all the food and raw materials we could produce at that time . In order to encourage maximum production it was deemed necessary to assure the farmer a. guaranteed market for his product . That was the purpose of underwriting his output at 90 per cent of " parity , " but it was never contemplated that this arrangement should be perpetuated in time of peace . This is attested by the fact that the wartime supports were to be discontinued two years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the program alive from year to year , and it can not now be terminated until the end of 1954 , or nine years after fighting ceased in the Second World War . So long as high and inflexible supports continue they constitute an invitation to maintain high level production , regardless of market demand , since the producer is assured ( in the case of basic commodities , at least ) 90 per cent of " parity " in any case . The statistical results of this misguided polily are easily available . The Government today has more than $3 billions tied up in food and fiber for which there is no market , and it is estimated that by the middle of next year the figure may have reached $4.5 billions . The news of the attitude of the dairy industry , in the light of this situation , is more than a little encouraging , It is evidence that Mr. Benson is making progress in his campaign of education ; and it confirms a. long-standing conviction of ours that when it Comes to knowing what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is likely-to diagnose his case : better than his " spokesman " in Congress .
