General Motors , which set a new pattern for labor and management five years ago by tying wages to the cost of living , last week modernized the pattern . It agreed to a request by the C.I.O. 's United Auto Workers that the bulk of the cost-of-living increases be incorporated in base pay rates . Thus , of the 24 in cost-of-living increases granted since 1950 , 19 will become a permanent pay increase . <P> Though the G.M.-U.A.W. contract ( renewed in 1950 ) still has two years to run , and the union had no legal means of forcing its reopening , G.M. agreed to do so on the union 's plea that long-term contracts must be " living documents ' ' subject to revision in the light of changing economic conditions . Said G.M. President Harlow Curtice , who wants to keep the comparatively strike-free status G.M. enjoys in the auto industry : " The agreement was a practical solution to problems created by the Korean war with its resulting inflationary impact . . . . " <P> Other major contract changes : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 4 to 5 an hour . <P> Some 40,000 skilled G.M. workers will get an additional raise of 10 an hour . <P> A new and more flexible formula will gear pay to the Government 's new cost-of-living index . Wages will rise a penny for every index increase of .6% , drop a penny for every decline of .68% , compared to a rise or fall of 1 for every 1.14 points in the old index . <P> " Our agreement , " said C.I.O. President Walter Reuther jubilantly , " shows that free labor and free management , exercising their rights and privileges , facing up to their responsibilities and using their common sense , can in our kind of democracy , work out their problems across the bargaining table . " Reuther promptly went after Ford and Chrysler for a similar settlement , plus some extra concessions on pensions and medical benefits .
