As if togetherness , life adjustment and the Organization Man were not enough , the U.S. must also bear up under something called " group dynamics . " Last week in The Clearing House , a magazine for high school teachers , H. A. Jeep and J. W. Hollis of Ball State Teachers College in Muncie , Ind . described how group dynamics worked in a class in mental hygiene and in another class dedicated to " organizing the pupil personnel program . " Teachers ' Teachers Hollis and Jeep thought the results inspiring . <P> With group dynamics , a class need not cover any particular amount of ground , and must not treat the teacher as anything but a " resource person who sparks sharing or supplies material at a psychological time . " " In a modern democratic society , " say Hollis and Jeep , " the emotionally healthy learner seeks more and should seek more for the acceptance of his peers than for the acceptance of the teacher . Teacher approval tends to weaken peer approval . " Students thought up most assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little reading as their individual needs seemed to require . " The whole idea was for students to develop the " we feeling " and to strengthen " such commonalities as the learner must have in order to be an accepted member of his society . " " All were encouraged to speak first and then to think through what they had said . " Among the authors ' other recommendations : Though the teacher must stick around in case he is needed , he " may interfere with group dynamics if he attempts to communicate opinions , attitudes , ideas and so on .

" " As the group develops a strong ' we feeling ' and gains experience in the group process , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader . The ultimate is when the teacher is no longer the leader . " <P> Conclude Jeep and Hollis : " Group dynamics is an energy-consuming , but very rewarding , method for both students and teacher . Soul-searching and deep learning are always energy-consuming.
