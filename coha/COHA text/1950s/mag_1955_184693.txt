For centuries , Jews the world over have experienced the joys and sorrows of their faith through the voice of the cantor . For centuries , cantors have sung such sacred songs as the mournful El Molay Rachamim ( " O , God , full of compassion . . . grant perfect rest unto the souls of our dear ones " ) , or the joyful Kiddush ( " We praise Thee , O God , and thank Thee . . . " ) . Unlike the choirmaster or organist in a Christian church , the cantor ( although not ordained ) holds a semisacred office ; the prayers he sings are an integral part of the service , and he must be trained in Jewish ritual . <P> Every year , the 210 families of Temple Avodah. a Reformed Jewish congregation in Oceanside , L.I. , had managed to hire a professional cantor for Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year ( in 1955 it falls on Sept. 16-18 ) , even if they had to be content with their temple choir on other holy days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cantor and a badly needed new organ. * they decided to buy the organ . But during choir practice recently , temple trustees were struck by a soloist who had not only a rich mezzo-soprano , but a sound knowledge of Hebrew language and ritual . Last week they decided that Mrs. Betty Robbins , an attractive , 31-year-old Massapequa housewife , should be their cantor for Rosh Hashanah . With that decision , they swept away 5,000 years of Jewish tradition . <P> As far as anyone knows , Mrs. Robbins , the wife of a New York City health inspector and the mother of four children , is the first woman cantor in Jewish his tory . An intensive search into Jewish law turned up nothing that could bar her appointment , but the whole weight of Jewish custom was against it . Although women are movingly praised in Jewish scripture , they have always occupied an inferior position in the Jewish religious structure as " ; a nation unto themselves . " Born in Cavalla , Greece , of Russian parents , Mrs. Robbins moved with her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon became the only girl in the all-boy choir at the synagogue there . Although she took no formal music training , she loved to listen to the cantors sing , learned all the principal chants by heart . <P> In the winter of 1939 the German SS set fire to the Danzig synagogue during a service . Young Betty escaped , later fled with her parents to Australia , where she continued her Hebrew studies . There she also met her future husband , then a corporal in the U.S. Medical Corps . <P> " If a woman is capable of doing cantorial work , " says Mrs. Robbins , " she should n't be barred just because she 's a woman . You must be able to understand what and why you 're singing . I sing what is in my heart . My only thought now is to sing as I have never sung before . " <P> <P> * Many Orthodox synagogues allow only the cantor 's singing . But Conservative and Reformed synagogues often add choirs as well as organ music .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
