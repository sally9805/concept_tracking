txt Letters to The Times Science Program Urged Plan Offered for Large - Scale Fundamental Research To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK . TIMES : A reading of the newspapers seems to indicate ' that we have not learned the lessons to be drawn from Soviet advances in satellites , high energy physics , thermonuclear power , etc . Once more a heavy clamor rises for more military expenditure as an answer to the satellite . We should like to point out that the satellite is first and foremost a scientific achievement for all mankind to rejoice over . This is a great positive accomplishment . The military aspect is negative and , we maintain , a minor one . Contrary to Khrushchev 's statement in his recent interview with James Reston , both sides are , and have been during the past five years , in a position to annihilate each other . What is sorely lacking is research ? fundamental research on a vast scale , for it is precisely this which is the " goose that lays the golden egg . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research is six billion dollars . The overwhelming portion of this goes into military applied work or menufe.cturteg de v etopinent . Tue actual amount going into pure research is exceedingly small . What can be done quickly and thoroughly ? ? An enormous increase in the backing of basic scientific research . A Secretary of Science of very high Cabinet rank . He should be a first class scientist and administrator . Special public schools , entrance Only lir- competitive examination , after the junior high school , where the tempo and quality of scientific education are comparable or superior to the German gymnasium . Federal scientific scholarships numbering around 100,000 a year . There should he a sliding scale according to ability to pay . Last , but not least , there exists an overwhelming necessity for several dozen advanced institutes of science . Here , again , money should not be the primary limitation . The budget of each institute should be around $50,000,000 per annum . Failure to carry out a bold program , which . is within our means to achieve , spells abnegation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Utilizing Our Resources To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Our country never seems able to evidence its tremendous power until directly menaced . Pearl Harbor in 1941 is an example of what I mean . It required a day of infamy before we sprang into action . The launching of a satellite into space by Russia , in the judgment of this reader , is many times more dangerous in its implications for the future of our country than ever was Pearl Harbor . First , there is the damage to our prestige , which is not theoretical but real in the effects which our friends throughout the world might feel now , by thinking that they are perhaps backing the wrong horse . Second , a nation that can launch such a satellite could , without much more scientific knowledge and mechanical brainpower , equip such a device with an atomic warhead which could be dropped almost anywhere on the face of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy . If we are to assure our form of society for our descendants , we must throw off the bonds of lethargy and complacency and use without reservation the deep wells of ingenuity and resources that we possess . SYLVAN GOTSIIAL , New York , ? Oct. 7 , 1957 , Freedom Versus Scientific Success To THE EDITOR of THE NEW YORK TIMES : The satellite Sputnik has demonstrated that a country without a Parliament , free press , man 's rights , night clubs and other such luxuries is more powerful than we are and has achieved a technological , strategic and propaganda success of the first order . Prevision : Many defections in Various parts of the world . Now would it not be high time for Americans to realize that freedom is indeed a very pleasant way of life , but that survival is more important than freedom , because if we do n't survive we can not enjoy freedom . Survival conies first . GIUS  --  PPE PREZZOLI NI , Professor Emeritus , Columbia University . New York , Oct. 7 , 1957 . To Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES : To the layman it Seems obvious that the knowledge gained from satellites in the ionosphere must influence the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles . The connection , however tenuous , can not but be alarming to the landlubber , who would naturally like to know more about the way in which the control of the skies might lead to controlling the lands beneath . Furthermore , what will the next phase be if smaller but perhaps less responsible countries are sold weapons of this sort ? The prospects for our children are at present indeed unnerving . However is the United States to insure the freedom of the skies ? Or is that a question that is out of date ? It would be more timely to ask this : how can the United States insure a continent 's integrity unless the United Nations , or at any rate those participating in the International Geophysical Year , arrange a strict control of this newly acquired use of the heavens . ?

The new flower boxes placed by the city on the front steps of the Metropolitan Museum as part of the Mayor 's Salute to Seasons program are not the cause of the green discoloration of the stonework as suggested in your editorial of Oct. 9 . The east wing of the museum was completed , with its present wooden front and bronze lighting stanchions , about 1905 . The discoloration is from these bronze fixtures . The woodwork is repainted yearly and the glass is washed each morning . We all look forward to the time when the city and private funds will make it possible to carry out existing designs for the removal of the steps to simplify the control of the front entrance . Two men clean away litter in the morning and again later in the day . They can not possibly cope with all the wrappers from the chewing gum ? and candy sold by venders , beyond the control of the museum , who are ticketed from time to time by the Police Department . The museum washes the steps each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest effort to police the area . The accumulation of filth in front of the museum results in large part from the fact that the entrance attendants do not permit people to bring lighted cigarettes and foodstuffs ' beyond the front door . ( There are , of course , containers in the vestibule as well as four baskets at the street level . ) A number of smoking rooms are provided in the museum as well as a restaurant , and a new snack-bar will be opened next week for the convenience and necessity of its patrons . I would doubt if a dead pigeon remained on the front steps of the museum for very long . This was probably one of those unfortunate ; creatures that nest beyond the control of the museum in our endless eaves and perhaps was blown down by the strong winds . In Europe  --  Lisbon , Madrid or Paris  --  there are fewer chewing gum wrappers to contend with , longer working hours and an army of workers to maintain what has existed for centuries . Our Commissioners are building for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the constant pick-up job required , as you suggest . Only this week I had occasion to write on behalf of the museum to the city requesting additional help for guarding and maintaining the galleries of the museum , As we pointed out . recently to the Borough President and a group of City Commissionens. we are doing everything* we can with private funds , where they are available , to improve the areas immediately surrounding the building , but we must look to the city for proper maintenance of these areas . Je mu:s J. Roeteme . Director , the Metropolitan Museum of Art . New York . Oct. 9 , 1957 . Secretary Wilson Praised It is gratifying that upon his retirement Charles E. Wilson is being given recognition for his appealing qualities of forthrightness and per- . sonai charm . It is most unfortunate , but , all too often , all the picture we have of our high Government officials comes from carefully scripted and staged public appearances . The dismal result of all this careful planning is a stereotype  --  a very stuffy and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these formidable barriers of . high public office to emerge as a human being . Mr. Wilson will be missed . One can only hope that from his departure others may learn that , whatever the short-range turmoil which may ensue , in the long run the American public and press still appreciate a man .

Risine* Cost of Living To ens EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If a little inflation is a good thing , why is it necessary for me to seek a part-time job to make ' ends meet ? With the cost of living continual . ly rising , still recognized as only " creeping " inflation , I am wondering just where we are headed . My guess , with prices moving ahead at the present rate , is that we are only climbing higher to fall deeper into an economic abyss . It would seem that less money in  - -  the hands of the people and more in the hands of the Federal Government is hurting us . It is beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great for even the comparatively prosperous American people to carry . Expending billions for roads , schools , foreign aid and subsidies are factors that are making inroads in the once stable American stand . and of living . AMERICO NAllARO .
