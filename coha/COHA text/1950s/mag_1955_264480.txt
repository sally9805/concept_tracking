When the priest arrived at Jesuits Bend , * about 15 miles south of New Orleans , he found a delegation of parishioners waiting for him at the mission chapel . " They were very polite , " the Rev. Gerald Lewis , 31 , said later . " They informed me that a Negro could not say Mass for a white congregation . " <P> New Orleans ' 79-year-old Archbishop Joseph Francis Rummel , a famed enemy of segregation ( three years ago he banned Jim Crow benches in New Orleans ' Catholic churches ) , met the issue head-on but gently . Instead of cutting off the congregation from all spiritual ministrations , he merely suspended services at the mission in Jesuits Bend and reduced services at two others at nearby Belle Chasse and Myrtle Grove . In a letter addressed to the congregations , the archbishop said that the incident violated " the obligations of reverence and devotion which Catholics owe to every priest of God . . . <P> " Furthermore , every human being , regardless of race , color or nationality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and destined one day to enjoy the company of the angels and saints in the awesome presence of the All High God ... <P> " Because the shortage of priests is such that we can not replace the reverend father in question , the suspension will stay in force until the members of these communities express their willingness to accept . . . whatever priest or priests we find it possible to send them . " <P> *Probably so named because the Jesuit Order once owned land at a nearby bend in the Mississippi River .
