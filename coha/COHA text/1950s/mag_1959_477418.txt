great Standard Oil Trust , say , or when he had triumphed in a bitter pipeline war . In his prime he knew vicissitudes as rollicking as any political campaign , but most of them were history before his grandchildren were born . He had been dead twenty-one years when Nelson chose to run , so he was n't consulted about it . He was considered , though . Once you have a John D. in your family , you have him always . Even after death he has a way of intruding himself into familial decisions . At Nelson 's campaign kickoff his grandfather 's spirit had been visibly present , in the form of the William Couper bust of him that looks out stonily on the family offices fifty-six floors above Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center . The bust is remarkably real , because John D. had a graven look in life , and the fact that it did n't flinch when Nelson told his brothers he was going to run for Governor is entirely consistent ; in family matters John D. 's tolerance was absolute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electioneer in a beanie and hula hoop , he would have kept quiet . The old dynast was shrewd enough to understand his own singularity , content to let a hundred flowers bloom . THE BAPTIST AND DA VINCI N 1 ELSON 'S political career has blosi soured in his fifty-first year , which was also John D. 's age when he reached the crest of his remarkable powers . Juxtaposed , the two men appear to have Iittle else in common . The titan lived in stark houses because shutters and curtains might cut off sunlight . The Governor adorned the grounds around his Pocantico Hills , N. Y. home with statuary . John D. absolutely refused to deal with anyone who tried to hurry him . His grandson was ticketed for speeding . The old man declined to honor his membership in the New York Stock Exchange by appearing on the floor because he despised the turmoil . Nelson wallows in campaign hubbub and borrows a band leader 's baton to add to the din . His grandfather 's palate was so sensitive that he would not touch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salami , hot dogs , and green taffy . John D. could find edification only in a Baptist pew . Nelson has the tastes of a da Vinci . John D. , the calculating introvert , won his battles by wile and sheer determination . He would endure anything in the interests of victory ( " You can strike me if you will only let me have my own way , " he once told an associate ) and when the struggle was over the vanquished felt they had lost a contest of intellectual will . As one of them put it , " We felt a pressure brought to bear on our minds . " Nelson is the egalitarian extrovert who triumphs by charm and persuasion ? who has , in the words of one defeated candidate in 1958 , " got magic . " The titan believed that a strong man should " get all the money he honestly can " and extend charity to the poor . His grandson is convinced that capital should go where it can do the most good , that it ought to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given , not as alms , but as a matter of right . Two men , then ? John D. in 1889 and Nelson taking the oath of office on his grandmother 's Bible seventy years later ? seem at first glance to be utterly diverse . The perceptive will note , however , that both are instinctive competitors , and that each fits comfortably into his own period . John D. accepted the business cant of nineteenth-century America , and Nelson is as uncritical of current orthodoxy ; he shares its abiding faith in public relations , omnipotent experts , and progress by committee . Times have changed ? as he reminded hecklers during his campaign , when he was chaffed for distributing rolls of pennies by those who remember his grandfather giving dimes . What he did not say is that in changing , the stream of time has described a curious oxbow around the name of Rockefeller . Our own grandfathers would be flabbergasted to see what has become of it . JOHN D. 'S POLITICAL BOSS B 0 S S I SIV1 was the charge Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stick . It occurred to no voter that a Rockefeller might try to use him . Yet in John D. 's day no one would have thought anything else . He was frankly out to alter the American economy , and though he himself remained aloof from corruption , the role unregenerate Bossism played in his success was immense . The top tiger in American politics then was Mark Hanna , who had been his schoolmate at Cleveland 's Central High . From the clay Ilanna organized the Cleveland Business Men 's Marching Club and strode into public life , he was Standard Oil 's faithful crony . In a remarkable letter dressing down a Republican attorney-general who had challenged the Trust in the courts , he once declared that , " There is no greater mistake for a man in or out of public place to make than to assume that he owes any duty to the public . " He added that Standard 's officers had " been most liberal in their contributions to 28 NELSON ROCKEFELLER lecture on how I should treat little Roddy , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very meekly , but it amused me greatly . " A friend who served with him in Washington during the war remembers wistfully remarking that he 'd like to see General Marshall , whom he did n't know . " Marshall ? You 'd like to see Marshall ? " said Nelson , reaching for the phone . He made the call and somehow arranged a meeting with the general , whom he did n't know , either . HIS WINNING WAYS N T H O S E days Nelson was a minor appointee , serving as Roosevelt 's official good neighbor to South America . Nobody in the capital thought of him as a politico yet . Friends and fellow Rockefellers , however , knew him better . They did n't blink when they heard that he was nosing around the capital , picking up odds and ends of legislative information that had no real bearing on his duties ; he had been curious since childhood , when , wondering what went on in manholes , he had eluded his nurse and climbed down one . Nor were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling people and getting his own way . His brother Laurance had witnessed that skill long ago in the easy relationship between Nelson and the crew of the 75-foot schooner on which , as boys , they voyaged into polar regions one summer with Sir Wilfred Grenfell . Fellow Dartmouth students , who remembered Nelson campaigning for class office in corduroy trousers and a casual sweater , had also observed it , and so had the embittered real-estate agent who lost his customers to the young Dartmouth graduate with a new real-estate brokerage license . Nelson had been charged with leasing five million square feet of new Rockefeller Center office space in the pit of the depression ; he achieved it by buying up clients ' leases in other buildings . The agent sued for ten million dollars , but did n't collect . " Wild Bill " Donovan also failed to score when he took a wartime dispute between his agency and Nelson 's to Roosevelt ? even though Roosevelt 's son Jimmy argued Donovan 's case . South Americans explain Nelson 's winning ways as arising from his simpatia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center was pretty much of a going concern by then , and abusiness trip for the Creole Petroleum Corporation took him south of the Rio Grande . He has been there off and on ever since , in various roles ? as a representative of his government , as a landowner , and as an economic Simon Bolivar intent upon introducing modern technology to lands he has found delightful , but backward . His interest in them is more than benign . He wants them to have more of the world 's goods , but he also recognizes that if they are denied them , the ultimate loser may be the United States . He thinks his countrymen are altogether too preoccupied with Europe , and he points to a Defense Department study which concluded that there are only two areas in the world with the potential for modern war ? the Soviet Union and North America phis South America . If Nelson moved into the White House , United States policy would be dedicated to removing the bitterness which lay behind the mauling South Americans recently gave his chief rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington would be marked by much else not conspicuous there now . It would be strongly lcd ? Nelson 's first months in Albany have demonstrated his talent for command . It would be more youthful ? lie himself looks younger than his age and thinks younger than he looks . It would be candid ? asked whether his nomination was a. draft , he told an interviewer , " I 'd like to think I was drafted , but to tell you the truth I never worked so hard for anything as I did for that nomination . " It would effervesce with new ideas , for Nelson is himself a man of quicksilver imagination , who likes imaginative advisers around him . And it would fairly sing with enthusiasm . Presiding over all the young , candid , burbling men would be the greatest advocate of the strenuous life since the last Republican Governor of New York successfully charged Capitol Hill . Nelson 's Republicanism might not he recognizable to T. R. in other ways , but it would be stridently bully . No one who watched Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nomination would have been under any illusions about a draft . Not since T. R. 's son tramped New York 's back roads thirty-five years before had upstate Republicans seen so vigorous a candidate . He covered all of the state 's sixtyships . Naturally enough . that led to his chairmanship of Point Four , but he still was n't satisfied . His policy recommendations kept getting stuck in the machinery of government . Since the engineers were Democratic and he was n't , Nelson concluded that the trouble was with them , and when Eisenhower 's GOP shift came on , he could n't join it fast enough . From the opening kickoff he was one of the most active members of the shift , or Team , as the Republicans were calling it At first he captained a team within the Team . Together with Milton Eisenhower and Arthur S. Flemming he drew up a list of suggestions for overhauling the machine ; one of them proposed that a Department of Health , Education , and Welfare be created , and when it was , Nelson became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special assistant on foreign policy , with duties so broad that a colleague said it made him " an assistant to God . " It gave him no godlike powers . He was still only an assistant , a 515.000-a-year helper who could urge action but not take it . He was close to eminence , however . The vast authority of high office lay just beyond his outstretched hand . He could see its possibilities , and they excited him . Being Nelson , he could scarcely keep his thoughts to himself . In White House policy sessions , and at the Summit in Geneva , he kept up a drumfire of recommendations , propositions , motions to do this , do that . The Team listened . And went back to its game . His three years with Eisenhower were not a complete washout . He did get a new cabinet office established , and his unfailing instinct for drama gave the Administration some of the brightest phrases of its first term : Atoms-forPeace , Open Skies , the Peace Ship , the Aswan Dam Plan . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Furthermore , many of his ideas crept back in the second term and were adopted . His proposal for regional economic authorities was revived , and although his service on a committee to reorganize the Defense Department bore no fruit in 1953 , many of the suggestions in the Rockefeller Brothers report on defense appeared in Neil McElroy 's plan to shake up the Pentagon . Nelson 's record was n't startling , but it was something . Any Washington panjandrum might have shelved his dispatch case with pride . After all , an appointed official can do just so much . Nelson knew that . But he did n't like it , and he did n't accept it . He remembered , not the ideas that caught , but the ones that got away . There were a lot of them , and he knew who hadjiggled the hook . Repeatedly be had gone to the White House flushed with enthusiasm , to be humbled by standpat teammates . Time after time his pet programs had been torpedoed by those constables of thrift known as the 4-H Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the International Cooperation Administration ; Herbert Hoover , Jr. , Under Secretary of State ; and Rowland B. Hughes , director of the Bureau of the Budget . As they saw it , Nelson wanted the federal government to adopt the philanthropic practices of the Rockefeller family . Most of his quarrels with them did involve money ? most quarrels do , in Washington and elsewhere . He wanted an imaginative aid program in Asia and more health , education , and welfare at home , and they were thinking of the taxpayer . THE DO-GOODER BRAND B u T there was another issue . Behind his rebuffs , behind the brutal scoldings he took from young Hoover , was the irreconcilable liberal-conservative conflict of our time . Nelson did n't just want bigger appropriations for other countries ; he proposed that the United States send more economic help abroad and fewer guns . His educational plans were undeniably expensive . But his proposed health reinsurance fund , to spur wider coverage by private insurance firms , was more controversial , because it raised in GOP councils the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , this one went surprisingly far ? it almost reached Congress ? but in a fogyish government it was doomed . Once the AMA had called it bad medicine , it was shot . If the man who had backed it had n't been so rich , he would have been branded a radical crackpot . As it was , he was obviously a do-gooder . Nelson could only plead guilty to that and gracefully retire . In the last days of 1955 he threw in the towel , got the expected " Dear Nelson " letter from the man whose star he had followed to Washington , and moved back to New York . The Democratic engineers , it turned out , had n't been to blame after all . Nor was the machine defective . He had been over it , part by part , and he knew it would work . The trouble was that he had n't been at the controls . Like Arthur Miller 's Willy Loman he had n't been noticed ? he had merely been " there to do work , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , " he concluded , " are taken , in the end , by elected officials . " It was in this frame of mind that he attended
