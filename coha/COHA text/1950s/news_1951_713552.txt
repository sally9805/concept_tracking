txt FRANKFORT , Germany , Jan. 18 ? On the eve of his visit to Germany , Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower has been assailed publicly for having humiliated the Germans and favored the Russians at the end of World War II . It has been honed that his visit will encourage the people of the Federal Republic to support a German contribution to the aefense of Europe . The attack on General Eisenhower , made over the northwest German radio network last night , was followed today by a bitter debate in the Federal Parliament at Bonn , in which Dr. Fritz Schaeffer , Minister of Finance , said flatly that if Allied occupation costs remained high the West must expect German expenditures for defense to remain low . Dr. Carlo Schmid , one of the leaders of the Socialist party in the Bundestag , added the warning that the Western Allies " can not treat us like defeated people and expect us to react as allies . " The atmosphere created by these developments was not encouraging to the success of General Eisenhower 's visit here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will talk with both Dr. Konrad Adenauer , West German Chancellor , and.Dr . Kurt Schumacher , Socialist leader , on Monday evening at the residence of John J. McCloy , United States High Commissioner , in Bad Homburg . It is hoped he will convince the two leaders and the German people during his stay of his confidence in the ability of a united Europe to prevent a Soviet invasion and of the importance of West Germany 's bearing a share in that defense . General Eisenhower 's welcome in the Federal Republic , however , is likely to be much more mixed than it was in countries such as France and Italy , which have far larger Communist parties . The coolness // will zome not only from the Communists , but from nationalist elements , to whom the defeats of 1945 are still fresh . The speech on the northwest German radio network last night is the latest and sharpest example of this attitude . The speech was offered to listeners as a reflection of editorial opinion of the radio network , its officials said . Warning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower and that ? things were turning out differently in Korea than the United States ' " second military hero " expected , the speaker said : " Eisenhower misjudged the Russians . He has a not inconsiderable share of the responsibility for the loss of the peace . On his command , the American and English troops stopped at the Elbe . On his command the Russians were enabled to take Czechoslovakia . " He enjoyed humiliating his German enemies and doing his Russian friends a favor . * * * He treated German generals as representatives of mass murder . At the same time he considered the Russians as friends of humanity . " Now , the speaker continued , General Eisenhower will lay before the Germans " as a duty what he formerly condemned as sin " and it will be difficult for either the Supreme Commander or his German subordinates to be friendly . Since General Eisenhower was named to command the North Atlantic Treaty forces , there has been criticism of him in the German press . The German tendency to demand a lowering of occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which came out into open in the Bundestag today , is as depressing as the criticism of General Eisenhower , to the Western officials seeking cooperation on rearmament . Dr. Schaeffer , speaking for the Government , declared that a long list of items , alleged to have been covered by occupation costs , published in the weekly Echo Der Woche , was " substantially correct . " These included the charge that the occupation costs provided for the pay of 39,000 domestic servants , 66,000 drivers , 39,000 waiters and cooks , 144,000 technical workers , 98,000 office workers and 48,000 other employes . Dr. Schaeffer said the German people would be able to understand the occupation costs better if " they were entirely used for security , " and added his warning that as long as they remained high the German defense expenditure would be small . Dr. Schmid demanded that the Allies cut their swollen administrative agencies , but reminded Parliament that " we lost the war and those who lost must pay . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
