txt What happened to Evelyn Hartley ? That 's the number one puzzler in this Mississippi river town where all shades have been drawn , doors and windows well bolted , and baby sitters are at a premium since the 15 year old daughter of a college professor vanished mysteriously from her baby . sitting job last October 24 . There were signs of a strug ? gle and a bloody trail  --  that led to nowhere . " We have not given up hope , " Evelyn 's parents , Dr. and Mrs. Richard Hartley , told a Tribune reporter today . " We know there 's only a slim chance she 's alive but we have to keep on hoping . " Police Are Baffled Police Chief George Long said , " It 's got us completely baffled . Everywhere we turn we run up against a stone wall . " Chief of Detectives Leo Kihm said , " Somebody pulled a Houdini right in front of all those neighbors . " People in town still ask : " Where is the body ? " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of coulees , creeks , bayous , prairies , bluffs , and ' rivers . Yet not ' a trace of Evelyn Hartley nor the clothes she wore that Saturday night have been found . No prime suspects or a shred of evidence has turned up that can be positively iden ? tified with what folks here call the perfect crime . Fits No Usual Pattern Is Evelyn dead or alive ? Will the spring thaws wash up her body ? Or is she held captive or a victim of amnesia in San Antonio , D e n v e r , or Devils Lake , N. D. , as some have speculated . Was it the work of a burglar or sex criminal ? The Hartley case fits into no familiar pattern . One of the most baffling points in Evelyn Hartley 's disappearance is how the abduction , apparently accompanied by plenty of commotion , window prying and peeping , scuffling , screaming , and banging against neighbors ' houses and garages , could have escaped the attention of all the neighbors , most of whom were home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright moonlight night with street lights and porch lights blazing and nearly a dozen big picture windows overlooking a clear , unobstructed view of the house , yard , and area where the events took place . Almost directly across the street a musician and his wife sat in their picture window their shades not drawn listening to the radio and facing the Rasmusen home where Evelyn Hartley had come to baby sit . Viggo Rasmusen is a physics and physical science teacher on the faculty of La Crosse State college where Dr. Hartley , Evelyn 's father , is a biology professor . Neighbor Washes Dishes Near the Rasmusen home a neighbor woman was washing her supper dishes  --  in front of a big kitchen window that looked directl:js ito the lighted back porch , kitchen , and bedroom of the Rasmusen house , Another neighbor was painting inside his basement as Evelyn Hartley and her abductor staggered past , leaving blood marks all along one side of his house . She is believed to have fallen near one of his basement windows , where another pool of blood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few houses away . And two women sat inside a picture window playing gin rummy as Evelyn Hartley presumably fought for her life only a . few feet away . Nobody saw anything . Several neighbors heard screams for help and dismissed them as the cries of youngsters at play . No one saw or heard Dr. Hartley , either , when he arrived at the Rasmusen home shortly after 9 o'clock a n d knocked on doors and windows and called Evelyn 's name . Eventually he found the open basement window . Girl an Honor Student Evelyn , a junior at La Crosse Central high school , an honor student near the top in her , class and active in numerous school , sports , church and ' youth organizations , had accepted the baby-sitting job a week in advance she was not a substitute sitter as was reported earlier so the Rasmusens could attend the col- ' lege homecoming f oot b all game . When she did not tele.

When there was no answer this time , he drove out to the house , found it locked but lighted with the radio on , and entered thru the open basement window . A small kitchen type stepladder was directly beneath the window inside the basement . One of Evelyn 's shoes was found on the basement floor at the bottom of the steps . The other shoe and her glasses were found on the living room floor upstairs . Mud Tracks on Rug There were a few mud 1tracks on the rug . Otherwise ' ' the house and basement were exactly as the Rasmusens left them  --  no mussed pillows , no tdrawers opened , no blood stains , no signs of a violent struggle inside , and not even a trace of snagged clothing , lost buttons , or anything else to prove positively that the intruder even entered by the tiny basement window , except I screwdriver pry marks which Wisconsin Mystery Evelyn Hartley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 24 . Evelyn 's parents , Dr. and Mrs. Richard Hartley , and her sister , Carolyn . Parents still have hope that she is alive . also were found on three other windows , and a screen removable from either outside or inside lying on the grass near a pool of blood . The screen was removed from the basement window nearest the front of the house but was found only a few inches from the last basement window toward the back of the house . Police theorize that Evelyn ran out the front door around the house and that the man snatched up the window screen and used it as a weapon when he caught up with her again . Their circuitous trail of bloodstains and foot prints around neighbors ' garages , houses , and back yards covered a distance of approximately a city block and police estimate it took at least five to 10 minutes for them to get to a waiting car . Evelyn 's screams were heard at 7:15 and police have established the time of the abduction as somewhere between 7 and 7:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the baby to bed at 7 and cover her in about 15 minutes after that .

Searching parties , plane s , bloodhounds , patrol beats , hunters and fishermen have searched the countryside and found only one clew  --  a badly worn pair of tennis shoes that match the footprints of the abduction suspect . Left Light Burning For weeks the Hartleys left a porch light burning a 1 1 night , thinking Evelyn might come home . Still clinging to a dim ray of hope that she might be alive , they said , " Please tell people again what she looks like-5 foot 6 , dark hair , blue eyes , very pretty and she was such a good girl , " That 's what everyone else in town thinks , too , as the search for Evelyn Hartley goes into its third month with nothing so far but dead-end clues .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
