To President Sukarno 's white-pillared presidential palace at Djakarta , Java came report after report of revolt and separatist movements , from the northern tip of Sumatra on the Indian Ocean to Borneo , the Celebes and Amboina , some 3,000 miles away in the Banda Sea . There was a new outbreak in South Sumatra . It is largely the reputation of Sukarno that holds the sprawling Republic of Indonesia together , but what threatened to sever it last week was a recent decision by Sukarno himself : to include Indonesia 's Communists in his government . <P> Ironically enough , it was the Communists themselves who seemed about to destroy any chance they may have had for inclusion in the government . All week long Red agitprop specialists spattered Djakarta 's buildings with red-paint slogans supporting Sukarno 's proposal . Across the city 's swill-strewn byways and broad , palm-lined boulevards diligent Communist cadres hung hortatory banners . The Red campaign was the most impressive show of organized political strength Indonesians had seen in years , and to many Indonesian politicians it was also the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was respected , soft-voiced Mohammed Hatta , himself a Sumatran , who resigned as Vice President in December largely because of his chief 's overt flirtation with the Communists . <P> Djakarta 's press , disliking Sukarno 's plan but hesitant to criticize him , kept silent until Hatta spoke out against Sukarno 's proposal to set up a " guided democracy " with all parties represented . " Oil and water , " Hatta snapped , " do n't mix . " Hatta had a sane and solid answer to Sukarno 's oft-repeated plea that " we can not ignore the 6,000,000 people who voted for the Communist Party . " Said Hatta : " Leave them in the opposition . ' ' Encouraged by Hatta 's stand . Djakarta newspapers took up the cry . <P> There was a further shock in store for Sukarno , who hitherto has enjoyed almost complete freedom from criticism . Though many army officers have participated in separatist revolts in East Indonesia and Sumatra ( TIME . Dec. 31 ) , Army Chief of Staff General Abdul Haris Nasution has been unswervingly loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private session with the President . Good Soldier Nasution told Sukarno flatly that taking Communists into the government could well lead to all-out civil war . A high-ranking Moslem politician was still more forthright . " If the Communists come in , " he said , " we will take to the hills . " <P> Promising Retreat . Sukarno finally backed down . He still insisted on including the Communists in a National Council which , as originally proposed , would have had veto powers over Cabinet decisions as well as acts of the Indonesian Parliament . But now , he said , the council 's role would be advisory only . <P> Later , in a talk with a Western visitor , Sukarno revealed the naivete that from the beginning has marked his dealings with the Communists . " You talk of wanting independence from foreign intervention , " said the visitor , " but the Communist Party is not a national Indonesian party-it represents a foreign power . " The President flushed in anger , clenched his fist and replied : " If I learn and can prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , I will crush them . "
