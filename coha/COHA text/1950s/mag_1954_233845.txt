" Then , after finishing his first Christmas Message to the American people , the President went to his backyard and turned on the thousand lights of the nation 's Christmas tree , a 35-ft .

" You may take a picture of a golfer if you like , " brother David announced , and was promptly shushed by Grandpa ( see cut ) .
