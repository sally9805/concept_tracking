ANYONE WHO HAS spent his life in a small Southern town can remember a soft summer evening when the day 's work and worry were temporarily stilled and in that moment just between twilight and darkness the soothing music from a Negro church on the fringes of town floated effortlessly across all the . visible and invisible barriers , pleading : " Just a closer walk with Thee ? " Many who still live in the Southern towns but have not forgotten , the message are discovering that it is not always effortless or peaceful to find a closer walk with their consciences , their Christianity or their citizenship . But there are those who keep walking  --  taking the decisive first steps , the cumulative long strides . Those who live outside the South and register only despair over its dilemma should find a measure of wonder and joy in the enormous courage these everyday citizens are displaying every day . Their fortitude is doubly admirable in a region which stresses sociability and where their adversaries are not foreign invaders but next-door neighbors beside whom they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a one is the minister in Clinton , Tennessee , who recently gave new meaning to the words of that old spiritual . As one townsman said , " When we all got up here that Tuesday morning , we had two big questions nobody was very anxious to face , much less answer : what about the Negro kids who had stayed out of high school since the Wednesday before because they 'd taken WILMA DYKEMAN is the pen name of Mrs. James Stokely ; she is the author of The French Broad , one of the Rivers of America series . JAMES STOKELY , whose family has lived in Eastern Tennessee for generations , is a farmer and a poet . r- , 1 ' ) rrp , r , : about all the petty torment they could ? And what about the city election we were holding that day , with the Wilite Citizens ' Council in its first test of strength ? By that night , those questions were on the way to being answered , or at least a lot better clarified in our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LATE IN November a stalemate had been reached in the desegregation situation at Clinton High School . A small gang , estimated by teachers at between forty and fifty out of the more , than 700 white students in school , had concentrated on making life unbearable for the dozen Negro pupils . Some of the gang had been out of school since early autumn and had apparently returned only for the purposes of the recently organized White Youth Council . As the school faculty pointed out in a joint statement : " The activities of this small group in our school have been of a vicious nature , obviously prompted by a mature person . " But by the last Wednesday of November they had achieved part of their goal  --  the Negro children were staying away from school . " We 'd had all we could bear , " one Negro mother said . " We wanted some assurance our children would n't be harmed before we let them walk into that school again . " Principal D. J. Brittain , Jr . gave the Negro youngsters the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the school board said it could not make the guarantee the Negro parents wanted . Local police seemed ineffective and federal authorities made no public move to meet the crisis . The Negro children were out of school and the White Citizens ' Council members were triumphant . Then , on Monday , December 3 , the Reverend Paul W. Turner sent word to the Negro children that if they wanted to return to school he would come and walk with them . The next morning the thirty-threeyear-old minister walked past the big solid First Baptist Church where he has preached for eight years , down the main street decorated with lights and garlands and good-will greetings for the Christmas season , around the corner at the old brick courthouse where segregationist-agitator John Kasper had only recently been acquitted in his second trial for inciting to riot , and down the street to the high school which serves both Clinton and surrounding Anderson County . A block beyond the school building a steep hill rises . The Rev. Turner now had two fellow townsmen walking with him : Sidney Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about halfway up the hill . There they were met by six Negro boys and girls . The little group went down the hill , past a huddle of perhaps fifty jeering white people , and the children went safely into the school . Davis and Burnett went back about their day 's business , and Turner started for his church . Some of the gang outside the school followed him . A block away a half-dozen of them closed in . In the broad daylight of an unseasonably warm winter morning , on a downtown sidewalk in front of a small , well-occupied office building , the minister of the town 's largest church was beaten up . Before the police arrived his blood had splattered the car near which he stood and stained the sidewalk . NEWS of the attack blazed through Clinton like a leaf-fire . There were two immediate results . School was closed ( a teacher had also been shoved around by two non-students who had entered the building during the morning and asked where they could find one of the Negroes ) . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during 531 the afternoon as is usual in small-town elections , there was actually a waiting line at times . The man and the event and the moment had met with rare fortuitousness that morning . Trying to discover what happens when a man takes the right step at the right time , we talked with some of the people here . " Remember , we 're not called the Bible belt without reason . Turner was n't just anyone getting mauled . He was a symbol , too . What happened , happened to us all  --  and it waked us up . " " Somebody had to do it . And it was n't going to be my husband and it was n't going to be any of the others that have businesses here in town . Most of us had shaken our heads over the Citizens ' Council and what it stood for , but we 'd gone right ahead pussy-footing and passing-thebuck . Paul Turner stuck his neck out for all of us . " " We do n't think niggers ought to be mixed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing is that people here was raised to associate with niggers in their place . I ai n't got nothing against them but they do n't have no right to associate 100 per cent with white folks . We want them to have an education , it would be sure bad enough to have them running around like a bunch of heathens . " " They 's a lot of white folks around here in league with that NAACP . White niggers is worse than black . " " The Communist Jews are behind it all . Frankfurter and Baruch and all them . They want an exuse to get things all tore up . " " You might call Paul the catalytic agent we needed to bring this whole thing into the open . The whole White Citizens ' Council ticket for mayor and aldermen was defeated four to one . People who 'd been afraid to speak up before spoke out with their ballots . " THESE men in their small-town offices and stores , these women in their neat yards and living rooms , these casual conversationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important step a citizen of a democracy can take 532 is that short walk to the voting booth . We went to see Paul Turner . His modest red brick house was filled with the buoyant sound of two small children , three years and eighteen months , and the pungent odor of dinner cooking in his wife , Jane 's , kitchen . Six-feet , blue-eyed , friendly and relaxed , he did not talk glibly nor heroically about what had happened . " Back in the fall when the first violence came , I did n't see what I could do to be effective except through my pulpit . The community did n't realize what was happening . We were all caught off guard . Action at the state level was the only answer . But this time we knew better what was going on . The hour had come when someone had to make a move or these people would win the day . Someone had to step out  --  and I guess I was elected . As things developed during the week and the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what I could do . First , of course , I could preach to my congregation about it on Sunday . Then on Monday I could act . And that 's what I did . " " Was your congregation behind you ? " " A minister and his congregation have to move together . Mr. Davis , one of the men who went with me , is the chairman of my Board of 4 Deacons . The superintendent of our Sunday School and his wife came down here and slept at our house the night after this happened . If I walked back up the hill now I think I 'd have a good crowd with me . " He smiles a slow , broad smile . " Why did they beat you and not the other two who were with you ? " " I 'm not sure . Maybe they thought the other men might have pistols , " he grins again . " They know a minister would n't be armed  --  at least with firearms . " We asked a young lawyer in town about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sid Davis is an attorney here in Clinton . He was on his way over to Knoxville that morning when he heard his minister was going to go bring the Negro children back to school . Sid is absolutely fearless . Maybe foolhardy . But he just went over and told Turner he 'd go along . As for Leo Burnett , he 's , an accountant down here at the hosiery mill , not a member of Turner 's church . But he got an idea of what this was all about before most of the rest of us . He was one of those John Kasper talked with when he first came down from Washington to stir up trouble back in August . Leo was out mowing his yard and this stranger came up and asked him if he believed in integration . Leo said no . Then Kasper went on to tell him about the tyranny of the Supreme Court , that it was like it was back in the days of England against the colonies . Leo told Kasper he might be against integration but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for Kasper to get out of his yard . " MANY OF the complexities of the Clinton situation are involved in that encounter . Chief among them is the dilemma of the great immobilized group , not only in Clinton but throughout the South , which does not want integration but does want to abide by the law . Faced on one hand with the immovable object of federal law , and on the other with the apparently irresistible force of elements which are always ready to resort to violence , they have been caught in a vacuum , without leaderThe Yri  --  r nv ship and perhaps without precedent . Probably 90 percent of the people of Clinton prefer segregation in the schools . Yet the overwhelming majority of their children accepted the Negro students into their midst with good will : they elected one Negro girl vice president of her class and when the school was closed the Student Council passed a resolution asking that classes be resumed as soon as possible and on an integrated basis . The parents themselves rejected the segregationist organization at the polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not perfection but a process working on the premise of perfectibility , it may not be premature to say that the unfolding story of Clinton reveals cause for quiet optimism . " I used to think of myself as a segregationist , " one man confides . " Now I 'm not so sure . It 's come to more than a matter of labels here , anyway . Whatever else I may or may not think I am , I know I 'm for law and order . " Another man says : " A little while ago everybody around here started everything they said with , ' Now I 'm not for integration , understand , but I do n't like what these folks are doing ? . ' Now there 's none of that prefacing ' and  --  but ' business . We just say , ' I 'm against that crowd . ' " It seems clear that here , in the showdown , the organized segregationist movement has demonstrated the extremity of violence to which it will resort . The White Citizens ' Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have found here that it is hard to be a little bit lawless . In a region which has always flaunted an individualistic attitude toward the law , it must be a thoughtless man or group indeed who sanctions disregard for the nation 's highest tribunal . AS FEDERAL authorities arrested sixteen of the alleged ringleaders among the troublemakers , Deep South segregationists realized that successful integration at Clinton would threaten their whole program and they launched a clever campaign of sympathy for " Clinton 's citizens . " Some of the newspapers pointed out December 22 , 1956 that integration can not be enforced if " the citizens " do n't want it ; Seaboard Citizens ' Council leader John Kasper said in Washington that segregationists will spill their blood before bowing " to a creeping federal dictatorship " ; a well-known Georgia attorney accused the Tennessee federal judge of " establishing a government of fear , rather than law " ; " Ace " Carter of the North Alabama White Citizens ' Council protested to Attorney General Brownell that in Clinton " Christian , God-fearing men , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Griffin of Georgia sent a personal check contributing to a legal fund for the " oppressed citizens " of Clinton . These self-appointed spokesmen can not afford to admit that they have already been repudiated four-to-one by this citizenry . In fact , the people of Clinton have learned at first-hand that the high-flown language of nullification is kissing-kin to the brutal fist that smashes into a minister 's face because he protects law-abiding children . If outside agitators will leave Clinton to work out its own problems , if the Deep South will permit the border South this boon it is always demanding for itself from the North , the story of this town may well become one of the meaningful episodes in our national history . As school principal D. J. Brittain , Jr . said a few days ago : " We 're not fighting these people for Clinton or Anderson county . We 're fighting for the entire South . " And if the struggle at Clinton is resolved in justice , no man will deserve higher honor from his town , his county , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bespectacled , almost frail in appearance , this man has withstood with iron determination , for better than three months , the daily onslaughts of those who would wreck his school . The student body as a whole has supported its principal with rare devotion and steadfastness . Tired and disillusioned by some of the citizenry he feels has failed to step out and support him when he often seemed to stand alone , Principal Brittain hopes that with federal intervention in bringing the troublemakers to account his school may have a chance to do its job : educate all the children of its community without fear or favor . There are others who have shared his hope and worked to make it real , too : editor Horace Wells , who has used his weekly newspaper to prick the consciences of Clinton and defy the rabble-rousers ; young lawyer Buford Lewallen who , with attorney Leo Grant , Jr . from nearby Oak Ridge , led in forming the Home Guard when violence erupted at the opening of school , and who has since been attacked both verbally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Principal Brittain and all the teachers  --  they 've been fine to the children , " one Negro woman says . Or one of the Negro girls who walked to school December 4 : " Rev. Turner was wonderful . When we came down the hill and saw some people waiting there outside the school he just kept saying to us , Do n't be afraid . Do n't be afraid . I wo n't let them hurt you . ' " The girl 's mother listens with tears brimming in her wide brown eyes . " He knows courage all right . But I think he must have had something else too . Mr. Turner must know love . " This time of decision in the South may force America to abandon the romantic fiction that all her heroes walk in twenty-league boots with never a misstep . Those who are leading the way to law and order in Clinton wear ordinary human shoes ? and sometimes falter . But if , during the coming months , they win their struggle , we may all be brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass-roots democracy . " On December 10 Clinton High School reopened . The Negro students were once more in their seats ; the hoodlums were gone and peace reigned . What was it the teacher of Paul Turner 's conscience said ? " Suffer the little children , of whatever color , to come unto me , and forbid them not ; for of such are the kingdom of God . " 533
