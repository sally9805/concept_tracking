txt Ever since the beginning , a Senator of the United States has had the right to talk until  --  is lungs , or his feet , give nilt And ever since we can remember , anyway , there has been a great political uproar about this Senatorial rule . There 's going to be a particularly loud roar next month , and from the looks of things at the moment the Senators are going to end up with gags in their mouths . Or at least the rule is likely to be changed so that some Senators can more easily shut up other Senators When they grew weary of listening . The arguments for doing this are the familiar ones . The right to filibuster  --  a nice word , that --  -- -is held by some to be a heinous privilege , granting to little groups of willful men a means of thwarting the will of the Senate , of the Congress and the public at large . We are supposed to understand that time and time again the filibuster has blocked the road for essential legislation demanded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate will be able to legislate all 4nanner of good laws for us . Well , we 've heard a good bit of nonsense spoken in the course of a filibuster ; some of Huey Long 's famed recipes were n't even good recipes . But not nearly so much , we think , as the nonsense spoken about the Senate 's rule of unlimited debate . This right of unlimited debate , we suppose , is not one of the absolute bulwarks of political freedom . There are many free , parliamentary countries in which it does not exist , and if it disappears here the loss will surely not be mortal . But if the defenders of this rule have sometimes exaggerated its virtues , this is nothing to the exaggeration of those who have tried to make its abolition a great and momentous issue . There has never been a time  --  not once  --  when this right of unlimited debate has prevented the Senate from ultimately taking any action which the majority of Senators were bound and determined to take . It has , without doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , served as a cloak to permit some Senators to publicly ask for such-and-such an action and then to blame the lack of action on a filibuster . This is not the same-thing as being an impenetrable obstacle . It can not be that .. Even a number of Senators can not really " talk a bill to death " for the simple reason that men 's capacities to talk are physically limited and the other Senators can always listen them to death . Indeed , whenever the Senate has truly wanted to override a filibuster , this is exactly what it has done . The truth of the matter , we think , is that both the virtues and the vices of unlimited debate are summed up in the simple word " delay . " The Senate 's rule can delay action which the majority thinks desirable ; but even this is not absolute for two-thirds of the Senators , even now , can silence the - other third . It can not prevent even bad legislation if the majority are determined to have it ; there is no sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large majority . Yet we still think the one thing it can offer is something worth preserving . It can require our legislators to stop , reflect and reconsider what it is they plan to do . This is a very valuable thing which in a democracy is hard to come by through other means than by rules which deliberately permit a few men to stand up and say " Wait . " Only a few years ago a President wanted to draft union members into the army to break a strike . In the House , where the momentary anger of the country against the strikers was keenly felt , the President 's plan passed within the hour . But in the Senate one man could , and did , demand a delay for second thoughts . And there are few now who would say that Senator Taft did not save the country from a very terrible action . This right to dampen hasty action is a virtue we ought not to throw away carelessly or diminish out of an impatience with rules that sometimes put a brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , or in the heat of what angry issue , he too may be grateful that a single Senator can stand up alone and have his unsilenced say .
