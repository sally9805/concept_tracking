" You ca n't pick up the phone that you do n't get an application for a World Series ticket , " a Philadelphia Phillies baseball official said . " Why , I 've been hearing from people I have n't seen in years . " Nevertheless , the Phillies announced last week that Series tickets would not be sold until Commissioner A. B. ( " Happy " ) Chandler gave his O.K. But while the pennant was still up for grabs , the Phillies ' 5-game lead early this week made them clearly the team to beat . <P> Thanks mainly to bonus Pitchers Curt Simmons ( 15-7 ) and Robin Roberts ( 16-5 ) , as well as spectacular relief pitching by Jim Konstanty ( 10-4 ) , the Phillies have pushed ahead of their early season promise , when shrewd , hustling Manager Eddie Sawyer was insisting they were just a good bet for third ( TIME , May 29 ) . <P> Bunched back of the Phillies were the Brooklyn Dodgers , who started off like runaways and then , with mediocre pitching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braves , supported by outstanding pitching from Warren Spahn , Johnny Sain and Vern Bickford ; the St. Louis Cardinals , held down by too many batting slumps ; the New York Giants , who had surprised everybody by winning 17 out of 18 games , then abruptly dropped three out of four to the Dodgers last week. * <P> In the American League , Red Rolfe 's Detroit Tigers had kept ahead of the field for most of the season ( their lead early this week : 3 games ) , thanks to the hurling of Dizzy Trout , Fred Hutchinson , Ted Gray and Art Houtteman and the recovery of Hal Newhouser , who was not able to start a game until mid-May . <P> Piled up behind the Tigers were the Yankees , with Joe DiMaggio back in the line-up ( see above ) , and Lou Boudreau 's rebuilt Cleveland Indians , spurred on by such rookie sluggers as Third Baseman Al Rosen ( 33 homers ) and First Baseman Luke Easter ( 21 homers ) , as well as Centerfielder Larry Doby ( nine homers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the Boston Red Sox . <P> Since July 12 , the Red Sox have been minus Ted Williams , out with an elbow injury . One day last week , Ted rapped a practice ball over the fence at Fenway Park . Said he : " It felt wonderful . " But it would probably take more than the return of Ted Williams to catch the Tigers . <P> <P> *Said Dodger Manager Burt Shotton : " Well , I guess that disposes of the Giants . I do n't think we 'll hear much more about them passing us this year . " Retorted Giant Manager Leo Durocher , when he heard about it : " So the Dodgers have disposed of the Giants ? Nuts to kindly old Burt . Just remind that silver-haired gentleman that we still have eight games to play with the Dodgers. "
