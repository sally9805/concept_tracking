Why some unions are honest and others arc always tainted ? no matter who runs them ... and why many businessmen are eager for types like Hoffa to " stop cutthroat competition . " 0NAN eminence near the Capitol in Washington squats a marble , glass , and aluminum structure designed in Miami Beach modern . This is the headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , Chauffeurs , Warehousemen and Helpers of America . In union circles , it is known as the Taj Mahal . Inside its third-floor executive suite , wall-to-wall carpeting lightens the burdens of heavy-footed executives . An enormous inlaid mahogany table on the ground floor is said to be larger than that of any corporation board in the world . On the second floor is an intricate , partly automated filing system , a marvel of technology if not of efficiency . ( Headquarters does n't know who among its 1,600,000 dues-payers are in good standing and who are not . ) This triumph of accounting is the outgrowth of a " visible file " system that Nathan W. Sheffer-man designed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and union buster , was a creation of Sears , Roebuck ( for which the company has since publicly apologized ) . For his filing system and other like services , he collected $61,000 from the Teamsters , less $24,500 which he paid back to his friend Dave Beck , then president of the Union . In the words of a Teamster board resolution , the headquarters is " a fitting monument to a great organization . " Indeed it is . The Teamsters ' tradition is as old as the Republic , andfrom the start it has been remarkable for two things : ( 1 ) It has been pock-marked with crime and violence ? extortion , arson , bombings , beatings , and an occasional murder . The first cartmen 's group , which was licensed in New York in George Washington 's day , had their licenses revoked in 1797 for charging extortionate fees . John R. Commons , the great labor historian , observed that it was not until 1903 that the teaming industry in Chicago could be studied as an economic rather than a criminal phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimist . For Al Capone 's Prohibition mobsters in the ' twenties shot their way into a score of Chicago Teamster locals and even murdered a union international vice president . And as recently as 1950-51 , two Teamster officials were murdered and three were brutally assaulted . ( 2 ) Also , from the start , the Teamsters have been more like a trade association of employers than a trade union of workers . They have been more concerned with setting rates and keeping outsiders from entering the industry than with bargaining for wages . At the turn of this century , Samuel Gompers and others in the young American Federation of Labor looked askance at the roughneck team drivers who were hardly fit associates for a craft elite . However , John B. Lennon , the AFL Secretary-Treasurer , commented : " There is no industry today that can successfully carry on their business if the Teamster lays down his reins . " So the Federation held its nose and in 1899 , issued a charter to the Team Drivers International Union . Almost at once the TDIU was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chartering of a successor four years later . The 71 new International Brotherhood of Teamsters , with 32,000 members , chose Cornelius Shea as its first president . Shea managed to defeat a conspiracy indictment , brush off charges of corruption , and even to win Gompers ' personal blessing . But in 1907 , another Boston Irishman , Daniel J. Tobin , defeated him for the union 's presidency . Tobin ruled in name if not in fact for an unbroken forty-five years . BULLY BOY AND FRIEND OF F. D. R. 0 R the next quarter-century , Tobin pre-1 sided over a trifling organization of local baronies , whose leaders guaranteed his perpetual re-election in return for a hands-off policy . Although membership ballooned in World War I , by the depression year of 1933 the rolls had shrunk to 75,000 . Tobin was nevertheless a bully boy in the AFL 's executive council . An immigrant from County Clare , he could make grand-sounding speeches about keeping aliens out of the United States ; the evils of jazz , whiskey , and college professors ; the " Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the ranks of the unskilled . He became a big man around Democratic headquarters and headed the labor division of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's election campaigns four times . Tobin never could understand why the President did n't make him Secretary of Labor . His ultimate doom was foreshadowed in Minneapolis in the early ' thirties . There , a band of Trotskyites ? Farrell Dobbs and the Dunne brothers , Vincent , Miles , and Grant ? established a beachhead in Local 574 . They originated a blueprint that is now transforming the Teamsters into a truly national union . Against Tobin 's bitter opposition , they began organizing the " over-die-road " drivers and the warehousemen in storage depots . Again over Tobin 's opposition , Local 574 spread its jurisdictional net to take in all kinds of unorganized workers regardless of their trade . They did this through Teamster warehousemen who refused to unload deliveries unless the goods were union-made and union-delivered . Bitter strikes , another technique disliked by Tobin , backed up the organizing drives . Trucks were now beginning to carve out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobbs-Dunnes team hit on the perfect organizational form to tap the new potential membership . " hey created a District Drivers Council linking together Teamster locals throughout the Northwest . Thiswas the godfather to the union 's four present area conferences . On the Pacific Coast , Dave Beck watched all this with admiration . So did an up-and-coming Teamster in Detroit named Hoffa . To Tobin 's dismay , Beck signed the union 's very first area-wide contract fur the Northwest in 1936 ; in 1937 , he created the eleven-state Western Conference . Tobin thought he could get along with the pushy Beck , but Reds inflamed his patriot soul . So he turned to his friend , President Roosevelt . At Tobin 's urging in 1941 , the Administration indicted the Minneapolis Trotskyites under the year-old Smith Act and a Sedition Act of 1861 . In quick order , eighteen of the Minneapolis group ? bitterly fought by the Communists in the labor movement ? were convicted . Beck , also a patriot , sent in hundreds of huskies to subdue The misguided rank and file , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new pattern of organization and contract negotiation suited the larger employers who disliked small , cutthroat firms and it raised workers ' wages , too . Tobin rode a tide that lifted his organization to 1,120,000 by 1952 . But he had long since become obsolete . That year , Beck shouldered him aside with the aid of a decisive block of votes from the new Midwest power , Hoffa . As president-emeritus , Tobin was consoled with two lavish union-built homes ; a $50,000-a-year salary ; union-paid vacations anywhere in ' the world ; a Cadillac limousine ; union-paid chauffeur and maid ; and a union-lawyer 's job for his son , Fred , THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN 'S BEST FRIEND T H E new president , Dave Beck of Seattle , had hustled from an early age . In his teens , he worked alongside his mother in a laundry ten to twelve hours a day . He went " outside " to drive a truck on a laundry route and by 1925 , at the age of thirty-one , was taking in the then sizable sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make Beck manager of a string of laundries . But Beck had also been spotted as a corner by Tobin , who offered him an organizer 's job . Beck , agonizing over the decision , finally took Tobin 's offer , He did n't forget his business training , however , some of which he picked up in night-school courses . Acting on the theory that success lay in working for rather than against business , he began wiping out price and wage competition in . Seattle laundries and also kept the market closed against new gas stations . Later , when a price war broke out among California brewers , he announced , " We are going to those breweries that are cutting prices and tell them we wo n't let our men work for them . " In brief , Beck was doing for small business what it ca n't do for itself ? eliminating price competition and insulating a market . Backward employers were taught about the Teamsters ' local power by way of arson , dynamite , rammed taxis , and overturned trucks . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aberdeen Assassin , ' ' was hired to instruct Beck 's staff in the manly art . But Beck 's big break came with the San Francisco general strike of 1934 . The radical young labor leader , Harry Bridges , after wresting the West Coast longshoremen from the feeble and corrupt hands of Joe Ryan and his International Longshoremen 's Association , announced he was moving inland . This prospect frightened the capital gains out of every West Coast businessman . As a Washington Post reporter observed in 1937 , employers " literally rushed to sign up with the Teamsters and other AFL unions . " The fleshy Beck , in particular , became the employers ' barricade in this strange version of the class war . The number of Beck 's dues-payers increased as employers saw the logic of his warning : " If you do n't take me , you 'll get Bridges . " The Seattle Chamber of Commerce respectfully sought Beck 's advice . The president of a big utility company purred , " Beck is a top labor statesman . He 's absolutely tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been hell . " HOW TO LOOK SORT OF RESPECTABLE B U T Beck was a driven man . Being a wheel in the labor whirl was not enough . He had a craving for respectability ? and that meant winning the esteem of the people that mattered , prominent businessmen . Getting rich was one way of winning prestige and Teamster treasuries were there for the plucking . Beck sold real estate to the union for a profit ; invested union money in mortgages and collected commissions for both buying and selling the mortgages ; sold toy trucks and furniture to Teamster locals ; and bought $94,000 worth of nylons , shirts , outboard motor boats , Sulka ties , furnishings , a gravy boat , imported binoculars , and the like through Sheffcrman . Sheffer-man of course , was repaid to the extent of S85,000 with Teamster dues . In time , the union was to build Beck , for over $160,000 , a lavish Seattle lake-front mansion . But this was n't enough . Beck had to prove himself to his new friends . So , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and elsewhere , he broke strikes by supplying strike-breakers . " For every enemy I make in the labor movement , " he said , " I make a hundred new friends in the Chamber of Commerce . " As for strikebreaking , those are " instances of the clearer heads of labor making concrete contributions to the cause of free enterprise . " Seattle 's thankful businessmen made him a grand exalted ruler in the Elks , a figure in the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars , chairman of Seattle 's civil-service commission and Seattle 's boxing commissioner . He was appointed to the State of Washington 's Prison Terms and Parole Board ; several times he served as regent on the University of Washington 's board and one year was its president . His new friends applauded when regent Beck voted to throw out half-a-dozen professors who invoked the Fifth Amendment rather than disclose their erstwhile left-wing politics . In 1948 , he prevented Tobin from giving Teamster endorsement to Harry Truman , and in 1956 he gave candidate Eisenhower the Teamsters ' blessing . Beck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House just before the 1956 election and came away with a promise , subsequently honored , that the Small Business Administration would relax its rules to make loans easier for truckers . He was one of the few union leaders to enjoy a stag dinner with President Eisenhower and his intimates at the White House . Installed as Teamsters President in 1952 , Beck began growing slack . He forgot that the power still lay with the locals . He was too busy enjoying suites at the Waldorf-Astoria and other inns . However , Hoffa did n't forget and Beck was being elbowed aside . In 1954 , the Internal Revenue Service launched a quiet but extensive investigation of Beck 's finances , which led eventually to his conviction this spring . His downfall in the Teamsters , however , came from an unlikely source , the United States Senate . The old McCarthy Investigations Subcommittee , now under Democratic management with John L. McClellan as chairman and Robert F. Kennedy as counsel , was investigating government procurement of uniforms in 1956 . This was n't very exciting . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across an interesting connection . His investigators found the government was buying uniforms from runaway shops in Pennsylvania that were controlled by well-known if second-echelon gangsters . One of them , John ( Johnny Dio ) Dioguardi , it developed , had first-class connections with Hoffa and other trade unionists . A new Select Committee was created in early 1957 with a specific license to hunt down union anti management misbehavior . Beck played a foolish cat-and-mouse game . For weeks he ducked the new committee 's invitations to testify , and when he finally appeared he invoked the Fifth Amendment , On Hoffa 's orders , Beck then announced his retirement from the union business , and Hoffa promptly took over in October 1957 , at the Teamsters ' convention in Miami . AS GOOD AS HE GOT H OFFA is also a driven man . But his fantasies are of a different order and appear to be more firmly grounded in reality . In fact , he gives a superficial appearance of being completely without illusion . His greatest handicap may be a lack of imagination . For he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences and that world is a hostile jungle alive with beasts of prey . Hoffa 's life lesson has been that money can buy just about everything ? judges , police , politicians , loyalty , status , and above all , power . Restless , smart , Hoffa packs 170 well-muscled pounds on a solid five-foot-five-inch frame . Sometimes , he appears to be nursing an unsatisfied grudge against the world . He himself once said , " I learned a long time ago that whatever you can do to me , I can do to you only more . " James Riddle Hoffa , born in Brazil . Indiana , in 1913 , was the son of a miner who died early of coal dust poisoning . When Jimmy was twelve , he was earning $2 a day passing out patent medicine handbills to Ford workers in Detroit , where his mother had a factory job . He finished the ninth grade , and left school for good . A 32-cents-an-hour job unloading boxcars at a Kroger warehouse taught him why men strike . " You stayed as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled . " But you got paid only for the hours you actually worked . The rest of the time you just sat around , waiting for more boxcars to come in . " Hoffa got the point and at eighteen staged his first strike . With four others , he secretly planned a walkout just as a load of perishable strawberries came into the warehouse . Within an hour , the management caved in , granted a small pay increase , and recognized Jimmy 's ad hoc union as bargaining agent for the produce workers . Hoffa 's little local soon picked up a charter from the AFL and then late in 1932 was incorporated into the Teamsters . But Hoffa was learning unionism the hard way . This was the Detroit of the Ford Motor Company 's Harry Bennett ; of sitdown strikes ; of mobsters in the Purple Gang . As Hotta remembers it , " Our cars were bombed out . Three different times someone broke into our office and destroyed our furniture . They hired thugs who were out to get us . The police would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you went on strike you got your head broken . . . But I can hit back . Guys who tried to break me up got broken up . It was no picnic , but I gave as good as I got . " Some ugly stories cropped up . A former CIO organizer reluctantly identified Hoffa before a House Committee as one of four men who had beaten him with tire chains to keep him from organizing an optical plant in which an AFL. official was rumored to have had an interest . Hoffa pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of trying to seal off a wastepaper shipment market for a few firms . But as he once said , that " is nothing against a man . Even General Motors has pleaded nolo . " This businesslike approach did n't hurt his Teamsters career . He climbed the rungs rapidly in a union notorious for suspicion of newcomers . The chronology : president of Local 299 ( in 1937 at the age of twenty-four ) ; president , Detroit Joint Council of Teamsters ( 1946 ) ; first chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , and international vice president ( 1952 ) . Old Tobin crowed : " He is pretty nearly civilized now but 1 knew him when he was n't . " But lIoffa helped Beck topple Tobin in 1952 and five years later Hoffa shoved Beck aside . Hoffa did n't just float to the top . He worked at it and he learned as he went along . He learned that autonomous , local principalities were pointless in an industry that was beginning to centralize . In Hoifa 's Midwest preserve , all over-the-road drivers are now covered by a single contract . Even more remarkable , so are the local haulers . His semi-official biography pointedly says : " He has little tolerance for the Teamster leader who wants to build a tiny little empire of his own . " WE SPEND A LOT OF DOUGH I ELE ARN ED about the law , and about how to survive under the public searchlight . Senator John Kennedy of the McClellan Committee said : in Hoffa 's scheme of things the law is for sale and a fix is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony , judges get hefty campaign contributions and a district attorney prosecuting Hoffa 's men is sharply reminded that anyone can be framed . " There are two ways to play politics , " Hala once told Paul Jacobs of the Reporter magazine . " You either make speeches or else you spend dough . We spend lots of dough . We got connections in the right places . We expect to keep t hem . " Few men have been subjected to the public pressure applied to Hoffa in the last two years . A Senate investigation has publicized him as a national menace ; he has survived two trials , one for allegedly attempting to bribe his way into the Senate Committee 's documents and the other for allegedly wire-tapping his subordinates ' phones ; his union has been thrown out of the AFL-CIO as a pariah largely because he is its president . And yet his hold on the union is still strong ? although rumors say the Teamsters ' hidden powers arc ready to dump Hoffa . There are several reasons for Hotta 's survival , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the reasons are these : ? He has built a smooth machine by binding Teamster officials down the line with cash , fervors , and loyalty . Senate investigators charge that the long gray line of convicts , ex-convicts , and convicts-to-be who march on his payrolls bask in Hoffa 's protective embrace . He has told the McClellan committee he has more important things to do than get rid of felons . &; According to Senate investigators , Hoffa 's underworld friends would make any Teamster think twice about revolt . Former Senator Irving M. Ives told Haifa : " You want jailbirds and men like that , crooks , gangsters , racketeers , and that kind . Because you want tough people to make it doggone tough on these people that you are leading . " ? Hoffa can draw on great gobs of cash . Teamsters ' monthly dues average $5 a man . That means $96 million a year llows into the locals , joint councils , state and area bodies , and the international . The international alone picks up 40 cents a man each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , and investments of the 1,100 locals and higher bodies give the Teamsters a net worth conservatively estimated at above $2 billion . As Hoffa put it to Paul Jacobs : " You ca n't buy loyalty but also you ca n't keep loyalty if you do n't give the . wherewithal to maintain loyalty and respect . " ? Big truckers appear to like him even better than their old pal , Dave Beck . Philip B. Willauer , general manager of the Highway Carriers Employers Association , hailed a Hoffa testimonial dinner as " recognition of your contribution to the stability and progress of the industry . " The key word is " stability . " For , as we shalt see , there is no contradiction between the affection of large trucking concerns for Hotta and Hoffa 's ability to win higher wages . ? Hoffa has considerable ability , misguided as it may appear to bystanders . He is bright , hardworking , and has a great grasp of detail . Few rival his knowledge of the jungle-like trucking industry . He is a tireless worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Foster Dulles visiting our allies . Unlike Beck , he is accessible to the ranks . He is too mechanical in manner and his icy blue eyes are too cold for him to claim any charm . But in a union of men who are clannish and view themselves as on the edge of rather than inside society , Hoffa is personally popular . ? Scattered rumbles from the ranks are easily disposed of with the help of a long Teamster tradition of anti-democratic practices . In Pontiac , Akron , and other cities , entire memberships are disqualified from running for office because the union wo n't collect their dues on time . ? The most important hold Hoff a has is the economic force of the contract . In Pontiac in one of the rare revolts in Hofia 's fiefdom , rank and filers tried to oust their officers because ? the rebels charged ? the officers were favoring veteran owner-drivers ; giving choice routes to their friends instead of following seniority ; and fail ing to enforce the contract . The rebellion was economic , not moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine the economic welfare of marginal workers . It is true that Hoffa wo n't turn his back on Johnny Dio because Dio herded Puerto Rican workers in New York into " sweetheart " substandard contracts ( although Hoffa once told Dio , " All you got to do is treat union guys right and they 're all okay " ) . But Hoffa has been able to guarantee the core of the union ? its approximately one million drivers and warehousemen ? a rising standard of living . For the first thirty years of the Teamsters ' history , the yearly pay for full-time workers in highway freight transportation and warehousing lagged behind the average for all industries . But in 1932 , driver and warehouseman pay topped the all-industries average ; the next year , their pay overtook the manufacturing average and has stayed ahead ever since . In 1957 , drawing $100 a week , the Teamster was doing all right . Hours , traditionally very long , are corning down too , and welfare and pensions are coming up ( though Senate investigators say they might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his expensive friends ) . It is not entirely clear what Hoffa wants . Unlike Beck , he does not lust after luxury and status . To be sure , he has made some money through his union card . He has owned ( in his wife 's name ) a profitable truck-leasing company ; he has promoted real estate through the union ; joined a lawyer negotiating for truckers in an investment company ; and has been partners in several ventures with the broker handling Midwest Teamster welfare funds . But while his business agents wear custom-made suits , Jimmy 's are ready-made . White sweat socks are a Hoffa trade-mark . He still lives in the modest brick house in an unfashionable Northwest section of Detroit that he bought for $6,800 in 1939 . He has a comfortable summer place on Lake Orion , near Pontiac , but it is not lavish . In Washington , he shares a suite with his executive assistant , Harold Gibbons , in the modish but not plush Woodner Hotel . He collects $50,000 a year plus expenses from the international : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live up to it . Hoffa does n't drink or smoke and is running too fast to pursue creature comforts . Even on vacation , he doggedly pursues game and fish . He has a conventional father 's pride in his daughter , a bright , twenty-year-old senior at Albion College in Michigan , and his sixteen-year-old son , an : instate high-school football guard last fall . His conversation is not spiced with the rich imagery of a Reuther or a Joe Curran . In fact , Hoffa would be a bore if he were not Hoffa . COULD HE STOP THE NATION 'S WHEELS ? B U T what does he want ? His psychoanalytically oriented friends ( and two of his closest are currently on the couch ) think he unconsciously seeks revenge for his harsh early life . The more prosaic answer is power . Power may be the motive behind his goal of a federation of transportation unions . This would be a logical union aim as a means to increase bargaining strength . Much has , been written about how his grandiose transport combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has achieved working relationships with the two Iongshore unions on the three coasts , the airline Flight Engineers and the two East and Gulf Coast seamen 's unions . A Hoffa associate claims to have healed the long-standing breach between the National Maritime Union and the Seafarers International . This gave Hoffa considerable pleasure since George Meany , the AFL-CIO president , had been unable to make peace after nearly two years of trying . Nevertheless , a lot of wild words have been written about Hoffa 's power to stop the nation 's wheels . He has no ties yet with the railroad unions . And despite trucking 's big advance , it accounted for slightly less than one in five ton-miles of freight transported in 1957 . Moreover , common-carrier or for-hire trucks , the heart of Teamster organization , totaled only 1.7 million of the 10.5 million trucks registered in the United States in 1957 . Of these common carriers , the American Trucking Associations figure the Teamsters have organized 90 per cent of the practical potential membership . ( This excludes small fleets and owner-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But a government compilation of the industry 's work force combined with informal union estimates of member strength by trade indicates that only 67 per cent of this " practical potential " is Teamster . THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY D ESPITE the haziness of the figures , the Teamsters can be said to be a power in the common carrier or for-hire industry . And it is to this peculiar , mushrooming industry that one must look for the answer to the central question ; Why have corruption , collusion , and violence distinguished the Teamsters Union for half a century ? In part , the answer lies in the strategic nature of trucking . When Prohibition ended , flush gangsters looked for new investment outlets . They decided to invest in unions , particularly those dealing with comparatively small employers who would be an easy mark . Trucking is an ideal field for this sport because a striking union of drivers or drivers who refuse to cross a picket line can cut off deliveries of raw materials and transport of finished products . So , tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers can be organized and their clues can provide a hefty revenue . But this Dick Tracy theory of Teamster corruption is far too limited and does n't explain the pre-Prohibition history . Moreover , corruption and collusion are a recurring feature in many building-trades unions , retail unions , the International Ladies Garment Workers , baking , and textiles . Along with trucking , these industries have a common factor . They are essentially competitive , made up of thousands of relatively small concerns , vying for shares of an unstable market through price competition . This is in sharp contrast to autos , steel , aluminum , and oil refining , where a handful of companies account for all production . In these industries , a few producers , within broad supply and demand limits , can make meaningful decisions about prices and output ; corrupt unionism in the conventional sense is both unnecessary and all but unknown . To be sure , not all competitive industries throw up crooked unions . Since the I920s , there has been barely a breath of scandal about the Amalgamated Clothing Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking rival United Textile Workers has been a sordid mess ; the newly formed AFL-CIO bakers union was created to drive out the corruptly led Bakery and Confectionary Workers . But the relationship between a competitive industrial structure and a crooked union is too clear to be called coincidence . The reason lies in a venerable marketplace maxim : " Competition is the life of trade and the death of business . " Few big businessmen really enjoy price competition ( that 's " cutthroat " ) or fighting for customers ( in trucking , it 's called " account stealing " ) . " Stability " is their perennial goal . Steel and auto company executives have repeatedly told the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee that there is no point in one firm 's cutting a price because its handful of competitors will match this and every firm will then be worse off . So prices are " administered , " and , in general , live-and-let-live is the rule . Truckers , like other competitive businessmen , pine for the stability of steel . In 1933 , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interstate Commerce Commission was given power to approve rates and routes for non-farm , for-hire trucks in interstate commerce . Today , trucking has n't completely shaken clown by a long sight , but it is getting there . A 1957 study for the Senate Select Committee on Small Business concluded that " the big are getting bigger and solidifying their control of the industry . " The ICC is deliberately encouraging this process by approving mergers , especially of large firms , at a great rate . In 1940 , there were 26,000 carriers regulated by ICC . This number had shrunk to 18,000 by 1955 despite an enormous increase in business . But 18,000 is still a lot of firms . Even the three biggest companies accounted For only 2.5 per cent of the : $6.2 billion taken in by all regulated companies in 1957 . So , helpful as ICC is , the industry always has needed and still needs another " stabilizer . " And that 's where the Teamsters Union comes in . Through strikes or threatened strikes , it can discipline rate cutters and customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages in and out of contracts . Teamster underworld allies are available for the messier enforcement jobs . Hoffa has bluntly said , " The future of labor-management relations is big labor and big business . There is no room for the small business or the small union . " " HE UNDERSTANDS OUR PROBLEMS " N THE Beck-Hoffa eras , the Teamsters have enjoyed generally cordial relations with the big truckers . All fort ) - five of the largest general freight firms are organized . Benjamin R. Miller , head of the American Trucking Associations ' industrial-relations department put it this way : " You just have to give Hoffa credit for buying the idea that the industry will pay well for work done but must stop paying for work not done . Its at least fortunate for the industry that he understands our problems and is willing to weigh our proposals on what is good for both management and labor . " From the narrow viewpoint of the truck driver in the bigger companies , Hoffa 's ultimate constituent , this is all to the good . Small firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working conditions . The big flans can more easily absorb demands for higher pay . But when a union performs this " stabilizing " role , something happens to its officials . They have trouble distinguishing between co-operation and collusion . They see employers living high on company-paid , tax-deductible expense accounts . They long for the confidence and top-down control that their employer friends enjoy . Some leaders of unions in highly competitive industries rise above the corroding effects of co-operation with employers for a shared goal . Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated did . His successor , Jacob Potofsky does . Both Hillman and Potofsky , however , were deeply rooted in a specific tradition of Jewish-Socialist ethical idealism . David Dubinsky of the International Ladies Garment Workers , too , has a reputation for integrity although rotten apples do turn up in his Seventh Avenue barrel . The Teamsters , however , have no such tradition although a comparative handful of their locals are run along orthodox union lines . If this analysis is correct , then union reform legislation will simply invite ingenious lawyers to invent outs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cripple the wayward . And replacing Hoffa and his minions will probably produce more of the same . Of course , if the major firms of truckers , shippers , stevedores , retailers , and other distributors showed any interest in breaking off their convenient relationships with Hoffa-type unionism , this would be a different story . However , organized business federations , like the National Association of Manufacturers and United States Chamber of Commerce have not applied any social ostracism to employers dealing with hoodlums . Instead , the NAM and the Chamber have attempted to exploit the McClellan Committee disclosures and picture employer beneficiaries of racket unions as innocent victims of strike pressure . Organized labor , in the person of the AFL-CIO , has adopted a completely different tack , and exiled the Teamsters and other corrupt unions from the decent labor family ; but the discipline has been painful and expensive for the parent organization . THE COMING SHAKEDOWN B U T this is no counsel of despair . For it implies that the changing nature of trucking will wipe out the corruption . The industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries , its handful of employers wo n't need the union to rig prices and market shares . They will do it themselves and the collusion will disappear . In time , then . Hoffa and his kind will become as obsolete as Beck , Tobin , and Shea . Of course , this takes place in what economists call " the long run . " And as John Maynard Keynes used to say , " In the long run , we will all be dead . " Moreover , this shaking-down process poses new problems for a democratic society . It implies a conscious or unconscious collaboration between big unions and big industry such as now exists in steel . What countervailing power exists to prevent the pair from engaging in an endless cycle of wage increases followed by more than offsetting price increases ? Big business and big labor together may create an economy in which the invisible and regulating hand of competition has been amputated . Our new inflationary economy is an open invitation for new instruments of social control . It is hardly surprising that sonic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresher legislators on Capitol Hill ? are now drawing up tentative plans for new ways of safeguarding the public interest ? the one " interest " that apparently never crosses the Teamsters ' minds .
