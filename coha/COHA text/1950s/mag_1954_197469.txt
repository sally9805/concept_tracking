DOWN WITH SKOOL ( 106 pp. ) - Geoffrey Willans &; Ronald Searle-Vanguard ( $2.50 ) . <P> THE FEMALE APPROACH ( 147 pp. ) - Ronald Searle-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Nigel Molesworth , no weed , cad , dirty rotter or funk , is the curse of St. Custard 's , or so he claims . St. Custard 's is a very English boys ' school , built by a madman in Gothic tempered by Byzantine , and run by a monstrous regiment of headmaster , masters and matrons , against all of whom Nigel is plotting revolution . He proclaims : " When we arrive in our helicopters we shall take over the skool and feed all with cream . FREE THE SLAVES . <P> <P> WE LOOK TO THE DAY . " <P> <P> In his social outlook , Nigel recalls Peck 's Bad Boy , while in some of his insights about adults , he might be a distant cousin of J.D. Salinger 's Catcher in the Rye . As created by British Humorist Geoffrey Willans and Cartoonist Ronald Searle , Molesworth could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him highly amusing , for the Boys ' International cuts across all frontiers . <P> A Silencer for Kanes . Although Molesworth is built close to the ground , he can rise to most occasions . He knows the great world , as is shown by the Molesworth newsletter : " ( a ) russians are roters. ( b ) americans are swankpots. ( c ) the french are slack , ( d ) the germans are unspeakable , ( e ) the rest are as bad if not worse than the above , ( f ) the British are brave super and noble cheers cheers cheers . The only way for Peace is for all of them to dive into the sea and end it all . " But he is at his best as a tactician in his own local revolution against the masters . Molesworth is succinct in a guide to " Kanes I Have Known " ( e.g. , " The ' Nonpliant ' or <P> ' Rigid ' with silencer attachment to drown victims cries " ) . His favorite expletive- " Chiz ! " - is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his whispering campaign about the masters ' carryings on , although he wonders : " i ask you wot could any GURL see in a master ? " <P> However , it must be admitted that Molesworth has some qualities potentially fatal to the revolutionary : a tendency to daydream ( he sees himself as an armored knight refusing mercy to a kneeling headmaster ) and a touch of defeatism . On the subject of how to get out of divinity instruction , for instance . Molesworth says : " You could try being let down into the class dressed as an angel . You then sa to the master Lo who are these cherubim and seraphim who are continually crying . He repli Form 3 B. You then sa Lo they are not angles but angels with the xception of peason who hav a face like a baboon . You must dismiss them and the master oba . " But after this fine start , the plotter adds dispiritedly : " On the other hand he may sa Lo molesworth 200 lines . It is quite a good wheeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
