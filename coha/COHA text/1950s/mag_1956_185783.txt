" Universities are a part of the workers ' and peasants ' state and must serve the construction of socialism . " In these blunt terms , the East German government defines the functions of the nation 's " institutions of higher education . " In practice , the definition means that East German universities bar the " nonproductive " ( i.e. , politically suspect ) , bourgeois " intelligent sia " in favor of the loyal sons and daughters of the " peasants ' and workers ' class . " <P> Last week , prodded by public protests from professional groups , East German officialdom took a new look at its educational policy . One of the policy 's embarrassing results : East German students by the hundreds are slipping into West Berlin to seek the education denied them at home . <P> <P> Social Record . Counting remedial " workers ' and peasants ' faculties , " there are 46 institutions of higher education in East Germany , with an enrollment of 100,000 . Admission to any one of them is controlled from East Berlin through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's present quota system , 65% of the nation 's college students must be recruited from the " workers ' and peasants ' class , " with priority for the remaining openings given to members of the " productive intelligentsia " ( i.e. , " deserving activists , " " deserving teachers of the people , " " deserving inventors , " college professors ) , and to such heterogeneous categories as " recognized victims of fascism , " inmates of orphanages , cum laude high-school graduates . Although high-school grades are in theory a determining factor , they actually have far less to do with a student 's chances than his family background and his record of " social " ( i.e. , political ) activity . The final high-school oral examination is a simple exercise in juggling the tortuous details of current party ideology . <P> Even if a " bourgeois " student survives his examination and proves socially acceptable ( e.g. , a member of the Free German Youth or the Para-Military Association for Sport and Technology ) , he still must make out on a 28% smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboring family in the same general income bracket . ( Living allowances are granted by the government to almost all students in institutions of higher education ; tuition is free . ) <P> Under all these conditions , some 1,300 boys and girls fled to West Berlin last fall ; most of them enrolled for nine-month high-school refresher courses , then entered universities or technical schools . This fall , he number of education immigrants will Drobably be even larger .
