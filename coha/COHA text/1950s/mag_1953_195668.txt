Golfer Ike Eisenhower , who has his troubles breaking 90 , got a few tips this week from Old Pro Tommy Armour , 57 , who has trouble breaking 70 nowadays . But in his prime ( the 19205 ) , Armour managed to win professional golf 's triple crown : the U.S. and British Opens and the P.G.A . Sitting down with a batch of Ike-in-action photographs for This Week Magazine , Armour tells the President what is right-and wrong-with his game . The rest of the U.S. 's 3,265,000 golfers could profit by Armour 's tips . <P> The President , says Armour , is " at his golfing best " on the pitch shot : " the most valuable stroke-saving shot in the game " ( head down , grip strong , feet close together ) . Says Armour : " It is probably the reason the President gets around the golf course in the respectable scores I read about . " Ike is also a hot shot out of a bunker , with " practically perfect " technique ( feet flat , head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower has spent a lot of time in sand traps . " <P> On the tee and fairway , however , Ike 's swings and footwork have a few kinks-the result , Armour supposes , of a bad knee ( an old football injury ) . Ike 's main trouble in almost every picture : " His right knee , and consequently his right side , has ' locked ' i.e. , stiffened during the hit . " Another of Ike 's form faults which Ar mour calls " not permissible " : his arms are sometimes bent on the follow-through , instead of going " straight out after the ball . " <P> It is Armour 's fond hope , he says , that Ike will ask him in for an hour or so of coaching some day . Armour 's promise : to take five strokes off Ike 's score .
