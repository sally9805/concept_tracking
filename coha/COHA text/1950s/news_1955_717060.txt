Most of us who were born here or who have lived here year upon year do not really see it at all . One may be reminded what it is like to " see " New York when one is asked to squire a young lady about on her first visit to Manhattan ? a young lady of 15 from the hinterland , wonderfully innocent , with a freshness one does not often find along Broadway . Times Square is the A Bit first stop for this young of Paint visitor , after she has Wanted looked curiously right and left from the cab all the way from Pennsylvania Station ; it is about noon of a cloudy , showery day . As are most visitors , she is fascinated by the " spectaculars , " the animated signs on the Square . " That one , " she says , pointing , " needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who passes it a dozen times a week confesses that this lack had not been noticed before . With that , one looks about more carefully and feels mildly depressed by the generally drab appearance of the Square and of Broadway ; surely more than that weatherbeaten spectacular needs a bit of freshening up , a few gallons of paint . A page from a newsDigging paper flaps along the Up the sidewalk in the wind . Street " New York certainly is dirty , " says the young lady , neatly sidestepping this Broadway tumbleweed . And she was right  --  and she is reminded that so are Philadelphia and Chicago and a number of other cities . The young lady stops to watch a crew digging up West Forty-third Street and is looked at , curiously , in return by the workmen . One is struck with the thought that someone always seems to be digging into West Forty-third Street , and one says as much to the young lady . " That seems silly , " she says , and one can think of nothing to add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the a Veil food , which the visitor scarcely touches , but because she catches sight of several persons she has seen , back home , on a television screen , After lunch a gray mist begins to , settle upon the town , the sort of mist that one finds dampening both to clothes and to spirits . As seen from Fifth Avenue the high mast atop the Empire State Building appears fitfully through the haze . " Is n't it beautiful ? " the visitor inquires , rhetorically . And one says , after taking a long look down the misty avenue , with its buildings looming majestically in the drizzle , that in fact it is beautiful , and one does not spoil it by saying that , really , its too bad the sun is n't shining , because then . . . . For this is New York in one of her most graceful moods , drawing a veil before her face , and then pulling it aside . With great foresight Stars one has obtained tickets in Her to a matinee which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2:30 . That hour arriving with no sign of activity upon the stage , she asks , " Why do n't they begin on time ? " and one finds no ready answer for that , either . But these are the last words spoken until intermission when , moving out under the marquee but no farther  --  for it is raining hard now  --  the young lady , clutching her Playbill tightly , says , " It 's wonderful , " with such feeling that one wishes her enthusiasm might be conveyed , intact , to the cast . About 5 o'clock one rides silently in a cab to Pennsylvania Station to see the visitor to her train . She has only three words : " Thank you , " and " Good-by , " and her eyes are still on a West Fortyfourth Street stage . But her face says that New York is a wonderful , exciting , beautiful place  --  when one is young , and seeing it for the first time  --  and that she would , surely , be back soon . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , Third Avenue , the - Park . There is never , never time enough for all .
