Every year , as their otherwise normal children emerge from babyhood , thousands of parents ask themselves the question : " Why is my child so inattentive ? " Often there are other signs : the child does not learn to talk as other children do ; he eats and breathes noisily ; when he cries out , his voice has an unnatural sound . As many parents soon learn , these are the symptoms of the child who can not hear . <P> In the U.S. today there are between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 U.S. children who are either partially or totally deaf . How can their parents teach and help them ? In a new book , Your Deaf Child ( Charles C. Thomas ; $2.50 ) , Helmer Myklebust , Northwestern University audiology professor , gives some primer-clear answers . <P> Leave a Light . First of all , says Myklebust , parents must find out just what sort of deafness their child has . A few " deaf " children actually have perfect hearing , but because of psychological tensions , choose neither to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of injury to the brain , can make no sense from the sounds about them and gradually come to ignore sound entirely . Other children can hear a few sounds , but not those in the range of ordinary speech . Still others hear nothing at all . <P> The silent world in which the deaf child lives is not easy for parents to understand . If the child loses his hearing at two or three , he will suddenly feel cut off . " Often he cries easily , " says Professor Myklebust , " and tries in other ways to show you that he feels lonely and sad . . . Remember that when the lights are turned out at night he has no contact with you . " Hearing nothing , and seeing nothing as well , he will be afraid . " During this time that he is learning to live without sound it is wise to use a night light . " <P> If the child is born deaf , he is at first better off . Later , however , he lives a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sudden and unexpected events , never hears the thousands of words that tie daily happenings together . Gradually , he begins to learn that he is different from other people . He notices how easily his brothers &; sisters make their own wants known . He begins desperately to want to hear , not because he misses the sounds he has never known , but because he is jealous . <P> The Best Thing . Faced with their child 's deafness , says Professor Myklebust , some parents become overprotective , allow the child to play tyrant , fail to prepare him for the problems ahead . Other parents take the opposite extreme ; they make no allowances for the child , confront his handicap with open hostility . Still other parents weep in front of the child , drag him to specialist after specialist for further treatment .
