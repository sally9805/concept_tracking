txt BIG FOUR PRESENT PEACE PLANS ; SOVIET TO DONATE TO ATOM POOL ; EISENHOWER FOR ' ALARM SYSTEM ' SECURITY KEY AM Desire for Conciliation Noted , but Division Is Still Wide Speeches delivered at opening - sessions , Pages 10 and 11 . By CLIFTON DANTE " . Special to The New ' York Terme .. GENEVA , July ** Big Four heads of government met today and exchanged proposals for resolving the issues that for ten years have set the East against the West . One immediate step toward cooperation with the Western powers was taken by the Soviet Union : Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin announced his Government would contribute to the international atoms-for-peace pool advocated by President Eisenhower . The President , who opened the conference , proposed a new approach of disarmament : He sug4 gested as a first step an " alarm system " of arms inspection to prevent " frightful surprises " or " sudden attack . " Sir Anthony Eden , British Prime Minister , recommended a mutual defense pact to be signed by all four great powers and a reunited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries oi the East European bloc and a two-stage approach to an allEuropean security system . Faure Presses Arms Cuts Edgar Faure , French Premier , elaborated his personal plan for control of disarmament by reducing military budgets and placing the money saved into an international fund for aid to underdeveloped countries , That plan had no visible support from Britain or the United States . Despite their manifest desire for conciliation the four govern ? ment heads in their opening speeches were still far from an understanding on fundamental issues . The East still differed from the West both in the order proposed for tackling European problems and in the ways sug ? gested for resolving them . It seemed tonight there also were differences as well among the Western delegates themselves in their reaction to the extensive list of new proposals ? . or variations on old proposals ? presented by Marshal Bulganin . Those differences were apparent even with national delegations . However , President Eisenhower , who presided at the morning and afternoon sittings of the conference and briefly summa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this early stage . Bulganin Last to Speak Marshal Bulganin , whose conciliatory attitude matched that of everyone else at the table . also declared that the differences in points of view should not " prevent our conference from achieving success . " The Soviet Premier was the last of the four chief delegates to speak . He was preceded by President Eisenhower , M. Faure and Sir Anthony Eden in that order . Having heard the three others , the Soviet Premier responded immediately to some of their proposals . He also produced a whole new set of variations on the familiar themes of Soviet policy . But he skirted the issue that all . the Western spokesmen had placed at the heart of the ' matter ? the reunification of Germany . Aside from endorsing the atoms-for-peace pool Marshal Bulganin made the following proposals : ilThe conference should come out in favor of an international agreement establishing the armed forces of the Uniteet States , the Soviet Union , Communist China , Britain and France at agreed levelz. slAs a beginning to disarmament , the Soviet Union would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Austria . The three other // powers should agree to do-the same . ilThe process of establishing a collective security system in Europe should be divided into two stages : In the first stage . the states signing the security treaty would maintain their existing treaty obligations but would refrain from the use of armed force and resort to the peaceful settlement of disputes . They would , meanwhile , take no steps to increase their armed forces on foreign territory . In the second stage , the states would terminate the North Atlantic Treaty , the Paris agreements for the arming of West Germany and the East European military alliance and replace them all with an allEuropean security system . In the meantime the Atlantic pact powers on the one hand and the East European Communist states on the other " could assume mutual commitments not to use armed force against one another . " The eventual aim should be " to have no foreign troops remaining on the territories of the European states , " Marshal Bulganin said . West 's Objections Passed Over While not insisting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect , Mar shal Bulganin passed over the grave Western objection to such a withdrawal of forces . The objection is that the withdrawal would leave - the Soviet Army standing ' on the threshold of West Europe while the United States forces would be pulled back across the Atlantic . Premier Bulganin also reiterated the Soviet Union 's desire that Communist China 's claims to Formosa and to a United Nations seat should be satisfied . As expected , he declared that the conference had no business discussing two issues raised by President Eisenhower  --  electoral freedom for the East European , Soviet satellites and the activi-1 ties of international communism . President Eisenhower , Premier Bulganin , Prime Minister Eden and Premier Faure voiced a hope for closer Contacts among their people . ? Next to Premier Bulganin , the British Prime Minister , who had participated in many greatpower parleys but never before as head of government , presented the largest number of new proposals to the conference . His proposals , however , ran counter to those of the Soviet Premier in , form and order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared there was no doubt that the unity of Germany was the chief problem of Europe . He renewed the plan he presented at the Berlin foreign ministers conference eighteen months ago to reunite Germany on the basis of free elections . Bid to Adenauer Hinted On the other hand , Marshal Bulganin merely said it " would be well to exchange views here " even though " in the present circumstances we may fail to reach immediate agreement on the reunification of Germany . " Premier Bulganin declared again that Moscow wished to see reunification but he did not deal substantively with the means of accomplishing it . It seemed that either the Soviet Premier thought an agreement in Geneva would be impossible or , what was more likely , the Soviet Government wanted to approach Chancellor Konrad Adenauer directly and personally . The West German Chancellor has been invited , to Moscow to discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union . Acknowledging that a reunified Germany might cause apprehension to the Soviet Union , Sir Anthony offered a three ; point plan to reassure Moscow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armaments . " His points in brief were : ( 11 " We would be prepared to be parties to a security pact , of which those round this table and a united Germany might be members . " 111 " We would be ready to discuss and tristo reach agreement as to the total forces and armaments on each side in Germany and the countries neighboring Germany . * * * All those represepented here would , we hope , be partners in this together with a united Germany . " " We should be ready to examine the possibility of -a demilitarized area , between the East and the West . " Sir Anthony Eden did not specify the size or location of that area but others have suggested that it should take in what is now the Soviet zone of Germany . Faure Presents Suggestions Another variety of the same general security setup was pro-1 posed by Premier Faure , who suggested that the commitments of the Paris agreements should be extended to the Soviet Union , that Germany should be in eluded in a new European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and west security systems might be merged . This plan seemed to be the nearest approach on the West ' ern side to the Soviet proposal for an all-European security system . M. Faure explicitly stated , what other Western spokesmen only suggested  --  that a united Germany should be a member of the Atlantic alliance and the Western European Union . Otherwise , the French Prelmier extensively expounded his ideas for " budgetary control " over disarmament . He argued that actually taking arms funds out of the hands of the military powers and placing them in an I international fund would exercise a sufficient deterrent on excessive armaments . The United States delegation , at least , has no taste.for what it considers an ineffectual control . Marshal Bulganin , however , said M. Faure 's plan was " of interest and worthy of careful examination . " The . examination ' of the day 's proposals will begin in detail tomorrow morning when the foreign ministers who sat with the heads of governments today will hold a separate meeting . In the afternoon the chief delegates , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second round of speeches .
