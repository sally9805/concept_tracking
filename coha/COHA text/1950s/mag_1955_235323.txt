For such a well-mannered magazine as the Saturday Review of Literature , the experience was a shock - but the shock was not limited to the magazine . In 1936 a scrappy , pug-nosed man from Utah took over as editor . His name , Bernard DeVoto , soon became a synonym for the atrabilious type of crusader who seems perpetually to be throwing a tantrum . Sinclair Lewis , one of his early targets , called him " a tedious and egotistical fool . . . a pompous and boresome liar . " " What , " asked Critic Edmund Wilson , " is Mr. DeVoto 's real grievance . . . this continual boiling up about other people 's wild statements which stimulates him to even wilder statements of his own ? " <P> <P> Over the years , Bernard DeVoto did indeed strike wildly , but more often than not he struck home . On speakers ' platforms , in his books , and from " The Easy Chair " in Harper 's Magazine , he lectured the nation on everything from its airplane service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He deplored , denounced , defied , but he seemed to do so out of a passionate fondness for America that made even the tiniest fault seem an outrage . He called himself a " critic of culture . " He was actually a challenge . " We have fought at Arques , " he recently told his readers after describing his bitter feud with McCarthyism . " Where were you ? " <P> Semi-Educated . DeVoto 's battles began early . The " child of an apostate Mormon and an apostate Catholic , " he entered the University of Utah at 17 , founded a <P> Socialist club , quit the campus entirely when four professors were fired for airing unorthodox views . He was later " semieducated " at Harvard , served as a smallarms instructor during World War I , taught for a while at Northwestern for $1,700 a year . Once again he quit , this time because " they were changing over from a good , small school into a metropolitan university , and standards were falling , well , wherever they happened to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructor and settled down in Cambridge , Mass. , his writings were already beginning to sell . <P> <P> He wrote slashing articles for the Saturday Review and Harper 's . Under the name of John August , he made his daily bread with serials and stories for the slicks . He became custodian of the Mark Twain papers , produced three books ( Mark Twain 's America , Mark Twain in Eruption , Mark Twain at Work ) that rescued Twain from the pryings of psychoanalytical critics . His interest in Twain was characteristic of his down-to-earth Americanism : while his fellow writers were busy exiling themselves to Europe , DeVoto remained stubbornly rooted in the U.S. <P> Which Paris ? He never left the North American continent ( " Why , " he told his wife when she proposed a trip to France , " I have n't even seen Paris , Idaho " ) . He hated the literary exiles who called themselves lost , and said that the sickness they saw around them was only their own . He despised writers with delusions about the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly to one another " ) , and he insisted that literary criticism was " an activity in which uncontrolled speculation is virtuous and responsibility is almost impossible . " DeVoto was a man in search of facts . The facts he liked best : those that lay the building of America . <P>
