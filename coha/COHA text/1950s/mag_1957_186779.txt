Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> Stalking into a Los Angeles court in a **25;5588;TOOLONG mood , torn-T-shirt-school Cinemactor Anthony Franciosa ground his teeth and glowered while a deputy city attorney recounted his misdeeds . Franciosa fractured the peace two months ago when , according to the lawman , he place-kicked a press photographer who was trying to snap him with his then great and good friend ( now wife ) shock-haired Cinemactress Shelley Winters . " It would not have been seemly to have had my picture taken with Miss Winters . I was still married , " Franciosa explained after the fracas . When the prosecutor demanded that he be jailed " for the protection of society , " Franciosa rose with his chest heaving . Chewing each word as if it were scenery , he pounded the table and began emoting eight to the bar : " He is saying society has to be protected . This is ridiculous . I am society . " Society 's sentence : two years ' probation , $250 fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues removed from the days when he followed his famed father in dueling along balustrades and skewering villains behind the arras , Cinemactor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , now a London boulevardier , last week bagged a pride of social lions . The catch at Fairbanks ' coming-out party for his 17-year-old daughter Daphne : Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip , and Princess Margaret with a new and eminently eligible beau , 23-year-old Lord Patrick Beresford , her escort at the Ascot races . Handsome Doug , whose swash shows no signs of buckling at 47 , got the first dance with the Queen , also got a precedent-breaking ( because Fairbanks and his wife are divorced ) invitation to tea at Ascot on the sacrosanct sod of the Queen 's Lawn . <P> <P> As befits a man who has spent much of his professional life expiring at the top of his voice ( he has logged 227 hours of dying time in Tristan alone ) , Siegfried-sized Tenor Lauritz Melchior knows his deathbed bathos down to the last Cheyne-Stokes wheeze . When bandits hopped the fence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neckties and began looting the place , the 67-year-old Dane huffed and puffed like a heart-attack victim , sagged to his chair in feigned death throes ( Tristan und Isolde , Act III ) to frighten them off . Said he : " I am something of an actor . I let my tongue hang out of my mouth , and my eyes rolled in my head . I was never better . They were frightened . " <P> But the act earned Melchior something less than an Equity minimum . As the tenor untied himself , grabbed a deer rifle and hustled out the door , his captor audience skedaddled back out the gate , taking with it $140,000 in boodle ( jewelry and cash ) . Police bag by week 's end : two of the four badmen , all but about $40,000 of their loot . <P> Even in Hollywood 's Cloud-Cuckoo-Land , all falls are not prat . Last week doorknob-bald Cinemidol Yul Brynner looked more dashed than dashing after he tried some Cossack-style horsemanship for MGM 's The Brothers Karamazov , swooped too low , fractured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels during the Pal Joey shooting , got sent to the showers with a gimpy tendon.
