Ingratiatingly , alluringly , the Russians last week used the tools of trade and culture to turn Latin American eyes and aspirations away from the U.S. , toward the U.S.S.R. The response from both Brazil and Chile gave the Communists cause to take heart . <P> In Brazil a small , hitherto unknown company named Torgbraz came to the fore as the Soviet Union 's trading arm . Run by a retired Brazilian colonel and a " refugee " from Russia , Torgbraz ( Trade-Brazil ) offered to supply Petrobras , the state oil monopoly , with crude oil , drilling and refinery equipment on either " short-or long-term payment . " ( At present Petrobras gets equipment from U.S. companies on strictly businesslike terms . ) <P> Only a month earlier , No. 1 Communist Nikita Khrushchev , in an interview with a Brazilian Communist newspaperman , had plugged for a booming trade that would exchange Brazil 's coffee , cocoa , hides , sugar and cotton for such manufactured goods as " oil-well-drilling equipment and automobiles . " The trade offers , suspiciously similar , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist Party members and enough party-liners to swing a tight election . They were shrewdly directed at sensitive areas such as Petrobras , of which the public is fiercely proud . Publicly , Petrobras was cool to the Torgbraz offers , but privately it awaited a top governmental decision . Congressional and army opinion was building up for a resumption of both trade and diplomatic relations with Russia . <P> Chile played host to a large contingent of eager Russians , including Playwright-Author ( Days and Nights ) Konstantin Simonov , a power in the Soviet Writers ' Union ; the Cultural Ministry 's Latin American chief , Konstantin Chugonov ; Neurologist Leonidas Koreisha ; and the 18-man Dynamo soccer team . Dynamo lost its Chilean match 1-0 , but the Simonov team scored by making agreements to exchange teachers with Chile , to send copies of all books printed by Moscow University in return for copies of a single Chilean literary magazine , to send the Moscow Dramatic Theater for a visit in 1959 . " Gentlemen , make your petitions , " said Culture Chief Chugonov jovially . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , the ambassadors of the two countries got together and agreed , subject to President Carlos Ibaez approval , to sell 20,000 tons of Chilean copper wire to Russia .
