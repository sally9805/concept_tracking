When Ireland 's Prime Minister Eamon de Valera was starting out in politics , a friend warned him : " You 'll never get anywhere until you have your own newspaper . " De Valera followed the advice , and in 1931 got control of the Irish Press . Next year he was elected Prime Minister . Under him , the Press spoke for " Dev 's " Fianna Fil Party , and circulation climbed until today it is 199,000 , only 4,000 behind the Irish Independent , the country 's biggest daily . But from the start , Dev had one trouble with the paper . In the heat of Irish politics , the job of editor , which is virtually a lifetime job on other Irish papers , has been far from that on the Press . Latest casualty was Press Editor Bill Sweetman , who , after 15 years in the editor 's hot seat , returned to the relative peace &; quiet of being a lawyer . <P> Last week De Valera named a replacement who is not likely to move out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new editor : James Pearse McGuinness ( " I spell it the same way as the stout " ) , 33 , who was born in the walled city of Derry and , as a Catholic in Protestant Northern Ireland , learned to fight early . He quickly became a single-minded Irish Republican . In 1939 , when the illegal " Irish Republican army " declared " war " on the British Empire , he volunteered to fight on British soil . He slipped into Britain , brags that he helped try to blow up power plants . De Valera , who thought the I.R.A . ' s methods were no way to win Irish independence , had McGuinness slapped into internment camp for two years when he came back . Says McGuinness : " My stay there was n't wasted . I learned Irish ( i.e. , Gaelic . " At war 's end , he went back to Britain as a laborer , picked up a job as assistant to the London editor of the Press . In his new job , McGuinness gradually learned to like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend : <P> " Chip by chip , the rugged Derry granite was knocked off his shoulder .

Last week , when his appointment as editor was announced , the competing Irish Times ( circ. 38,000 ) gave him an Irish sendoff : " The fact that he was given the job so young might suggest that De Valera 's party hoped to have somebody pliable . If so , they could not have made a worse choice . . . Whether he will be able to keep his political master in order remains to be seen . But certainly they will not be able to muzzle him .
