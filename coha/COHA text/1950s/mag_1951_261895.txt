From the Gulf of California to the Strait of Magellan , 125 million Latin Americans braced themselves hopefully this week for the gayest , gaudiest carnaval in years . <P> Only in Panama would joy be confined . There , an outbreak of 130 polio cases led President Arnulfo Arias to call off all public assemblies . But in Trinidad , the calypso tents have been billowing for weeks to the chants of contenders for the title of 1951 calypso king . In Haiti , more than 30,000 people , clad in bamboo suits of armor and other bizarre costumes , loped along mountain trails on their way to masquerade in Port-au-Prince . In Buenos Aires ' downtown Avenida de Mayo , colored lights , bunting and comic posters went up in preparation for a municipal jamboree . In Uruguay , practical jokers would soon be in full frolic on Montevideo 's streets . In Lima , everybody battened down for a soaking , giggling weekend of indoor juegos con agua ( water fights ) . <P> With Getulio Vargas ' inaugural this week , Rio planned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samba time from the capital 's shanty-lined favela hills . For the favela folk , pro-Vargas almost to a man , the return of the " father of the poor " called for a big blowout . In their " samba schools , " where fathers , mothers and children had paid dues all year toward costumes and a community float for the carnaval parade , the sentiment was the same : " We 'll make this one for the velhinho little old man . " <P> The pre-carnival samba competition broke all records with 700 new entries . At week 's end , two were declared 1951 co-winners . One was a coldhearted ditty called For Your Information ( " For your information , there 's someone else in your place " ) . The second , fretting over the city 's perennial water shortage , was called I Hope It Rains Three Days in a Row . No sooner were the winners announced than it rained three days in a row . Now all that Rio asked was clear skies-and perhaps a word from the velhinho that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could forget .
