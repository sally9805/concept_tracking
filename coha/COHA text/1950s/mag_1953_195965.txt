The U.S. won a significant victory in the United Nations . India , most powerful of the neutrals , was denied a place at the post-armistice conference on the Korean war . and the U.N . side at the conference was limited to the nations which actually put troops on the fighting front . The victory came as the result of a policy decision made a month ago by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , essentially a decision to oppose the British-Indian position that the conference should be turned into a round-table discussion of any and all Asiatic affairs . <P> To United Nations Delegate Henry Cabot Lodge fell the duty of arguing the U.S. position in the U.N. , and he argued with a singleness of purpose and a talent for counterpoint that the U.N . has seldom heard from the U.S. <P> He argued from a sound position : the U.S. owed a certain loyalty to its principal cobelligerent , South Korea , and South Korea 's Syngman Rhee was firmly opposed to having India at the conference . More important , the U.S. knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds a chance to prolong indefinitely the negotiation of a specific settlement , and 2 ) tie the question of Korean settlement to the demand of Red China for a seat in the U.N . The U.S. is not opposed to a round-table conference per se , but objects to an Asia-wide conference until the Chinese Communists have proved their intentions on the specifics of Korea . <P> As Lodge argued through the week , much of the British press ( see INTERNATIONAL ) , joined by some of the U.S. press , wrung its hands because the U.S. was suddenly on the unpopular side of a vote . The cries of " intransigence " faded somewhat once Lodge had won his point . But in the great hubbub , few stopped to realize that by holding to a firm policy , the U.S. had resisted a tempting form of appeasement - and thus probably contributed solidly to any genuine settlement to be made in Asia ( if the Communists really want one ) .                  @ @ @
