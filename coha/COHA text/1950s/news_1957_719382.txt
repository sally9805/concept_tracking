txt Secretary of State Dulles said today that next week 's conference of the North Atlantic Council would be devoted essentially to a renewal of a spirit of unity . Mr. Dulles will leave Thursday for the Paris sessions after attending a National Security Council meeting . The Secretary indicated that at the " quite unique " gathering of heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the specifics of military planning and of political problems would be subordinated to " ' renewed dedication to the principle of interdependence . " He said the most important single result of the meeting should be " an elevation again of the members of NATO to the conception of the importance of co-operative action . " The importance of the fact that the heads of government were gathering for the first time , he declared , is that " it brings to the top of every Goveminent a fresh sense of unity , fellowship and need , which is more surely manifested thereafter in the activities of the Government itself . " But forty-five minutes of questioning at Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elicit the outlines of a United States program of specific action . The Secretary said he could not make a " preshowing " of what the United States would propose at the meeting of the fifteen Allies , which opens Monday . The most precise point he made was that he believed greater use could be made of the industrial potential of Europe , including West Germany , manufacturing " some of these new weapons " for NATO . He added that he hoped the subject would be explored with " positive results , " Urges Consultation Habit Mr. Dulles discussed these additional viewpoints in connection with the meeting : ( ) Consultation among the Allies should be strengthened and broadened and " has got to become a habit . " ( ) However , consultation can not be made a rigid rule of requirement nor can NATO sessions reach conclusions about non-NATO countries . ( ) The alliance must be flexible and change to meet the challenge of new weapons and of what he termed economic warfare being conducted by the Soviet Union . As one means of meeting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy 's Foreign Minister , Giuseppe Pella , that payments on Marshall Plan loans be used to set up a fund for economic development of the Middle East . Disputing assertions by Democratic leaders in Congress that there was not enough sense of urgency in the Administration 's planning , Mr. Dulles said that such a view was contraverted by the very fact that the United States was participating in the heads-of-government meeting . An effort such as the forthcoming one to revitalize NATO " is going to have to be done every five or six years , " Mr. Dulles said . He rejected the widespread notion that to do so , 1 some sacrifice of sovereignty by NATO members would be necessary . It is an exercise of sovereignty rather than an abandonment of it , he continued , when a nation places its forces under the command of officers of another nationality or when it submits its national policies " to the scrutiny of others . " " That is quite an important innovation in international affairs , " he said . " It does not involve an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what you will . But the fact that you subject your policies to scrutiny and comment is an extremely important thing . " He conceded that the United States had not consulted its NATO allies , other than France and Britain , on the problem of supplying arms to Tunisia , though he said that was " perhaps " the kind of problem on which there could be consultation . Basic United States policy had been known for at least two month ; he noted , and had riot been " criticized or objected to by anyone . " He asserted that the United States was " prepared to lay before the NATO Council our policies with respect to any part of the world , " Denying reports that he had abandoned hope of limiting any war and , intended to warn the Allies of this , Mr. Dulles said there was no need " to eliminate the concept of local aggression anywhere or to eliminate preparation for local aggression .
