<P> President Paul Magloire , Haiti 's burly , beaming Chief of State , last week welcomed some new foreign friends to his capital and sent some old domestic enemies on their travels . In Port-au-Prince one morning , he draped the Haitian Order of Honor and Merit around the neck of Edward G. Miller Jr. , chief of the U.S. State Department 's Latin American affairs section under the Truman Administration . At noon the same day he welcomed to Haiti Sir Hugh Foot , K.C.V.O. , Governor of Jamaica , and Lady Foot . <P> Sir Hugh was the first Jamaican chief executive to touch what is now Haitian soil since Acting Governor Sir Henry Morgan , the respectably retired pirate , was shipwrecked on French Hispaniola 279 years ago . In Sir Hugh 's honor , the Foreign Minister put on an elegant ball , and the tall , slim governor gamely accommodated his swooping waltz style to the intricacies of the Haitian meringue . <P> While Sir Hugh laid wreaths and visited museums , some other travelers inconspicuously departed from Haiti . Senator Marcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eluded arrest three weeks earlier by having himself smuggled into the Mexican embassy rolled up in a rug , received a safe-conduct from the President and flew off to Mexico . Three lesser oppositionists , like Hrard charged with plotting to overthrow the government , left the Panamanian embassy and headed for Cuba . But 25 others , caught by the cops , still languished in jail .
