THE OUTSIDER ( 405 pp. ) - Richard Wright-Harper ( $3.95 ) . <P> When Novelist Richard Wright was a teen-ager in the South , he once forged a note and handed it to the local librarian : " Please let this nigger boy have the following books . " Among the books he wanted was Dostoevsky 's Poor People . From his own bitter experience of life , young Wright already knew just about all there was to know about poor people ; he was looking for other kinds of **25;9105;TOOLONG for young writers . In Dostoevsky he found his eye-opener , and in world Communism his herald . Less than 20 years later , Moscow 's critics were comparing Mississippi 's Richard Wright to his Russian model . <P> It was Native Son that prompted the comparison , a powerful , brutal reminder of black resentment and confusion in a white man 's capitalistic world . It made Wright at 31 a world-famed author and the literary darling of the Communists . His new novel , The Outsider , will hardly add to his reputation on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damon , a Chicago Negro mail carrier ( Wright was once a post-office clerk in Chicago ) . Cross , a discontented man with a vast appetite for sex and drink , is married , but separated from his wife Gladys and their three children . His newest sweetheart is pregnant , under the age of consent , and threatening him with jail if he does n't divorce his wife and marry her . His wife Gladys feels well rid of Cross but wo n't divorce him . His dilemma is solved by a subway accident . Cross heads for New York . <P> In Harlem , Cross gets tangled up with the Communist Party , but sees through it almost at once . In quick succession he kills two top Communists as well as his landlord . The wife of one of the Communists , a white woman , becomes his mistress , but commits suicide when Cross is exposed as a murderer . <P> Novelist Wright , now disillusioned with his Communist friends , writes from the thesis that Cross Damon , weakling and murderer , is the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fear and peopled by despairing creatures who have quit on life . Damon , he says , could be any man , black or white , not just a pushed-around Negro . Moreover , Wright argues , the whole world , including the U.S. , is getting worse and is in for a totalitarian age . The Soviet Union-though he now rejects it-is not much worse than any place else . As a novelist , Wright has resorted to so much ludicrous coincidence , unlikely conversation and soapbox bombast that his story becomes a bore . <P> While Wright sits out the threat of totalitarianism in Paris , an abler U. S. Negro novelist sees the problem of his race differently . Says Ralph ( Invisible Man ) Ellison : " After all , my people have been here for a long time ... It is a big wonderful country , and you ca n't just turn away from it because some people decide it is n't your country . "                    @
