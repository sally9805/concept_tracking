WHEN the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . c onsum a ted their well-advertised merger last week , it also Marked the twentieth month of the C. I. 0 . strike at Kohler . The pickets in front of the plant are filled with buoyant hopes  --  and gaping questions . Does " unity " mean that all A. F. of L. teamsters will no longer , make deliveries in or out of Kohler ? Does it mean that A. F. of L. longshoremen will refuse to unload clay for the struck plant , or that A. F. of L. plumbers will refuse to install the company 's products ? For the Kohler pickets such unity would spell decisive victory , and if this were the substance of the A. F. of L.-C . I. 0 . wedding it would evoke unlimited enthusiasm down at the grass roots . At the moment , however , such unity is merely distant vision . What has taken place is simply a " merger " ? or , in the picturesque term made famous by John L. Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the lowest form of unity possible ; in fact , only the first small step . For effective labor unity  --  the kind that the Kohler pickets pray for - therewould have to be at least three additional steps : 1 . Unification of rival groups , such as the A. F. of L. electrical workers with C. I. 0 . ' s I. U. E. ; A. F. of L. retail clerks with C. I. 0 . retail and wholesale workers , the two A. F. of L. paper unions with the one in the C. I. 0. , the airplane division of the C. I. 0 . auto workers With the airplane division of the A. F. of L. machinists , and many others . 2 . A no-raiding pact signed by all the affiliates , and a clear definition of jurisdiction . 3 . An agreement for mutual help between all international unions , particularly as regards respecting each other 's picket lines and joint efforts to organize the unorganized . Take these three steps and you ? - - have real labor unity . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of American labor but of American society as well . It would assure organized labor of twenty to thirty million more employees in the retail , white collar , chemical , and agricul tural field , as well as in that citadel of the open shop , the South . It would assure a considerable raising of living standards , and a new political importance for labor . But at the moment these are all consummations devoutly to be wished . Rival international unions , under the merger agreement , are " urged " . to unite but not required to ( , do so . Very few show any enthusiasm for the prospect . For many years anyway they will remain warring and divided . It is certain , for instance , that the rival electrical unions will not merge . Neither will-the rival retail unions . C. I. 0 . packinghouse and A. F. , of L. butcher workmen continue talks and blow hot and cold alternately , but the chances of fusion are more negative than positive . The rival chemical , seamen , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brides or bridegrooms . Each - Limon presents unity formulas which would clip its rival 's wings . The A. F. of L. retail clerks have suggested to the C. I. 0 . retail and wholesale - workers that it would be willing to merge with the retail unions in the C. I. 0 . group . But the latter has bakeries , candy factories , soup factories , warehouses , and what not , along with retail employees . It would not only have to leave behind scores of local unions , but would actually have to divide and atomize many others . C. I. 0 . packinghou  --  e workers and A. F. of L. butchers are evidently agreed that there will be a separate department for retail butchers and another for packinghouse workers . But how much autonomy shall be given the packinghouse group which will be dominated by C. I. 0. - forces ? The C. I. 0 . packinghOuse union is organizing in a wide variety of fields , including sugar , agriculture , candy factories . What happens to these forces in a possible merger ? How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrim ' ination ? C. I. 0 . packinghouse workers have done an excellent job in race relations ; they are almost fanatic on the subject . The A. F. of L. , group , on the other hand , has some jimcrow locals in it . Such are the problems of unification . They disturb power structures built up over decades . Leaders of the international unions are what C. Wright Mills has called the " new men of power . " Few of them arewilling to trade their status of big fish in a little pond for smaller fish in a bigger pond . The merger at federation level is relatively simple because fewer power structures are involved . Perhaps that is what made Merger possible . Hitherto the rival Wit groups tried to patch the whole house of labor together before agreeing to unite . Today they have decided on a more modest handiwork ; they have dug ' the ground for the basement  --  no more  --  and will wait for the house itself to fall into place over a period of years . The A. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , essentially lobbying forces , mere servicing bodies , not real seats of power. - They coordinate legislative action , do some research and education , handle relations with foreign unions , organize political action of a rudimentary sort . But they have no power over individual union members and play no role in the central activity of labOr , collective bargaining . They can only " advise " international unions ; they ' can not instruct . On the other hand , the leaders of internationals by and large have " life and death " say over local unions and the rank and file . They can expel lower officials , veto or call strikes , conduct bargaining sessions , withdraw charters . Each international is autonomous ; in today 's labor structure it , rather than the A. F. of L. or C. I. 0 as such , is the power center . So long , therefore , sas the rival internationals do not unite , there can be no effective unity . THAT the rivalry will continue is evident from the fate of the no-raiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration of all jurisdictional disputes between rival unions . But it becomes effective for each international only when it signs the agreement . So far about two out of every three internationals have done so , but the most important union in either federation , the A. F. of L. teamsters , has refused to sign . For all practical purposes this tor-pedoes the pact . Teamster President Beck and the new power behind the scenes , Jimmy Hoffa , are forging into a dozen fields . They are in fact building a counter-center to the new merged center , making alliances on an ad hoc and individual basis . For instance , they have agreements for common organization programs with the A. F. of L. butcher workmen in the food-processing fields , and with the A. F. of L. machinists in the auto-repair and related areas . In these instances the Teamsters scrup-ulously respect the agreed-upon jur-isdictional fines . On the other hand , Tearaater unions have on more than one occasion raided the A. F ? of L. retail clerks , whom they consider " enemies . " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new merged federation plans organization efforts in many , virgin fields . The , Teamsters claim jurisdiction over warehousing and many other , activities which are bound to create problems so long as there is no machinery for resolving disputes . ? There is , finally , the ideological obstacle to true unity  --  the lack of labor solidarity . For most of the old-line unionists , solidarity is a dead letter . They help or support other unions only when they are allied or friendly with their leaderships . The Teamsters respect picket lines on some occasions , deliberately walk through on others . The same is true of the building-trade unions and many others . Here is perhaps the most serious defect of the whole labor movement . It affects intraunion democracy , idealism , and in fact labor 's whole structure and outlook . It is a symptom of the dictatorship and centralization in so many unions which make possible the perversion of the principle ' of labor unity by the opportunism of leadership alliance . In political action particularly , the failure to practice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be based , is fatal . Yet the A. F. of L.-C . I. 0 . merger does not even touch on this problem ; it obviously could not . We have here an insight into the mechanics and reasons for merger . ' If the participants had insisted on true labor unity  --  on the reshuffling of power structures , on changing ideological outlooks  --  there would have been no merger . The merger takes place precisely because it is the Undoubtedly here was justification enough , but for the real motivating factor we must look elsewhere . The reason for the merger , and at the same time as , tragedy , is that the C. I. 0 . zs in the process of disintegration . The C. I. 0 . , is uniting at the lowest point of its bargaining power . When the first attempt at unity was made back in 1937 , C.I.O. was riding high . From a mere 900,000 members when it left the A. F. of L. in 1937 , it had mushroomed to 3,700,000 . It was then larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt 's White House ; it had captured the imagination of many millions of unorganized ; it was staffed with hundreds of idealistic young radicals who were - Willing to walk picket lines and who knew how to bring out the latent militancy of American labor . Today the C. I. 0. , according to its own over-estimated figure , is only five million strong . Its elan is gone . Since the first flush of the 1935-1940 period , it has had no sensational organizational successes . It has grown with the economy , but hardly more . The young radicals of yesterday are middle-aged pork choppers today , far removed from the Socialists , Trotskyists , Wobblies , Stalinists , and Lovestonelles with whom they consorted in the thirties . And they no longer work around the clock or dream the dream that inspired them in that long ago when America was digging itself out of the enervating depression . The C. I. 0 . is not identical with the A. F. of L. : it has no racketeer .. problem ; it has more democratic aspects than the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Teamsters . But it lacks verve and vigor . Since the big organizing drive , in auto , steel , rubber , oil , and packing it ss- has muffed the ball in the South and in a dozen other fields . Politically December 10 , 1955 49.5 and organizationally it has blended closer to the mentality and make-up of the older federation . Even the wages of its organizers and top officials have slowly inched themselves up toward the $30,000 , $50,000 and , $70,000 standards of the older elite . The eleven Communist-controlled unions were expelled in 1949 , and the C. I. 0 . has been asserting its allegiance to the free-enterprise system with fervor nearly equal to that of the A. F. of L. Thus the gaps between the- two federations , which in 1935 appeared unbridgeable , have now been bridged . Industrial unionism , political action , organization of the unorganized  --  these pillars of C. I. 0 . policy no Ichiger make the difference between the groups . The A. F. of L. too has its industrial unions . The A. F. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party . And neither A. F. of L. nor C. I. 0 . has scored any real successes for more than a decade in organizing the unorganized . The groundwork for unity has been there for at least ten years . Only the power drives of a few men kept the movements apart ; since the war the only real question has been . who will get posts , who will keep the power when and if merger comes about ? Now the , C. I. 0 . is " returning to the house of labor . " For the long run Walter Reuther has great hopes and daring plans ; but at this historical juncture he is being married at the point of a shotgun in the hand of David McDonald , the conservative president of the C. I. 0 . Steelworkers . McDonald 's enmity for the irrepressible redhead is painful to behold . At a Jewish Labor Commit- tee dinner some time ago McDonald spent the major pOrtion of his speech berating Reuther and his " socialism . " Ever since Reuther became C. I. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with McDonald has threatened to blow the organization sky high . Finally , when McDonald threatened to take his union into the A. F. of L. , Reuther had no other course but to step up the pace for merger . The C. I. 0 . is being brought into the A , F. of L. structure as a kind of in- , dustrial-union department on terms similar to those discussed in 1937 , but with its flag at half-mast . The C. I. 0 . weakneSs was evident throughout the preliminary fencing for position . The A. F. of L. takes the two top positions with President Meany and , Secretary-Treasurer Schnitzler ; it dominates the Executive Council , the Executive Committee , and the General Policy Board-composed of all international union presidents . The argument over the merger name is indicative of the whole process . The C. I. 0 . people wanted a blended name which would advertise merger  --  something like American Congress of Labor . But A. F. of L. leaders refused to yield ; the best they would agree to was to tack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider to " American Federation of Labor . " Everywhere the welcome mat for the C. I. 0 . is more like a funeral shroud . Throughout the country the C. I. 0 . is being relegated to second-class citizenship . Naturally in cities like Detroit , where C. I. 0 . strength is overwhelming , this will be impossible ; but the trend is there . The schism between Reuther and McDonald , subordinated for the moment , plagues the C. I. 0 . even in this transition period . Many A. F. of L. officials , have cemented alliances with Steelworker leaders in the hopes of freezing out the autoworker group . PRESUMABLY Reuther feels that these are inevitable blows in the shakedown period , that he must give considerable ground  --  and wait . Reuther will have charge of organizing the unorganized . His auto workers have already pledged $1 per member , , $1,250,000 , to start the job rolling if others will also respond , and with the prestige that comes from bringing in new forces  --  provided he can do it ? Reuther hopes again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . first to the head of the Auto Workers and then the C. I. O. itself . Enormously confident , Reuther permits no one to " turn his left end . " He knows how to talk radical even when his actions are not so radical ; and how to respond to the pressures of the workers . Yielding ground to Meany is for him only an episode in a future regroupment of labor around himself . During the " waiting period " there will be a realignment . It is already in the making . McDonald 's Steelworkers will undoubtedly gravitate toward a more conservative axis , probably with Dave Beck 's Teamsters . On the other hand , such unions as David Dubinsky 's Ladies Garment Workers and Al Hayes 's Machinists , both now in the A F. of L. , may become part of Reuther 's C. I. 0 . department . What happens after these realignments ? Will Reuther 's position become stronger , or will there be a new split ? Is it possible that a realignment will extend beyond all the present participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought together the Center ; Lewis , Hillman et al , and the Left , Socialists , Stalinists , etc . The extent of the present realignments will depend in the final analysis on the objective situation . If we are in for an inflationary spiral and prosperity , then organization efforts will be much simpler and wage prospects brighter . If we are in for " leveling " and unemployment , the prospects are reversed . The question of war and peace will also cast its long shadow over the inner workings of the labor movement . The merger is merely an episode in a bigger saga . Though welcome , it is hardly more than a step ; certainly not a goal in itself . The important thing is what happens after merger. ,
