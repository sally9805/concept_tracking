For 14 centuries the Greek Orthodox monastery of Saint Catherine has stood serene and safe beneath the shoulder of Mount Sinai . Founded in 527 by the Emperor Justinian , it is in one of the world 's most inhospitable places . A traveler must drive 100 miles southeast from Suez across jagged wilderness , then turn off along a succession of dry stream beds for an eight-hour climb to the gates , 5,000 feet above the Red Sea . Its one tiny door swings open only for men bearing letters of introduction from the Greek Archbishop of Cairo . <P> The few travelers who reached it came back with reports of a fabulous treasure-trove of art hidden behind its 50-ft. - thick walls . But no one was allowed to photograph or even to catalogue it . Then last year a team of scholars and technicians , jointly sponsored by Princeton , Michigan , and Alexandria universities , got permission to make the first complete record of Mount Sinai 's treasures . This week TIME publishes an unprecedented sampling of the expedition 's finds . <P> Sacred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were 3,000 manuscripts , many illuminated . In the apse of the basilica there was a 6th century Transfiguration of Christ , 20 feet across , one of the earliest , most splendid , and best preserved of all Byzantine mosaics . There were more than 2,000 ancient icons , by far the world 's largest and also greatest collection . <P> The fact that so huge a stockpile of ancient art has survived is in part due to the fact that , remote and detached , Mount Sinai has long been a still point in a turning world . It marks a spot sacred to three religions : Judaism , Christianity and Islam . There Moses heard the voice of Yahweh out of the burning bush , commanding him to go down to Egypt and set Israel free . On the journey to the Promised Land , Moses stopped again at Sinai , climbed to the peak and received the Tablets of the Law . Among Christians , Mount Sinai is also revered as the shrine and resting place of Saint Catherine of Alexandria . To Moslems , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the peak , the camel bearing Mohammed to heaven left the imprint of one foot . <P> The site of Mount Sinai at the confluence of contending religions was responsible for the fact that the monastery contains nearly all the icons which survive from before the 8th century . In 726 , the Emperor Leo the Isaurian ordered all icons within the Byzantine realm destroyed to discourage idolatry . Only those at Mount Sinai escaped , since the monastery had fallen under Omayyad rule . The Moslems left the monastery in peace ; in return , the monks allowed the Moslems to build a mosque within the monastery . <P> New Window . For Princeton Professor Kurt Weitzmann , 55 , the expedition fulfilled a long-frustrated dream . He first tried to get to the monastery in 1932 , but was turned back by an attack of typhus . A second try was stymied by the start of World War II , and a third by the Suez crisis .

The expedition packed in their own food supplies , since the 13 monks that keep the monastery can not spare any food from the sparse yield of their parched garden patch .
