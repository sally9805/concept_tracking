Barging into Charleston , W.Va. for his first big speech on behalf of Adlai Stevenson , the coal miners ' John L. Lewis faced an unexpected and thoroughly embarrassing predicament . From Washington had just come news that the Wage Stabilization Board had cut the $1.90 daily-wage increase agreed upon by the mine operators and the United Mine Workers ' soft coal diggers . WSB 's ruling : $1.50 . <P> It was a most unkind cut ; the grey-maned U.M.W. boss apparently guessed it would not happen , especially after he aligned himself solidly with the Democrats . Besides , he might have had in mind the Truman Administration 's partiality to the steelworkers earlier this year . <P> The man who made Lewis guess wrong was WSB Chairman Archibald Cox , a Harvard Law School professor . Explaining his . board 's action , Cox said : " The real issue before us , in this case , is whether we shall now abandon the fight against inflation . . . Our decision is against such a step . . . " The coal miners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those granted to steel , rubber , auto and other workers . <P> Economic Stabilization Administrator Roger Putnam , who had tried vainly to get the WSB to postpone its decision for further study , put the best face on the decision when it came and acclaimed the board 's " real courage . " Lewis lumbered into a strategy huddle with his top aides , lumbered out again to deliver his pro-Democrat oration as promised ( " cast aside and push away . . . the alluring Republican names " ) , without a mention of the WSB decision . <P> Lewis ' only comment on the decision was to say later : " This is a solemn day . " And it was , for this week 300,000 of the nation 's 375,000 soft coal miners walked out in protest against the WSB 's decision . Having lost two months ' steel production , the nation was now faced with the prospect of another crippling shutdown of defense industry ( though the prospect was not immediate ; the amount of coal above ground is larger than usual ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel strike , was the result of unsuccessful Government interference in free collective bargaining .
