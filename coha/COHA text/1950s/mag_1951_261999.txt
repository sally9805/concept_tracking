Scarce and expensive drugs are the potential jackpot payoffs of pharmaceutical chemistry . Right now one of the most valuable is the steroid hormone , cortisone , which sells at wholesale for $23 a gram . Reason : under present commercial methods , it takes the bile from 1,000 tons of cattle to make a month 's supply of cortisone for a single arthritis patient . <P> In the great chemists ' drive to synthesize cortisone , some researchers start at the beginning with simple ingredients ( TIME , May 7 ) , others are trying to make the magic drug out of complex vegetable substances , which contain the building blocks of cortisone . <P> Chemical Trick . Some hormones are not difficult to make in this way . Syntex Inc. of Mexico City , for example , has been making sex hormones ( testosterone , progesterone , etc. ) out of an inedible wild yam called cabeza de negro , which yields a substance containing the four-ringed steroid nucleus . But cortisone is tougher . For one thing , its molecule has an oxygen atom attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to place that oxygen in the correct spot is a difficult chemical trick . <P> Last week Syntex announced that a group of its chemists headed by Dr. George Rosenkranz had at last accomplished the feat , starting with diosgenin from cabeza de negro . They transformed it by 18 chemical steps to " Reichstein 's Compound D , * which had been found in minute quantities in the adrenal gland , but had never been synthesized . Only three more steps were needed to turn this compound into cortisone . <P> Within a year , says Syntex , it hopes to make as much yam cortisone as is now produced from cattle bile . In three years , when its new $2,000,000 plant is finished , it hopes to supply enough cortisone for the entire U.S. demand. * <P> New Code Words . If all this works out ( there may be unforeseen difficulties ) , it is good news for those patients who are helped by cortisone . Perhaps even more promising is another aspect of the Syntex accomplishment . The steroid hormones are , in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells of the body . They are all very similar , built around the same nucleus , but the slightest difference ( such as the shift of an oxygen atom from one carbon atom to another ) changes their effect . Medical researchers would like to try hundreds of steroids to see what each can do to make the body work properly . <P> The Syntex process produces , along the line , whole classes of promising steroid compounds . Some of them have been found in adrenal glands , but in quantities too small for practical experimenting . Now , says Syntex , these " cortisone precursors " can be made in any amount desired . Some of them may prove more potent biologically than cortisone itself . <P> <P> *Chemical name : Allopregnane-3 beta , 17 alpha , 21-triol-n , 20-dione. *Which is growing steadily . Newest use : Pediatrician Lawson Wilkins of Johns Hopkins reported last week in Seattle that girls who show marked outward signs of masculinity ( pseudo-hermaphrodites ) respond magically to small doses of the hormone . They shed facial hair , develop curves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
