txt Communist China 's admission to the United Nations , once that nation is purged of aggression , was proposed tonight by Sir Gladwyn Jebb . It was suported by Dag Hammarskjold , Secretary General of the world organization . Sir Gladwyn , until recently British representative at the United Nations , urged the United States to accept the principle of " universality " in making the United Nations a true world forum in which peace could ? ' be won . At United Nations headquarters in New York , Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , the United , States : representative , said he would not " shrink " from using the veto if necessary to keep Peiping out.1 The Communist Government should represent China as soon as the majority of the United Nations members believe it has abandoned aggression in Korea or Indo-China , Sir Gladwyn asserted . Reflect Foreign Policy Only if all powers , Communist and non-Communist , discuss great worldissues can " constructive action of ideas " take place , he told the Pilgrims , a society dedicated to the fostering of Anglo-American friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed that the Western world and the Communist world meet around the United Nations conference table and " all the representatives of the main centers of power must be there . " The British diplomat said his impressions of the United Nations were " personal . " However , Sir Gladwyn is Ambassadordesignate to Prance and his views are believed to reflect the : longterm thinking of the makers of British foreign policy . Sir Gladwyn also pleaded vigorously for : West Germany 's equality in the Western world , with future membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . 11Stronger - support for France and a greater realization of that country 's " splendid civilization " and its contribution to the spirit of man . Common economic policies for the British Commonwealth and the United States for the " welfare of the human race and for the raising of the standard of living throughout the world . " Reviewing his four years at , the United Nations , Sir Gladwyn advanced two salient conclusions on the organization 's effectiveness . The first is that because of the restrictions imposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Security Council can not at present be relied upon to cope with any aggression other than a minor one in which the interests of-the great powers are , not engaged . " Forum for Settlement But  --  and it was on this " but " that Sir Gladwyn developed his more hopeful thesis  --  the most important function of the United Nations , that of a forum for peaceful settlement , remains , the Briton added . After recalling the United Nations successes in this field , Sir Gladwyn stressed the Indian initiative on the issue of Korean prisoners of war . Without this Indian proposal hostilities in Korea would have gone on longer than they did , he declared . This demonstrated what the process of peaceful settlement can achieve , the British diplomat said , and showed the " unwisdom of those who maintain that the United Nations would be better off without Communists and that " it bad better be transformed , if . possible , into nothing more or less than an anti-Communist alliance . " If , this occurred , Sir Gladwyn asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both disputes and possible middlemen would have been removed . Finds U. S. Overly Cautions Although he found much to praise in the United States ' willingness to resist aggression in Korea and to endure " great sacrifices , " Sir Gladwyn found Americans unduly cautious and suspicious in their approach to the United Nations as a forum for peaceful settlement . The British diplomat then expressed a belief that observers believe to be at the bottom of British Governmental thinking about the world struggle with the Communist bloc . " We are just not going to defeat Communism by physical means , necessary though it may be to defend ourselves and the whole free world by such methods , " Sir Gladwyn declared . Another world war would not eliminate communism but would be more likely to extend it universally , perhaps uner another name , he added . " Somehow or other we have got to learn how to get on in this world with governments we dislike and whose disappearance we should be the first to applaud if it could be accomplished by means other than war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his new pest in Paris will be the " incorporation in some manner agreeable to France of Germany in our Atlantic community , " Sir Gladwyn said . It is some time since a highranking British diplomat has spoken of France with the respect and warmth employed by the Ambassador-designate . Here , he said , is a " vital " link in the free world , ' one to which the West looks " for the cool analysis , the fertile idea , the humane conception . " It is for Britain , her- nearest neighbor , Sir Glad= wyn asserted , to see to ' it that France " has her rightful share in the scheme of things , and together with her to combat that defeatist neurosis which since the war has hung like a cloud over EurOpe . " Anglo-American relations are better than they sometimes seem , the diplomat asserted . Americans , as a whole , 40 not think the British spend their time appeasing Communists ; nor do the Britons believe they are in danger of being dominated by Wall ? treet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the one country is done for without the other economically , the second is done for without the first strategically , " the Ambasfirst strategically , " he added . Mr. Hammarskjold emphasized that the full participation of Communist nations in the United Nations discussions was necessary to establish lasting peace . He hailed the presence of Communist China at the " difficult " Geneva conference next month . The Geneva negotiations must not be allowed to lapse , he emphasized , should an early solution of the Korean peace treaty prove impossible . " It is inherent in the United Nations approach that the Western world and the Communist world meet regularly around the conference table , " Ma Hammerskjold said . " If the world organization IS a ' sheer necessity ' in President Eisenhower 's words and the ' heart 's desire ' in Sir Winston Churchill 's , then the main , representatives of all the main centers of power must be there , " the Secretary General declared . " Otherwise , it is not a world organization . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
