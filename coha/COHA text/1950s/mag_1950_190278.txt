From the Portland Oregonian : <P> BILLY GRAHAM WARNS STALIN <P> <P> Time to Compromise <P> After nine weeks of futile negotiations to end the strike on New York 's World-Telegram and Sun , Federal Labor Mediator Walter Maggiolo decided the time had come to talk turkey . Said Maggiolo : " The strike has gone too far for either side to win a clear-cut victory . There will have to be a compromise . " <P> Last week Maggiolo persuaded both sides to settle down to intensive , almost continuous negotiations to work one out . In one room in his offices he put W.T. &; S. reprsentatives . Newspaper Guild negotiators were put in another room near by . Maggiolo and fellow mediators shuttled back &; forth between the rooms , relaying terms . At 5:15 a.m. one day last week , the dog-tired , red-eyed negotiators finally came to terms . As they shook hands , World-Telly Managing Editor B. O. McAnney said : " I am very happy that both sides have reached an agreement we can live under . " As such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Safe for a Year . The chief issue of the strike , ' the largest major walkout in Guild history , was union arid job security . In the end , the Guild negotiators settled for the same offer that management had made a month ago , which a group of rebel Guilds-men had tried to get the Guild to accept ( TIME , Aug. 14 ) . The job-security clause permits arbitration of contested firings , with dismissals to be made only " for good and sufficient cause . " <P> The strikers won a management promise to make no economy staff cuts for a year . Said Thomas Murphy , executive vice president of the New York Guild : " Even if the Telly loses 50% of its advertising , no one can be laid off for a year . " Salaries were also to be boosted . The pre-strike minimum salaries had run from $36 to $110 a week . It was reported that under the proposed agreement they would range from $39 to $120-just about what the strikers had demanded . But the 10% general wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average increase of about 6% . <P> The agreement would not go into effect until the strikers voted on it . If they approved it , the W.T. &; S. would probably be back on the streets in about a week . <P> Gone for Good ? The strike had been costly for both sides . The 400 striking Guildsmen together with the 1,000 A.F.L. printers , stereotypers and pressmen who had refused to cross Guild picket lines had already lost upwards of $1,000,000 in wages . The World-Telegram and Sim had lost a huge amount in advertising and circulation revenue . But the full cost of the strike to management was still an unknown quantity . While the W.T. &; S. was off the newsstands , New York 's two other evening papers had both increased their daily circulation . It was estimated that the Post had jumped about 110,000 and the Journal-American about 70,000 . The early evening edition of the morning Herald Tribune was believed to have sold about 40,000 extra papers daily .
