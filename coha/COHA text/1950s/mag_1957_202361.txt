" There is nothing worse , " contended Ohio 's James Middleton Cox , " than an invertebrate publisher . " Stocky , round-faced Jim Cox was one of the higher vertebrates in a generation of publishers that included such well-spined warriors as William Randolph Hearst , Joseph Pulitzer and Colonel Robert McCormick . As a journalist , he practiced his preachment that newspapers " should tell the truth as only intellectual honesty can discern the truth . " As a politician , Democrat Cox was also notable for intellectual honesty . And he almost achieved the classic American cycle : born on a log-cabin farm , he got to be a Congressman and Ohio 's governor ; he was his party 's presidential candidate in 1920 , ran a good race in a bad season for Democrats . <P> Yet when he died last week at 87 , James Cox did not land on many front pages . His was " not a familiar name to the modern generation , " explained Fellow Publisher John S. Knight in a warmly felt eulogy , " but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this century . " <P> Loser for the League . First and last , " Fighting Jimmy " Cox was a newspaperman . At 28 , he was already an influential publisher who took pride in the fact that his Dayton Daily News had racked up more than $1,000,000 in libel suits by its hard-hitting reporting . All the suits were later dropped . After buying the Miami Daily News in 1923 , he covered Badman Al Capone 's local activities so thoroughly that a gangster syndicate offered Cox $5,000,000 for the paper . The offer was turned down . <P> At 69 , Publisher Cox took on what he called " my largest enterprise , " by paying $3,500,000 for the Atlanta evening Journal and its rival , the Georgian , on which Hearst had lost $10 million in 27 years . Merging the two papers , Cox successfully battled " the dangerous and disgraceful regime " of Governor Eugene Talmadge . He was 79 when he bought Atlanta 's other daily , the morning Constitution . Asked , like Lewis Carroll 's Father William , how he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running water never grows stagnant . " <P> A onetime political reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer , Newsman Cox was overwhelmingly elected to Congress from Ohio 's Third District in 1908 and 1910 , fought hard for such causes as tariff reduction and antitrust laws , later became Ohio 's only three-term governor . In the 1920 presidential campaign he promised ailing Woodrow Wilson : " We are going to be a million percent with you and your administration . That means the League of Nations . " But in Warren Gamaliel Harding , able Orator Cox and his running mate , Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( a young man he later came to differ with in political philosophy ) , faced an Ohio publisher whose easygoing ways eminently suited the times . Cox carried only eleven Southern states . Jim Cox vowed never again to seek public office-and in 1945 turned down the offer of an Ohio Senate seat . " I was still in public life , " he explained . " I had my newspapers . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
