In Paris last week , after arguing the point for 18 months , representatives of French Painter Maurice Utrillo finally convinced a court that he had not painted some 30 pictures bearing his name . The bogus Utrillos , the court decided , had been put in circulation by Jean Pinson-Berthet , ex-partner of Utrillo 's art dealer . The damage to Utrillo 's up &; down reputation was set at 2,000,000 francs ( $5,714 ) . Pinson-Berthet , who had disappeared , was sentenced to five years imprisonment .
