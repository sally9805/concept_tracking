Two doctors who ran a careful , scientific study on 159 sniffling children , victims of the common cold , told last week what they found to be the best treatment . Grandma and the horse &; buggy doctor were right , they concluded . The most effective answer is bed rest , with plenty of fluids and maybe aspirin ; the modern wonder drugs do more harm than good . <P> At Children 's Memorial Hospital in Chicago , Drs . Howard S. Traisman and L. Martin Hardy reported to the Illinois State Medical Society , 55 of the children got only the old-fashioned treatment ; 37 got a sulfa drug in addition , and similar groups received one of two antibiotics . Children in the standard-treatment group got well faster than the others ; when they had complications ( such as ear infections and pneumonia ) , these showed up sooner and were cleared up earlier with the proper drugs . <P> The doctors believed that the sulfas and antibiotics delayed the appearance of complications and may have masked them so that they became harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given for the cold itself , but saved for possible complications . <P> Said Dr. Hardy : " It is a sad commentary on our professional integrity and honesty when antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agents are prescribed for an undefined illness in order to placate anxious parents and allay our own insecurity . " <P> . . . . . . . <P> Dr. Pierce Theobald , an ear , nose and throat specialist , added another count to the indictment . One kind of deafness is increasing , he believes , as a result of the haphazard use of antibiotics in colds . If there is a middle-ear infection , the drugs may mask it , and then part of the ear fills up with fluid anyway . If this is not drained , it may solidify and impair hearing . The only solution , said Dr. Theobald , is to puncture the eardrum and remove the substance .
