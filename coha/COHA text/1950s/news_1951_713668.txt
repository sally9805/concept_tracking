txt The Pennsylvania Railroad disclosed plans yesterday to install on its major passenger lines a $12,000,000 automatic train speed control system described by the railroad as " the most effective means of insuring maximum safety . " The new devices will automatically apply air brakes to enforce speed limitations and virtually eliminate man-failure as a cause of accidents on lines carrying twothirds of the road 's passenger service , James M. Symes , vice president in charge of operations , announced . They will go into service on all commuter lines in the metropolitan area , he added . Installation of the new system had been planned long before the Feb. 6 derailment of a commuter train at Woodbridge , N. J. , with a loss of eighty-four lives , Mr. Symes said . The new control device , he explained in response to questions , could have limited the wrecked train 's speed on the temporary spur to twenty-five miles an hour and , to the extent that speed was responsible for the disaster , might have prevented it . Earlier yesterday , a Pennsylvania attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad 's not guilty pleas to the eighty-four manslaughter indictments returned by a grand jury there Feb. 20 as a result of the deaths of passengers in the Woodbridge wreck . ' Middlesex County Judge Charles M. Morris set April 9 for the trial . At the line 's Pennsylvania Station offices , Mr. Symes told reporters the railroad would not comment on the causes of the Woodbridge wreck pending completion of Federal , state and local investigations , adding : " These people of the Pennsylvania Railroad its owners and employes are not indifferent to human safety as the recent indictment of their railroad implies . We deny this charge as vigorously as we know how , and are prepared to disprove it in court when an opportunity is given for a fair trial free from the natural emotional stress that-has thus far prevailed . " The Pennsylvania , he said , was the first to adopt automatic block signals and cab signal relays , and its over-all safety record for 1950 and for the preceding decade was bett'r than the national average for all railroads . The cab signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all heavily traveled passenger lines of the road , picks up electrical impulses from the track to activate a replica of the track-side signals in the cab of the locomotive . Failure of an engineer to observe a signal , he said , sets off a shrill whistle to alert engineman and fireman . Superimposed on this systemrthe new devices would activate automatically the train 's air brakes to bring the train down to the speed or stop  --  Indicated by the signal if the warning was ignored by the crew , he said . This , he said , was an improvement over the automatic train stop gear which brings a train to a sudden , shuddering halt if a signal is passed and which can be forestalled by the engine crew . The speed control system , he explained , prevented the engineer from increasing speed above the signaled limit . Installation of speed control where tracks already carry cab signal devices would be carried out first , at a dost of about $2,000,000 , he said . This will include abut 1,200 miles of heavy density lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh and Indianapolis and the metropolitan area commuter lines , carrying about 75,000,000 passengers annually . Other Lines to Get Devices A second phase , to cost an estimated $10,000,000 will put cab signal and speed control systems on other major passenger lines in the 10,000-mile system . The first of the new devices probably will be installed within two months , the railroad official said , and production will be in full swing in from six to nine months . The Union Switch and Signal Company , Swissvale , Pa. , will produce the new equipment . There were no current plans for installing the device on freight trains , he said , and he had no information as to whether the Central Railroad of New Jersey , which shares trackage on the Woodbridge line , planned to adopt it . Thus , unequipped trains still would be able to ignore signals , he conceded , but added : " At least it will keep our passenger trains from running into them . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
