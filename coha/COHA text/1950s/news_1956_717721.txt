txt figures are available . One study made at the University of North Carolina guessed that entire cost of the 1952 presidential election , primaries and all , was 150 million dollars . Most figures are only guesses . A Senate rules subcommittee in 1952 surveyed 3000 radio and TV stations and recorded a little under three million dollars spent on TV , and a little over three million dollars on radio . The Republicans spent 3.4 million dollars and the Democrats 2.5 millions . Reports of spending in the presidential phase of the 1952 contest  --  including radio and TV ? were 17.4 million dollars , and another 5.5 millions for congressional candidates , or a total of 23 million dollars . But such figures give returns of only certain groups . Most observers think a great deal more than this was spent by other groups , and in the preliminary primary fights . Loopholes in Law The 1956 election probably will cost more . Theoretically , campaign contributors are limited to certain amounts . Theoretically , also , Washington lobbyists are supposed to register and list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they actually may obscure matters more than clarify them . For instance , a candidate can have as many organizations working in his behalf as he wishes and a corporation or other contributor can give an amount up to the legal limit to each and all of them . The " legal limit " thus becomes almost meaningless . Again , when Washington lobbyists register under the 1946 Legislative Reorganization Act they find the provisions extraordinarily elastic . In the first four years of the act some 600 corporations reported campaign contributions of 71 million dollars and expenses of over 33 millions . Did this tell the real story ? Representative Frank Buchanan ( D ) of Pennsylvania , chair ' man of a special House committee , conducted a survey of 152 large corpora .. tions . Of these only 37 had filed reports under the act with expenditures of only 3776.000 to influence legislation . But the 152 corporations replying to the questionnaire reported 32 Mahon dollars for the same purpose This discrepancy could not be squared under the act .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
