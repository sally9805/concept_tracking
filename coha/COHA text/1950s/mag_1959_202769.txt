From his aerie in Switzerland , hawk-eyed Karl Barth , 72 , Europe 's most prestigious Protestant theologian , peers coolly at the Christian West . Last week U.S. Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr , 66 , glared right back . In the Christian Century , Niebuhr sharply answered Barth 's latest anti-West pronouncement-a 45-page pamphlet addressed to an anonymous pastor in East Germany who had asked for spiritual guidance . <P> Barth began by spraying a plague on " the forces and powers " of both East and West , but the plague on the West soon took precedence . " If there is such a thing as hostility toward Christ , " Barth said , " it does not exist in the Communist East alone . " The " evil spirit " manifests itself in the East as " open totalitarianism , backed by an all-powerful political party . " whereas in the West it takes the form of " creeping totalitarianism , backed by powerful institutions , such as press , private enterprise , public opinion and arrogant wealth . " Moreover , the Communist regime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God which fulfills a definite function according to the Lord 's plans : the function of a punishing rod ... " <P> Barth 's inquiring pastor had asked whether he should resort to prayer to ' ' pray away " East Germany 's Communist government . Replied Barth : " Would you really take the responsibility of approaching the Lord with such a plea ? Are n't you afraid that God might grant your request and that some morning you might wake up among those Egyptian fleshpots which symbolize the American way of life ? We in the West have been struggling for many a year with the powers and demons that hover over the land of the ' economic miracle ' meaning West Germany , this land which thoughtlessly joined NATO and proceeded to rearm . . . Pray for us as we pray for you . " <P> Theologian Niebuhr could not wholly discount Barth 's " above-the-battle Christian witness . " since " East and West alike are in equal condemnation by the real gospel . " Yet the price of this attitude can be " moral irrelevance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " praying away " Communism because God 's answer might be American " fleshpots . " Chided Niebuhr : " The dilemma is so deep that I would prefer to let the eminent theologian stew in it for a while , at least until he realizes that he is not the only prophet of the Lord . " Barth 's attitude " always involves the danger of speaking after the imagination of our own hearts . It is subject to Jeremiah 's condemnation about the false prophets. " * <P> More sharp words flared last week from Karl Barth 's son , Dr. Marcus Barth , 43 , of the University of Chicago 's Federated Theological Faculty . The younger Barth denounced U.S. Sunday schools for shunning reality with syrupy sermons that " Mama loves me . Papa loves me , teacher loves me , God loves me . This develops self-centered young egoists . " The schools even launder Bible stories so that " Egyptians never drowned , John the Baptist was not beheaded . " Urged Barth : " Even eight-year-olds can know that all the world is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the child . " <P>
