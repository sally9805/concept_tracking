txt The administration , badgered by continued farm surpluses , is prepared to resort to extraordinary measures to reduce farm production . It would remove whole farms from production by paying farmers to turn , their entire cropland over to government conservation projects . Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson , in hiS second sensational press conference within the past fortnight , has announced that the program is ber ing put into effect on a trial basis in four states ? Illinois , Maine , Nebraska , and Tennessee . Farmers Name Price The unusual feature of this new , bold attempt to beat the costly and uneconomic surplus problem is that farmers will name the price at which they are willing to enter into this contract with tlp government . " Bids , " they are called . The Department of Agriculture may accept or reject these bids , " on the basis of the lowest acceptable offers . " This differs from past practice in that , under the regular conservation reserve procedure , farmers have no opportunity to suggest a price , but are offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no doubt that the new plan was prompted-by the failure of the soil bank to pull any large amount of land out of production and reduce surpluses . Proposal by CED The all-out effort now will be to concentrate on the long-range , - conservation program as the better solution . Making it worth while for the farmer to put his whole farm to conservation crops will remove the incentive to turn remaining acres over to price-supported crops already in surplus . Secretary Benson 's announcement of the four-state " trial program " followed ? a similar proposal by the Committee on Economic Development . he CED estimated that the cost of retiring whole farms would be costly , but less costly in the long run than the present program . if the trial program proves successful , it Nv 1 I be extended to other states . To make the offer more attractive , the government will increase its maximum annual conservation reserve payment from $5,000 to $10,000 under the new " bid " procedure " thus enabling larger farms to participate with all eligible land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a very tentative , " trial " basis , that it offers real promise . The program , in essence , is seen as representing one of the most revolutionary ventures in agriculture . The effort to take whole farms out of ' crop pro- , duction appears to corroborate the often-repeated claim that the basic problem is one of too many farms and too many farmers . The administration already has taken initial steps in this direction through the rural development program , designed to help unsuccessful farmers find fulltime or parttime work in nearby cities . " The whole program , " as Secretary Benson put it , " is aimed at reducing the size of the agricultural plant and preserving it in a good state of conservation until such time as additional crop production may be needed . " The Agriculture Department is preparing to re-appraise the soil bank feature of the farm program , which expires in 1959 , with a view to terminating it even sooner if it seems feasible .               @ @ @ @ @ @
