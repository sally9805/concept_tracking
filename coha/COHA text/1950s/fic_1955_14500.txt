The lights go up on the curtain and there is a premonitory trembling along its surface as if it were about to rise . However , it settles back and a man 's voice is heard backstage , calling somewhat peremptorily . VOICE Places please ! Did you hear me ? I said places please ! Curtain going up !

( While the Player King speaks a jester of the time of Richard III begins to appear against the curtains in the background . He is seated on a low stool , cap in hand , and his eyes are fixed on the Player King , who does not see the jester but seems to feel his gaze . ) Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front , And now , instead of mounting  --  ( The Player King pauses , The stage manager , whose voice was first heard , prompts him . ) AL "  --  instead of mounting barbed steeds  --  " PLAYER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of continuing the Player King turns , as if against his will , and looks at the jester . ) To fright the souls of fearful adversaries , He  --  ( He pauses . ) AL " He capers nimbly in a lady 's chamber  --  " PLAYER KING He  --  capers  --  AL " Nimbly  --  " PLAYER KING Nimbly  --  in a lady 's chamber  --  ( He pauses , in agony , unable to recall. ) p. 4 AL " To the lascivious pleasing of a lute .

I 'd rather be out front myself , and so would Mr. Leger , I think , but we 're in a rather peculiar jam . The play 's stopped and the curtain wo n't come down , so something has to be done and I guess we have to do it . Joe , will you take over ?

We had an uninvited guest at our party , but he 's gone now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start from the top . p. 7 PLAYER KING Again ? LEGER You 're a bit shaken , Mr. Gates , and of course it 's the usual thing to take the curtain down when you have to start fresh . It just happens that there 's a mechanical failure and we do n't have that little springboard  --  and since we do n't have it  --  well , we 'll have to make ourselves jump in without it . We 'll leave the stage , the-stage manager will say " Curtain " and off you go . PLAYER KING You 'll leave the stage , but he wo n't . KENT Who wo n't ? PLAYER KING Whoever that is !

( A pause. ) p. 9 DAG I come a long way.You should have known my master . There was a man accustomed to command . You do it cheaply . LEGER Why do you dress yourself in this ridiculous costume and interfere with the presentation of this play ? DAG I 've wondered myself . It may be that when venom is poured over bones For centuries , and the lies touch someone you love , It reaches the quick at last and you stir in your grave , And ca n't lie quiet , and get up and walk  --  And search  --  and find out this evil  --  where it lives  --  And try to fight back . KENT What evil ? DAG Deliberate , poisonous , vicious calumny Of those I loved , of my good lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the love Of children  --  for it was the love of children  --  They were cousins and grew up together , loving Even then . KENT You say we have slandered your master  --  Who was your master ? We slander no one ! DAG Richard ! The Richard you cartoon with the lump on his back , And the withered arm  --  making love to somebody 's widow ! After he killed her husband , and killed his father ! LEGER Are fool . I was the fool they kept at Middleham To sing at supper . I loved my lady . She died Of grief when her son died . Four months later my lord Was killed at Bosworth , and pushed into a grave Without rites , near Leicester . I lived on under Henry , The peddler king . KENT But this is ridiculous ! DAG There was no marker on Richard 's grave , But I marked it , and had myself buried there Under that same drip of serpents ' tongues That drenched my master 's bones . Well , after a certain number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather together In desperation , and a whirl of dust comes round them , And once again anger and love stare from the eyes.For I loved my mistress and my lord . It is  --  It is ridiculous , and forlorn , and hopeless ! But I come to stop that wash of scurrilous stuff With these broken hands . To stop it at the source  --  Here where it 's made . So when he stands before me , Your player king , he can not say the lines , Because they 're lies . KENT You came to stop Richard Third ? DAG I came to stop Richard Third . And I have stopped it . KENT It 's been played ten thousand times ! Did you allow The first ten thousand ? DAG Sir , it may be That the first ten thousand are the easiest . I never did understand our human life , And our human death 's no simpler . That septic drip Grew less bearable with the centuries . Grew unbearable in the end  --  and here I am. p. 11 KENT It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be On your opening night . And there will be No Richard Third such as you 've always known , With crooked back and black smile and dull knife And Tower full of dead children ! LEGER There 's no other Richard ! DAG I knew another.His bones washed down with mine to that little scurf Of trash at the bottom of the field . I had No trouble telling his occiput from the one I used to wear . His was the king 's . Mine had The cap and bells still on it  --  gone dirt color And partially dissolved . ( He indicates his headgear . ) But he was a king ! If I could rouse him and bring him here you would see Another kind of Richard ! KENT ( Winking at Leger . ) Yes , I believe it , but you see our problem 's To put a play on here tonight . We 've promised Richard Third , and rehearsed it . The audience Paid to get in , and it 's not fair to give them Nothing because you think there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given so often How could one more time matter ? LEGER And see , they 're waiting . KENT They 've been very patient LEGER Could you policeEvery English-speaking stage , to the end of time . To keep them from giving this play ? p. 12 DAG No . KENT And even if it 's not given Why would n't it be read ? And if it 's read What have you gained ? DAG Nothing . Yes , I 've gained nothing . ( He bows his head in his hands . ) KENT After tonight Come in and put your hex on us if you like , But let us go on now . LEGER Just for this opening Let us follow the program that was promised . After that  --  well , we 'll take our chances . KENT What do you say ? Will you give us This one night ? ( They pause and wait . The jester does n't answer verbally but he begins to fade and soon is only a wraith before them . ) The answer 's yes ! Yes , ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you see , And we can start in a moment ! LEGER Mr. Gates , Is Rosalind ready ? PLAYER KING Yes , all made up and waiting . LEGER Good ! Now , I 'll tell you  --  If the audience does n't mind , and Mr. Kent Says yes  --  we 've lost so much time , let 's not go back To the top , But start with the second scene , And pick up from there . KENT It 's all right with me. p. 13 LEGER And with you , Hal ? PLAYER KING Yes , by all means . ( He sees that the jester has quite vanished . ) Let 's get on with it . ( He goes out . ) LEGER Al ! AL ( Offstage . ) Yes , sir ? LEGER Do n't bother with the curtain ! Twelve ! AL ( Offstage . ) Right . Places ! Places for twelve ! LEGER We 'll get off . KENT Yes . ( Kent and Leger go out . The lights come up . The stage is empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four noblemen enter , carrying a coffin on their shoulders . The Player Queen follows them in mourning .

He is in heaven , where thou shalt never come !

PLAYER KING Yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it . PLAYER QUEEN Some dungeon . PLAYER KING Your bed-chamber . PLAYER QUEEN Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest !

He and the jester are absorbed in the scene that is playing . ) But , gentle Lady Anne , Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets , Henry and Edward , As blameful as the executioner ? PLAYER QUEEN Thou art the cause ! PLAYER KING Your beauty was the cause ! Your beauty , which did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom . p. 16 PLAYER QUEEN If I thought that , I tell thee , homicide , These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks !

What ! I , that killed her husband and his father , To take her in her heart 's extremest hate , With curses in her mouth , tears in her eyes , The bleeding witness of her hatred by , And I nothing to back my suit at all But the plain devil and dissembling looks , And yet to win her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot already that brave prince whom I Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury ?

( He capers a little , watching his shadow . There is some scattered clapping at the rear of the audience . Richard , obviously amused , smiles at the Player King and claps with the others , not over-enthusiastic , not too patronizing . The four nobles pick up the corpse and carry it out. ) p. 21 DAG Master ! RICHARD III Yes , Dag ? ( The Player King bows and goes out . ) DAG Can you applaud this ?

RICHARD III Well , the name 's Richard . There have been many Richards , One like this perhaps . Not I. DAG It 's toldAbout you and your lady . RICHARD III Then perhaps This is one version of what we were like . DAG This is the only version  --  and in all histories This is the way you 're known . RICHARD III It 's not possible .

DAG Sir , do you consider yourself the injured party ? KENT If I 'm not the injured party I do n't know who is ! When I put a play on I feel responsible to the actors and the people in the audience and the investors ! They 've all got an interest in seeing this show done well ! What right have you to climb onto our stage , get in the way of the performers , spoil the audience 's fun , throw the actors out of work , and ruin the investment ?

( The Player King and Queen slip offstage quietly. ) p. 25 DAG There must come an end to the lies ! KENT I 've heard enough of that , too ! Who says it 's lies ? Richard the Third of England was the biggest liar , murderer , thief , brigand , and hypocrite that ever sat on any throne anywhere !

And now , or I 'll find someone to lock you up ! ( To the audience . ) I beg your pardon for blowing up , ladies and gentlemen , but this sort of behavior is beyond belief ! A man comes to the end of his patience ! ( To Dag and Richard . ) Now , can we have the stage ? RICHARD III Sir , have you read a great deal of history ? KENT Some other time  --  RICHARD III I must know this now . KENT Listen , old-timer , I never went to school much , I do n't know much history , but one king everybody knows is Richard Third !

AL Yes , sir . ( He goes out . Kent comes briskly downstage and looks up . ) KENT Can we do anything with that curtain ? LEGER Al sent a man up , but he says we 'll need a ladder on stage . ( They look at the curtain above them . ) KENT We 'll let it go then . We 'll have to . LEGER I want to say a word to the actors . KENT Right .

RICHARD III But will the truth out ? The plain tale Of Richard and Anne is this : When he was fourteen He went to live with his uncle Warwick . His playmates Were Warwick 's daughters , Isabel and Anne . Anne was eleven . Richard 's brother , George , Chose Isabel , Richard loved little Anne . When Richard was nineteen and Anne sixteen They were married .

By the way , I do n't want to be discourteous to anybody , but at this point I find myself with rather little to say to those two lunatics at my left . Meanwhile I want to thank you for being extraordinarily patient . I 've been in on a lot of plays , and I thought I 'd seen everything , but I never went through anything like this ! AL ( Looking in . ) Mr. Kent ? p. 28 KENT Yes ? AL The officer 's here . KENT Good . Ask him to come on stage .

I think they belong to some group that 's opposed to putting on Richard Third , so they walked in here deliberately to make trouble . JOSEPH ACCARD ( Uneasily , looking out at the audience . ) I never had to do this before . Interrupting the performance , eh ? p. 29 KENT Yes . JOSEPH ACCARD ( Stepping further on stage . ) Come on boys . No more horse-play . Out the stage door . ( Dag and Richard do n't move . ) You heard me , I think . You told'em to get offstage ?

He turns toward Richard , who also vanishes . ) What kind of hocus-pocus is this ? Hey ? KENT I 'm blessed if I know , Joe . They pulled that on me , too . JOSEPH ACCARD Oh , they did ?

( Dag reappears in his path . ) DAG I should warn you , sir , that if you step too near me  --  if you step , let us say , beyond this line of light  --  you will forget who you are and why you came here . JOSEPH ACCARD What kind of game is this now ? DAG It 's not a game , sir . JOSEPH ACCARD It 's tricks , then . DAG No , not tricks . But come near me , come beyond this line , and you will forget who you are and why you came . JOSEPH ACCARD ( To Kent . ) What 's playing in this theatre ? KENT We 're putting on Richard Third . JOSEPH ACCARD I saw a hypnotism routine once in vaudeville . This is n't that kind of thing ? p. 31 KENT I do n't know what these fellows are up to . We 're playing Shakespeare . JOSEPH ACCARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly do . JOSEPH ACCARD He certainly looks like he was dressed for your show . KENT There 's no fool in Richard Third . JOSEPH ACCARD It 's Shakespeare , is n't it ? KENT Yes , but no fools in this one . JOSEPH ACCARD No ? Well , how do you tell which ones have fools and which ones do n't ? Same difference to me . ( To Dag . ) All right , I wo n't cross your line , but move , now ! Move ! ( Dag is still motionless . ) You do n't leave me any choice , do you ?  --  Look , I do n't want to arrest-you . My motto is , never start a commotion if you can settle matters amicably . So come on , let 's settle it without attracting attention . DAG I tried that . JOSEPH ACCARD You 're not trying it now . DAG No . JOSEPH ACCARD What are you trying ? DAG I 'm seeking for justice . p. 32 JOSEPH ACCARD You 're liable to get justice if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ( To Al . ) Watch that door now . AL Yes , sir . ( He goes out stage right . ) JOSEPH ACCARD ( To Kent . ) You 'll watch this side ? KENT I 'll stay right here . JOSEPH ACCARD Because when a guy draws a line and dares me to step across it I step across it , and put the arm on him . ( He goes purposefully toward Dag , crossing the line of light that falls between them . Dag does n't move . There is again a glimmer of lightning , succeeded this time by a distant rumble of thunder that begins far away and seems to come closer  --  ending in a violent clap . Accard puts his hand to his forehead and stops . ) DAG Have you forgotten something , sir ? ( There is a pause while the officer tries to think . ) KENT What 's the matter ? JOSEPH ACCARD Damned if I know . ( He reaches instinctively for his revolver . A sandbag falls from the flies and hits the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet to his left . Kent catches the officer 's arm and pulls him downstage. ) p. 33 JOSEPH ACCARD What are you doing ? ( A sandbag hits where the officer was standing . ) KENT They were dropping sandbags around you . ( Leger reenters . ) JOSEPH ACCARD Just a minute ! Are you one of these or one of them ? LEGER What do you mean by them ? JOSEPH ACCARD Them in there ! ( He catches Leger 's arm . ) LEGER Are n't you a little confused ? JOSEPH ACCARD I sure am . KENT Mr. Leger is our director . JOSEPH ACCARD Sorry . ( He drops Leger 's arm . ) KENT That 's the fellow I want you to do something about . ( He points to Dag . ) JOSEPH ACCARD I do n't want to be made a spectacle of ! Did you bring me in here to hypnotize me ? KENT I brought you in to make an arrest ! JOSEPH ACCARD That would be very funny . A cop reaching for a guy and suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me , Joe ! I 'm putting on a play ! This is n't a review ! p. 34 JOSEPH ACCARD How do I know what 's what here ? There 's an actor , and he 's on stage in costume , and you want me to arrest him . You all look like the same bunch to me . You better come down to the station house and bring formal charges . KENT But we ca n't go on with the play till we get rid of them ! ( Al comes in from stage right . ) JOSEPH ACCARD I ca n't spend the night on this , you know ! I 've got traffic outside and it 's probably jammed all the way across town by now ! LEGER I do n't think you ought to leave it this way , officer ! JOSEPH ACCARD One thing I know  --  I 'm not stepping across his lines again  --  that I do know ! ( He goes out stage right . ) KENT Well , I do n't take that for an answer , audience ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . We 'll put this play on if we have to call out the riot squad ! Right , Mr. Leger ? LEGER The actors are standing by . They 're game . KENT I 've got a couple of friends at headquarters . ( He starts off . ) LEGER You 're going to call them ? p. 35 KENT I am . LEGER What happens till then ? KENT Till  --  ? ( He pauses . ) Well , ( To Dag . ) You 've got about fifteen minutes to tell your version ! See if you can hold an audience with it ! Ladies and gentlemen , maybe these historical pranksters can amuse you while I get the police to help us ! Any of you who do n't want to watch their charades can step out and get a drink . Hang on , everybody , and I 'll make my calls ! ( He pulls a little book from his pocket and consults it as he goes off . Leger and Al turn to follow . ) LEGER You know , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police department . AL Something pretty peculiar happened to Joe . LEGER Something very peculiar . ( They look at Dag , who has kept his place , and go out . Dag rises and opens a fold of the curtain behind him . Richard comes in . ) RICHARD III You begin to frighten me , Dagonet . What have you done ? What power do you have ? DAG Master , I do n't know.Lying there in the earth , I tried to rise , And I did rise . There was such a burning in me I could n't rest . The fire bit still at my vitals , So I called you , and you came . When we were here I looked at the ropes and tried to tangle them  --  And they were tangled . Then this officer , I made a tangle in his mind . Some power I seem to have , even now . p. 36 RICHARD III Whose dream are we dreaming ? DAG I do n't know that . It may be the dream of the spirit world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's next to do ? DAG My king , I brought you here to speak . RICHARD III But , Dag , This is your project , your affair . DAG No . You were the king . It was you they injured . RICHARD III ( To the audience . ) When he 's alive a king commands , but when He 's dead , his fool commands him . Long ago , When Anne and I were young , this fellow sang For us and for the guests , in the winter evenings At Middleham . He was said to be A descendant of Merlin . He could call spirits up And make them appear . I never knew quite how . I do n't know now how I 'm here  --  nor any of this , This prestidigitation , shall we say  --  That brings me from my grave and lets me see you , And you see me . It 's some kind of science mixed With miracle , like the rest of life , I suppose . Mystery and miracle . I lay under weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to sleep there , For the lies were old and no longer hurt , but he came And called me , and I 'm here . DAG These are the living Who believe the lies . I was not content . I writhed in my grave under that virulent rain , And writhed awake , and woke you . p. 37 RICHARD III What can I say ? Say that I was maligned  --  and make my bow  --  And back to fertilize rag-weed ? DAG We must play it out . RICHARD III Play it out in scenes  --  extempore  --  ? DAG As it was . RICHARD III I 'm here alone . DAG I 'll call them back . You shall have anyone you like . RICHARD III Even Anne ? DAG Even Anne . But when you see her , If you speak to her , you must never say A word that would let her know it 's not the first time The word was spoken , or she 'll go back to dust When she knows this . RICHARD III You want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can remember , As near as you can remember . RICHARD III Who can recall  --  ( To the audience. )  --  Who of you can  --  can recall the words , The aimless , spider-web words you said in one hour To your lady , or the words she said , or the way She turned and spoke ? Every man 's past is like A night in summer , lit by one dim-wit fire-fly , Flashing unpredictably on the darkness , Lighting a face speaking a half-phrase , then Silence , blank , dark , maybe a glimmer again A little further on . From these glimmerings Can I weave the threads of a day , bring back the words , The way we stood and moved ? It would not be true  --  It would be all lies if I fudged such a scene , Pretending that it occurred . p. 38 DAG But let me bring her . And she will remember a little . RICHARD III Yes , perhaps , She would remember some words , and I some words , And she some moods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them together we 'd have only Something meditated , written out fair , made-up , Something that never happened . Old times are like Last year 's grass in winter . It wo n't go back . You ca n't put it back green again . DAG ( Whispering . ) Have I come all this way For nothing ? RICHARD III Yes , Dag , for nothing , save for one thing : To see Anne I would play any game , for these or for any , For you if you like . And , boy , this is true of you , too . You loved my lady . DAG I  --  RICHARD III Have we come all this way , Both of us , to see Anne ? DAG Are you angry , master ? RICHARD III ( Smiling . ) We have shared a grave For a number of centuries . No . DAG What day shall we live ? RICHARD III Am I to choose ? DAG Yes , master . RICHARD III Then let it be The day we met first after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 DAG It was at Middleham , And I was with you . We had ridden there After the battle in which her father died . This was the hall . ( A trace of stone-work appears on the curtain . ) Clarence had entered . ( Clarence is seen , armed . ) This ( A girl 's figure emerges from the shadow ) Is Isabel . You followed Clarence in.And I came after . ( Richard rises and enters the scene . Dag follows him . ) Sitting behind her sister , And rising slowly to greet us  --  for she 's been weeping  --  Is Anne . Whom you 'd forgotten . ( But no figure appears behind Isabel . They wait a moment . Richard looks back at Dag . ) RICHARD III ( Whispering . ) But she 's not here . DAG ( Whispering . ) Let me call her again . She was weary of her life.She lies in the chancel with your son and hers And does n't wish to rise . Anne , Lady Anne ! ( They wait a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III ( Whispering . ) Anne ! Lady Anne ! ( After a pause the figure of Anne , looking much like the Player Queen , but dressed youthfully , appears seated behind Isabel , a kerchief at her eyes . She becomes aware of the men who have entered and rises , drying the tears hastily. ) p. 40 CLARENCE Isabel ! Wife Isabel ! ISABEL NEVILLE Clarence ! Can I ever trust you again ? My father is dead ! You betrayed him , fought against him ! CLARENCE Treason is not treason when it succeeds . Loyalty is treason when it fails . Your father failed . ISABEL NEVILLE I hate you ! CLARENCE Come , kiss me , wife . I am your husband . You will not hate me long . Come  --  we shall see to that . ( They go out together to stage left . ) RICHARD III Forgive me , lady . But Warwick 's younger daughter , my playmate once , Is she not here ? Her name was Anne . ANNE NEVILLE My name is Anne . RICHARD III She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANNE NEVILLE It may be she 's grown And become a woman . RICHARD III You know her ? She is here ? ANNE NEVILLE I am Anne . RICHARD III I believe you are . I am Richard . You called me Dickon . ANNE NEVILLE Oh , I knew you .  --  You fought in these wars . You were A leader of armies .  --  I 'd be proud of you , only My father died in the battle . You could have saved him . p. 41 RICHARD III No.He fought in another part of the field .  --  Let me see you .  --  Anne  --  I 've thought of you .  --  I come back and find you , and your face Is still the face I love . ANNE NEVILLE You did n't know me . RICHARD III No . You are as I 've hoped . When we were children We swore to love forever . ANNE NEVILLE That was nonsence . They say I 'm to marry elsewhere . RICHARD III Some great lord ? ANNE NEVILLE Yes . ( There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I see you there 's so much to say  --  And I have no words . Anne ! My dear one ! Anne ! ANNE NEVILLE And I have none . ( Her figure has begun to fade , and now suddenly it 's gone , Richard steps toward where she was . She 's not there . ) RICHARD III Anne ! ( He turns to Dag . ) Dag , you must bring her back ! Dag ! Why did she go ? DAG You spoke words not said at that time . RICHARD III But I do n't remember ! I do n't remember the words said long ago ! Would she know them ? p. 42 DAG No . But when they are wrong There 's nothing to hold the hour together . It goes And she goes with it . RICHARD III Dag , if you ever loved her , Bring her back for a moment ! Only to see her ! Only to say  --  ! DAG What would you say , my master ? RICHARD III Something for her only ! But quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to tell her That she died not knowing ! DAG Would you say something new ? Something not said in your lives ? RICHARD III Yes . DAG But that ca n't be . We can only call back old times . RICHARD III But she died not knowing  --  DAG You can say only what was said before  --  RICHARD III Who wants his life again if it 's to be Unchanged ? Who wants it the way it was ? DAG We have come , my lord , to show it the way it was  --  Because of the lies about you  --  RICHARD III To show it to these ? ( He indicates the audience . ) DAG Yes . RICHARD III Fool ! Oh , fool ! Fool ! What do I care How it seems to them ? They sit in an age I do n't know Out there , out of time , out of space , too , out Of my life or yours or my lady 's ! I do n't know them ! Ca n't ! They do n't touch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnaws at my knucklebones ! ( To the audience . ) ( That 's bad sometimes , that Ant . In case you 've wondered What it 's like for a ghost who feels the nip Of mandibles on his bones ! It 's bad , And it 's worse in sunny weather ! ) Look , my jester , Descendant of Merlin , or whoever he was , This is why I must see my lady ; After she died , And I had buried her , I was too dull with grief to face my nobles  --  So I let them wait , And sat for a day among the things she left , Her work-box and the dresses she had worn And jewels  --  And the small secret things a woman puts Aside when a man comes in  --  Still with her perfume light upon them .  --  So there I found a letter written to me To be opened after her death . " For my dear Richard . To be opened when I am dead . " Inside it went something like this : That because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no more children , For she was ill , She wanted me to know that when she died I was to marry again  --  and have an heir To the throne.And since my niece , Elizabeth , The daughter of my brother , looked at me With happiness in her eyes , Perhaps I 'd turn to her , be happier there Than with unhappy Anne . And then she signed it , " Anne , your Anne , Who is sorry that she failed you , And loves you wholly , And will love you when she is gone . " Now , I tell you , Dag , my girl had never failed me , Nor had I ceased to love her , Nor looked at any woman , least of all At Elizabeth , my niece . p. 43 DAG Who told her this  --  About Elizabeth ? RICHARD III I never knew For I was away with one war after another , Risings , rebellions , Red rose and white , Gules on a green field , gules on black , Battles and carrion , death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must tell her now  --  I must tell her if I see her ! I do n't know Your rules of necromancy , of how I must say Only what was said before , and suchlike matters , This can not hold me when I know she died Thinking I no longer loved her ! DAG These are not my rules , my lord , But the rules of what can happen . Try if you wish . Speak words that were not spoken . Tell her your love Was the same at the end . She wo n't hear this . She will dim And you will lose what you have . My king , my sovereign , Only the living can change . You and your queen Have long been dead . The errors Made in your lives ca n't be rescinded now . There are the living . What is in their minds Can still be altered . If they 've been unjust They 'd want to alter it . Let us bring back the past  --  We can do no more  --  So they can deal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III I take no pleasure in it . It does n't matter what they believe . Nor whether It 's true or untrue . DAG But I say it does ! The truth Does matter ! I want them to know the truth About my lord and my lady ! When a man 's maligned , When a name 's blackened unjustly , It shakes the order of things , Sets a virulence working like the plague At the bottom of a spring  --  Sets a precedent of disease  --  So all men are in danger ! If a lie is a lie , and you know it And let it live , it corrupts every truth you know Till truth begins to be lies ! p. 44 RICHARD III But the lies about me , What harm have they done except to me and my lady In these times about us ? DAG They have only encouraged all lies , And liars about all men ! Just in so far As history is a lie no man is safe Whether he be alive or dead ! RICHARD III Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Anne again ? DAG Yes . You will see her . RICHARD III Could we call her now ? DAG First we must call on a rodent , One Henry Tudor , Who does n't wish to come , who comes because He must , because he 's called , but lurks in crypts Like the rat he is , till he 's cornered , And must speak . ( A shadow flickers at the foot of the rear curtain . ) My spell is on him . See , he shuffles there Under the curtain , tries to run away . There 's your Henry Tudor . RICHARD III I see only a shadow . DAG He tries to look like a shade there , like a nothing , Like a king of spades , dancing , Now on the curtain , now on the floor ! He wo n't come to rest till he 's pinned against a wall ! Come , we must corner him ! RICHARD III Does this lead to Anne ? DAG It will lead to Anne , if we can shake this rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner the shadow . It flits back and forth desperately as they close in . Then we see that it is really a little , thin man with a thin whisker and furtive rat face . It shivers and snarls at them  --  a subhuman sound . Dag gets it by the collar of its old coat , and holds it. ) p. 45 HENRY TUDOR ( Clicking its teeth . ) Ck , ck , ck , ck ! RICHARD III Is this Henry Tudor ? DAG This is Henry the Seventh , of England . Quite majestic , Do n't you think ? Did you speak , Your Majesty ? HENRY TUDOR Ck , ck ! ( He covers his eyes . ) Ck , ck , ck , ck ! DAG Yes , Your Majesty . It is bright here . You never liked the light . You preferred dark holes and passages . HENRY TUDOR What is this ? Who holds me ? ( His voice is almost a squeak . ) DAG You 've been dragged out To show yourself in public . Those you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out sharply at the audience , and then turns with a slow , cautious movement toward the rear . ) There 's no way out . You 'll stand and take it . ( He lets go of the coat . ) Try to go out . You 'll find You ca n't . ( Henry looks out again in the audience , and as he does so begins to draw himself up to his full size . ) HENRY TUDOR Ah  --  give me a moment to collect myself . I am not  --  ( He pulls his clothes into shape. ) p. 46 DAG Take your own time , my lord . HENRY TUDOR Who are these again ? ( Indicating the audience . ) Are these my citizens ? DAG They are citizens . Not yours , I believe . HENRY TUDOR I 'm the victim of some trick . A trick . Of the kind with which you entertained the court When you were called on . ( He finds a crown somewhere in his rags and dons it . ) You are Dag , the fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You used to call men from their graves , Old grave-stained fellows , Stumbling back through their lives For us to laugh at . But this time I 'm the victim . The sacrifice . I was in my grave , I remember . Well-interred And honored and at peace . You will excuse me , gentlemen . I know this fool Of old , and his sleight-of-hand . These are not my citizens ? DAG No . HENRY TUDOR Plain no ? Not , no , my lord ? Or if it please you ? DAG Plain no . HENRY TUDOR How many years have passed  --  to put it plainly  --  Since I was buried ? I see the fashions have changed . DAG I 'm not good at arithmetic . I never Added up . It 's been some time . p. 47 HENRY TUDOR Some time . Do they speak my language ? The king 's English ? DAG With some changes . HENRY TUDOR They can understand us ? DAG Very well . HENRY TUDOR And who is that ? DAG You may remember Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . ) Richard . RICHARD III My greetings , Henry . HENRY TUDOR Will he be in this ? DAG He will . This audience Will see you both in a few episodes That have been somewhat obscured . HENRY TUDOR Will see us both ? DAG Yes . HENRY TUDOR I refuse to take part in such mumming ! DAG But you will . HENRY TUDOR I appeal to this court of inquiry ! The fool 's unfair ! A friend of Richard 's ! He 'll put me through Some plottery to cast doubt on what I did When I was king ! DAG I shall put you through nothing , Can put you through nothing , that is n't the way it was . We shall see the events as they happened . p. 48 HENRY TUDOR I refuse ! DAG You can not refuse , as you know . HENRY TUDOR I do refuse ! ( He is suddenly the rat , as when first seen , trying to hide under the curtain , blinking at the light , scurrying back and forth . Dag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Richard catches him by the collar and shakes him hard . Henry stops struggling and suddenly climbs to his full height . ) DAG That 's better . HENRY TUDOR ( facing Richard defiantly ) Why , good ! If you dare to show yourself to them , You , Richard the Third , with your murders , rapes , Throttlings , drownings , buryings alive , your poisons , Tortures , ropes and chains , if you dare show your face , Then I have nothing to hide ! Let us proceed ! Let us show it all ! RICHARD III Yes , Henry . Just as it was Let them see it all . HENRY TUDOR They 'll see this wild boar , this hog ! RICHARD III They 'll see what was . Dag , what day do we live ? DAG First we must find The day when Henry Tydder , the music master , Taught Clarence and Bishop Morton a quick back way To the throne of England . p. 49 HENRY TUDOR There was no such day ! DAG My lord , It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Merlin himself ! DAG You will take your place , my lord . ( Reluctantly , but as if unable to resist , Henry walks into the scene and is joined by Bishop Morton , an oily prelate . Clarence enters , meeting them . ) See how it falls on them  --  A light more brilliant than reality , Like images in a glass , and when they speak The words come back , reflected . There , the light now , As sharp as childhood ! RICHARD III Anne is not here . DAG Not yet . ( He sits on the floor at stage left to watch the episode . Richard kneels or crouches beside him . ) ARCHBISHOP MORTON I may see your wife , your grace ? CLARENCE She 's coming . ARCHBISHOP MORTON How much is known About Richard and Anne ? How far has it gone ? CLARENCE They 've been seen together . There was always a league between them . ARCHBISHOP MORTON And it 's renewed ? CLARENCE Well , quite frankly , they were seen Lying on the grass under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 50 ARCHBISHOP MORTON Who saw them ? CLARENCE Isabel . ARCHBISHOP MORTON That could mean much or little . CLARENCE From other things That Isabel 's observed , it 's serious . They may be planning to marry . ARCHBISHOP MORTON We agreed , your Lordship , That Anne must marry a commoner . You were certain You could keep her away from Richard . CLARENCE Well , I reckoned Without my wife , or rather I counted on Her vigilance , and ( Isabel enters ) she failed me . There were no letters ? ISABEL NEVILLE No , I swear it . There were no letters , no messengers between them , No communication before last night  --  Then suddenly she was in his arms . ARCHBISHOP MORTON You knew That he was coming ? ISABEL NEVILLE No  --  and she could n't have known . Yet there they were in the moonlight on the lawn , And I thought she was in her room  --  I 'd heard no word of Richard . He came alone . CLARENCE Who let him in ? ISABEL NEVILLE Anne must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Richard marries Anne . p. 51 HENRY TUDOR You lose more than that . ARCHBISHOP MORTON Listen . HENRY TUDOR Keep Warwick 's land And Warwick 's incomes , and you can make yourself king Sooner or later . Give Richard half of it And you 're an earl , no more , never could be more Than earl or duke . CLARENCE If she marries well she takes One half as her marriage portion . HENRY TUDOR Prevent it . CLARENCE How ? HENRY TUDOR A death or two might help . CLARENCE Whose ? HENRY TUDOR Richard 's  --  Anne 's . CLARENCE No . HENRY TUDOR One or two deaths now may help as much As ten thousand later . ARCHBISHOP MORTON Perhaps you do n't want it much . Or not that much . CLARENCE I 'd rather not murder for it . HENRY TUDOR You do n't want it much . Well , put her away In some safe place . Though no place is quite safe Except the one you shrink from . ARCHBISHOP MORTON You must take her from him And keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY TUDOR At once . CLARENCE Yes . At once . HENRY TUDOR He must not see her again . You have possession of Anne . Can she be put Where Richard wo n't find her ? CLARENCE Leave that to me . ARCHBISHOP MORTON But make sure . CLARENCE As sure as death . HENRY TUDOR Nothing 's as sure as death . She should be thrown On a kitchen midden , like a dead cat . And covered With what they throw from kitchens . CLARENCE She will be . ( The lights go out on the scene , leaving Dag and Richard alone on the stage . ) RICHARD III Isabel saw us There on the lawn . DAG It seems so . RICHARD III I rode up in the night Without warning . The castle gates were closed . I sat there on my horse , not wanting To wake the household . The moon came up , and I heard somebody clanking With bolts and chains . It was Anne letting me in . Could we have that scene ? DAG We 're past it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she was then . Oh , Dag , let it be moonlight On that one night , and Anne there ! p. 53 DAG Yes , master . ( A shaft of cool moonlight comes across the curtains , as if finding a way through the trees . There is a rattling of chains and the sound of heavy bars falling . Richard steps to stage left and then comes into the moonlight and waits . Anne appears as a door swings open . She takes a step toward him ; he hesitates . ) RICHARD III Anne ? ANNE NEVILLE Dickon ? RICHARD III Were you awake ? ANNE NEVILLE I woke and looked out the window . I could see a horseman under the trees  --  Somehow I knew you . RICHARD III I have only this hour . I must be at the ford at sunrise . The king expects me . ANNE NEVILLE More wars , more battles ? RICHARD III There 's a castle to take . Then I 'll be free . ANNE NEVILLE I 'm beginning to be afraid here . RICHARD III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III Of whom ? ANNE NEVILLE Your brother . My sister . RICHARD III Clarence ? p. 54 ANNE NEVILLE Yes . RICHARD III But why ? ANNE NEVILLE It 's nothing that I can say . Just that I feel it around me . RICHARD III Isabel ? And Clarence ? ANNE NEVILLE Yes . RICHARD III My brother 's wooly-minded , But I never thought him dangerous . ANNE NEVILLE He is . RICHARD III May I kiss you ? ANNE NEVILLE Yes . ( They kiss . ) RICHARD III You 're cold . ANNE NEVILLE Oh , Dickon ! It 's good to have you ! You were away so long ! RICHARD III You 're afraid . ANNE NEVILLE Not so much of Clarence or Isabel . It 's those around them . The bishop and the little music-master  --  Who knows no music . RICHARD III They 're both here ? ANNE NEVILLE Both here . RICHARD III This is Monday night  --  Or Tuesday morning . I could come for you Thursday At this same time . There 'll be no moon . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? RICHARD III We shall be married .

RICHARD III We work well together . At any rate we won . We can count on the king . And I 'll take you out of this . Let 's sit here a moment . ANNE NEVILLE Do you have time ? RICHARD III Let the king wait . He can swim or eat breakfast . I must kiss my girl . ANNE NEVILLE Not here . Out of the moonlight . I was awake and someone else might be . RICHARD III Is there someone does n't like me ? ANNE NEVILLE Does n't like us together perhaps . RICHARD III I do n't know why . ( They sit . ) ANNE NEVILLE And I do n't .

ANNE NEVILLE I 'll be waiting for you . I 'm lost without you , Dickon . Come for me soon . RICHARD III Let 's set the time so there 's no mistake . Two or three hours after midnight , Thursday morning , Look for a horseman there , under the trees ; Be ready to ride with me . ANNE NEVILLE I 'll bring very little . RICHARD III Bring yourself , sweet . I 'll have four walls somewhere in the north of England , With the usual bric-a-brac . It 's a house to live in . It 's ours . ANNE NEVILLE Thursday morning , Two or three hours after midnight . I wo n't sleep . I 'll watch for you . ( They kiss .

It will come back to you . p. 57 RICHARD III ( Going to his place . ) But if this is the Thursday morning I wo n't see Anne . She never came . There 's no point in the scene without her . DAG Master , master , please remember we 're here To clear your name ! Your love for Anne is over . We and our loves are dead as Agememnon Or the father of Agamemnon . RICHARD III I 've read my Homer . The father of Agamemnon lived to be An old man , shrunken ; probably he looked As old as God . But Agamemnon died At midway , full of blood . That 's true of me . I died in battle when I was thirty-two , My wife died at twenty-nine . Do you wonder that I 'm restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I died My love , my years , my youth were sweet in my mouth  --  I reach out for them yet . And reach out for Anne . DAG You will see her again . RICHARD III But my part in this scene is only to wait ? DAG Only to wait . ( Richard sits to watch and listen . Anne comes in silently at stage right , out of his view , and seems to swing a door open . A chain falls . Henry comes in behind her and beckons to two men who follow . Henry indicates Anne , who is about to go out through the door when one of the men catches her from behind , one of his hands covering her mouth to prevent a scream . There is a scuffle as she is dragged off , stage right . Richard leaps up but can see none of this and when it is quiet again resumes his seat , still watching . When he can no longer bear the suspense he strides to the door and raps sharply . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little brother ! What brings you clapping at my door in the middle of the night ? RICHARD III I came to see Anne . CLARENCE Anne ? Anne has gone to London . RICHARD III When ? CLARENCE Why , some days ago . RICHARD III For what reason ? CLARENCE Since when did girls give reasons for their vagaries ? She gave me none , But she left saying she was going to London . Some of my people were travelling up to town and she took it into her head to go with them . RICHARD III This is strange . CLARENCE Is it ? Come in , if you like . Look about her rooms . RICHARD III No . I 'll go to London . ( He turns away . ) CLARENCE And no sleep ? Very well . ( The scene fades . Richard speaks to Dag . ) RICHARD III It was a weary year before I found her . But I did find her ! DAG And you will see her again . ( Al , the stage manager , comes on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AL Try that curtain now , Charlie ! I think we 've got it ! CHARLIE ( Offstage ) @x ( The warning bell rings and the curtain goes up as usual , showing the empty stage . Al comes out , distressed , and looks up at the ropes that control the curtain . ) AL ( Calling to his assistant . ) Put another man on it , Charlie ! CHARLIE ( Backstage . ) No good , Al ! Looks like a square knot from here ! AL Who pushed that buzzer ? CHARLIE Not me ! LEGER ( Coming from the rear of the audience . ) Al ! AL Yes , sir . Yes , Mr. Leger . LEGER You did n't signal for the buzzer ? AL No , sir . LEGER Take the curtain down . AL Charlie 's trying to get it down right now , and there 's the same tangle in the lines we had before . LEGER The same tangle ? AL Yes , sir . LEGER Who touched the ropes ? ( He joins Al on the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawk , and so have I. But the lines are twisted and the curtain wo n't budge . p. 60 LEGER Well , for God 's  --  ( He pauses , in deference to the audience . ) AL Who was this Merlin , anyway . Was he real ? LEGER None of it 's real  --  Merlin , Richard , Anne  --  none of it ! AL I 'm beginning to wonder . ( Kent enters from stage right . ) KENT Say , Al , is this phone back here out of order ? AL  --  Why , no.  --  Which one ? KENT Well , I 've tried both  --  the one backstage here and the booth downstairs , and I ca n't get the police department . AL Do you have the number ? KENT I 've got both the number of the station and the private number of the commissioner and I 've been trying both for the last half hour . LEGER The booth downstairs is working . I used it just before curtain-time . KENT Well , all I can get on it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police department in some God-forsaken small town in England  --  LEGER England  --  ? KENT Not New England  --  England ! She keeps giving me the police in Chichester or some place like that , and when I tell her I want the New York chief , I get the chief of police in York ! York , England ! For a while I thought it was straightened out and I had the commissioner on the wire , but then it turned out I was talking to the Lord Mayor of London and he was hopping mad because I 'd got him out of bed at 2:30 A.M. ! p. 61 AL But they would n't wake the Lord Mayor ! KENT That 's who he said he was  --  so then I decided to go to the station by taxi , and the stage door 's jammed  --  LEGER That 's never happened  --  KENT The doorman was outside trying to get in and I was inside trying to get out and I guess I was pretty mad . I broke a panel . But it 's still stuck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out right . ) KENT I want to say this to the audience . Ladies and gentlemen , it may be that we wo n't be able to give the Richard play as announced . I confess I 'm somewhat baffled by what 's been going on around here  --  and maybe I 'm a little scared . I do n't give up yet  --  I 'm still going to try to reach the commissioner and , of course , we wo n't allow that door to remain closed . But personally it seems to me that the best I 'll be able to do is go across the street for that drink . If any of you want to join me there I 'll be glad to pick up the check . I understand there 's a performance of some kind going on here . As far as I 'm concerned , it can continue for a while . We 'll see to that stage door . LEGER I think maybe that drink is a good idea . ( Kent and Leger go backstage together . A butler out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three young servant girls of the same period . The girls carry long spoons. ) p. 62 CLINK ( The butler . ) Now I have established with you what your wages are to be . They are to be one penny a day for each , and you are required to work here in the kitchen from sun-up till supper-time , which will be when the cook finds it convenient . There is to be no giggling , no whispering , and no following . If the men servants try to kiss you , beat them off with your spoons and report the case to me . Do not believe it is because you are good-looking that you are followed . These fellows we have about would follow any female , especially one that smells of grease , as you do , all three , because of the garments I gave you . Now you will have different work for each day , and each day I will tell you what the work is . Some days you will sort goose-feathers , choosing out down for the pillows of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court-yard , beginning at the gate and ending at the kitchen . Today you will take each your spoon and you will skim the grease from the top of the great kettle and place it in a barrell . The kettle will boil all day , and you will skim all day , and tomorrow we shall make soap . And you must think yourselves happy that you work in the city house of the brother of the king , where so much soap is made that three wenches work all day to skim the grease for it . Come hither , you . 1ST GIRL ( Going to him . ) Yes , sir . p. 63 CLINK My name is Clink , and I am butler here in the house of the Duke of Clarence . What kind of face have you ? ( He inspects her. ) 1ST GIRL A plain face . It was good enough for my mother . CLINK She was easily pleased . Pass on . Let me see yours . 2ND GIRL Yes , sir . CLINK Show me the reverse . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . ) No , I thank you . Let me see this last . ( The other girl comes forward . ) Now here is one to pattern by . Here is truthfully a good-looking kitchen-wench . Let me see your legs , for sometimes these pretty faces blind a man and he fails to note that they are beef-to- the-heels . ( He starts to lift her skirt . She strikes him with her spoon . He staggers back . ) Why do you do that ? ANNE NEVILLE ( The 3rd girl . ) Beat them off with your spoons , you said . CLINK I am butler in the city house of the brother of the king ! I think I may lift a girl 's skirt without reproof ! ANNE NEVILLE Could we proceed with the skimming of grease from the pot ? CLINK Why , yes . No girl conceals her legs without reason . You are beef-to-the-heels , and prefer to remain covered . Come with me , all of you . The pot is boiling . ( He starts out to stage right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Precede me and begin to skim . I hear the voice of my master . ( The girls go out right. ) p. 64 CLARENCE ( Offstage at left . ) But not the kitchen , brother ! RICHARD III ( Offstage . ) Brother , I must look in the kitchen also ! ( He comes on stage , followed by Clarence . ) What part of the house is this ? CLARENCE The butler 's pantry . RICHARD III ( To Clink . ) And who are you ? ( Clink is silent , overwhelmed with deference , open-mouthed . ) CLARENCE This my butler , a poor , honest , stupid soul . RICHARD III C-C-C-Cl  --  ( He swallows and gives up . ) CLARENCE His name is Clink , and his brain-power is obvious . Brother Richard , I take it in very ill part that you come with armed men to search my house ! RICHARD III ( To Clink . ) I want to see every woman who works for you . ( Clink looks at Clarence . ) CLARENCE You look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought her for more than a year , Clarence , and she has been spirited from one place to another . Today I have traced her to your house . She is not upstairs ; She may be below-stairs. p. 65 CLARENCE ( To Clink . ) Fetch the cook . RICHARD III Fetch out every woman who works for you . CLARENCE Good . Fetch them . ( He turns . ) Good hunting to you . ( Clink goes out right . ) RICHARD III Do n't try to slip away , Clarence . Those are the king 's soldiers about your house . CLARENCE Why are they here ? RICHARD III You were setting yourself up to be king , with the help of Bishop Morton and the little troubador . The stealing of Anne was only part of your scheme . Edward sent me to arrest you . CLARENCE I ? You would arrest me ? RICHARD III The way you were playing it , it was your neck or brother Edward 's . He prefers his own . ISABEL NEVILLE ( Outside , to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( She runs in , followed by a man-at-arms . ) CLARENCE And so am I , but not till little brother learns his lesson ! ( He draws his sword , Richard draws and disarms Clarence . ) RICHARD III Go with the captain . p. 66 CLARENCE I make an ignoble ending . ( He and Isabel turn and go with the officer . Clink comes from the right , leading the three girls with long spoons . ) CLINK Here be three . ( Richard turns to him . ) RICHARD III Three of what ? Three who eat with the devil ? Anne ! Anne ! ( He goes to her . ) ANNE NEVILLE ( Holding him off . ) I have my orders ! No followers ! " Beat them off with your long spoons , " says he ! RICHARD III Anne ! I 've found you at last ! ANNE NEVILLE Not in this dress , Richard ! It 's filthy to the floor ! It stinks ! RICHARD III ( His arms round her . ) I bring a new dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ANNE NEVILLE Richard ! Richard ! I knew you 'd find me ! I 've been skimming fat to make soap tomorrow ! ( They go out with their arms round each other . ) CLINK So I 'm stupid , am I ? And you was a lady , the pretty one . I might have known when she held her petticoats down . ( The lights go out on the scene and come up on Dag , who is seen sitting at stage left . Richard goes up to him. ) p. 67 DAG Have I kept my promise ? RICHARD III You have bettered it . It all came out as it was , every word as it was . DAG You thought you could n't remember . RICHARD III Where has it lain , this old day ? In what record book Is it written down and pictured ? DAG That I do n't know . But somewhere it is , The whole past , and can be called on . RICHARD III What have you called For our next scene ? DAG Bishop Stillington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , when I became king . DAG He 's here , you see . RICHARD III Yes , as he was . ( A bishop with a flowing beard and a lean ascetic face comes into the light . Richard approaches him in a flash of anger . ) BISHOP STILLINGTON You have sent for me , my lord ? RICHARD III Why have you done this ? BISHOP STILLINGTON I am a man of God , my king . I serve God first , and after God my king . I spoke The truth . RICHARD III Then you spoke it late ! p. 68 BISHOP STILLINGTON I spoke in time . RICHARD III Why not before ? BISHOP STILLINGTON My king , if I had told While Edward was alive , and on the throne , That he was a bigamist and his children bastards , What would have happened to me ? RICHARD III You 'd have lost your head . But a man who serves God should be willing to lose his head In that service . BISHOP STILLINGTON And what would God have gained ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her place , Her son would be king . RICHARD III I would he were . BISHOP STILLINGTON My lord , Things are one way or another , true or not true , As I see it . I married your brother , Edward Fourth , To Eleanor Butler , some years before he married Elizabeth Woodville . I 've brought before Parliament The documents and witnesses to attest this , And the Parliament , having no other course , With the evidence before them , have decided That Edward 's children are base-born , and therefore You must take the throne . RICHARD III I was loyal to Edward . Loyal to Edward 's son . My loyalty Has been my life . BISHOP STILLINGTON Be loyal now to England . For you are England 's king . ( There is a horn call at stage right , and Anne is seen standing there in a white dress with a long train . She wears a gold crown . Two lords hold the train of her dress. ) p. 69 RICHARD III The coronation Is not till tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paces . This is what I 'm to wear When we appear together . ( She comes to him . ) Oh , Richard , Richard , Should a crown seem so heavy ? RICHARD III Does it seem so ? ANNE NEVILLE Yes . And there 's something heavy here  --  and here . Could we escape this ? Could n't we be as we were , Let your nephew reign ? RICHARD III The bishop says no . BISHOP STILLINGTON The parliament says no . ANNE NEVILLE I do n't know why But I think it will be evil . RICHARD III I do n't want it , Do n't like it , and I think it will bring ill , But I do n't know why . BISHOP STILLINGTON You must rule England . RICHARD III God help us . BISHOP STILLINGTON Dear children , I think he will , and I think you will rule well . ( The lights go out on the scene , and come up on Dag as before . Richard speaks to him out of the darkness . ) RICHARD III There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was sometimes for me . To know that laws Were needed , like reforms in the jury system , ( He comes into the lights . ) More freedom for Caxton , the printer , better roads , Some order among the couriers that carried Letters and messages , things like this Gave me a little happiness sometimes , But never Anne . Perhaps she knew what waited For us , behind the years . Does one ever know What lies in wait ? p. 70 DAG I do . And since I do Others may . RICHARD III But nothing was really wrong Till our son died . Then everything went wrong , Everything together . ( The light comes up on Anne as she kneels in her regal finery over a white coffin . ) Must we see that now , Anne and our son gone ? Show us the Christmas time That came before . ( But Anne speaks . ) ANNE NEVILLE I kept him at Middleham . I did n't want him spoiled like Edward 's children , And I was wrong . The physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They might have saved him . They might have saved him . Oh , my little boy ! And I did n't want you spoiled ! Edward ! Edward ! My little son ! RICHARD III Let us see the Christmas , Dag ! This all comes late , too late and out of order ! Why should I not see Anne and see my son When he was alive and she was happy ? ( The lights fade on Anne . ) DAG My lord , You will ! I suppose it comes as one remembers  --  Not always whole  --  or in order . RICHARD III But that last Christmas . Let 's try to have it whole  --  not only Anne And our son  --  but my brother Edward , who was king , With his queen and their two sons . p. 71 DAG That was the day He chose you to be protector . RICHARD III Was it that day ? Would you know that ? DAG You told me of it later . During the masque I watched you talking apart , And you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind now  --  And seems to come with music . Was there a song ? DAG " Oh , melancholy Is the holly "  --  RICHARD III " In the summertime . " ( He muses a moment . ) Dag , so far I 've said Only the words I was supposed to say In the days called back . What would happen to her , To Anne , if I said more ? DAG You 've seen it . She fades . RICHARD III But in her heart  --  in her mind ? What happens there ? Is it a hurt ? DAG It 's the bitterness of dying To be suffered through again . Or so it was When it came first to me . Let her believe That the hour is new . RICHARD III Well  --  now the Christmas . The king was there , and the queen . ( A Christmas carol begins in the darkness , a boy 's voice singing and a lute or cithern playing with him . As the song proceeds the lights come up on the scene and Dag is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nine or ten , and singing for his father and mother , Richard and Anne , who sit listening . With them are King Edward IV and his queen , Elizabeth Woodville , and their two children . Two servants stand in the rear ) p. 72 DAG &amp; EDWARD The Holly Tree ( singing ) " Back in the summertime The sober holly treeWas hung with berries green , oh , Green as they could be.Oh , melancholyWas the holly In the summertime ! But in the wintertime The merry holly treeIs hung with berries red , oh , Red as they can be , Oh , red and jollyIs the holly In the winter time ! " ( Richard and Anne applaud ) PRINCE EDWARD Master Dag , may I ask you a question ? DAG Master Edward , out of question you may . RICHARD III ( To Anne , low . ) What is this ? ANNE NEVILLE Do n't interrupt . They 've rehearsed it . RICHARD III Oh . ( He takes Anne 's hand . ) DAG Ask your question , Master Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ? DAG Oh , I 'm left-handed . I usually eat with my left hand . PRINCE EDWARD That 's strange . DAG What 's strange about it ? p. 73 PRINCE EDWARD Well , I always eat with my mouth ! Laugh , Mother , laugh ! That 's the joke ! ANNE NEVILLE We 're all laughing ! Do n't you hear us ? EDWARD IV We 're roaring with mirth ! ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Listen ! Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ! RICHARD III The king is laughing ! And the queen ! PRINCE EDWARD Oh , but that one 's not so good ! We have a much better one , do n't we Dag ? DAG Much better . RICHARD III I like your singing , too . PRINCE EDWARD Oh , but , listen ! Master Dag , why was the princess blind ? DAG Because the prince was handsome ? PRINCE EDWARD No . DAG Because she was bashful ? PRINCE EDWARD No , no ! She was blind because when the prince came in she dropped her eyes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEVILLE I 'm laughing ! PRINCE EDWARD Is it funny ? EDWARD IV Ha , ha , ha ! I shall do myself a mischief ! p. 74 RICHARD III It 's very funny . Dag , you have a pitiful influence on the prince 's mind . DAG My lord , it was what he wanted . PRINCE EDWARD I want to be a jester when I grow up . RICHARD III Why not a warrior ? PRINCE EDWARD Because warriors know no music , and music is what I love . But now , if you will excuse me ! ( Little Edward sits . Dag is seen speaking . ) DAG This year , in place of the Christmas masque , your highnesses , we have an entertainment out of old days . The conquerors of England will appear before us habited as in their life-times , and give us a glimpse of what was . Julius Caesar will appear , and William the Conqueror . PRINCE EDWARD Oh , I 'll like that ! ANNE NEVILLE Yes , but listen quietly . EDWARD IV ( To Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARD III Of course . ( The king and Richard walk together , the king 's arm round Richard , to stage right , where they can speak aside . ) EDWARD IV ( Indicating Dag 's activities . ) Must we listen to this ? p. 75 RICHARD III Not if there 's something of importance to be said . It 's Dag 's usual Christmas pantomime . EDWARD IV Does he really bring back folk out of history , or is it all acting and mystification ? RICHARD III The truth is I do n't know . I do n't think he could bring folk back . EDWARD IV I do n't either  --  This is what I wanted to speak about ,  --  Two weeks ago I was struck down by something . For half a day I could n't move my left side . Then it went away , but it hangs over me . It could be a portent . RICHARD III My king  --  EDWARD IV Call me brother . You 've been the only man I could trust . The only man who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself . RICHARD III You have taken too little care of yourself . For the good of the state , you must live . Your sons are not old enough to manage England . EDWARD IV If I should die  --  RICHARD III There would be chaos . EDWARD IV Nevertheless , I might die . And if I do I do n't want my wife 's relatives setting up a regency and managing England and the children . They 're selfish , ambitious and unscrupulous , the lot of them . p. 76 RICHARD III What other course is there ? EDWARD IV I shall make you protector . With full powers to rule the kingdom during the children 's minority . RICHARD III My lord ,  --  EDWARD IV Brother , please  --  RICHARD III My brother  --  EDWARD IV ( Pointing to Dag . ) Look ! He 's brought Julius Caesar as he promised ! ( In a pool of light , Julius Caesar is seen standing alone , in deep thought . He lifts his arms in a gesture of despair . ) DAG When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do in Britain , he decided , standing alone on the road to Scotland , that he must give up and turn back . This is that moment . ( Caesar , dropping his arms , turns back slowly , looking longingly over his shoulder . ) RICHARD III We could have told him the Scotch are hardly worth the trouble . EDWARD IV Yes , we could , brother . But you 've brought order to the Highlands , anyway for the present . RICHARD III At least they 're quiet . EDWARD IV Lest we should not have time for this later , I 've had an instrument drawn , making you Protector in the event of my death , and I hand it to you now . ( He gives Richard a rolled parchment . ) A similar document is registered with the Parliament , so there could be no question of my intent . p. 77 RICHARD III You truly fear this ? EDWARD IV I truly fear what would happen if Rivers and Hastings  --  ah ! RICHARD III What is it ? EDWARD IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his group . ) DAG He who is seen now began many things ; his blood runs in your veins , most of you . ( A figure begins to show in the pool of light . ) When William the Conqueror first landed in Britain the little boat that put in from his ship was washed up on a beach near Bristol . William leaped out onto the sand , but the receding wave took the boat and his followers out again . He was left alone and somewhat dampened on the shingle . ( William is seen , calling to his mariners . ) WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR Holla ! Holla ! Que faites-vous ? Cochons ! Malheureux ! ( The figure fades and vanishes . ) EDWARD IV ( To Richard . ) Keep this safe , brother . RICHARD III I shall keep it safe , my king . DAG And now for the end , Your Majesties , we have a dance of our own devising . ANNE NEVILLE ( To the King and Richard . ) Richard ! Edward ! Could n't business come a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 78 EDWARD IV Ah , forgive us , Anne , let us see the dance ! ( The King and Richard return to their seats . ) DAG &amp; EDWARD ( Singing and dancing as they sing . ) But in the winter-time , The merry holly tree , Is hung with berries red , oh , Red as they can be ! Oh , red and jollyIs the holly In the winter rime ! ( The lights go out on the scene . Richard speaks out of the darkness . ) RICHARD III This was his last Christmas , and her last . No more music . For him or for her or for me , No more music . And yet , she loved me too . Why did it seem to her that life was empty After our son was gone ? I loved my lady . How could she believe that I loved elsewhere ? What put this in her mind ? DAG You were away in battle . And a woman came to stay with her , a woman Sent by Bishop Morton . And therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hours Together . This woman and Anne . RICHARD III Sent by Morton ? DAG And Henry . RICHARD III Even then  --  even then ! DAG But that was later too . You were in Scotland when your brother died , Leaving the throne to his little son . It all Came about as Edward feared . A swarm of uncles And brothers-in-law took power . ( The lights come up on a scene in which the Queen Elizabeth is surrounded by Lords Rivers , Hastings , Stanley and Grey , and consulting with Bishop Morton and Henry Tudor. ) p. 79 ARCHBISHOP MORTON You are the queen . Your son is the king of England , Or will be when he 's crowned . No duke on earth Can take this from you . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE But Richard is protector ; My husband made a will to this effect And the Parliament has the will . HENRY TUDOR If I may speak  --  ELIZABETH WOODVILLE ( Grudgingly . ) Yes , surely . HENRY TUDOR Madam , the duties of a protector , It 's a question what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be guardian of your son  --  A mother should care for her child . Well , this takes time , And while the courts are thinking the matter over You can make the kingdom yours . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE But the Parliament , Will it wait for the courts ? HENRY TUDOR It must wait . Your husband himself Taught it to honor the judges . LORD RIVERS Let us delay The coronation , consolidate the power In our own hands . HENRY TUDOR And when Richard arrives Let him protect himself , if he 's protector . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Delay the coronation ? HENRY TUDOR Till the boy 's crowned You will rule England . ( A servant looks in. ) p. 80 SERVANT Madam ? ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Yes ? SERVANT The Duke of Gloucester 's here , and  --  LORD RIVERS Richard ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON Good God , What shall we do with him ? HENRY TUDOR It 's simple enough . The queen must refuse to see him . LORD RIVERS Yes . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Since he 's here I think I must admit him . HENRY TUDOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Tell the duke That he may enter . SERVANT Yes , Madam . ( He goes out . ) HENRY TUDOR ( Turning away . ) I wo n't be here . ARCHBISHOP MORTON Nor I. ELIZABETH WOODVILLE You 'll stay and face him , all of you ! If he 's to be feared , and I 'm to hold him off Then stay and help me do it ! HENRY TUDOR Well , if you wish it . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE I wish it ! And if Bishop Morton is one of us Let him be seen here ! p. 81 ARCHBISHOP MORTON Very well . SERVANT ( Reentering . ) The Duke of Gloucester ! ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Let him come in . ( The servant steps aside and Richard comes into the presence of the queen , taking in the ring of advisors about her . ) RICHARD III My duty to you , Elizabeth . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE I thank you , Richard . RICHARD III And to all these about you My friendly greetings . This was sad news that caught me On the Scotch border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who loved her . I have lost A brother , who was my close friend . We , all of us , Have lost a king whom we can ill spare , a king Who wore the light of genius on him , a light To make men follow . Let us hope his son Will wear it when he 's grown . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE You are named Protector . When should my son be crowned ? RICHARD III At once . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Those about me advise delay . ARCHBISHOP MORTON There must be some pause  --  LORD RIVERS Some preparation . p. 82 RICHARD III But why ? ELIZABETH WOODVILLE There must of course be time for fitting costumes , And sending out invitations . RICHARD III Yes , for such things We must wait some days , perhaps . ARCHBISHOP MORTON How long ? RICHARD III ( To Elizabeth . ) You would know this better than I. ELIZABETH WOODVILLE What date is in your mind ? RICHARD III Why , this is the eighth of June ; Two weeks should be enough . On June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORTON I think I see your plan . You mean to crown the lad so that you , as Protector , May govern the kingdom . RICHARD III That is my intention . And that was my brother 's intent when he made the will . I shall try to carry it out . ARCHBISHOP MORTON You intend to govern ? RICHARD III I do . HENRY TUDOR Then , madam , when your son 's crowned This duke will act as king . RICHARD III But only during The king 's minority . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE When he comes of age You would resign as Protector ? p. 83 RICHARD III I will resign  --  Exactly as directed in Edward 's will . LORD RIVERS This I do not believe . ARCHBISHOP MORTON Nor I. HENRY TUDOR Nor I. ELIZABETH WOODVILLE ( To Henry . ) Who are you to speak in this presence ? The son of a son Of an obscure Welsh noble who married a widow Who was once married to a king ! Does this Give you a voice here ? HENRY TUDOR I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE I do n't trust your friend , And I do n't trust you ! I have more faith in Richard ! If he says he will resign the power he will ! I 'm quite certain you would not ! LORD RIVERS Madam , we agreed  --  ELIZABETH WOODVILLE I agreed to nothing ! Of all the men about him The king put most faith in Richard ! I shall trust him ! Let us set an immediate date for the coronation , As Richard advises ! LORD RIVERS You will lose the help Of the nobles who stand round you ; mine , for one ! . ARCHBISHOP MORTON And mine ! HENRY TUDOR And mine ! p. 84 LORD RIVERS Yes , every man here present Will be lost to you ! ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Why ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON Would you give up power When it 's in your hands ? ELIZABETH WOODVILLE I think it 's safer In Richard 's hands than yours ! And Edward thought so When he chose Richard ! LORD RIVERS If you choose Richard now I warn you plainly , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall speak plainly , too . The knot of men That clusters about the queen there  --  uncles , brothers , Hangers-on  --  you have made up your minds together To cling to the boy king , rule through him . This was not What Edward wanted . He made me Protector To guard against just that . And I shall try To carry out his wish . If you go to war This will tear England ! You have no legal claim  --  Only a hold on offices and powers Which you do n't want to lose . You 've held them long But that does not mean you own them . It would be far better To give up these powers and keep the peace . ARCHBISHOP MORTON Give up Your powers then ! Your power as Protector . I tell you we do n't trust you ! RICHARD III It 's well known That you 're a man to be trusted , Bishop Morton . The queen has made her choice . ( To Elizabeth . ) Do they hold your son ? p. 85 ELIZABETH WOODVILLE No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Richard . ) RICHARD III We must take our plans for the coronation . LORD RIVERS Leave me out of the plans . RICHARD III Very well . ARCHBISHOP MORTON One true thing you said : " This will tear England . " RICHARD III Let me revise what I said . You will tear England ! ( The scene darkens . Richard is seen speaking with Dag . ) Yes , it was that way . Or something like it . How it went on from there I do n't recall . Reality 's so confused  --  Motives , cross-purposes , irrelevant details ; In fact , it 's nearly all irrelevant Compared with a play . DAG The boy was never crowned . RICHARD III No . Shortly after this Bishop Stillington Went to Parliament with his news . DAG I was at the palace When a herald came to Elizabeth . ( There is a sudden fanfare of trumpets , and Elizabeth is seen with her women . A servant appears at the door . ) SERVANT Madam  --  ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Whose horns are these ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease this blaring ! Tell me his name When the noise ends ! ( The trumpets are silenced . ) SERVANT Madam , it 's only a herald Sent by the Parliament . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE He could come in less rudely . What does he want ? SERVANT To deliver a message . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Why , then , Let him come in with it . SERVANT Yes , madam , He 's here . ( The servant steps outside and a herald in full panoply enters . Coming before the queen , he lifts the horn to his lips . ) ELIZABETH WOODVILLE No , no ! No more of that ! We heard you come in And we know you 're here . You can put Your noise away And deliver your speech . HERALD Madam , I come to read A message from the Parliament ! ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Read and be done , I beg of you . HERALD ( Lifting a scroll and reading . ) From the Parliament of England , Greetings ! Greetings to Elizabeth , who sat Beside Edward as his queen , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . Whereas Bishop Robert Stillington of Bath Has come before the Lords and Commons , sitting Together , and has laid before them proofs That Edward was married to Lady Eleanor Butler Daughter of the first Earl of Shrewsbury , Married to her before he married you , Elizabeth , Therefore his children by you are all base-born , Born out of wedlock , and can not inherit , Can not inherit land , property , name or throne Of the aforesaid Edward ! p. 87 A WOMAN What 's that ? What 's that ? ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Is this a dream ? Is this Happening to me ? A WOMAN This can not be true ! ANOTHER WOMAN Does he come from the Parliament ? ANOTHER WOMAN He says he does . HERALD I have more to read . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE It can be no less welcome that what you 've read . Read on . HERALD Whereas King Edward left no heir Among his children , the throne of England passes To his next of kin , his brother  --  A WOMAN To his brother ? HERALD To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gloucester , Who is called to accept the throne , and will be when crowned , Richard the Third of England ! ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Let me see that paper ! HERALD ( Showing his scroll . ) I am sent by the Lords and Commons . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Unless this is a most elaborate fraud It seems to be true . They sent him . A WOMAN But this news  --  p. 88 ELIZABETH WOODVILLE I do n't believe it . He was a careless man Where women were concerned , but not that careless . HERALD I may take my leave ? ELIZABETH WOODVILLE You 've done your harm . You may go . ( The herald goes . ) Who is this Bishop of Bath , this Stillington , Who seems to speak for the devil ? When I was lowest , When I thought all was lost , and life was over I never imagined this ! Send for him ! God ! It may be true ! Send for this Stillington ! ( The lights darken on the scene , revealing Dag , where he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . ) RICHARD III You saw this ? DAG Yes  --  and remember it . RICHARD III And it turned out to be true  --  The king had been careless , Or worse , And left no heir among his children , And I was king . Dag , why did I lose at Bosworth ? I had never lost a battle , and Bosworth field Should have been mine . DAG You were betrayed , my lord . Stanley betrayed you . Half your army marched around to fight against you Under Lord Stanley 's orders . ( A light comes up on Henry , Stanley , Rivers , Grey and Morton , bearing arms. ) p. 89 LORD STANLEY What am I offered ? HENRY TUDOR Are you so blunt ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON Why , good , Let him be blunt if he likes ! We offer more Than you 'll get from Richard . LORD STANLEY Richard 's an honest man . I 'll get nothing from him That I have n't got already . HENRY TUDOR What do you say To Warwick 's estates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LORD STANLEY Warwick 's estates are nothing . For the name of earl , for that I 'd do a good deal . HENRY TUDOR Would you change sides ? LORD STANLEY When ? HENRY TUDOR In the midst of a battle . When you 're counted on . LORD STANLEY Let 's talk about it . ( The light darkens on the scene , comes up again on Richard and Dag . ) RICHARD III Anne had warned me against him . Our son was dead , and she Was dying , though I did n't know it then . I remember our last words together . There was a woman with her , as you said , Before I came . ( The lights come up on a couch where Anne is lying , pale and quiet . A woman sits beside her holding her hand. ) p. 90 ANNE NEVILLE I can not believe But that he loves me still . ALISON ( The woman . ) We must remember How selfish a love is , even in those who love Most deeply . The illness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity  --  a turning away From his love for her . ANNE NEVILLE I have been ill . ALISON And it is A turning away . ANNE NEVILLE But not an unfaith ! I love him ! ALISON There 's a cool selfishness in men that looks At life with hard eyes ; it 's in both men and kings , But most in kings . It looks at sickness and death As human conduct , conduct that we choose . Sickness is failure , death is departure . ANNE NEVILLE Richard , Richard , have I failed you ? ALISON You must not die , For if you die that 's a real perfidy To your king , your husband . ANNE NEVILLE It would be better , though . He could love elsewhere . ALISON We think when we 're in love That we 're not replaceable , but it 's not true ; No , when we 're gone it 's nature 's way for a man To look about him . ANNE NEVILLE If I were gone , and Richard Looked about , he 'd see Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are others who look at him . ANNE NEVILLE She follows him with her eyes ; then when he leaves The room she 's restless . After a while she makes Her excuses cleverly , and goes . ALISON Yes . ANNE NEVILLE But he never sees her , never ! ALISON Your son is dead . In a king unfaith Is sometimes a virtue . To be true to his kingdom Richard must have a son . ANNE NEVILLE Help me up ! ( She tries to rise . Alison helps her . ) My breath came hard for a moment . It will pass . Oh God ! Oh Richard ! RICHARD III ( At the doorway . ) Anne , did you call my name ? ANNE NEVILLE Richard , Richard ! You were away so long ! RICHARD III So many things  --  There 's an invasion pending . I must ready for that , And there 's money to raise .

ANNE NEVILLE ( Her arms round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow The music master , has made a claim to be king In my place  --  p. 92 ANNE NEVILLE He  --  king of England ? RICHARD III Little Henry , The one who stayed with Morton . His claim to the throne Is baseless , yet the man has some sinister power , He fills the air with evil . ANNE NEVILLE His face is evil . RICHARD III He 's being supported By some powerful nobles , and the king of France Lends him an army . ANNE NEVILLE I thought we 'd have peace at last . RICHARD III We should . We 've earned it . Yet if he lands on the coast With any force , I 'll have to fight him off  --  And that means money and soldiers . ANNE NEVILLE And you away , Always away . Could you stay with me , Richard ?

He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's not on a throne And does n't have to pay . It 's not like fighting With a man , it 's like fighting with a rat , a rat Whose bite is venomous .

RICHARD III He 's an honest man . ANNE NEVILLE But married to that woman ! Oh , my dear , You 've been too trusting . You forgave her when She plotted with Hastings against you , let her keep Her lands and titles ! Now her son invades And she 's married to your steward ! RICHARD III I know the woman , But I trust Lord Stanley . ANNE NEVILLE And Stanley 's brother Is chamberlain of North Wales ! Oh , what would happen If they went over to Henry ? RICHARD III If they changed sides Even Henry would have a chance . But the Stanleys have No reason to betray me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARD III Darling , you 're not well .

ANNE NEVILLE Dickon , I 'm foolish and sad  --  Not ill . You 'll never find me ill again , I promise you ! Do n't waste an hour with me ! You have a king 's work to do ! RICHARD III Not ill ? ANNE NEVILLE Not ill ! ( She rises . ) Kiss me and then tend , if you must , To this singer and his Stanleys ! I will not Lie a-bed when you come back ! RICHARD III That 's a promise ?

KENT ( Calling from the rear of the auditorium . ) Leger ! Mr. Leger ! p. 95 AL ( Looking out . ) He 's backstage , Mr. Kent . KENT I 'll come back . The squad 's on its way . It took a little time .  --  Are these shadows still operating ? AL They 're doing pretty well for shadows . Certainly nothing like Richard Third .

Why ca n't I speak to Anne As you speak to me  --  or Henry ? Whose rules are these ? Who made these rules ? DAG I do n't know . RICHARD III But you know what they are ! DAG My lord , There are no rules at all . RICHARD III Then you make rules , And you choose how to call Anne ! DAG Choose ? p. 96 RICHARD III Yes , magician ! I 've trusted you as a friend , but now I see Some kind of malevolence in the way you dangle Your grave-yard puppets ! You will have your show as you want it , And the puppets will speak as instructed ! Not otherwise ! Is it so ? DAG No . No , master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is darkness in every mind That no eye has seen into . Do you know All that 's in your mind ? RICHARD III No . DAG Master , truly , I ca n't control what I want and whom I call for , Some things I can not do ! RICHARD III What ca n't you do ? DAG Master , forgive me . This same darkness in me , I think it does n't want my mistress to know You were not unfaithful . Would rather she believed She 'd lost you . RICHARD III Why ? What do you gain by this ? DAG Loss ? Gain ? Is there ever any loss or gain For the demons in that subterranean chasm Where we do our thinking ? RICHARD III It 's because you love her . DAG One could put it so . RICHARD III And I can not say to Anne Any new thing ? p. 97 DAG I 've tried to change this . I ca n't . There 's something in me that wo n't . Forgive me !

But see her ! Only a little ! Once again ! Before I go back ! DAG After this scene , The scene with Henry , I 'll call her . RICHARD III Very well.Let 's have him . ( He turns away . The lights dim on Dag and Richard and come up on Henry and his nobles in formal court costume . ) HENRY TUDOR My friends and nobles , we May breathe more easily now ! The savage king Who ruled here in this island , has been buried , In the mud of a battlefield . Richard the Third is dead . The bloody boar , The guilty dog , is dead ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rape , the truth is open councils Instead of falsehood . My first act has been To redeem the name of Edward Fourth . His children Were not bastards , he was no bigamist , As Richard proclaimed . And to do further honour To Edward 's blood and line , I shall now make Elizabeth , his daughter , queen of England , By taking her to wife . Her mother , the widow Of Edward Fourth , shall have a place in our court , Shall be queen mother . Elizabeth , is this What you would choose ? p. 98 ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Do you address me or my daughter , My lord ? We are both Elizabeth . HENRY TUDOR I address Your daughter first . ELIZABETH OF YORK My lord , I have not wished To marry , have not looked so high . HENRY TUDOR But now , Hearing the offer , does yes come to your lips , Or no ? You are free to choose . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE Let me answer for her , My dread lord . Before you offer marriage To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guilty despot Who came before me , Richard , must answer that . Your sons are dead . He killed them . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE They were alive After his death . I saw them alive and well After the battle of Bosworth . HENRY TUDOR You mistake The date then . ELIZABETH WOODVILLE I tell you I saw them !  --  If they are dead You killed them ! HENRY TUDOR No more at present . We shall have private conference . Bishop Morton , We come next to you . You shall be made Our archbishop of Canterbury , and inducted Within the year . Our further plans shall be Revealed tomorrow . LORD STANLEY My lord ! p. 99 HENRY TUDOR No more today . LORD STANLEY My lord , I am sorry If I should seem importunate , but the lands That I was promised  --  HENRY TUDOR You shall have all and more Than you were promised , Stanley ; in my own time . This concludes the presence . LORD STANLEY ( Bowing . ) My lord .

ARCHBISHOP MORTON I have  --  HENRY TUDOR Alone ! ( Morton bows and Vergil goes out hastily . ) This queen mother woman , Elizabeth ! This is not be borne ! Take care of her ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON Quite easily , your grace . HENRY TUDOR There are convents From which one hears nothing ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON There are . HENRY TUDOR Keep her alive . It may be useful . ARCHBISHOP MORTON Will you marry the daughter ? p. 100 HENRY TUDOR I have no liking for it , but she is The daughter of Edward , and strengthens My tenuous title to this crown I wear . ARCHBISHOP MORTON The boys are dead ? HENRY TUDOR They are . I had to make Elizabeth legitimate to piece out My claim to the succession . But that made The sons legitimate also . They were then The obvious heirs to the throne . Well , they are dead , And since the mother seems recalcitrant We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORTON Is that enough ? HENRY TUDOR What do you mean ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON A more elaborate story With names and dates and witnesses is needed If men are to be convinced . HENRY TUDOR Convinced of what ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON That Richard killed them . HENRY TUDOR I have a storm Of things to do . I have no time to fashion A story with witnesses and dates . Those Stanley brothers , Let them be placed where they can be forgotten And nothing said . As for the children , Richard , Their uncle , killed them ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON But your bare word , my lord , Will not be taken for this . Oh , at first it will , While it 's not healthy to contradict . But later , The chroniclers will find you out . p. 101 HENRY TUDOR Well , let them . ARCHBISHOP MORTON Let them ? HENRY TUDOR Can they be stopped ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON I think they 'd better be . You wish to leave a Tudor name , to found A Tudor dynasty . But the Tudors have No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARCHBISHOP MORTON In anyone else . To make it certain that no rebel ever Tries to put the Plantagenets back in power You must blacken your predecessor . Make him so foul That he 's a by-word . Otherwise sometime Somebody will look too hard at your antecedents , And find them flimsy , and stir people up , perhaps Overthrow you  --  or your son . HENRY TUDOR Let us blacken him then . How do we go about it ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON In the first place , It was Parliament put Richard on the throne , Declaring him king after Edward . Expunge that act , My lord , cut it out of the rolls . Make it appear That he usurped his place . HENRY TUDOR Who can do this ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON There are experts who know where to find the vellum Clear back to the Conqueror . Give me power to do it And I 'll see it 's done . p. 102 HENRY TUDOR You have it . ARCHBISHOP MORTON That 's to begin . History 's written by the victors , or So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll employ Our own historians to indite our version Of Richard 's reign . If there 's anything you 've done You 'd rather not be blamed for , anything That Edward did , that we could lay on Richard , Let 's set our scriveners at it . HENRY TUDOR Do you have men in mind ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON This lad that was here  --  He 's a historian of some note at home  --  He can be paid to write . HENRY TUDOR Can he be trusted ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON If we pay him enough . Shall I call him ? HENRY TUDOR He 's ready to begin ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON He has no honor , piety or truth , I 've sounded him . Fear nothing . He 's a writer . And the sooner we 're launched the better . There 's too much truth Abroad . It must be headed off with lies . HENRY TUDOR Bring him . ( Morton steps to the door and beckons . Vergil enters and bows . ) ARCHBISHOP MORTON You will make some notes of this . POLYDORE VERGIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the princes , Edward 's heirs , Was carried out by Richard . Dress that up With names and dates , and the kind of accessories That make gossip into truth . POLYDORE VERGIL Yes , truly . ( He bows over his notes . ) ARCHBISHOP MORTON What else ? HENRY TUDOR He murdered Henry the Sixth ! Why this is a game Such as I had n't imagined ! We 'll write our own , Our very own history ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON And the world will take it ! HENRY TUDOR You have that ? POLYDORE VERGIL Yes , my lord . HENRY TUDOR He murdered Clarence ! But wait , now , wait . Clarence was executed By Edward . ARCHBISHOP MORTON We control the documents . That can be arranged . HENRY TUDOR You 're sure of that ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON Yes . We place new records where the old have lain , And truth lies darkling . HENRY TUDOR Good ! He murdered Clarence ! POLYDORE VERGIL Could I suggest  --  ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON Yes ? p. 104 POLYDORE VERGIL Why , I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a by-word Let it be whispered about as Richard 's jest , " He was drowned in a butt of Malmsey . " HENRY TUDOR Vergil , your name is ? POLYDORE VERGIL Yes , my lord . Polydore Vergil . HENRY TUDOR I like this Vergil Better than the other ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON I was right ? HENRY TUDOR Right . And now I have an idea . This game gives me ideas . This Richard lad was a slim young man-at-arms Who took the fore-front in battles . I did well To stay out of his reach . But when we write about him Let us make him a monster . Let us make him hump-backed , And lame ! With a horrible aspect ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON And born with teeth ! HENRY TUDOR A full set ! POLYDORE VERGIL And a head of hair ! HENRY TUDOR And a withered arm . Two withered arms ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON No  --  one . One withered arm . HENRY TUDOR Why one ? HENRY TUDOR Why , he fought in battles . He held a sword . p. 105 HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me see , Are there no pictures of Richard ? ARCHBISHOP MORTON If there are This story will destroy them ! Who wants to believe The dull truth when a horrid heap of bones Comes mumbling and murdering out with a fee-fie-foe And a withered arm ? That 's edged with genius , That withered arm part ! ( Richard moves slowly in the shadows , and Henry , catching sight of him , seems to realize his position . ) HENRY TUDOR I 've been tricked again ! Fools ! We 've been tricked  --  you , too , Morton of Ely  --  you with your Vergil ! No more of this ! ARCHBISHOP MORTON My lord , what 's wrong ? HENRY TUDOR There 's Richard in the shadows ! And that 's the jury . Sitting there in rows ! A monstrous jury , sitting to judge of us In some latter-day festival , In a court unknown !  --  , Say nothing ! I 'll say no more ! Go ! ( Morton and Vergil dim and vanish , but Henry can not find the exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Dag leaps into the scene to stop him , and Richard , following , blocks the other side . Henry runs to and fro like a ball-player trapped between bases , dwindling in stature till he begins to look like a rat again . ) DAG Here ! No  --  there he goes ! p. 106 RICHARD III He 's here . No  --  the rat eludes me . DAG Damn him ! ( He catches Henry , then loses him . ) RICHARD III He 's got smaller ! DAG He 's turning back to rat ! RICHARD III ( Getting a firm grip on Henry 's collar . ) I begin to believe In the transmigration of souls ! Pythagorus Understood these things ! HENRY TUDOR ( Snapping . ) Ck , ck , ck ! DAG Do n't let him bite you ! It 's poisonous ! He 's filthy ! RICHARD III He 's bitten me already ! ( He shakes Henry . ) I see it now , you very filthy king ! A commoner , Not even a fanatic , With no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sausages . You 've worked From the beginning , to make yourself king of England ! A maker of sour music , king of England ! First with Clarence , you plotted and connived , And kidnapped , Pretending he was to reign , Then with Hastings , saying he 'd be king , Then with Stanley , letting him have illusions , But you 'd have none , You meant it all for yourself ! One by one you destroyed them , and went on , Murdering , lying , planning in secret , Till at last the throne was mine  --  And you could take it from me By promising Stanley what I would n't give him , Making a traitor of the man I trusted , And when you 'd beaten me , when I was gone You cut off Stanley 's head  --  and you were king !

What an odor ! HENRY TUDOR ( Straightening still more . ) Yes ! We 'll act out the scenes if you like ! It wo n't change The minds of the jury ! Tell it as much as you like ! Tell it and show it ! The histories have stood Four hundred years the same ! Men know what they think Of Richard and of Henry ! You 're a hunchback And a murderer of children !

AL ( Who has been listening . ) If I may  --  RICHARD III Speak , sir . AL I was out in the lobby tonight , After the first act . I listened to the audience . And the feeling was that though it was interesting To see what happened , And it might very well be true That it happened this way , They liked the old version better , With its hump-backed usurper And they 'd rather watch it again , Though it might be fiction , Because it seemed bright and clear and real . RICHARD III And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things is misty . Compared with that scene we saw early in the evening It 's misty indeed . Maybe when a great poet takes over history  --  Whether it 's lies or truth  --  and writes his vision Into such blazing words , that 's reality  --  What really happened has no chance against it .  --  Beware of great poets , then . What they say is final , ca n't be contradicted . Well  --  let it go as it is ! Let the rat king lie down Among his stolen purples ! The poet wins . His earth 's more real than ours .
