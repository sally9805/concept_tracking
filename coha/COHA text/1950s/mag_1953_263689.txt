The Presidential plane Columbine hummed northward from Bermuda , high over the Atlantic . In his midships cabin , Dwight Eisenhower sat at his desk , making final corrections and checks on the speech he would give , later in the afternoon , before the U.N . ' s General Assembly ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) . As the President finished each page , he handed it across the aisle to Ann Whitman , his private secretary , who sat before a special I.B.M . electric typewriter equipped with jumbo type . As Mrs. Whitman finished the final proofed copy of the speech , she passed it on to Mary Caffrey , secretary to James Hagerty , who banged out stencils for the duplicating machines . <P> Back in the tail of the plane , Press Secretary Hagerty , manning a hand-operated machine , cranked out press copies of each stencil . When Hagerty had duplicated 600 copies of each of the nine pages of text , AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss , Presidential Adviser C. D. Jackson and the rest of the presidential party snatched up pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line stood Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , armed with a hand stapler , who efficiently fastened the copies of the speech together . By the time the Columbine landed in New York , Ike 's high-level assembly line had 200 advance copies of the speech ready-enough to satisfy the immediate appetite of the press and radio . <P> Three Weeks to Go . Ike 's speech gained for him-and the U.S.-new influence on the world 's somber thoughts of war and peace ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . That evening , Ike went aboard the Columbine again and headed for Washington and one of the biggest jobs his Administration has faced : final preparation of the program which he will present to Congress in just three weeks . His Administration and the Republican Party , the President has solemnly stated , will stand or fall on that program . <P> Next morning , the President summoned the Cabinet for the first of three meetings in the space of a week . Ike apologized to the Cabinet members for putting them through an 80-hour work week , getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . But , he explained , he wanted to be as well prepared as possible for his three-day conference this week with the leaders of Congress . Much depended on their suggestions and reactions , and Ike wanted to be fully prepared . <P> A Powerful Persuader . The President intends to take a strong hand in pushing his program up Capitol Hill next January . He plans to use a powerful persuader to assist him . If Congress balks or bogs down , Ike will simply step.up his schedule of speeches and TV appearances , and tell the public all about it . <P> In the midst of his busy week , President Eisenhower found time to see his old friend Governor Thomas Dewey , who came down from New York to protest the " unprecedented interference " of the Interstate Commerce Commission with Dewey 's efforts to reorganize the bankrupt Long Island Rail Road . The Pennsylvania Railroad had applied to the ICC for a 25% rate increase on the Long Island , which it owns . Dewey felt that , since the Long Island lies wholly within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction - especially no jurisdiction to raise commuter fares on the residents of two heavily Republican counties . Ike promised to look into the matter .
