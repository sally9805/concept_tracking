txt President Eisenhower appeared to please nearly all the political Cen-I ter in Congress today by the civil rights , loyalty and immigration policies laid down in his State of the Union Message . " The Left Wing at some points and the Right Wing at other points were made far from happy , for varying reasons . The prospect raised was that the President could count upon at least as much Democratic support as Republican support  --  and perhaps more  --  for his approach in these fields , which encompass some // CIVIL RIGHTS PLANS GET WIDE SUPPORT Confirmed From Page 1 of the most emotional domestic issues of the times . The immediate meaning of the President 's declarations was seen by observers in and out of Congress about as follows : ' hat a , ny national civil rights . program carrying Federal compul-1 sions and penalties against racial discrimination in hiring , segregation and so on could be considered beyond the realm of practical pos- ' sibility for a long time to &Fie.; ' That . the Eisenhower Administration intended to run its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not gladly tolerate Congressional interventions and investigations in that field .

Job for the Attorney General The more general implications and ramifications of the President 's message were such as to suggest to many politicians " he was moving at the outset well away from the Republican group exemplified by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin . For example , on the question of loyalty of Federal officials and employes , the President made it emphatic that this was a responsibility not for Congress but for his own Executive Department and that it would be handled under the guidance of the Attorney General , Herbert Brownell Jr .

This development was applauded , though in private , by both the middle-roaders and the liberals in Congress . The latter were especially ? gratified because the President bad indicated that his Administration would seek not only to serve ' Titional security but " to clear the atmosphere of that unreasoned suspicion that accept rumor and gossip as substitutes for evidence . " - The Democrats , on the word of dome of the most powerful among them , stood ready to back the President in this , and ; already there was some cloakroom twitting of the Republicans to the effect : " Your investigations are gone " mow .

As to civil rights , the Center and Right Wings felt profound satisfaction that the President had not asked for action ' toward Federal legislation . Those forming the heart of the opposition to such laws , members of the southern Senate bloc , expressed chagrin that General Eisenhower had gone so far as to promise to " use whatever authority exists in the office of the President " Ito end racial segregation in the District of Columbia , the Federal bureaucratic offices and the armed forces . South Would Oppose Bills Southerners suggested , however , that the President actually could not accomplish the elimination of segregation in Washington short of new laws , which they would be prepared to oppose . As to the Federal offices and the armed forces , they asserted , there is little segregation now anyhow .

As a practical matter , however , they turned their hopes toward immigration reform-specifically for amendments that the President had indicated were necessary to correct present " injustices . " For example , Senator Herbert H. Lehman , Democrat of New York , spoke of this part of the Presidential ? message as " fine , " and . declared . that it might ultimately bring success to the long efforts of a Senate minority to make entry into this country less difficult .
