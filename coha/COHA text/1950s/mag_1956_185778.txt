Air Force Captain Manuel J. Fernandez Jr . is an old hand at taking chances . In the dangerous skies over Korea , he took so many and took advantage of them so well that he accounted for 14 MIGs . To his annoyance , peacetime duty kept his adventures to a minimum . Last year Captain Fernandez discovered a new way to cut loose . He began to devote all his spare time to planning and practicing for the Bendix Trophy race , a 1,120-mile dash from George Air Force Base , Calif , to Will Rogers Field in Oklahoma City . <P> The rules for last week 's contest gave Fernandez every opportunity to push his luck to the limit . Hungry for a supersonic record , race officials decided to give pilots their choice between air-to-air refueling and lugging underslung wing tanks . <P> <P> No longer would they have to throttle back for their pass above the Will Rogers pylon . They could let down as fast as they wanted to - provided that they stayed above 5,000 ft. so that the shattering racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators or jostle instruments . <P> Fernandez figured everything to a split second , scorned the time-consuming safety of taking on extra fuel in the air , climbed as high as 30,000 ft. running away from head winds , got his F-100C Super Sabre jet to Oklahoma City with exactly one minute of fuel left . His nice calculations earned him the Bendix Trophy and a new Bendix record : 666.661 m.p.h . In second place , with 656.250 m.p.h . : Captain Robert A. Madden , a Korean veteran who spent 15 months as a PW . Although adverse winds edged them out of a supersonic trip , all six contestants , all flying North American F-100Cs , cracked the record of 616.208 m.p.h. set two years ago by Captain Edward Kenny in an F-84F.
