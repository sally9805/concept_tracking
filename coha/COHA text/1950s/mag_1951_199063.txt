Andrew Conway Ivy , who ranks high among U.S. physiologists and still higher as a vice president of the University of Illinois and booster of its medical schools , was on the spot last winter . For 18 months , he had been doing hush-hush research with a drug named Krebiozen which seemed to have helped a few cancer patients for a while . He wanted to go on and find out whether Krebiozen was really valuable , and that would take years . <P> But Krebiozen is no ordinary drug . It is a secret concoction from the blood of horses , made after the animals have been given a secret " stimulator . " The maker of Krebiozen was an emigr Yugoslav researcher named Stevan Durovic , who worked with the financial backing of his rich brother Marko . The Durovics were in the U.S. on visitors ' visas which were about to expire . They were threatening to finish their work abroad , slap Krebiozen on the market . <P> Blocked Channels . To win an extension of the Durovics ' U.S. visas , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work they were doing . He could not do this through the usual medical channels because the job was far from finished and , anyway , medical journals would have rejected reports on a " secret remedy . " Dr. Ivy took his dilemma by the horns , told a press conference about Krebiozen , and started a first-class foofaraw ( TIME , April 9 ) . <P> Slowly , the mills of the Chicago Medical Society began to grind-with a formal complaint that Ivy 's conduct was unethical . One committee after another studied the charge , called Dr. Ivy in for consultation . Many of Ivy 's most admiring colleagues shook their heads sadly over his action . " Ivy 's really stuck his neck way out , " they said , or , " He 's courageous but foolish . " <P> Ivy could get little information from Durovic about the " secret " of Krebiozen ; the little that Ivy got , he passed on promptly to the medical society . It was enough , he argued , to take Krebiozen out of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , the A.M.A. reported on its own investigation of 100 patients treated with the drug : only two benefited even for a short time , and 44 died ( TIME , Nov. 5 ) . The A.M.A. rejected it as a treatment . <P> " No Ambiguity . " Last week the Chicago Medical Society found Illinois ' Ivy " guilty of unethical conduct , " and suspended him from membership for three months . " It was regrettable , " said the society 's council , " that Dr. Ivy would associate himself with a drug whose physical and chemical properties were kept a secret . This was a specific violation of medical ethics . . . There is nothing ambiguous about these ethics . . . One principle . . . reads : ' The prescription or dispensing by a physician of a secret medicine ... of which he does not know the composition , or the manufacture or promotion of its use , is unethical ' . . . Any physician who violates this principle is doing a grave and pathetic disservice to humanity . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
