( See Cover ) <P> The life of the land is preserved in righteousness. * <P> - Hawaii 's motto <P> In the village of Kilauea. on the northernmost Hawaiian island of Kauai. the workmen from the sugar plantation began to drift in to vote about midmorning . Tony Castro , 53 , a naturalized Filipino-American , had been up since dawn , when he started the day by opening the mountain gates for the morning 's irrigation . As he edged through the throng toward the paint-flaked schoolhouse , he was besieged by election workers who begged a vote for their candidates . Castro shook his head wordlessly . Behind him , wearing dirt-streaked khaki pants , sweat-stained shirt and heavy shoes , Louie Pacheco , 44 , operator of a harvesting machine , broke through the campaign workers with the cheerful promise to vote for everybody . " Hey , Louie ! " yelled a friend . " See you pan hana after work ? Plenty feesh at Kapukamoi ! " Replied Louie in pidgin English : " No more da car . Da ole lady bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " offered the friend . " Hokay ! " yelled Louie , as he ducked into the schoolhouse . <P> Three hundred miles to the southeast , on the " Big Island " of Hawaii , workers from Kona coffee plantations and leather-faced cowboys from the Parker Ranch headed toward the polling places to mark , their ballots . On Kauai and the Big Island , and on each of the other luxuriant , diamondlike islands of the chain , the people of Hawaii were casting their votes in the first major election since Congress enacted the statehood bill last March . Never before had such a pageant launched an American state . To the polling places came men in bright aloha shirts and slacks , women in cotton-print Western dresses and loose-fitting , ankle-length muumuus. - They were Japanese , Chinese , Korean . Filipino , Puerto Rican , purebred Hawaiian and haole ( Caucasian ) , and combinations thereof , and they represented together the broad racial spectrum that gives Hawaii its unique vitality . <P> Hello &; Goodbye . As the hours passed , that vitality began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honolulu ( est. pop . 311,000 ) , impromptu motorcades crisscrossed the crowded streets , as passengers happily shouted campaign cries and drivers leaned heavily on their horns , all drenched with the celebrated spirit of aloha , that flavorsome. catchall Hawaiian term that means peace , warmth , kindness , hello and goodbye , and good luck . And this time , even aloha had an added special flavor injected by the general awareness that Hawaii was on the threshold of a new epoch , sharpened by the fact that there were 81 different elective offices at stake-in the state legislature ( 25 in the senate , 51 in the house ) , in the U.S. Congress ( two in the Senate , one in the House ) , and in the posts of Governor and Lieutenant Governor . Biggest prize : the governorship , since Hawaii 's chief executive will control no fewer than 750 job appointments , and in this way affect Hawaii 's political posture for years to come .                  @ @ @
