" Mr. Casey , who is here for talks with United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , British Foreign Secretary , Anthony Eden , and French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault , added that " the retention of southeast Asia in general and Indochina in particular in non-Communist hands is of great importance to Europe . " In official circles in Britain recently there has been stress on the possibility of partition of Indochina as a solution to the present military impasse . Reflecting this attitude , The Times , of London , declared April 19 , " It is believed that the British Government would countenance a truce in Indochina if the Communists could be sealed off in one neighborhood , such as northeast Vietnam , and effectively restrained from further incursions .
