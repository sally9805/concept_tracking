The first time Professor Walter Hallstein visited the U.S. , he was marched ashore at the point of an M1 carbine in 1944 . He was a P.W. , an owlish-looking Wehrmacht lieutenant captured at Cherbourg , and he was bound for the stockade at Camp Como , Miss . He did n't mind much . " It was like a monastery , " he recalls , " an ideal place for study . No alcohol , no girls , no outside diversions . " <P> Last week , a bachelor at 51 , the Herr Professor was back in the U.S. But behind him this time stood the growing importance of the Bonn Republic . The Wehrmacht lieutenant was now Bonn 's first Secretary of State and , in all but name , Foreign Minister of the new West German Republic . His destination was not a prison camp but Washington 's Georgetown University , where he was scheduled to deliver a lecture . <P> Candid Answer . In prison camp , Hallstein had quickly been spotted as a " good German , " and hustled home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rector of Frankfurt University , he was busy trying to run a university of penniless students and wrecked buildings when his phone rang one day in the spring of 1950 . The call summoned Hallstein to Bonn . There Chancellor Konrad Adenauer asked : " What do you know about the Schuman Plan ? " Replied the professor candidly : " Something less than there has been in the newspapers . " Hallstein emerged from the Chancellery as chief of Germany 's Schuman Plan delegation . <P> When the Allies allowed Bonn to have foreign affairs , Professor Hallstein , dressed in a worn tweed jacket and odd slacks , became the postwar successor to arrogant Nazi Joachim von Ribbentrop . He was no pro , but that fact was reassuring to Germany 's unforgiving neighbors . To ease French fears that Germany might dominate the Schuman Plan , he quietly pointed out that the Ruhr will contribute more than half of the coal and one-third of the steel , but will have only two members on the nine-man high authority . <P> Wined &; Dined . Arriving in Washington last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , he expressed a mild hope that the State Department might find a little time for him . The Department did better than that . He chatted privately for 20 minutes with Dean Acheson , dined with two assistant secretaries , and was cross-questioned by 20 State Department German specialists . <P> Their verdict was the same as that of Western European diplomats : even those who question Germany 's regeneration do not question the professor 's sincerity . He calls European unity " the new reality , " but realizes as well as anyone else that the new reality has not yet been sold to the West Germans themselves . Says the professor : " We wo n't stop trying . "
