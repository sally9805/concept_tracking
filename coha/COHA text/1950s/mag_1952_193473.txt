Ever since the Inter-American Press Association met in New York two years ago , Argentina 's Peronistas have been trying to wreck it . They noisily protested that I.A.P.A. was " created by the United States to dominate newspapers in the Western Hemisphere . " A fortnight ago , when I.A.P.A. 's eleven-nation board met in Panama , it passed a stinging resolution condemning Peron 's seizure of La Prensa , Argentina 's once-great independent newspaper . The board also drafted a newsprint-sharing plan to help Latin American publications , leaving Argentina out in the cold . <P> Last week the Peronistas struck back . The Central Bank of Argentina announced that henceforth import permits will be required for many U.S. magazines and the Argentine post office said that 13 of them were banned from the mails . The banks made it plain that no import licenses would be issued .
