Doctors noted long ago that women get relief from rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy , then relapse within a couple months . Why does pregnancy have this effect ? Some arthritis researchers have tried to find a drug or chemical which would get the same results ( hence , ACTH and cortisone treatments ) . Dr. Louis W. Granirer of Queens General Hospital in New York City reasoned that the healing substance was probably in the blood of pregnant women , and probably stayed there for a while after childbirth . <P> Last week Dr. Granirer gave striking evidence to the Society of Medical Jurisprudence that his hunch had paid off . A healthy woman after a normal delivery can readily spare some blood ; from each volunteer , Dr. Granirer took about seven ounces . The plasma was pooled and about half a pint given to bedridden arthritis victims . After a few weekly transfusions , each recipient gained weight , lost pain and swelling , felt better in every way . By way of proof , Dr. Granirer showed movies of former cripples jumping rope . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 97 pounds when treatment was begun ; her husband picked her up like a doll when she had to be moved . Now hale &; hearty , she weighs 170 pounds , and her husband complains that she can toss him around . <P> Dr. Granirer has had 24 arthritics under treatment with postpartum plasma , half of them for two years . He has learned to cut the plasma dosage to 200 cc. and to reduce the number of treatments . Patients do not need to be hospitalized . The plasma takes longer ( a month or two ) than ACTH or cortisone to produce benefits . But the effects of the plasma , he believes , also last longer ; relapses ( which are often cruelly severe after hormone treatments ) usually can be prevented by three or four transfusions a year . Best of all , says Dr. Granirer , he has not had a single case marred by incidental ill effects from the plasma . Judging from these preliminary reports , nature 's remedy for arthritis seems to be the safest .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
