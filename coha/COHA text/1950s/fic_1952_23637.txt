Captain of the White Yacht A Story by Max Steele Drawings by David Carlson N ISLAND , to be sure , is a timeless place . But these sandbanks off the Carolina shores are as involved with time as one is with a memory which threatens to quiver with life . A stranger has the same feeling here he might have when he awakes at twilight and finds that the watch on his wrist has stopped and the only clue from the gray sky through the window is that it is either dusk or dawn . But then the stranger hears the commanding ticking of the hall clock and the wonder becomes agony . Somewhere order exists and he can not lie pleasantly on his back perusing the opalescent sky and choosing at will either dawn or dusk . Perhaps the natives whose families have existed on the outerbanks for a hundred years and longer are not time-haunted . Perhaps in their hall they have a different clock which the stranger can not see or hear : a clock which keeps a secret time . They tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noigh touching the light'ouse now . Ere it was amoil away . " And " ere " may mean either yesterday or two hundred years ago . An island is timeless and constant ; on the outer-banks the shorelines shift with the seasons and within a man 's lifetime he may surf fish where he once hunted golden pheasants and chased ' wild ponies . He may build a house where once he launched a boat . Thus the changing sea gradually ate into the land and threatened the lighthouse ; thus a tower with the new light was built in the low pine hills above Baxter , a mile away from the old lighthouse and the inconstant sea . A light a mile away from the lighthouse , one would think , could easily have been confusing to unchartered boats , but every day ships passed safely in Punto Sound and on the Atlantic  --  every day except one . Late on that September evening before good dark , four men from Little Mitty Mitchell saw a white yacht approaching . It was a beautiful craft , a pleasure boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly toward an underwater sandbar that had begun twisting two miles offshore . The four men waved her back with a canvas top from the sand-stalled jeep . They shouted desperately and ridiculously and still the white yacht steered true toward the treacherous sandbar . In Little Mitty Mitchell they heard the shouting and the younger men came running . The older people and the children hurried down after them with lanterns and torches and with the long rope and rusty first-aid tin . The young men waved the lanterns and ran up and down the twilit beach near the black ocean . The vessel moved slowly on a straight course . The old people huddled together on the soft sand , talking low , looking not at each other but at the imperiled craft . Gradually and then suddenly they ceased their murmuring and were silent . The white yacht was no longer moving . The young men stopped their running , stopped their signaling . An old sailor ran down to the water-edge and tried to shout in a rasping voice above the hollow roar of the surf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing and the tall sandgrass was dancing brightly on the dunes behind the still natives . Family at a time left to eat and returned to wait . They brought back coffee which they kept boiling in a bucket half buried in the ashes . They lay in the sand drinking coffee and later cold ale and recalling the hundred and more boats that had sunk during storms and wars at Star Point . They sat up wondering again why the yacht had not yet sent out a boat . Same of the younger men argued that they should go out to her , but the older men who had been sailors and coast guardsmen pointed out wisely that that would be work and that she was obviously not disabled . Wait , they said , if the skipper wants help he 'll send for it . Wait . It would indeed he work : they waited . Claude , the strong and foolish golden retriever , bounded up the beach and barked at the darkness . Rushed back by a stampede of following phantoms he circled the fire once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The night was powdery with starlight ; the flames were thinning blue over the bright coals ; and far out on the ocean the sole light stared coldly at the shore.44 BELIEVE the damn fool 's dying . " The voice sounded deep and resonant on the night air . The fire-flickering faces turned up the beach toward the night voice , frowning to hear more . The silly dog yawned and shut his eyes . Keppin Devron whispered what he had heard : " I believe the damn fool 's dying . " The others nodded yes indeed . First his white cap , then his white trousers appeared , then his face and the gold buttons on his dark jacket . He strode briskly to the beach fire in long elegant strides . " Has anyone a cigarette ? " it was more a command than a request . He glanced quickly down at the curious faces and dismissed them immediately . With a thin , engraved lighter he lit the cigarette that a skull-faced man handed him , drew once deeply , blew smoke over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn fool 's dying " The faces questioned . " The ship 's cook . Up the beach . " He jerked his head backward . " Is there a doctor on this place ? " Keppin Devron began explaining that during the last year of the war a naval doctor who had lost a leg in an explosion had arrived and was now living . . . . " Better take him to the doctor . He 's down the beach . About a half-mile . " Without a word the four MacMillan brothers , already in their jeep , raced on the hard sand up the beach . The captain shifted the large flat case under his arm . " I want to be taken to the nearest coast guard station . I 'm on a sandbar . " Keppin Devron offered to drive him the four miles up the inside-rut . Together they walked toward the tar-painted A-model . Underfoot the soft sand whispered . At the coast guard station , a ridiculous old Victorian house on a lonely stretch of sand , the captain strode without knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like for you to send for the cutter . " The old coast guard lieutenant stood and questioned with his squinted eyes . " I need the cutter immediately . " " The cutter is at Charleston . What do you want it for ? " " I 'm on your goddamn sandbar . " " I have no sandbar . " The lieutenant spoke firmly . Keppin Devron intervened with his good-natured voice and laughing eyes : " The one you 're plotting on the new chart . Out from Little Mitty . Up from Star Point . " The lieutenant asked when and where and why and how ; and why the coast guard had not been notified immediately . The captain presented his card and pronounced the name : " Shaffer Daniel Cadenhead . " He did not seem willing to say more to the men who were gathering close around . A hullabaloo cleared the smoke . Cadenhead listened carefully to each man and waited until all curiosity was uttered before letting a muscle relax in his hard face . He considered well before answering in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . Yes , he owned the yacht outright . Had bought it three months ago with money left by his first wife . At that time the craft was insured for $100,000 . Now there was no insurance covering her . He had refused to sell her for $123,500 before leaving Boston . She had a seventy-ton keel . The charter was for Bermuda . Early that day the cook had doubled over in cramps . Appendicitis undoubtedly . Probably ruptured by now . Naturally he had to be put ashore . Before dark they had sighted the lighthouse . A few minutes later when the light came on they seemed to be off course . Cadenhead himself had taken the wheel for correction . The ship had struck the sandbar and stuck fast . He would attempt nothing more until the cutter arrived . Now he was hungry . A befreckled lad disappeared and returned with a hot plate of fried fish , cheese , big biscuits , and bitter black coffee steaming in a huge cup . Cadenhead opened the case which he had been holding under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before choosing a knife , fork , and spoon  --  unaware of the men who stood watching in an amused yet respectful awe . T T DAWN , at the very instant the sun burst from the sea , Cadenhead was walking to the top of the tall sandfence to stare out toward Star Point where the white yacht lay motionless on the brilliant water . The old beach fire and ale cans had been night-buried by the high tide and now dry sand was washing over them . Delicately , stealthily , the sand traced the creases of his white shoes , then lavished them completely . MAGAZINE It was a solemn yet festive morning . By noon most of the natives of Little Mitty had come down and now men were coming from Mitty Mitchell , Cornwallis , and even front as far as Hesperes . Some had come to see the yacht , and others had come apurpose to see the captain who ate with his own silverware . Cadenhead stood on the sand dune above the beach and refused with curt but civil answers to he engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and A-model Fords with slick balloon tires were standing on the beach , their motors pointing upwind away from the blowing sand . The fish were biting and the natives were already forgetting the plight of the yacht . Cadenhead alone was not fishing . Standing on a high dune and momentarily turning his eyes from the yacht , he caught sight of the Negro walking slowly up the beach . " Why in hell are n't you dead ? " " I did n't have appendicitis , " the Negro called . " Stomach-ache was all . " Cadenhead poised until the Negro was close below him . Then he sprang and knocked him to the ground , falling with him , hitting him in the face with his fist , and rolling with him to the bottom of the dune . " You sonovabitch . I 'll kill you . " They rolled in the sand . Cadenhead swung a hard fist and cracked the Negro 's eye socket . The Negro 's huge hand closed on his throat . Cadenhead kicked free , leaped to his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up gripping desperately . " I 'll kill you , " Cadenhead gasped . The Negro tore clean , ran up the beach , disappeared over a sand dune . Cadenhead sank to his knees ; his coat sleeve , torn at the shoulder seam , hung down over the knuckles of his elegant bony hands . Blood dripped steadily from his nostrils and stained the white sand and one knee . He ignored the natives who offered him medicine or bandages , and brandy . When finally he raised his head , he stared only at the white yacht . T HE following day the cutter arrived ? and left . Cadenhead had coldly de- manded ridiculous help . He expected the cutter to approach his ship through the treacherous sandbars , which they could not hope to do successfully . They would throw out long lines and try tugging her free . But " Wait , " they said , " if the skipper wants help he 'll send for it . " Cadenhead knew a craft could he wrenched apart by long lines . The coast guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast guard responsible for all damages done to the vessel during the attempted rescue work . Cadenhead , now in a cold temper , revealed his first plan : he would open a suit against the coast guard for giving inadequate information about the coast and the separation of the light from the lighthouse . The officers informed him about the sources of quite adequate information . " We 'll let the courts decide , " Cadenhead announced . The officers said in such a case they could not touch the yacht . " Then get outs " Cadenhead ordered . The yacht 's crew , listening to the quarrel , demanded release and pay ; Cadenhead said they could not quit , said wait , wait until he could phone a salvaging company in Wilmington . Wait . The crew waited . Cadenhead phoned . The small company had one job on hand but ten days later the salvaging tugs and barges appeared . A week passed before Cadenhead came ashore again . He had not shaved and his white shoes and trousers were oil-stained . Looking directly at nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten pounds of corn meal , ten pounds of white beans , eight pounds of streaked bacon , and a dozen bottles of ketchup . Then , although he had not been asked , he turned and faced the natives , who were sitting on wall-benches near the soda fountain , and explained : " The sand is silting around the keel faster than they can move it . " He had signed a contract for $10,000 with the company but he did not have much faith in them . The owners , two ex-GIs , were sinking tanks , securing them to the ship , emptying them of water and pumping them full of air . But the tanks barely budged the yacht , barely made it tremble . Of course , Cadenhead smiled , if they did not free the ship the contract would be broken , whether they knew it or not , without a penny paid . As he spoke his eyes sighted every person in the store before stopping hypnotically on Keppin Devron and Rona Bruton who sat close together , their hands touching . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , spoke : " You 're wasting your time and their money . " Cadenhead blazed : " How do you know ? " " We 've had a storm and three high seas since she 's been out there . I know what a storm does to that ocean floor . If the ocean ca n't float her , you ca n't . Each of those seas has buried that hull even more . " Cadenhead smiled . " You may be right . " He gazed deliberately at Rona , who clung quickly to Keppin Devron . He picked up his bundles and left , still smiling . N ow October can be a bitter month on the banks . Obsessed hurricane winds whirl near and lush the ocean over the banks into the sound and then draw it back again , cutting gullies and channels across the island roads while the natives locked inside their houses battle the salt-sprayed wind which threatens them at every sash . The coast guard began to warn of an approaching twister . Maddened by the imminent danger to their equipment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll save her . We 've got to save her . During the high seas we 'll free her . There 'll be a bonus . Hear me . A bonus . " The GIs , as though paralyzed at sight of this desperate man , and perhaps wanting to believe that the rough sea might be a boon , waited . The hurricane whipped in , blinding , unleashing a fury that ripped across the yacht taking wood and brass superstructure with it . The barge with all the salvaging equipment and then the tug broke loose and within sight of the yacht were dashed under the waves . After the storm Cadenhead walked the yacht 's deck writing in a ledger the considerable damage done ; deaf to the GIs who had lost all of their equipment ; blind apparently at the moment they put ashore penniless . In the confused and gray-scudded dawn of the following day his own crew put down their boat , rowed steadily toward the shore , and there at the grocery store bargained for passage up the beach on the icetruck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that on a clear sea he was a good captain . So saying , lean and ashgray from their long and steady diet of white navy beans , and still wet and cold from the recent high seas , they climbed into the old icetruck , and without looking out either at the sea and their abandoned white yacht or back at the store where the natives were wishing them well , they rolled up the beach , never to be seen again . Alone on the yacht , Cadenhead was walking the deck , writing in his log , crawling on his hands and knees , hammering , lashing canvas over the gaping holes , and , like an old crab , dragging material down into the hold . After securing the yacht as best he could , he too put to shore where he asked briefly about the welfare and departure of his crew before inquiring about a temporary lodging for himself . Thus it was that Cadenhead , late that October , began his daily and unfailing lookout . Each morning he would leave his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a small driftwood fire he would scramble an egg or cook two slices of bacon . During the morning he would sit sheltered in a tent-half from the biting winds and gaze steadily through the haze or rain at the forlorn yacht . In the afternoons , stirring himself and - 41104. ... 1041P. .. on a fiat and bone-strewed gully where once the sea had cut through . . 77 ranging the length of the beach for planks and boxes washed up from the wreckage of the war-sunk cargo ships and tankers , he would work until dark on the one-room shack that was taking shape between two magnificent dunes , on a flat and bone-strewed gully where once the tornado-driven sea had cut through . Each evening he cooked before his cabin and ate standing , staring out at his distant possession , unheedful of the taunts which were directed at him by the laughing singing fishermen going out or coming in . Wiping the grease from his young wild beard he would stare after them and spit into their fresh tracks . Occasionally Keppin Devron and Rona came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would join them . Together the three would cast and reel , silently , commenting only when a catch was landed , . or more rarely when one escaped . 0 NE night in late winter Keppin Devron , having heard the fresh racking cough that shook Cadenhead 's very bones as they fished , brought down a Thermos bottle of steaming rum to the Iantern-lit shack . Cadenhead was sitting up on the cot , shrouded in blankets , when Devron , bidden , entered . They poured their drinks and sat opposite each other in the silence which they both were accustomed to . Whether out of a gratitude for the hot grog which burned through his body , warming for the first time that winter his feet and hands , or whether from a degree of loneliness unusual even in a man as solitary as himself , Cadenhead spoke direct with none of the island gift for small talk , insinuation , and weighty casualness of purpose . " You feel responsible for me ? " " No . " Keppin answered , not casually , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with this stranger who had come ashore so long ago at night . " Not responsible . Interested . Curious you might say . Maybe kinship . " " Kinship hell . I have no kin . Father and a brother but no real kin . " He drank from the Thermos cup . " No offense . " " Nope . " " What is it you 're curious about ? Speak up . I may not talk again . " " Nothing specific . " Keppin Devron spoke gravely with a reserve and dignity that would not let him question . " Good . There 's nothing to me . Out yonder is me . That yacht . It 's everything I 've ever dreamed of , worked , stole , lied , cheated , and married for . There 's nothing else . " He hugged two blankets about his neck , clutching them desperately with grime-nailed fingers to his chest . His red-webbed eyes were deep in the lamp-shadowed sockets , and his voice was thin when he spoke , softly , as though Keppin Devron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a dream . And you know it 's a good dream . I worked a long time . Thirty-seven jobs from the day I quit high school till I shipped out at eighteen on an old merchant ship . What a joke that was . Young , full of ambition of a sea career , full of ideals about what a ship should be . Oh I 'd read too much . A ship was a universe . It was the perfect escape , the perfect , clean , and manmade world of law and order . And then I saw that first captain , what a sonovabitch he was , and that stinking tub and the filthy , brutal , lying , cheating passel of self-made bastards aboard her . And not just that ship . One was n't enough to kill such a world as I had in mind ; yeah , I was gut-strong in those days . It took a hundred . Yet each time I boarded a new ship , I 'd stand in the bow and look at her and see her in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , happy , proper , and proud with a fine crew that popped-to and a captain who knew the proper respect for his men and I 'd swear to myself to have such a ship . But each voyage was the same . When you see in your mind 's eye a ship the way I did , you are n't likely to find her in any ordinary harbor . So I quit the sea till I could buy my own craft . That yacht out there and that with the crew gone . Not one of them realized a boat can be a universe and you can make it what you will . " His cough racked through him and seemed so certainly to be tearing him bodily apart that for a moment Devron leaned forward to catch the blankets which were , in the frenzy , being scattered about . Cadenhead squeezed his thick rummy eyes and wiped the cough tears from his gray face and glistening beard . " You 'd better go , " he said . " Thanks for the drink . " The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thing , " Cadenhead said while Devron paused in the open door . " Do n't repeat what I 've said . I may be drunk or delirious . At any rate it 's nobody 's business . Hear me , old man ? " Devron offered his hand in silent promise before going out onto the night beach where the late winter wind was making snow flurries of the sand . vj ACH day , shaking and bending double , lassoed by great strangling coughs . Ca-denhead , bearded , dirty , and smelling , with his coat sleeve pinned at the shoulder , moved slowly up the gully of whistling cold air to the hard-surface road and to the Post Office where he anxiously demanded a letter . He never seemed to believe Miss Hannah when she said : " Still nothing . " Often he stood on the steps before the open mail window and cussed a round of names . One day in early March , just as he had left the hard-surface , a yellow convertible roared honking down the road . He spun quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racking cold had settled in his foot , he chased the car to where it was now stopping across from the Post Office . The driver , a Cornwallis fisherman , was already out holding open the door when Cadenhead , forehead blue-white and popping sweat beads arrived . A tremendous frowzy and rumpled blonde climbed out dragging and tugging at her thick bright purple coat . She gave a regal flounce to the white fox collar that settled about her shoulders and across her heavy bosom . She inspected the heels of one purple pump and the grease on her bare plump ankle before looking up at Cadenhead who was regarding her in half-amused wonder . " Cadenhead ! " she screamed in actual astonishment when , after studying this bearded man , she recognized him . " Cadenhead . " She seemed inclined to throw herself into his arms , then paused and offered her hand of clinking rings . The disguise , she chattered hysterically , was perfect and were the whiskers real and where had he ever found those vastly amusing clothes and why was he hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , maybe from the police , and naturally she had not written but had simply left Mi ami which was really dreadfully dull when she received his forwarded letter but she could n't believe the boat would still be afloat . How perfectly droll and could they leave absolutely at once for Barbados . On she talked ignoring the staring natives and the restlessness of Cadenhead 's eyes . Finally she screeched again with laughter , screamed darling , and kissed him above his eyes , leaving large orange lips gaping lasciviously from his forehead . Cadenhead leaned forward ; and while pretending to study the back seat , where a fur coat was trapped in the skelter of air luggage , wiped the lips from his forehead , and then sat down behind the steering wheel . " Get in , " he commanded . The blonde was on the island three days , during which time the islanders were full of talk about the hard drinking , shouting , and general brawling heard day and night near the shack . By God she had no money and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to please herself or Cadenhead . No ! She would not sell the car and the coat ! On the fourth morning they drove up at the grocery store just as Keppin Devron and Rona were passing toward the beach . " There she is ! " the blonde woman screamed . " I 've seen you at the shack watching every move Cadenhead makes . Take him . You can have him . If you can get him away from that boat . I ca n't . Here . Here he is ! Take him ! He .... " But at that second Cadenhead slapped her soft face . The blonde bent over the front fender and laughed and cried with astonishing abandon . " Who wants a ride up to the ferry ? " Cadenhead asked the four men sitting on the bench . At last one shyly volunteered . " Get in , " Cadenhead ordered the big blonde . She crawled in behind the wheel and the fisherman crept in and made himself small beside her . The yellow car backed up , swerved through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood entranced but Rona was running off in the opposite direction , away from the beach , away from Devron , and away from Cadenhead . She was holding her forehead and was crying . Cadenhead strode to the Post Office , where he - knocked sharply on the unopened window and demanded again the letter which still had not arrived . LL LL the islanders whispered that Cadenhead was broke ; and with the begin- ning of warm weather he often ranged the hard-surface , and never refused either work or an invitation to eat . When he was not scavenging for work , or fishing with new intent , he would row out to the crippled ship and stay all day , explaining upon return his plans for floating her on one of the first spring full tides . The natives usually waited until he was out of sight before scoffing at a man so deluded and willfully mad that he could look at a wreck and expect it to float , could not tell when a ship was lost , aye , was breaking to pieces in his very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had demanded morning after morning , arrived . He read it to himself while walking the windy gully toward the shack . A restlessness seemingly caught from the brisk and variable spring wind seized him and carried him rapidly through the grass dunes toward the pine woods through the cedar stumps and marshes . It was a crazy dance he was held in , like the hunger-tethered flight of a sea gull over a shrimp boat . He ranged the beach until off in the distance he saw Keppin Devron hunched over , working . When Keppin , glancing up at the wind-cleared sky , saw him , Cadenhead slowed his pace and approached in his usual long dignified strides . " I have n't seen you , " Cadenhead paused , out of breath , and thought , " since my wife left . " He thought again . " No . Not since then . " Keppin returned his attention to the snarled reel . " I 've been going out with the fleet . " The two men remained silent until finally Keppin spoke again : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . She was . My second . She 's gone to get a divorce now . " Again , as though he had not said it before , he said : " I have n't seen you about , or Rona . " Keppin glanced quickly up when Rona was mentioned . Yellow wrinkles cut furrows in his new-brown forehead as he probed the snarled line . " I reckon not . " Cadenhead studied him awhile longer . Then turning his back to the whipping wind he spoke quickly . " Got this today . " He unfolded the crumpled letter from his grease-stained jacket . " The letter I was waiting for . From my father . " " Yes , " Keppin said in a tone that did not admit either curiosity or ignorance . " Read it . See what you think . " Devron regarded the letter with an obvious respect for its privacy . But then squinting with his humorous blue eyes , he regarded Cadenhead and , not wishing to offend , balanced his words carefully . " I 'm busy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper in the whipping wind and read in a voice which became even deeper and more majestic , apparently in mockery of a voice even more bass than his own : Dear Shaffer : Whether your monotonous and absurd demands for money are purely for the purpose of outraging and mocking me further , or whether , as you claim , you are in dire threat of losing your boat , I have no way of knowing , and fortunately , as one of the bounties of old age , little energy to care . I know only that I have watched mutely while you exploited and if possible crippled every person who stood between you and the gangplank of that white yacht which would be most certainly , you prophesied , the " perfect craft . " Even this late I find that you are still using criminal methods in your attempts to be a captain . Your last threatening letter had the effect of making me tired , but certainly not afraid ; and I have turned it over to my lawyers for whatever legal amusement it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be permitted any substantial part of the estate after my eagerly awaited death . I had naturally hoped that you would someday realize that the quest is the important part of the grail , but until you do I can not refrain from praying that your justly damned boat will sink . Cadenhead laughed in short explosives . " That was my fifth ace . Not even money enough to sue the coast guard now that I can estimate the full damage . " " What about the ten thousand you had when you signed the contract with that GI outfit ? " " I never had ten thousand . All paper manipulation . " Caden head laughed and started off again in the driven dance . He called back : " Drop by the but tonight for a drink . " He observed the wonder on Keppin Devron 's face . " The last I had on the boat bar , I 've been saving it for this answer . " He hit his chest pocket which held the crumpled letter and was off again in the crazy dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spring moonlight blanched the whalebones and giant shells and ran like a fire-river through the gully cut by the wind . Alone on his sand dune Cadenhead gazed out at the stricken yacht and bummed quietly to himself . He did not seem to know at what moment Keppin first stood behind him in the silent sand . " The tide runs high , " Cadenhead said easily . " It does . " Keppin agreed . " Yet the wind has died . " He stretched out on the sand near Cadenhead and looked at the ragged shadow of the yacht . His hands worked nervously through the loose sand and around the grass roots , probing , searching ; at the same time his lips were finding and abandoning unspoken words . Cadenhead was secretly watching this agitation , but continued casually with a square of metal writing his name in the sand , pressing it out , and writing and embellishing it anew , each time more elaborately . Startled , Keppin discovered the narrow eyes watching him . His glance darted sea-ward , moonward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , up the rag sleeve to the bearded face and hawk eyes that were watching him relentlessly . He looked away . Finally his eyes seized upon the metal in Cadenhead 's hand . His voice was slowness and his words pulse-like . " Do you know direction Keppin had pointed . " Where ? I 've never seen a wreckage near . " " Hereabouts . Maybe the sand 's covered it completely now . " Devron 's voice was relaxing slowly . " Part of the prow used to stick straight skyward when I was a boy . We used to play ' pirate ' there . " " Real Spanish coins ? " " Not many . Not gold . One or two . But thousands of bits of iron : hinges and the like . " " Maybe it was a treasure ship . " " No , not likely . The gold ships seldom ventured this far north . And Kidd and the pirates were down between here and Sea Island . There 's treasure on down . Here though . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They walked through the tall grass , kicking the sand  --  until , stopping , Devron waved his arm overhead in a childish flourish . " Here . " He pointed to a double row of iron spikes which outlined a boat prow against a low sandhill . " The sea was there . " He pointed to the steep dunes which hid the ocean and the new beach . " The beach is building up here . Fast too . I 'll probably live to see it reach Star Point . " " A ship . Here . " Cadenhead mumbled , unaware of being heard . " Buried . " He stumbled drunkenly back to his dune where the bottle of rye was stuck like a jib-boom in the sand . He drank and coughed and wiped his matted beard with the sleeve of his filthy jacket . He offered the remaining few drops to Devron who refused . " I thought you came out for a drink . " Cadenhead 's eyes burned with reflected moonlight . Devron slapped his fist with the open palm of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Letting himself down gently onto the soft sand dune Cadenhead asked : " About what ? " Devron crouched on his knees and again nervously-sifted sand through his frightened fingers . " Rona . " " Ah . " Cadenhead grinned , knowingly , wickedly . " And what your wife said at the store . " Cadenhead 's grin widened from wickedness to lewd delight . " Oh . " " What . did she Mean ? " The slow casualness was gone from Devron 's voice . " I do n't remember what she said . " Cadenhead shrugged his shoulders in a gesture of ignorance . Devron crouched , tense , his words rapid and impersonal . " About you and Rona . " " That ? " Cadenhead laughed . " I do n't know . " Devron stood up and glared down at the man . " You do . " Cadenhead arched an eyebrow , dead quiet , then observing better Devron 's scowl answered : " I had n't thought of it . Why did she say that about Rona ? Maybe because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine a woman feeling any other way . " Devron 's fists unclinched . Cadenhead rose uneasily to his feet and weaved as he walked toward the sea . " Or maybe she discovered the truth . " " You mean you think Rona 's in love with you . " " Damned if I know . What does she say ? " " She does n't say anything . She wo n't talk about you or about that day or about that woman . Fact is : she does n't seem to want to talk to me about anything any more . " Like a Fringe of grass fire the white waves were eating at the beach . The two men trod the hard-packed sand , gazing oceanward at the jagged shadow of the yacht through the thickening air . " Even her folks say she 's strange now and odd-like . And naturally everybody talks about what was said and how we are n't seen much together anymore . " " They do ? " Cadenhead was smiling with immense pleasure . " Mr. Bruton wants her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Brothers ? I thought she was the only child . " " There 's Rona and then there are the twins : Cawdor and Thane . " Cadenhead snapped his fin gers and whirled rapidly . " They 're the boys with the fleet of tugs and river barges ! " He slapped his hand against his flanks like a young crowing gamecock . " I 'll be damned . I knew that . Why did n't I remember ? I heard about them before I got that company from Norfolk . And then I forgot . They were too far away . I 'll he damned . They 're her brothers : " He giggled aloud to himself . " How old is Rona ? " If he had been more sober and less full of this intense jubilance , he might have seen all the humor and gentleness and every trace of friendship leave Keppin Devron 's face . Instead he was squinting his eyes to cut through the moonlit fog which was covering the white yacht . " How old ? " he repeated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . " Eighteen . " Cadenhead 's laugh muffled the whisper of Devron 's steps as he disappeared down the tornado gully . Flowing over the beach and through the gully the warm fog lake spilled over the rusty red roof of the shack and over the swaying grass on the dunes . Cadenhead cackled and kicked sandspray and danced a drunken hornpipe . He grasped the soft fog by the hips and followed up the gully in a wild conga , out of the seafog , onto the road , and down to the store where in the light of the gas pumps two men were playing checkers on the carved squares of the bench between them . " Oh where and oh where does my bonnie lassie live ? " He sang in a deep merry voice and shuffle-danced , grinning at the two men . " Where 's Rona live ? " " On down near Baxter . The big yellow house . " " Oho ! " Cadenhead saluted a toy-soldier salute , bowed , and was off down the road singing : " Come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn back to see Keppin Devron come out from the store and pump three gallons of gasoline into a jerry-can which he carried into the fog toward the yacht . T ; NG after midnight a jeepload of young- sters swerved to a stop on the hard- surface four miles beyond Baxter . Cadenhead was sitting in the middle of the road . He accepted without thanks the ride offered him on the hot hood of the Birddog . He was mumbling to himself : " She would n't even talk to me . Would n't even open the door . ' Go away , ' they said . Like a drunk tramp . Me . " Back at the store , now dark , the Birddog bounced off the highway and plowed through the sand ruts down toward the shack . Gaining the hard beach sand it raced along the water-edge and was turning sharply around when Cadenhead stood up and was thrown over the hood and onto the hard-packed sand . He jumped to his feet and ran limping to the land 's edge . Out off Star Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hurry . Get help ! " he yelled to the kids as he ran limping to his boat . " Hurry . " He pushed off into the cove . " Dammit . Hurry , " he screamed as the Birddog plowed past . All night the ship burned . The coast guard worked dangerously close to save her , then fell back exhausted . The fishermen on their way out and the night fleet on its way in detoured to watch as the yacht , listing more precariously , waved fire-flags at the distant shore which in the early dawn was crawling with people . Cadenhead , driven back by the coast guard . circled madly in his boat shouting for help above the crackle and hiss of thefork-tongued flames . Once he eluded the guard and rowed straight in but was pushed back by the white heat . Finally when he could row and shout no more , he sat openmouthed and stupid with exhaustion . The coast-guard men again threw him a line which this time he accepted . With swollen fingers Cadenhead , entranced , secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorged on the ship . As the coast guard boat towed him slowly away , the white yacht wallowed over , hissed live steam , blew white smoke , and dived under the burning oil-slick . Cadenhead walked through the natives who gathered round and followed in his wake , like waves from the bow . Shoulders sagging , he limped to the cabin and in the half-dark stared with smoke-reddened eyes about him . He kicked over the canvas cot and opened a secret door in the baseboard . From there he pulled out the leather case with the ship 's silver . He unfastened it , dreamily touched the purple velvet and the silver , then shut the lid . Glaring about him , he painfully reached to a rafter for an immaculate white- and gold-braided captain 's cap . Pulling it low over his smoke-blackened , blistered , and greasy face , he stumbled out of the shack . He was coughing and wheezing with desperation as he shuffled up the gully , ignoring the sympathies of the natives who were all saying : " It happened so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheezing painfully , and staring dumbly . " Cigarette ? " he finally managed to beg in a hoarse whisper . He lit one , took a long draw , exhaled , and gasping again for air , he dropped the cigarette and pocketed the pack . When the ferry-bound icetruck pulled off the highway , Cadenhead climbed in . Mrs. Maddy handed the driver a dollar and another to Cadenhead who , without looking down at the natives or into the store where Rona was numbly sitting or at the side of the store where Keppin Devron stood with bandaged hands and blistered wrists , signaled the iceman to drive on . The old icetruck rumbled up to the end of the highway and out between the sand dunes and on up the beach through the screeching laughter of the seagulls and the maniacal applause of the surf .
