txt Before anyone calls anyone else a liar , it should be explained that any version of the weather in Chicago yesterday ought to be ac1 cepted without question . It seems it was either the sort of day that turns a young man 's fancy , or a cold , damp , foggy stinker that should n't happen in California , much less Chicago . It all depended on where one happened to be . Along the lake front , for instance , it was 43 degrees at 6:30 p. m. , and a chill , wet fog grounded planes at Meigs field . But at the same hour it was 76 degrees at Midway airport-33 degrees difference  --  and west ciders were agreeing it was an enchanted evening . Shivers on Warmest Day ! Ivan W. Brunk , a federal forecaster , was called upon to explain these trying phenomena . He pointed out that , officially , yesterday was the warmest day of the year because the mercury climbed to 79 degrees at 4:10 p. in. at Midway airport . But he cautiously stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the statement . And he admitted that he was going to have to shiver his way home without a topcoat . Here 's Brunk 's explanation : The lake water is still a cold 43 degrees . And there 's enough water in the big pond to chill any air that is rash enough to venture across it to Chicago . A lot of warm air from the south started for Chicago , but the part that came across the lake got a quick cooling . So it was chilly in the loop and lake shore areas , even the other warm air was nudging folks a little farther west to roll up their sleeves and mow their lawns . Weather All Mixed rp The fog happened , of course , when the chill air met the warm air . And the whole picture was complicated by winds that blew the warm air toward Wisconsin in the afternoon and blew it back in the evening . The upshot of the mixing was that the humidity went up to 100 per cent in the foggy areas , and the fog started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the last time he 'd leave his home at 5721 S. Spaulding ay . without a coat just because it was warm there . He added that the disturbance was local and that today probably will be a nice , warn spring day . He should live to long .
