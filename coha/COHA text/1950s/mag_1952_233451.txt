An unarmed Catalina flying boat emblazoned with the three gold crowns of the Swedish royal air force lumbered above the Baltic early one morning this week in search of a sister plane that had been missing for four days . Cruising east , some 60 miles off the coast of Estonia and no miles from the Swedish coast , the defenseless Catalina was ambushed. * Two Russian MIG-15 jets bansheed down and made seven passes at the Catalina , one of them blasting away with its 20-mm. cannon . Hit several times , the Swedish plane got off a message to its home base : it had been crippled but would try for home . <P> The Catalina did not make it . About 90 miles from home , it made a forced landing at sea , and cracked up . For tantalizing hours , Sweden heard no more . Then came another report-a German merchant ship had rescued the Catalina 's seven crewmen , two of them wounded . <P> Two Protests . The news explained beyond much doubt what had happened to the first missing plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom " for Swedish air force radio operators , and to its complement of eight . The Baltic from Finland to Danzig was aswim with Soviet warships and submarines , the sky was thick with Russian jets ; all were engaged in sea and air maneuvers . <P> A wave of cold anger swept across doggedly neutral Sweden , which stayed out of World Wars I and II and now refuses to join Norway and Denmark in NATO . The anger was aggravated by an event in Stockholm : the opening of a treason trial against seven Swedes who are accused of selling out the secrets of Sweden 's entire northern defense system to Soviet espionage agents . On the streets and in the coffeehouses , Swedes muttered their indignation . Prime Minister Tage Erlander summoned Soviet Ambassador Konstantin Rodionov . As he left his own embassy , a crowd of Swedes jeered at the ambassador and spat into the embassy compound . When he walked out of the Foreign Office , he carried away with him two irate Swedish protests . <P> Answers , Please . One protested Soviet espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop spying . The second demanded retribution for the " act of violence perpetrated by Soviet military aircraft " and steps " to punish those responsible for the outrage . " <P> <P> * In just about the same area two years ago , Russian fighters shot down a U.S. Navy Privateer , with a crew of ten . The men were never found . The Russians admitted that they had attacked the plane , rejected U.S. protests , and decorated the Soviet airmen who performed the deed .
