Patients for Sale By STEVEN M. SPENCER The spreading stain of fee splitting has honest doctors worried . For those secret deals between surgeon and family physician have resulted in unnecessary operations , " ghost surgery , ' and  --  sometimes  --  exorbitant fees . Who is to blame for this blot on medical ethics ? How ran you protect yourself against it ? A Post editor reports on a menace that affects us all . MERICAN medicine , accustomed to well-deserved plaudits for its accomplishments. finds itself today in an embarrassing posi-tion . As an observant doctor in Western ennsylvania wryly sized it up . " We have gilding on the dome and termites in the basement . " For at the very moment when the profession has reached a shining pinnacle of scientific competence , having pushed hack disease and disability on most fronts and raised the average life expectancy of the people to a record high , it is under serious attack for the moral derelictions of some of its busiest members . The attack , which springs not from " outsiders " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is aimed at those doctors who buy and sell patients with the patients ' own money . The transaction is commonly known as fee splitting , although it goes by other names , too , from the blunt " kickback " to the more genteel " referral fee . " It is not only objectionable in itself but it often leads to more serious evils , among which is the performance of unnecessary operations by doctors whose judgment is blurred by the vision of a large payment . There are many and ingenious ways to divvy up the patient 's dollars . This is one example of how it is done : The family physician , called out to treat a pain in the abdomen , finds symptoms that suggest acute appendicitis . " I know the best surgeon in town , " he tells the patient as he completes the examination . " We 'll get you right into the hospital , and he 'll operate in the morning . " When the patient gets home again , or perhaps before , he receives a modest bill for five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon . He pays each the amount asked , and up to that point everything has been legitimate . But the family doctor now goes to the surgeon and collects a cut of fifty dollars or $100 as his commission for bringing the surgeon this particular piece of business . If the surgeon is trying bard to build up his practice , he may pay the referring physician as much as 60 or 70 per cent of the surgical fee . Now , the secret splitting of fees is against the level in twenty-three states , and a division made with the patient 's knowledge is still illegal in sixteen of those states . Fee splitting in any form is unethical in all states , and in Canada , also , if the American Medical Association 's code of ethics is to be taken seriously as the physician 's guide to correct conduct . Moreover , it is a violation of a specific pledge taken by all members of the American College of Surgeons , and is contrary to the staff rules of every accredited hospital in North America . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? codes of ethics , pledges and hospital rules , these unethical practices have continued to flourish in many areas of the country . The fee-splitting " termites " constitute , to be sure , only a fraction of the medical profession , and it is unlikely that they will ever be numerous enough to cave in the entire structure , which still rests firmly on the shoulders of honest and upright men . But the offenders have been increasing in recent years , and are now so concentrated in certain communities and hospitals that they are impairing the quality of surgical care offered the unsuspecting public in those places . Fur thermore , the process , unless it is checked , tends to be self-perpetuating , for where fee splitters are in control they make it difficult if not impossible for well-qualified , ethical , non-fee-splitting surgeons to establish practices . Disturbed by this sorry state of affairs , the American College of Surgeons , which has 19,000 members , recently decided to wage open warfare upon the wrongdoers and assigned its determined , plain-speaking director , Maj. Gen. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now in his sixties , is the former Army doctor who a few years ago took over the Veterans ' Administration medical department and effectively shook it out of its bureaucratic doldrums . Never a man to spare a strong phrase in a good cause , he quickly lashed out at those doctors who , as he put it , " purchase their patients with blood money . " He did n't name names , but the college 's officers quietly expelled a few members  --  all too few , in the opinion of some observers  --  for violation of their pledges . And hospitals in several cities fired staff surgeons who had been performing too many unjustified operations . Curiously , this attack upon medical misbehavior did not meet with universal applause , even though it was leveled against practices to which nearly every medical organization stood officially opposed . Loud and injured cries went up from certain general-practitioner groups , who , while protesting the innocence of the majority , bitterly criticized Doctor Hawley for calling public attention to the sins of the few . They accused him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They charged that he was dividing the ranks of medicine , to which Doctor Hawley retorted , " That only means that some groups condone evil practices while others do n't . " A group of Chicago physicians went so far as to circulate a petition  --  fortunately without succeasseeking to expel Dr. Loyal Davis , a distinguished brain surgeon , from the Chicago Medical Society because he had dared state , in a College of Surgeons press conference , that fee splitting was on the increase in Chicago . And in a rash of wordy resolutions brought before the American Medical Association 's House of Delegates last June , the opponents of the campaign sought official censure of Hawley and others for harping on fee splitting . But they weakened their own position by asking at the same time for a change in the medical rules to make some form of fee division ethical . Both requests were turned down . The American Medical Association remained firm in declaring that no form of combined billing , even with both doctors ' names on the bill , was ethically acceptable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be wellatarted . But the storm of charges , countercharges and recriminations has left large segments of the public in a state of perplexity about the issue . Are there two sides to the question ? Is fee splittingwrong , and if so , why ? How did it all start ? What keeps it going ? How much fee splitting is there and where is it worst ? What can be done and is being done to stop it ? Rebates are not a new problem . Doctors of frail moral fiber have been accepting them , on and off , for many years , and from a variety of sources , including the druggist , the optician , the X-ray specialist , the commercial clinical laboratory and even the undertaker . It is of historical interest that Dr. Everts A. Graham , a leader in the American College of Surgeons ' current drive upon fee splitting , had his first encounter with this particular dragon nearly forty years ago . And he has never since relaxed his grip on the spear . Professor emeritus of surgery at Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chest surgery and one of the world 's most eminent and respected surgeons , Doctor Graham , now seventy , accepted chairmanship of the College of Surgeons ' powerful and influential Board of Regents on one condition ? that the college conduct a vigorous campaign against unethical practices , especially the division of fees . In 1915 Doctor Graham went to a town in Northern Iowa as chief surgeon of a seventy-bed hospital and clinic , and it was here that he came face to face with the same sort of situation that confronts so PHOTOGRAPHY BY BILL SHROUT many young doctors today . For the first three months his operating schedule was a crowded one . Then , for some unexplained reason , the number of patients appearing at the clinic for surgery began to drop off . The director of the clinic came to Doctor Graham one day and remarked about this decline . " Have you been making out the checks all right ? " the director asked . " I 've been paying my bills , " Doctor Graham replied , " if that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , " that 's not what . I mean . I 'm talking about , t he fifty-per-cent checks to the referring physicians . " " You mean splitting fees ? " the young surgeon asked . " No , I certainly have not ! " The clinic director shrugged his shoulders . " Well , " he said , " that 's the way we do business here , you know . " Doctor Graham declared angrily that he had n't known , otherwise he would never have joined the group , and if t he clinic had to purchase its patients from the country doctors at so much a head he was handing in his resignation immediately . " The chief of the clinic told inc to calm down and not to rush off , " Doctor Graham related . " He and his partners held a meeting that lasted until one-thirty A.M. : after which they told me they would try it awhile longer my way , without fee splitting . " ( Continued on Page 50 ) THE sxruilto , ty ENTNING POST ' armory 16,1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won out , that thine . The young surgeon stayed at . the clinic , and he Also fought fee splitting in the community at large . He made speeches before women 's and businessmen 's clubs . He wrote editorials and obtained the cooperation of the local newspapers . The methods of some of the early fee splitters were pretty crude . One bitterly cold January afternoon a doctor came into Doctor Graham 's clinic office , introduced himself and said he had a young woman with acute appendicitis hat he 'd like to have operated upon . " Where is she ? " the surgeon asked him . " Oh , I left her at the Great Western station platform , with her parents , " the doctor replied . " My heavens , man , " Doctor Graham exclaimed , " do you mean to say you 'd leave a girl over there on that exposed platform in this zero weather while you came here to talk to me about an operation ? " " Well , she 's wrapped up , " the doctor said , - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what kind of a deal you 'd make . I usually receive fifty per cent of the surgical fee . " That was enough for Doctor Graham . " You ought to he in jail ! " he harked . " Now get out of here ! " The doctor left , but only to look up another surgeon in town , who obligingly took the case on the requested terms . As a result of his stand against fee splitting , Doctor Graham and his associates lost certain " feeders " who had been referring patients for a split . " But we gained the confidence of many other physicians , " he said , " wonderful country doctors such as you read about in the storybooks . They would come to me and say they were opposed to fee splitting and for that reason had never sent cases to our clinic before . In any event , our surgery was soon booming. - The practice of dividing medical fees got . its start around the turn of the century . Before that it would have been difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its early days surgery was such a hazardous and terrifying procedure that the patient could not be prevailed upon to submit to an operation , nor would a doctor attempt one , unless the situation was really critical . The phrase " going under the knife , " heard often in our grandparents ' time , reflected the prevalent attitude of fear . But as better anesthesia and antisepsis made surgery safer , its " sales appeal " increased tremendously . People learned they could go to a hospital , have an operation , enjoy a lazy convalescence and come home again none the worse for the experience , and usually the better for it . At the same time the surgeon , impressively masked and gowned , and performing miracles with his gleaming instruments , was placed on a financial pedestal which the less spectacular family doctor and his little black hag did notshare . A patient would willingly shell out $200 or $300 for an abdominal operation because he could see something big and important had been done for him , but he would balk at paying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diagnosis and deciding that the operation was required . Here you had I he soil and the seed , the opportunity and the pressure , which gave rise to fee splitting . It was simply that , people would pay well for surgery , but were inclined to tow-rate the services of the general practitioner . The latter felt . he was being unfairly dealt with , and rather than argue his economic case with the patient , be sometimes took the easier course and sought , a rebate from the surgeon . One can argue I hat this only evened up an inequitable distribution of the medical dollars and that the surgeon 's fees were often too high anyway . It should be said on behalf of the surgeon and his charges , however , that if he was a fully qualified man , he had spent four or five more years in training than his general-practitioner colleagues had . The general practitioner , too , of course , often deserved a better financial break . But the first . wrong of underpayment could not . be ethically righted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be argued that . the secret division of a fee is not in itself harmful , if you as a patient do n't mind not knowing who gets how much of your medical dollar . The College of Surgeons takes the position , however , that " the essential of ethical financial relations in the medical profession is simple honesty , which requires the patient to he informed of the amount which is due to each physician for services rendered . " The college maintains that " the secret division of a fee between two physicians ... is dishonest , against the public interest , and has long been considered unethical by responsible doctors of medicine . " Some surgical fees are doubtless padded before they are divided , the patient being charged more because his fee is to go to two people . Doctor Hawley does not believe , however , that this is usually t he case . Rather I han hike his charge , the fee-splitting surgeon usually evens things up through increased volume of business . Whether fee splitting is a financial imposition on the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a serious and dangerous physical one . For it often leads to unnecessary surgery , with the accompanying unnecessary risk , and to the family doctor 's choice of a surgeon on t he basis of the latter 's commission arrangements rather than his competence . One reason these activities can go undetected by the public is that the layman is seldom capable of evaluating the surgery performed upon his own body . The point is illustrated by the innocent remark of a woman in a Midwestern state . " The doctor did beautiful operation , " she told a friend , " and he took good care of all the complications . " What she did not know was that the operation was unnecessary in the first place and that the complications resulted from the bungling of a hurried fee-splitting surgeon who had simply taken the word of the referring doctor that the operation was needed . The removal of a healthy organ or piece of tissue is seldom perpetrated as a deliberate and intentional fraud upon the patient . The unnecessary operation usually comes about through the haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " commercial surgery . " An Ohio surgeon , a reformed fee splitter , explained it this way . " The general practitioner sends you a patient . who he says has appendicitis . You examine the patient and find he has pyelitis , an inflammation of the kidney . But you do n't want to discredit the referring doctor in the patient 's eyes by telling him he does n't have appendicitis , so you say to yourself it wo n't hurt to have this appendix out anyway , and you go ahead and remove it and treat the pyelitis too . That 's wrong . " Even the best surgeons will make diagnostic mistakes in a few cases . They may be deceived by symptoms simulating acute appendicitis , for example , and may remove the appendix only to find that it is normal and that the symptoms were caused by some other inflammatory process in the abdomen . " In such cases the need for the operation was decidedly in the best interest , of the patient , " says Doctor Hawley . " Also , until diagnostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a small proportion of eases in which no cause of symptoms can. - be found at operation . " The better surgeons have an erroneous diagnosis rate of not more than 5 or 6 per cent . The College of Surgeons allows a wider margin and does not level t he charge of unnecessary surgery against a man until his percentage of normal appendixes removed exceeds 10 or 12 . How far out of line a surgeon can go , however , is indicated by what went on in a small Southern hospital . The story is told by Doctor Hawley in the Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons . ( Ceniiniied nn Page 52 ) ( hrnrinur 'd froni Page Sin , The staff stiff trustees of I his hospital had become concerned about this work of two surgeons , and asked the college to make an audit . A careful study of all I he surgical operations performed during the preceding fourteenmont h period , including a review of the clinical records and a microscopic examination of the removed tissues , revealed that the two surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 per cent of their total combined surgery . By contrast , the ten remaining surgeons on the Sian ' had performed only twenty-seven unnecessary procedures , or 6 per cent of their combined total . Unjustified appendectomies ran 38 per cent for one surgeon and 32 per cent for the other . And although acute appendicitis is rare in very young children , Surgeon No. 2 had operated upon eighteen children under four . Thirteen of these operations , or 72 per cent , were found to be unnecessary . In the removal of female reproductive organs , one surgeon scored 87 per cent in the " unnecessary " column , and the other 60 per cent . " One patient , upon whom was performed an unnecessary hysterectomy , died on the fifth postoperative day of pulmonary embolism , " Doctor Hawley reported . At this point a statement by Dr. Fred W. Rankin , of Lexington , Kentucky , made last October on his inauguration as president of the American College of Surgeons , is pertinent : In many respects surgeons carry the heaviest responsibilities of all physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the harm they can do . For this reason it is essential that they never forget what they are undertaking when they lay hands upon the human body . " He added that he thought medical schools had been " culpably remiss " in this regard . " It is essential , " he said , " that we determine a man 's intellectual ability and training before we allow him to begin the study of medicine , but we should make far greater efforts than we are now making to determine his qualities of heart and spirit , and we should dwell upon those things throughout all his days in medical school . " Another medical leader who has been outspoken in his criticism of unethical practices is Dr. I. S. Ravdin , professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania and a regent of the College of Surgeons . In an address before the American Medical Association in 11 ) 51 he warned that too many unnecessary gynecological operations were being performed . " The wholesale removal of ovaries and tubes and of uteri is all too frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women involved , " he asserted . Doctor Ravdin also declared I hat " ghost sur gery " had spread in many communities . Of the many varieties of fee splitting , ghost surgery is the lowest on the scale and the most flagrantly deceptive . It is an arrangement under which a surgeon is hired by the general practitioner to come into the operating room after the patient has been anesthetized , to cut where he is told and to get out before the patient wakes up . The patient never meets this masked marvel and is led to believe that the operation was performed by his trusted family doctor , to whom he pays the surgical fee . The family doctor , in turn , secretly slips the ghost , the agreed-upon split , sometimes 50 per cent , but . usually less , The phantom operator may he a man of some technical proficiency . But as he does not examine the patient before he cuts , he can not confirm or disprove the referring doctor 's diagnosis . He therefore dodges the surgeon 's first responsibility ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He frequently finds himself removing an appendix , gall bladder or a uterus that did not have to come out . On the score of unnecessary surgery he is apt to he one of the most serious offenders . The ghost surgeon may successfully keep out of the patient 's sight , but he can not escape detection by an alert hospital administrator . Several years ago the mother superior who manages a St. Louis hospital became suspicious of a certain surgeon and his " alignment " with two general practitioners . She stopped in one day at a patient 's room and discovered that the patient was under the impression that her operation had been performed by one of these general practitioners . " Why , he did n't operate on you , " said the mother superior . " Doctor X did . " - Well , for goodness sake , who is Doctor X ? " the astonished patient asked . " I 've never even heard of him . " The mother superior 's suspicions of ghost surgery thus confirmed , she summoned 1 he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly fired from the staff . He was also expelled , after a hearing , from the College of Surgeons . In another large city the president of a local medical society was known by many doctors to be one of the busiest ghost surgeons in the area . But there also a hospital administrator finally decided to clean house , called the surgeon to her office and said , " As of today , you are through operating here . " And that was that . In the present controversy , the surgeons and the general practitioners are inclined to blame each other for having started and perpetuated the fee-splitting practice . So far as guilt is concerned the situation is analogous to the briber and the man who takes the bribe . Which is the guiltier ? As a matter of fact , the proposal to split can come from either side  --  and in equally tempting terms . " A G.P. who had hung out his shingle in a suburban residential area invited me over to look at his hooks one evening . " a Detroit surgeon told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me $10,000 in the next six months if I would do all his surgery for him on a fifty-fifty-split basis . I said , ' No . ' But it has taken me ten times as long to build up my practice without giving rebates as it would have if I had played the game . " From a general practitioner in Columbus came a similar story , but with the roles reversed . Shortly after he opened his office several years ago be was approached by a young surgeon who was also just starting out in practice . " I 'd like to make an arrangement with you , " said the surgeon , " to split sixty-forty , you to take the sixty . " " You 're very generous , " replied the G.P. " But no , thanks . I do n't even know whether you are a good surgeon or not . " Thus rebuffed , the surgeon peddled his proposition elsewhere . He lined up three or four " feeders , " but after a few months they thought better of the scheme and quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often called an " assistant 's fee , " which , under certain circumstances , makes it legitimate and under others does not . In a large teaching hospital the surgeon is usually assisted by his residents and interns , who are in training with him and are apt to be better at the job than doctors who have only occasional contact with surgery . The residents and interns receive their compensation from t he hospital ? board and room and perhaps a small monthly stipend . In some hospitals the surgeon is assisted by another surgeon on the staff , who receives an assistant 's fee , or by junior associates whom he employs on a full-salary basis . In many small hospitals , with small staffs and few if any residents and in-terns , the surgeon must call upon out-side physicians to " scrub in " and help him at the operating table . Here he en-ters a twilight zone where he must walk cautiously to avoid pitfalls . His chances of stumbling into error are lessened if he follows certain rules ; I it chooses his as-sistants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him , 121 pays them a flat fee of Wen l ' d on 56 ) ( ( Aintitsireil 1 " Page 52 ) twenty-five or fifty dollars per opera-tion and ( 3 ) makes sure the patient un-derstands the financial arrangements . The College of Surgeons states that if the assistant is not the referring physician the surgeon may pay him directly without informing the patient of the transaction , but if the assistant is the referring doctor , then he must submit his own separate hill to the patient for this service . Occasionally a patient asks the family doctor to stay with him during the operation , " just to see that everything goes all right . " If the doctor bills the patient for his time , that 's legitimate . If he makes a generous gesture , says , " Of course I wo n't charge you for that , " and then collects $100 or $150 from the surgeon , that 's fee splitting . And unfortunately , the " assistant " relationship is frequently little more than a thin cover for such unethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " assistant-fee " system is apt to stir up bitter resentment . Typical are the remarks which an Iowa surgeon , in a letter published in the Bullein of the American College of Surgeons , said were thrown at , him when he first came to town . I 'm used to my fifty per cent and I ai n't been gettin ' it , " one doctor complained . -I want it now . " " Did So-and-So pay you ? How much of that is for inc ? ' And finally , when the surgeon made it clear that he was n't splitting : " Damn you , you 'll starve . You 'll never get another patient from my part of the country . There is n't another doctor in the state who does n't get his cut . You 'll go begging for patients . " The surgeon did n't beg for patients or buy them . But he did have a tough time , financially . until he found there were physicians who did n't expect a cut and who were glad to refer patients on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the College of Surgeons has been distressed by the number of reports and letters it receives from well-qualified young men seeking a piece to practice surgery and being told , in town after town , that there would be no business for them unless they conformed to the local custom of turning back 35 or 50 per cent to . the referring doctors . As we have indicated , there are many ways to divide a fee . Often the family doctor , who knows the patient and his financial circumstances , will suggest how much the surgeon should charge and will collect for both of them . A general practitioner in Detroit tried a variation on this theme , but with an ethical surgeon who did not suspect a split . The G.P. volunteered to collect the surgeon 's $300 fee , " as a favor , because I know these people . " In due time the surgeon received the $300 , and mailed a receipt for this amount directly to the patient . The receipt was something the G.P. had n't figured on . For the patient immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean by sending me a receipt for $300 . Doctor M. told me your bill was $1000 and that 's what I gave him to give to you . " That finished the G.P. And what do the fee splitters themselves say about it all ? Many insist they would prefer to practice without rebates , if everyone else would do the same , but that the straight path is impossibly narrow and that you " starve to death " if you try to go it alone . I talked to a Chicago surgeon , call him Doctor A. , who had split fees when he first came to town but who disliked the practice and soon stopped . Then a January JO . 1 , ' 34 few years ago , on the staff of a certain hospital he soon collided with Doctor B. , a big operator and fee splitter . M a result of a disagreement , Doctor B. moved his large surgical practice elsewhere and the hospital he left soon had a lot of empty beds and a deficit of several hundred dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Doctor A. said , " and told me that if I had played ball with Doctor B. this would not have happened . In other words , they did n't give a damn about the morals of the situation . Actually , I was supposed to he chief of surgery , but I was finding men on the staff whom I did n't know . And when I appointed two orthopedic surgeons who would n't split fees , the board turned around and brought in one who would . Apparently in such hospitals you either split fees or wreck your hospital . " Finally , disillusioned and disgusted , Doctor A. , who had resigned from the College of Surgeons , turned again to giving rebates . He demands a receipt from the referring doctor , however , and he also tells the patient what the financial score is . As for Doctor B. , he continued to split fees and was at this writing still a member of the College . " In this business , " Doctor A. sardonically remarked , " you must be big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one sense the medical capital of the nation , being the headquar'ers of such important organizations as the American College of Surgeons , the American Medical Association , the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Hospital Association , the fee splitters there have apparently not been awed into good behavior by that fact . " Chicago has a lot of fee splitting , " one of the regents of the College of Surgeons remarked , - and everybody there knows it . The bulk of the surgeons are clean and honest ? I 'm sure of that . But some of the smaller hospitals in the city are dreadful . Some surgeons coilect the fee in cash before the operation , and afterward peel off half the roll and hand it to the referring physician . " Fee splitting has always had a spotty distribution . It is rampant in some communities and almost unknown in others , One of the regents told me that Boston and Philadelphia , where the influence of the country 's oldest medical schools is strong , are relatively free of the practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Jersey . Another regent pointed out that it is bad in New York City , " which is so overpopulated with doctors that they are cutting each other 's throats . " With a few notorious exceptions the South Atlantic States are fairly clean . But fee splitting is said to be widespread in certain West Coast cities , and it flourishes throughout much of the Middle West . A thorough cleanup of these areas can not be accomplished without fearless and consistent action by all medical organizations whose members may be involved . As Doctor Ravdin has said , " All surgeons can be held responsible for the derelictions of a small segment of our profession if we fail to attempt to do something about them . " This applies to other medical groups as well . The American Academy of General Practice , although it was sharply critical of Doctor Hawley 's public blast at fee splitting , has emphasized that it , too , " is and always has been opposed to secret fee splitting and other unethical practices . " The Academy 's president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that " a regular family doctor , whom the family knows and can trust , can alone protect the patient against unethical practices and the occasional outrageous fees a few surgeons sometimes demand . " HaQpily for the future welfare of the patients , right principles do seem to be making headway , even in places where the big split was for many years standard operating procedure . In Columbus , Ohio , reform began in 1945 , when two of the city 's busiest fee-splitting surgeons decided , with mixed motives , to turn over a new leaf . They realized fee splitting was bad for the patient , and they were also tired of kicking back half their income to referring physicians . They therefore persuaded other surgeons to join them in organizing the Columbus Surgical Society , a major aim of which was to abolish fee splitting in the community . Each member signed a pledge not to split fees and also agreed to an annual examination of his professional records and accounts , including his income-tax returns , by a firm of auditors . The tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitably split fees unless he could deduct the rebate as a business expense , and to do that he would have to put it down on his income-tax return and thus reveal violation of his Surgical Society pledge . But there was more behind the move than that . The Internal Revenue Bureau had in the past permitted the deduction of the rebate payments only if they were " normal , usual and customary in the profession and in the community . " In 1946 the Columbus Surgical Society , having won over most of the surgeons , passed a resolution declaring that fee splitting had now been virtually abolished in the community . It also notified the Internal Revenue agent that rebates were therefore no longer a " normal , usual and customary " cost of doing business . As a result of this maneuver , Columbus became the first city where income-tax officials disallowed the rebate of surgeon to physician as a deductible expense . Any surgeons who had been reluctant to give up fee splitting were now forced by economic pressure to do so or to stoop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus plan , a number of ethical surgeons in Detroit this past year organized a similar group there . The Detroit Surgical Society already has some 600 members , including not only general surgeons but gynecologists , ear , nose and throat specialists , and eye doctors . The society prohibits fee splitting , states that combined bills are not permissible , " as they may constitute subterfuges for fee splitting , " and requires the members to submit to periodic financial audit . An organization of this type has also been started by a group of ethical young surgeons in Indianapolis , and the American College of Surgeons recently issued a statement recommending this pattern of action for other cities , noting that the plan offers " a compelling reason for offenders to obey the ethical injunction against fee splitting . " " The dictates of conscience , enough for some , are not sufficient for all , " the college statement adds . " It is the history of human behavior that moral purpose frequently surrenders to economic pressure . " The College of Surgeons is also developing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical-audit system which will enable every hospital " to measure the work of each staff physician and to assess the achievements of the hospital as a whole . " In announcing this step , Dr. Harold L. Foss , of Danville , Pennsylvania , retiring president of the College . remarked that attainment of this objective " will not only assure better patient care in our hospitals but will eliminate a present major deficiency in medicine  --  the inability or unwillingness of hospital staffs to discipline the actions of their own members . " If the medical staff still fails to do something about members who may he incompetent or unethical , it becomes the duty of the hospital board to take action . For , as another official of the college pointed out , it is the governing hoard which is " legally and morally responsible for the conduct of all hospital affairs , including those pertaining to the welfare and safety of the patient . " Still another indication of progress is a series of conferences between representatives of the American Medical Association and the American College of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enforcing the code of ethics to which both groups subscribe . And finally , the patient himself need not be entirely helpless and passive in this matter . The regents of the College of Surgeons were asked at a press conference last fall what the patient could do to protect himself against fee splitting . The reply was that he , or a responsible relative , should , before surgery , " talk to his own family doctor and the recommended surgeon individually and separately and arrive at a financial understanding with each , the charges to be commensurate with the patient 's ability to pay and with the service each doctor performs . " The college regents urged that the patient - " recognize that the services of the honest , conscientious general practitioner in making a correct diagnosis and in placing him in the hands of a good surgeon may be.as valuable to him as the surgery itself , and should be rewarded accordingly .
