" Both men and women are of a common size with Europeans . . . The women . . . were the merriest creatures . . . and kept chattering without the least invitation . . . From the waist upwards they are generally naked , and it seemed to be a custom to anoint these parts every morning . . . They are seldom disturbed by either foreign or domestic troubles and appeared healthy , strong and vigorous-a proof of the goodness of the climate in which they live " <P> - Captain Cook 's Voyages <P> Last week , 177 years after Captain Cook 's ships dropped anchor there , the tall , brown people of Tonga , still strong and vigorous , were enthusiastically celebrating a royal birthday : Salote , the strapping ( 6 ft. 2 in . ) Queen of the Tongans and a Dame Commander of the British Empire , was 50 years old . <P> Tongans could celebrate Queen Salote 's birthday with good reason . In her 32 years ' reign , Salote has capably and efficiently continued the tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands ( total area : 250 sq . miles ; pop . 45,000 ) for almost 3 centuries . Tongans have no housing problem , no unemployment ; they get free medical and dental care . Education ( including English , Tongan history , singing and native arts ) is compulsory from the age of six to 14 . <P> Debt &; Taxes . Under Queen Salote 's diligent administration , Tonga has built up sizable overseas investments . The islands , which became a British protectorate in 1900 , have no income tax , no public debt and a remarkably low crime rate : one murder in 30 years . At the age of 16 , every male Tongan gets eight acres of land , for which he pays an annual tax of about $7 U.S. to the Tongan government and a token rental to his chief . Tonga has its own passports , its own currency and its own postal system ( including the station , famed among philatelists , of " Tin Can Island " ) . <P> In the last 50 years , Tonga has experienced only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minor crisis was World War II ( Tonga formally declared war on Germany in September 1939 , with a proclamation that began : " We , Salote . . . " ) . In the spring of 1942 , U.S. troops went ashore on Tonga with orders to " take the island and destroy the enemy . " The invaders were met by a group of friendly Tongans who explained that they had heard of Pearl Harbor long before , had promptly tossed all of the islands ' 100-odd Japanese into jail in the capital city of Nukualofa . Later , thousands of other Allied soldiers stopped off at the Tongan Islands on their way to &; from the Pacific battlefronts . During this time , Queen Salote wisely instructed her people to retire to the interior , safely avoided any entanglements , economic or romantic , between the Tongans and the G.I.s.
