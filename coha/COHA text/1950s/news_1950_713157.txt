With his story , the jigsaw pieces of the mystery surrounding Warren 's expensive campaign , financed Johnston Dahl , NVarren reenter , and Griffin . mainly by three men , began fitting together . But Johnston 's testimony , to be resumed tomorrow , was only one phase of the committee 's inquiry into Florida 's Democratic politics and gambling , and the invasion of the rich Florida gambling field by Capone mobsters from Chicago . Fired by Warren Other developments wore : 1 . C. V. Griffin , Florida fruit grower who contributed $154,000 to Warren 's campaign , told of being fired as Warren 's investigator when Griffin was turning the heat on gamblers  --  a firing Griffin said occurred after Johnston had visited the governor . 2 .

Spokesmen for the fabulous S. and G. gambling syndicate of Miami Beach came to the defense of Harry Russell of Chicago , a missing witness accused of muscling in on them as front man for the Capones . The S. and G. men said he bought his way in last year for $20,000 , altho the business had an income of 26 million dollars in 1948 . Story of Syndicate 4 . S. and G. partners told the story of their syhdicate , which poured money into charities , gave lavish financial opportunities to municipal officials with whom they hobnobbed , and even named a judge . Johnston . one of the 10 original witnesses the committee found missing when it tried to subpena them , came in protesting he had been willing to testify all the time and that he had received no word from the subpena servers . Rudolph Halle y , committee counsel , retorted that the committee could get no word regarding him from his offices and residences in Chicago and Florida , and accused Johnston of deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over $100,030 Johnston denied this , but Halley said the committee had been informed by John H. Rush , Jacksonville attorney for one of Johnston 's four dog tracks , that Johnston was not going to appear until the state had issued him permits for the dog track race meetings . Johnston said he actually turned over $100,000 to the Warren campaign . But $35,000 of it , he said , came from his brother , J. R. Johnston , Tulsa banker and his associate in the Florida tracks , $15,000 from James R. Busey , St. Petersburg lawyer , and $10,000 from Max Silverberg , hot dog concessionnaire at Sportsman 's Park and Arlington Park tracks in Chicago , and at the Florida dog tracks . Johnston said Warren was a friend of 15 years . He said he gave n.ost of the money in cash because he did n't want checks popping up to plague him later . Reads Florida Law When the committee accused him of seeking to stay in the background because of a Florida law banning contributions from race track men , Johnston read a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the stand , he testified Warren had asked him to solicit Johnston 's help . Griffin testified at an earlier hearing that lie contributed $154,000 to the campaign and that another $154,000 was contributed by Lou Wolfson , Jacksonville industrialist a n d Washington , D. C. traction magnate . Griffin acknowledged he wanted favorable legislation for fruit growers and appointment as Warren 's special investigator in return for his contribution . He got the appointment in mid-1949 , and began investigating gambling , but his appointment was kept secret until last January . Fired After Visit He said he was fired after Johnston visited the governor two days after his investigating job was made public . At the time , Griffin said , it was " common gossip " that Warren was seriously ill ' from worry over threats cf gangland assassination . Griffin said it also was " common gossip " Johnston had aided Warren on behalf of Johnston 's " Chicago connections . " The story of the S. and G. syndicate 's operations , including Russells sudden appearance as a onesixth partner , was told by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Harold Salvey , and Jules Levitt , partners in the syndicate , and Ben Cohen , their attorney . The committee has been told Russell muscled into the syndicate in March , 1949 , after the syndicate 's bookie news , supplied by the Continental Press service from Chicago . had been suddenly and mysteriously cut off and then as mysteriously restored two weeks later . Bought In for $20,000 To a man , they insisted that Russell had bought his sixth of their multimillion dollar partnership for $20,000 . Their explanation was this : Russell had been visiting Miami Beach 's 350 hotels , in almost every one of which they said there are gambling establishments , and persuading the owners to throw out S. and G. bookies this year and join with him . Russell 's job was easy , the S. and G. men said , because some of the hotels were " Chicago owned " and Russell knew the owners . Among the " , Chicago owned " hotels the witnesses listed in the Miami Beach district were the Kenilworth , Sea View , Shelburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. men said they always had been proud of being a home town organization , but they called Russell in and offered him a partnership , on the understanding he would develop baseball gambling for them . Only a Coincidence They insisted it was only a coincidence they took Russell in immediately after getting their news service restored . Their memories failed completely on the two weeks in which the news was cut off altho it put them out of business . They did not recall any reason given them for cutting it off , and they had no clear recollection of steps they took to have it restored . But their memories were sharp on one point : They paid for the two weeks it had been cut off without warning , because they felt a " moral obligation " to the people who cut it off , an agency that sold Continental News . One Partner Missing All the partners have been among the missing witnesses , and one still was listed as missing today . He is Charles Friedman. the man , they said , who could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded with Friedman to stop hiding . But Friedman will not face the committee , Cohen said , because he is not well educated and fears the committee will humiliate him by making him appear to be a " dumb monkey . " The partners had failing memories , too , on the yacht , Clara Jo , which they bought early this year from Tony Accardo , reputed head of the Capone mob . They never knew Accardo , they said , and did not even ask whose boat they were buying when Russell advised them to buy it for $20,000 . The partners said they were independent Miami Beach bookies in 1944 when they decided to join forces . They formed a partnership , which they registered , and named the S. and G. , a name which they said stood for nothing . 26 Million Income In their best year , their income from bets was 26 million dollars . In that year they gave $33,140 to hospitals , the Red Cross , the cancer and heart disease funds , and the Boy and Girl Scouts . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach officials . Altho he is worth $350,000 , he said he borrowed $40,000 from Ald. William Burbridge at an interest fee of $2,000 for three months , which Sen. Kefauver D. , Tenn. , committee chairman , said amounted to 20 per cent . Burbridge was described as the boss of the Miami Beach council . Salvey said he also leased a lot that Burbridge bought for $7,500 at $6,000 a year for 99 years . Salvey pays the taxes . Atty . Cohen told of obtaining the appointment of a man in his office as a Miami Beach municipal judge . Raided bookies appear in Municipal court and pay fines that are generally $200 , but Cohen said none has had a jail sentence in five years . Other witnesses have said the syndicate " permits " frequent arrests of its bookies to keep the city government in funds and pays half the fines . Reputations Ruined Cohen , former president of the Miami Beach Bar association , said the syndicate is being dissolved because the partners feel their reputations are being destroyed by the investigation . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of crime , he said , whereas they are only gamblers " technically " breaking the law . When the subpenas were issued for the Miami hearing last month , each partner found he had an ill relative out of town , an illness , or a scheduled vacation , and none could be found when the hearing opened .
