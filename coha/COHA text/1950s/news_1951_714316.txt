Role in Africa Asked Observance of the Statutes Governing Merit Plan Is Urged Intervention to Prevent Extinction of Native Peoples Believed Needed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The practical aide of giving life to our basic lawsthe day-to-day functioning of government ? is seldom mentioned except when a civil servant fails in his duty . Yet this is the part of government which la important from the standpoint of certainty of gaining in proper season the fruits of sound governmental policies . The quality of governmental services depends very largely upon the human element in government . Government can not preserve basic freedoms or carry out the services desired by the people without workers of integrity and efficiency . At no time in our history have we risen to anything like the maximum degree of efficiency in government or of freedom from exploitation of government . The waste in the actual carry " ing on of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book , " The Civil Service and Patronage , " when he stated : " Only a country with the immense resources of the United States could have borne the expense of the spoils system . " Guarantee for Efficiency The people of each unit of government throughout the United States have ready at hand a sound and effective means of guaranteeing the efficiency of their government if they wish to adopt it . It is the merit system of recruitment and promotion of personnel for the non-policy-forming , non-elective offices , plus the utilization of modern well-proved employment practices . Selfish political considerations have interfered with the establishment of a truly competitive . merit plan in federal service . The same is true to a distressing extent in the State of New York and its civil divisions . Despite the fact that the merit system was first written into national and state statutes in 1883 , it has never been given full , support . This is so because the merit system conflicts with political ambitions and party patronage , upon which parties are supposed to depend for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of constitutional merit system principles thus far in our own state and its civil divisions , should we not seek to invigorate our implementing statutes , improve administration , and perhaps create new agencies ? ? Incentive for Competence We could provide in the law that all , not just a part , of the non-policy , nonelective positions in government be filled on the basis of sound competitive tests for merit and fitness . We could assure that citizens who compete successfully and as a result enter public service would have the opportunity to reach the top non-elective positions on the basis of proved ability . Is not this the time for civic groups in New York State interested in good government to join in presenting definite proposals for effective administration of the merit system to the special state commissions headed by Senator Walter J. Mahoney and Assemblyman Fred W , Preller , respectively , that are making a special study of civil service needs ? Unless the people express themselves vigorously in favor of an efficient body of civil servants in all units of government from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support a plan to assure this , they have little hope of enjoying to the full the rights and opportunities and services of a free government . WILLIAM F. , Albany , N. Y. , Dec. 11 , 1951 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tams : That there is a problem to be faced in " satisfying native African aspirations for independence , self-rule and political equality " there can be no doubt . THE TIMES is to be congratulated for pointing this out on its edit ? rial page of Dec. 4 , That the problem is one created by the Western civilization now facing it is also beyond doubt . Although yotit editorial concedes that the right of the Africans to a greater share in their own government is " morally obvious , " you weaken the morality by ' stating that , after all , " Europeans have their legally acquired rights in Africa . " Forced Dependence It seems rather ironic that " rights " acquired by invasion , conquest and much cruelty can be either legal or civilizing . And Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led it to a modern equivalent . In a good many ways , I am happy to report , an American education has shaped the careers of those native Africans who are now responsible leaders in the evolution toward self-determine ? tion . But , though hopeful , this is lonely saving grace in the over-all picture . No doubt there are many people today who see legality in the right . acquired by the nations of Europe in Africa . This legality , if any , is surely artificial and applicable only to European colonial schemata , especially designed for eight parts exploitation and two parts education toward independence . The dependence of the Africane was , of course , forced upon them and their forward going represents a kind of liberation or breaking out of prison . Thus we have a situation in Africa where a kind of hostile " peace " has been forced upon the tribes , although they were never at war with Europe in the first place . " Discovering " a new land or an Old and taking it by raising a flag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right known to civilized jurisprudence . There must have been prior rights in existence at Jthe time the Europeans were colony hunting and if there were they belonged to the native Africans . The only reason that African resiptance against the European invasion has been so long delayed is because it was only recently that the Europeans per : mitted the Africans a Western civili= zation education . By that standard the Africans have come to realize that the colonial system is less civilization and legal rights than exploitation , Declination of Tribes The danger to Africa , in exalting * theory of " legally acquired rights , " , the eventual extinction of Africans through a perverse historical process which will see them in the same defeated position as the American D1414 Justifying this sort of thing in the name of legality is to foster the rub " bing out of a race . That this conclusion is no reductio ad absurdum can bi seen in the alarming figures quoted by the Rev. Michael Scott in your columns on Dec. 3 : " Of 80,000 Herreros , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butchery . " Although the focus at Paris is now on South-West Africa , because , as you note , the Union of South Africa re ? mains adamant in its " blatantly radar ' apartheid policy , the U. N. might *ell turn its attention to other parts - Og Africa in the name of the humanity to which it is dedicated . BRUCE MCM . WRIGHT . New York , Dec. 5 , 1951 . Protection for Public Officials To THE EDITOR OK THE Naw YORK TIMES : I feel that I must express to you my deep appreciation of the article written by Arthur Krock which appeared in your columns on Dec. 6 under the heading " In The Nation . " It has been a grievous experience toi me to have my name injected maliciously and with a total disregard of the facts into a Congressional investigation now being featured prominently in the press and radio . For men whose careers in government ride in the balance of public opinion , as they should , it is of the utmost importance that the truth of their character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when their characters are maligned , and their works distorted , these men become defenseless in the face of smear and character assassination . ' Therefore it has been most heartening to me to see in THE NEW YORK TIMES the article by Mr. Krock , which points calmly and objectively to one of the most serious situations today confronting men in public life . The libel and perjury manufactured before the King subcommittee wreaks irreparable harm on those who ' are its targets , even if they are wholly innocent . I believe Mr. Krock 's article renders a distinct public service by bringing this problem out in the open . I repeat the plea which I made be ! ore the King subcommittee , that legislation is necessary to . protect public 3fficials from the decgtful machina:ions of irresponsible witnesses uttering testimony made of whole cloth . I tgree with Mr. Krock that the corn ) lete answer does not lie solely in legisation but also in adherence to the ) principle of due process for all accused . Precisely in the same manner as we ) unish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must also want the official who observes the scruples of honesty which his position Is a ruihlio . Servant riettfullv demands . JESS LARSON , Ldministrator , General Services Administration . Washington , Dec. 6 , 1951 . Drafting of Blood Supply Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Thiess ? The apathy of the general public as regards voluntary blood donation programs raises some interesting moral questions . If men can be drafted , why can not blood be drafted to help keep these men alive ? I believe that federal legislation should be enacted which would provide for the donation of blood by every eiti ? zen of the country who is physically ? able to do so . This would be no differ . efit than taxation imposed to buy military armaments , except that it it a tax which could really be distributed . equitably . Everyone should share . The present program for blood pro . curement is not only inadequate for military and civilian defense needs but has resulted in serious shortages of blood available for civilian hospital needs . The need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-scale war , has been sufficiently emphasized . How we are to get this blood is a . question which has not been adequately answered . It would seem to me that the burden of blood donations should be borne by the population as a whole , and not by a small percentage with a more active sense of social responsibility , ROBERT J. WEISS , M. New York , Dec. 5 , 1951 . Significance of Phi Beta Kappa Key To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tons : Let me thank you for your editorial on Phi Beta Kappa 's birthday . I fear the average reader of THE TIMES would not understand what'you mean , when you call a Phi Bete key the sym- ? bol of cultural values ? " the symbol of ideals of intellectual achievement . " The average man on the street sees in this piece of gold merely a gadget of the liberal college . For him the values symbolizes are too intangible and not readily translated into the hard dollars and cents of a capitalistic society . I find that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN M.
