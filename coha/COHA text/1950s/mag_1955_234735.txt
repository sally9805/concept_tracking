IN retrospect , 18th century France seems to have been minueting straight for the guillotine . Its art , with the emphasis on immediate sensual pleasure expressed in delicately tinted surfaces , often lacked the suggestion of tragedy that carries art beyond the incidental and transitory . <P> But to contemporaries , the 18th century was the Age of Elegance , one of those brief moments in history when man can abandon himself to the art of living . Warmed by the afterglow of France 's great Sun King , Louis XIV , the Versailles court lived a lavish life . Its taste and style were enviously mimicked in the other courts of Europe and in the newly decorated salons of Paris ' prosperous bourgeoisie . The age 's artists par excellence were Francois Boucher and his brilliant pupil , Jean Honore Fragonard . <P> Boucher 's patroness was Louis XV 's mistress Madame de Pompadour , and the artist worked furiously to keep up with her demands and those of the court-decorations for chateaux , scenery for opera and theater , lush paintings of nudes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his talent for rendering sensuous and elegant women in symbolic attitudes is best seen in his drawings , where quick pencil strokes catch the freshness and spontaneity of his inspiration . <P> Fragonard , some 30 years younger than Boucher , drifted with the increasing vulgarity of his time , trying hard to please the flamboyant Madame du Barry . Often he peddled his frumptious nudes to Paris ' burgeoning demimonde . Fragonard also was a master draftsman with an inspired poetic vision , as proved by his sanguines ( red crayon sketches ) of Tivoli 's Renaissance palace , Villa d'Este , surrounded by antique ruins . <P> The Boucher and Fragonard drawings opposite are included in a collection of 55 masterpieces of French and Italian drawing on loan from France 's Museum of Besan-Qon and showing this week at The Detroit Institute of Arts . From Detroit the show will go on to Indianapolis , Cincinnati and San Francisco to give gallerygoers a fascinating look at what the ancien regime regarded as modern art .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
