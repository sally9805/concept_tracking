TO the stage world , Japan 's Kabuki theater is a respected example of traditional dance-drama . Its beginnings go back more than 350 years to an Izumo priestess , O-Kuni , who is said to have developed the Kabuki theater from ceremonial shrine dances . At first , most of O-Kuni 's female players were young courtesans , and as time went on , their costumes , gyrations and behavior developed an air of such gay abandon that " many people were led astray , " say Japanese authorities . In 1629 , women were forbidden to take part in the Kabuki theaters , and male actors have played all the female roles ever since . <P> One dance-drama of the early Kabuki called Shibaraku ( Wait a moment ) , first seen in Tokyo in 1697 , is still performed ( see pictures opposite ) . Its hero , like many others in rough &; tumble Kabuki tales , is a typical Oriental Superman who can lop off the heads of many opponents at a blow , lift houses with one finger , crush temple gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord , who has usurped the rule of the country , orders the decapitation of some people accused of losing a precious sword . Suddenly the brave hero appears , shouting " Shibaraku ! " He then exposes the true culprit , the villain 's henchman , thus saves the innocents ' lives . <P> <P> This week a troupe of dancers in the Kabuki style , under the leadership of Tokuho Azuma , the daughter of a famed Kabuki star , brings a sampling of these traditions to the U.S. for the first time . <P> Unlike the classic companies of Japan , the Azuma group will feature female as well as male dancers . But the color of the traditional Kabuki remains : stylized postures , garish costumes and makeup . <P> The Kabuki company plans to entertain New York for four weeks , move on to Boston , Philadelphia and Washington , then to Europe . Sticklers for authenticity , the dancers brought their own cypress stage with them . This week , as is the custom when a brand-new stage is used , an official of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagehand was allowed to lay a hand on it .
