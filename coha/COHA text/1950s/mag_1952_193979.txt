In a letter to the Washington Post , a reader last week offered the latest explanation of flying saucers : " The sky over the United States is saturated with TV waves from all over the country which get scrambled together . . . Occasionally waves of the same frequency from Gorgeous George 's torso get jammed between those from Faye Emerson 's neckline and those from the profile of Miss America . When that happens . . . it makes the masculons and the femitrons in the stratosphere fly off on tangents in all directions at high speeds-hence flying saucers . They are just electronic illusions caused by the monkey business that goes on in TV studios . "
