Erroll Garner is a chunky Negro pianist whose happiest ambition is " to get that listener 's foot tapping . " One of the best jazz pianists around , he seldom has any trouble doing it . In Greenwich Village 's smoky Cafe Society last week , he was succeeding brilliantly . <P> A pianist who likes to take things easy , he cocked his head , grunted snatches of This Ca n't Be Love and Body and Soul in a voice that has more soul than body . Nobody cared about that . It was what was going on at the keyboard that counted . Garner sometimes plays with a relaxed but rollicking bounce , his right hand dallying attractively behind the foot-tapping beat of his left . Other times he just gets slow and dreamy , playing around the melody a lot of quiet chords that have just enough bite to keep the customers awake ; but this harmonic fabric makes many another jazz thumper sound either flat or fussy . Says he : " I just play what I feel . Suddenly I hit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't worry about how it 'll come out . " <P> At 30 , Garner has little to worry about : he made close to $100,000 last year by taking off in his own groove . Pittsburgh-born , he started at the piano when he was three , playing by ear the music he heard on the phonograph . At seven , he turned pro , played piano with an outfit called the Candy Kids on a Pittsburgh radio station . He has played with bands , but now settles for a trio ( " Three 's a crowd , three 's enough " ) . <P> A bachelor , Garner has a Manhattan apartment as well as a house in suburban White Plains , but not a piano . He putters occasionally with golf . A good part of the time , " I just sleep . " He still can not read a note of music . " It 's a gift , " Pianist Garner says . " The good Lord gave it to me and I 'm trying to develop it . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
