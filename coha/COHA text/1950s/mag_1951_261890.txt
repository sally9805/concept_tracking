Britons sizzled last week over a 20% government cut in the tiny meat ration . The cut reduces the ration to eightpence ( 9 ) worth a week-about one small lamb chop or a matchbox-sized piece of steak . This is an alltime low-less meat than sweat- &-tears; Churchill gave them in the worst days of the war . <P> Despite rising exports , Britain got into this meat hole because of a gimmick beloved of its doctrinaire Socialists , bulk buying . The fact that the government does all Britain 's buying of essential foods and many other commodities is supposed to enhance its bargaining power , make imports cheaper for Britain 's people . But after Britain became a bulk buyer , Argentina , which supplies 20% of Britain 's meat imports , became in self-defense a bulk seller . <P> The Ministry of Food , dickering for a year 's Argentine meat supply , refused nine months ago to pay a 5,000,000-a-year increase asked by Argentina . The Labor government called it " blackmail .

Some private British meat importers would pay the high price in the hope that they could sell at a profit . If they were wrong , Argentina 's price would come down . <P> The Socialist substitute for a free market has no such flexibility . In fact , British Laborites explained last week that if they met the Argentine price , they would have to revise upward their meat contracts with Australia and New Zealand . Government bulk buying , supposed to get cheap meat , was getting close to no meat at all . <P> London 's Liberal News Chronicle pointed out another result of Socialist economies : with the new ration cut , the government is committed to subsidize butchers by an additional 20 million ( $56 million ) yearly so that they can stay in business . Said the News Chronicle : " It will , therefore , cost the taxpayers four times as much not to have meat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In London 's Holborn district , a butcher adorned his empty window with the hand-written text : " Let them wander up and down for meat , and grudge if they be not satisfied .
