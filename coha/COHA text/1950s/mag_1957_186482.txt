A rundown , three-story building at 770 Eastern Parkway , Brooklyn is the hub and powerhouse of one of the most intense religious brotherhoods in the modern world : the Lubavitcher movement . In Communist Russia and North Africa , Australia and all over the U.S .. an estimated 10,000 followers of this Hasidic sect look to Brooklyn for light and guidance , for it is the home of their Rebbe , * Menachem Mendel Schneerson . He is the seventh leader of the Lubavitchers , a man whose wisdom is believed by his followers to be something more than human . <P> Few outsiders have made the effort to try to understand this paradoxical sect of highly organized , missionary-minded mystics , strongest remnant of the great age of Hasidism , that inspired Eastern European Jewry during the 18th and 19th centuries . In the March and April issues of Commentary , Reform Rabbi Herbert Weiner of Temple Israel in South Orange , N.J. presents the results of a year-long study of the Brooklyn Lubavitchers . <P> Joyous Mysticism . The Lubavitcher movement , deriving its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Shneur Zalman ( 1747-1812 ) , a brilliant young Talmudist in White Russia who became a disciple of Hasidism . This was a movement of holy men ( zaddiks ) and their followers who reacted against the arid , hairsplitting Talmud-boring of 17th century Judaism with a kind of joyous mysticism ; they have often been compared to the followers of St. Francis of Assisi . Shneur Zalman burned with Hasidism 's hitlahavut ( spiritual enthusiasm ) , but he recognized the need for organization and teaching as well , and he steered a middle course between mystical rapture and the traditional emphasis on study . He gave his followers and their descendants a highly organized religious school system , a missionary tradition and a lively concern for health and material welfare that kept the movement alive ( often underground ) through persecution , war and revolution . <P> In 1940 the sixth Rebbe , Joseph Isaac , arrived in New York City , an ill and exhausted refugee from Communist imprisonment and the German bombardment of Warsaw . But in the decade before he died , he planted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missions , " and set up Lubavitcher Bible classes , founded a publishing house to turn out textbooks in English and Hebrew , dispatched missionaries all over the world . After his death in 1949 , he was succeeded by his son-in-law , Menachem Mendel , who , like all Rebbes , added Schneerson to his name in honor of Founder Shneur Zalman . <P> Long Discourse . Author Weiner describes his visit to a farbrengung , an annual festivity in celebration of Joseph Isaac 's release from Communist prison . The courtyard adjoining the Brooklyn headquarters was jammed with Lubavitcher men at benches and tables , many of them in long black coats or full jackets and large-brimmed black hats . Some wore the gartel , a black silk cord bound around the waist to symbolize the distinction between the " higher " and " lower " parts of man . As soon as blue-eyed , black-bearded Menachem Mendel arrived , he was handed a bottle of whisky , which he passed to outstretched hands below him , and almost immediately bottles of whisky and paper cups appeared on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
