Her black hair straggled to her shoulders , and her tight tweeds strained in odd bulges . For three weeks of rehearsal , she worked as unobtrusively as if she were the second lead 's standin . But when the Du Pont Show of the Month put What Every Woman Knows on the air last week , she gave new life to the dated charm of the J. M. Barrie play . As Maggie Wylie , the homely but wise and witty Scottish lass who is the real reason behind her bartered bridegroom 's success , Ireland 's Siobhan ( pronounced Shi-vawn ) McKenna , 35 , was a trim , burr-voiced delight . <P> Sentimentalists who had seen Maude Adams or Helen Hayes sweeten the role did not find the Maggie of their memories . " Maggie is n't so virtuous , " says Siobhan in her rich resonance , the native Gaelic just a thin inflection away . " She can be a bloomin ' bitch . I could play her all mealymouthed , the poor little rich girl , but I do n't see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been playing parts her way ever since she grew up in Galway , daughter of a mathematics professor , and began her play acting with her pals in a neighbor 's barn . For a while the theater came close to losing her to her father 's profession , but her love of Gaelic and the stage kept her coming back to Irish drama . Soon she was involved with Saint Joan , the role that has almost become her alter ego . For a starter she translated the Shaw play into Gaelic , but her greatest triumph came later on the New York stage in 1956 . There , her Joan emerged as a thick-brogued peasant , tough and practical and yet a single-minded fanatic . <P> Ever since Joan , Siobhan has starred as an international vagabond . " I go from country to country , and half the time I do n't know where I am . ' ' But movies , stage or television , she always knows what she wants to be . " In England , ' ' she says , " first they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , thank you ; I do n't know who was responsible for it , but obviously they went to a lot of trouble to think it up . ' " In Hollywood , she had similar trouble . " They said : ' We 'll get you great parts , but first we 'll spend six months grooming you . ' Then somebody told me what grooming means-it means an operation on your behind , your front and your nose , so I said that 's that . " <P> Idle Fear . Her travels have taken Siobhan from Broadway ( The Chalk Garden , The Rope Dancers ) and off-Broadway ( Saint Joan ) shows to London movies
