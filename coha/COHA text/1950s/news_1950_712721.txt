Letters to The Times Financing Road Building Failure to Use Earmarked State Funds Charged in Protesting Tell Plan To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Recent editorials in THE NEW YORK TIMES have advocated the adoption of the toll principle for building highways , ' particular reference being made to the New York Thruway . As spokesman for its 217,000 members in the New York City area , the Automobile Club of New York is heartily opposed to any Mich additional charge to motorists for highway construction for which they already pay . In your editorial of Feb. 10 you mention " the utter unlikelihood  --  and the unsoundness  --  of mandating a percentage of motor fuel or automobile license taxes for road construction . " Yet , implicitly in state law there is such a mandate . In 1947 , amendments to the tax law and vehicle and traffic law specifically allocated for highway purposes 37% per cent of the gasoline tax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also specifically earmarked portions of such taxes for highway purposes . In the same editorial you recall " the bright and hopeful publicity that attended the ground-breaking on July 11 , 1946 , for the first short unit of the 486-mile New York Thruway . " Cost Defrayed Earlier in that year , in his annual message to the Legislature on Jan. 9 , Governor Dewey had this to say about the Thruway : " This construction will save enough money that would otherwise have to be spent in widening existing routes through congested areas to defray practically the entire cost of the Thruway . Careful investigation and survey by a committee of expert engineers has resulted in ' the conclusion that it can not be supported by tolls and should be toIl-free . " In the Feb. 14 editorial you say : " Automobile owners who now pay about $165,000,000 in taxes and license fees for support of the state government and its aid to localities have a right to expect that special charges made to build the Thruway be used for that purpose alone . " In 1910 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from registration fees for highway purposes , the automobile owner also had the right to expect that these funds would be used for highway purposes alone . Gasoline Tax Again , in 1929 , when the state 's first gasoline tax was adopted with a clause specifically requiring that all funds from this tax be used for highways , the automobile owner also had the right to expect that this law would not be violated . In 1947 , after these promises had been broken to the tune of $700,000,000 ( which was diverted from highway purposes and thrown into the general fund ) , the automobile owner again had the right to expect that the specified 37% per cent of his gasoline tax and 75 per cent of his registration fees would be used only for highway purposes . Now that Governor Dewey and THE NEW YORK TIMES tell us that there is no money in the state treasury for new highways , despite an estimated $169 , - 000,000 to be collected from motorists during the 1950.51 fiscal year , the automobile owner would be foolish indeed to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's general fund and some new way found for him to " bear a greater burden . " So far as the motorist is concerned , there appears to be a vast area of broken pledges which separate him from the highways and bridges that should have been constructed with the revenues he has contributed for that purpose . It is time that those responsible for fulfilling these pledges took the necessary steps to live up to them . It is time also for them to remove from the motorist the burden he carries for state expenditures other than the highways and related facilities he uses and benefits from directly . J. R. CROSSLEY , Vice President , Automobile Club of New York , Inc . New York , March 6 , 1950 . State Aid to Libraries To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : In just the right way and at just the right time you have made certain that nothing short of an emergency is likely to prevent the granting of state aid to our public libraries before the Legislature adjourns . Your editorial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so persuasive and reasonable , it shows so convincingly how necessary state aid is , it so inspiringly points out that the goal of the legislation is " good books within the ' reach of everyone , " that both Governor Dewey and the legislators may be Confidently expected to unite enthusiastically and almost unanimously in taking this historic forward step this week for the cardinal benefit of our public libraries . HAROLD J. BAILY . New York , March 7 , 1950 . Status of Press in Argentina To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have had the good fortune to come upon the editorial comment made in THE NEW YORK TIMES in December , 1949 , concerning the difficulties encountered by El Intransigente , an Argentine daily newspaper founded thirty years ago , publication of which was suspended due to circumstances in July , 1949 . Please accept my thanks for the remarks contained in your editorial . They were generous and true . For us in Argentina it is sad to be forced to admit that our country had no freedom of the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intransigente , seventy other nublications have been censored , either because they could not see eye to eye with the regime in power , or because they did not greet with sufficient enthusiasm measures which have been launched . El Intransigente , now being issued in mimeograph form , holds tenaciously to its views , without ostentation and yet fearlessly . We are certain that the violence done one of our most fundamental constitutional rights is but temporary and that in the days to come perhaps these very penalties will serve more firmly to establish this freedom of the press , so widely exercised in your great nation . May I express my cordial friendship for your great paper . DAVID MICHEL TOFtINO , Publisher , El Intransigents . Salta , Argentina , Feb. 28 , 1950 . New York 's Dairy Industry Yellow Oleomargarine Believed Threat to Farmers , Figures on Milk Given TO THE EDITOR OF TIM NNW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of recent date indicates that you realize what a serious thing it would be if a substantial part of the dairy industry in this state ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housewife , who 1. , e now required , to spend a little time tit color oleomargarine . If THE NEW YORK TIMES looks into this yellow oleomargarine matter carefully , and I am sure it will , I believe It will reach the same conclusion I have reached . We can either take a little time in each individual household to color oleomargarine , and continue to have a cheap substitute for butter , or we can color it , and by so doing take away once and for all from the poor families of this state their cheap butter substitute , and at the same time start the dairy farmer on a downward road to which there may be no end . In a recent letter to your paper Charles F. Collison indicated that less than fifteen million pounds of butter a year was manufactured in New York State . The Department of Agriculture and Markets informed me this week that in 1949 1,766,780,000 pounds of New York State milk went into butter , cheese and ice cream . The Milk Marketing Administrator also advised me this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into butter , cheese , etc. , at the rate of over 170 million pounds per month , and that in May , 1949 , over 380 million pounds of that milk went into manufactured products . There are a great many dairy farmers in this state whose entire fluid milk output goes into these products . These farmers are currently getting $2.73 a hundred , or a little less than 6 cents a quart for their milk . Moreover , you recognize , I am sure , that , regardless of how much butter is manufactured here , the price of practically all dairy products is tied to the price of butter . And when you consider the wholly unjustified spread between the price of white and yellow oleomargarine in those states which permit the sale of yellow oleomargarine above and beyond the 10 per cent federal tax , and when you realize that it requires about a hundred pounds of milk to make four pounds of butter , and when butter sells , at 70 cents a pound , which is about $2.80 a hundred pounds ( 47 quarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do not only to the consumer but to the farmer as well . SHARON J. MAmis , Member of Assembly , Schoharie County . Albany , March 2 , 1950 . An editorial on the subject discussed in the above letter appears elsewhere on this page . Metering of Buildings Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I note in THE NEW YORK TIMES of March 3 that city officials consider the cost of a family water-metering system prohibitive and therefore propose apartment building metering which would cost an estimated $130,000,000 . Installation of apartment building meters as proposed may be compared with construction of bridge towers on opposite sides of a river as a substitute for a bridge across the river since the latter would be too costly . While the proposal may have the merit of costing only $130,000,000 , it does not have the merit of accomplishing the metering objective , which is to make people pay for the water they use . Common sense fa'ls to grasp the soundness of such an expenditure when all that may be expected in return is voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantity charge by the landlord which has no relation to the quantity used by specific tenants . The waster 's immunity to personal cost remains virtually intact . For example , in an apartment with fifty families , a waster , would have to pay for only two gallons of every hundred gallons he wasted . There is really no more incentive to save under the building meter plan than there is at present . Conscientious individuals who read the newspapers are now conserving water . They might save more with better public education on ways to save . But thoughtless wasters and neurotics whose excessive use of water is compulsive would not be touched by metering that does not reveal their exce use . There is one other observation that is inescapable . The vast outlay required for metering that does not measure could be used constructively in obtaining additional water supply . The Hudson can be tapped for an addition of 10 per cent to our water supply for $5,000,000 . That is easy picking and further additions would obvi ? ously be more costly , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEORGE MUM . , New York , March 6 , 1950.
