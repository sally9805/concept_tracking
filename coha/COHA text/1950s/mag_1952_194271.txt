THE GREAT BEAST ( 316 pp. ) - John Symonds-Roy ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> " I thought that I knew of every conceivable form of wickedness , " said a judge to a London jury in summing up a libel case in 1934 . " I thought that everything which was vicious and bad had been produced at one time or another before me . I have learned in this case that we can always learn something more ... I have never heard such dreadful , horrible , blasphemous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the man who describes himself to you as the greatest living poet . " <P> The poet in question was Aleister Crowley , 58 , born the son of well-to-do evangelical parents . His parents had lived their own lives as active Christian laymen , and done their best to make him follow their example . They had given him the baptismal name of Edward Alexander , but he preferred others . Perhaps his favorite name for himself ( adopted from the book of Revelation ) was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , at 72 , he was popularly known as " The Worst Man in Britain " and " The Wickedest Man in the World . " His literary executor , John Symonds , has now written a sympathetic biography . <P> 316 Devils . Many a son has reacted to parental righteousness by going wrong . But Aleister Crowley is one of the few who deliberately devoted a lifetime to creating a " religion " out of every vice in the catalogue . At 14 , he seduced the kitchen maid while his mother was at church , and butchered a cat to see whether it had nine lives . These were mere preliminary excursions ; he inherited a fortune from his pious father and went on to broader fields . At 23 , he became Brother Perdurabo ( " I will endure to the end " ) of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn . The group was interested in communication with good or angelic spirits in the " beyond " ( William Butler Yeats was also a member ) . Crowley branched out a bit ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once by his own count gathered 316 devils together . <P> Without her family 's knowledge , Crowley married Rose Kelly , sister of Painter Sir Gerald Kelly . They spent their honeymoon in Cairo , where they drove through the streets dressed in silks , diamonds and cloth of gold , and in Ceylon , where , for a while , Rose thought she was a flying bat and was found by her admiring husband hanging from a beam , naked , upside down and unhurt . <P> Dirty Snowdrops . Crowley insisted that in all his acts he was directed by " The Secret Chiefs , " i.e. , the top brass of the spirit world . These chummy spooks now informed him that " a New Epoch had begun for mankind and that Aleister Crowley had been chosen to initiate it . " Crowley took orders from the Egyptian god Horus , with his wife ( now known as Ouarda the Seer ) acting as interpreter . The Book of the Law ( the bible of the New Epoch ) was then dictated to him . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no law beyond Do What Thou Wilt " - and this Crowley proceeded to do . One of his first acts of freedom was to set " Beelzebub and his 49 servitors " after the leader of the Order of the Golden Dawn . Another was his baking of sacred " Cakes of Light ... to breed lust " in all who ate them . To this period , too , belongs the slim volume of pornographic poems entitled Snowdrops from a Curate 's Garden .
