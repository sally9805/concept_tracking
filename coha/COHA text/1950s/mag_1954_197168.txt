In Tunis too , the bright promise of local autonomy that Premier Mends-France brought ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) was already being tarnished by old habits of suspicion . The venerable ( 72 ) Bey of Tunis , with Mends ' backing , appointed Tahar Ben Amar , 68 , one of the protectorate 's biggest landowners , to be Premier . He was certainly as pro-French as anyone could wish . But he immediately ran into difficulties . <P> Tunisia 's 250,000 French colons , knowing that in any local government they would be swamped by Tunisia 's 3,000,000 <P> Arabs , were angry at Mends ' promise of autonomy within the French Union . They denounced Mends-France as a " Judas Iscariot " ; planeload after planeload of them went tearing off to Paris to protest his " sellout " to their powerful representatives in the National Assembly . Paris told Premier Ben Amar that Tunisian independence was at best a " stated principle , " which could not possibly be implemented until " arrangements " have been made to secure the colons ' special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical man , accepted the French restrictions without a murmur . <P> But his difficulties were not over . He offered cabinet posts to the leaders of Neo-Destour , Tunisia 's clandestine but powerful nationalist party . Most of the leaders are in exile or cooped up in French jails , but six hurried to Switzerland to confer . They talked by phone with their exiled leader , Habib Bourguiba , 51 , now a " guest " of the French in a villa near Paris . Bourguiba counseled " accept . " <P> But when Premier Ben Amar submitted his cabinet list to the new French Resident General , Pierre Boyer de la Tour du Moulin , it was the Frenchman who would not accept . Only after Ben Amar dropped two out of six Neo-Destourians was his ten-man team approved . Every man on it is a moderate ( what the French call " calm " ) . This week at a formal investiture , they kissed the right palm and left shoulder of the Bey of Tunis , received his " blessing of Allah . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With their religious festival , Aid el Kebir , upon them , crowds gathered in the streets , waiting for Neo-Destour to decide whether the holiday should be celebrated with joy , or with reserve . At last the word spread through the bazaars : celebrate with joy .
