Some U.S. victories can be won on the drawing boards of industry . Last week two new fighting machines moved closer to battle : <P> Eager Beaver . The Army has long wanted a heavy truck that can splash ashore from landing barges and ford deep streams . Last week it had just the thing , and in quantity . Reo Motors Inc. delivered the last of 5,000 six-wheeled , 2-ton trucks designed to start , stop and run under water as easily as above it . Called the Eager Beaver , the vehicle is a big brother of the submersible jeep ( TIME , May 15 ) . Its engine breathes and exhausts through vertical snorkel tubes like a latest-type submarine . Its wiring system is completely covered with a silicone-rubber compound that repels water . Tight oil seals keep water out of all engine openings . <P> Equipped to carry a five-ton load through a 7-ft. - deep stream , the Eager Beaver does even better . In a grueling Army test , with the driver wearing a portable lung , it went to a depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a clear stream with fish swimming around it ( see picture ) . <P> Flying Arrowhead . The Navy allowed Douglas Aircraft Co. to release a picture of its XF4D , an experimental jet interceptor of daring , tailless design . Intended for launching by catapult from a carrier deck , it has been test-flown successfully , but nothing has been made public about its performance . <P> The XF4D illustrates an aerodynamic axiom : " The more power you have , the less wing you need . " Presumably it is very fast ; it may be supersonic . The short , steeply swept-back wing is shaped to minimize the Shockwave effects that are generally felt near the speed of sound . The thickness of the foreshortened wing and weblike " planform " in the center is intended to direct the air in a " three-dimensional flow " - below , above and around it .
