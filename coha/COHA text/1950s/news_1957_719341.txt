txt Letters to The Times " Aside from outer space itself , " I stated , " questions will undoubtedly arise as to sovereignty over celestial bodies which may be reached by man in the foreseeable future . Consideration would need to be given to whether or not such celestial bodies should be regarded as subject to claims of sovereignty and , if so , as to whether the rules of international law regarding discovery and occupation , conquest and cession should be made applicable to such celestial bodies . Space ships too would presumably need to be subjected to some legal order , and this raises the question of the applicability of present laws , both national and international , regarding aircraft and seagoing vessels . " Choice of the United Nations as the forum for the consideration of problems relating to outer space is supported by the identity between its purposes and principles and the purposes and principles which must govern any international consideration of such problems . If one or more nations have achieved something which can take us into outer space , the peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this through some program of international control . Further , the benefits derived from such devices must by shared by all nations , in keeping with the growing tendency of international sharing of advances in the scientific field , a tendency which has been accentuated in the field of atomic energy and in the arrangements adopted for the International Geophysical Year . Voice for Small Powers The United Nations is also peculiarly equipped to provide small powers with an opportunity to be heard , Although it is undeniable that primary responsibility for the settlement of such matters rests on the great powers , any steps taken by them would necessarily affect the smaller ones , and I therefore believe , both personally and as the representative of a small power , that they definitely should be heard . I believe that the near future will see us proceeding , whether out of necessity or free choice , along the lines I have suggested . Failure to do so would surely lead to spatial anarchy and render futile all the advances in science we are witnessing today . The more through science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater and more compelling the necessity for us to learn  --  nations , men and women ? the art of living together in toleration and understanding . The realization that progress in international toleration and understanding must not be permitted to lag behind our advances will , I am sure , result in the timely achievement of a proper balance between the two . LESLIE K. MUNRO . New York , Dec. 6 , 1957 . Delegates to Conventions To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In The Times of Nov. 30 James F. Donnelly , a surviving delegate from New York City to the 1915 state constitutional convention , writes critically of my letter to The Times of Nov. 15 because it was signed as " Sole surviving delegate from New York City to both 1915 and 1938 constitutional - conventions . " Greetings and all good wishes to Mr. Donnelly  --  but the fact remains that Mr. Donnelly was not a delegate to the 1938 constitutional convention .

It follows appropriately the excellent contribution by Prof. Henry Steele Commager published in your Magazine of Nov. 24 . Our liberties have been dearly bought ; one of them , the right to speak and write on matters of public concern , must be vigilantly preserved . The I. P.

Air Pollution Control Progress in Conversion of Brooklyn ' Power Plant Reporte To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Dec. 6 The Times published a letter from John F. of . Brooklyn in which it was pointed out that the Consolidated Edison Company 's Hudson Avenue power plant is depositing soot and flyash in certain sections of Brooklyn as a result of its operations . For the benefit of Mr. and your other readers we should like to point out the following : Since the Department of Air Pollution Control was established , in 1952 , Consolidated Edison has spent some *12,000,000 on conversion of its thirty-three boilers in the Hudson Avenue plant from coil-fired to fuel oil-fired burning . Twenty-six of the boilers have been converted thus far and the remaining seven conversions , at a cost of between $2,000 , - , 000 and $2,500,000 , should be completed next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hudson Avenue . plant are clear of almost all pollution , and when the conversion is completed the remaining two will be as well . We realize that it is difficult to remember what smoke looked like yesterday , let alone to remember what it looked like a year ago , but we believe that the improvement in emissions from this plant is very noticeable . Adequate Progress Conversion of such large boilers takes a minimum of twelve weeks for each one . Such conversion can not proceed constantly , because power must continue to be produced at all times . Nevertheless , the Department of Air Pollution Control maintains a vigorous and constant check on the progress of the work and we are convinced that it is going forward at an adequate rate . The Department of Air Pollution Control agrees that much work must be done before this power plant and several others in the Consolidated Edison system are in good condition from the air pollution control point of view . We are continually prodding Consolidated Edison to maintain a good performance schedule on this and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of air pollution control in our city . To accomplish control will take time and patience . We believe that in so far as the Hudson Avenue plant of Consolidated Edison is concerned progress is good and steady . When the conversion is completed most if not all complaints concerning this plant will be a thing of the past . LEONARD GREENBURG . M. D .. Commissioner , Department of Air Pollution Control . New York , Dec. 6 , 1957 . Financing Italy 's Mideast Plan TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In reference to the reactions described in your issue of Dec. 8 on the Italian plan related to the creation of a fund for the economic development of the Middle East , I would like to stress a technical point which appears to be of importance for the evaluation of said plan . It has been , in fact , reported that one of the difficulties for the acceptance of the plan would be that the reimbursement of the loans originated by the Marshall Plan funds are being repaid in local currencies . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promissory notes issued by the Italian Government to the Export-Import Bank in connection with the loans above mentioned clearly spell out that the repayments would be made " in lawful money of the United States of America . " There is no doubt that the same applies to the notes issued also by other countries in repayment of similar loans . GABRIELE PARESCE , Press Counselor , Italian Embassy . Washington , Dec. 9 , 1957 . Problem of Slums To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The series of articles by Charles Grutzner on slums and blight in'bur suburbs provided some sorely needed light on the conditions in our suburban communities . In showing what is being done  --  all too little in terms of the . size of the problem ? it should awaken communities as to what can be done . Certainly these communities can not afford to ignore these ugly problems much longer . The longer they wait , the more it will cost and the bigger the problem will become .

Believed to Be Proper Forum for Their Consideration The writer of the following letter , Ambassador from New Zealand ' to the United States , is President of the General Assembly . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read with satisfaction your editorial of Dec. 5 entitled " Man Into Space , " in which you urged the United Nations to take the lead in solving legal and other problems posed by man 's recent and forthcoming ventures into space . You may be interested to know that in an address to the New Jersey State Bar Association on Nov. 22 last I drew attention to some of these problems and suggested also that the United Nations was the proper forum in which to consider them . I of course was not thereby committing the Assembly . I pointed out that while the scientists intensify their efforts to exploit fully the newly Uncovered pathways to greater understanding of our universe , it behooves us to ponder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adapted to new developments and what new ones must be developed .
