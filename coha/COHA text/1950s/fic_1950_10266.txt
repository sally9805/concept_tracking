And the time they sat on the balcony outside their room at the Ritz sipping a marvelous Pommery and watching the Place Vendome melt away into purple twilight . Ah , ah , ah that was a good time , a sweet time , a lost time . The staccato popping of corks had been a rhythmic counterpoint as they danced in a champagne haze on the rooftop of the Crillon , in a champagne daze on the rooftop of the world . The days and weeks and months and years had popped and fizzed and poured together in the soft yellow twilight of a champagne haze , the champagne days from the wine-numbed heights of Naples to the Mummsoakedshores of Santa Monica , from a day in 1927 he managed to remember to a night in 1929 he could not forget .

" ... We 're two little lambs who have lost our way , baa , baa , baaaa ... " Talking their way through the second bottle : " ... In those days we seemed to be the hub around which parties were always revolving . Wherever we moved our parties always seemed to move with us . Whether we wished it or not ...

You certainly feelp102in High Noon that all those parties , all the carousing , the frantic search for oblivion was a symbol of , well , call it group neurosis . " " Tell you the truth , Stearns , I had a big talent and I used it pretty well , in my good years anyway .

" Then Halliday said with an edge of hostility : " I 've still got some of my talent left , Stearns , but I 've got to channel it , concentrateit . " Halliday stared down into his empty paper cup . He felt quite sure that he was sober . But somewhere in his mind lurked the vague impression that he was talking too much , or too revealingly . He made a hasty recapitulation of what he had been saying  --  movies , parties , Jere ( no , he had been careful not to mentionJere , had n't he ? ) , writers , himself  --  it was n't exactly a jutnble , just the informal playing of truth and consequences . The stewardess was bending over them . " Are n't you two nightowls going to sleep at all ? " Shep held up their half-finished bottle . " Have a drink ? " " Ooh , champagne . Somebody 's birthday ? " " No , it 's a marriage , " Halliday said . " We 're eloping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very happy together . " " And we 're going to have a child together and its name is Love on Ice and we want you to be its godmother , " Halliday said . " Come on , Miss Heath , a toast to your godchild . " " I wish I could but it 's agin regulations . Try me again when I 'm on the ground . " " That 's the trouble , " Halliday said . " Too many regulations . Everybody is so serious . Young girl like you  --  too many ' spon-sibilities . " Shep studied the older man carefully . He felt perfectly soberhimself . He had n't even noticed a change in Halliday . " Pour me just one more little touch , " Halliday said . Shep poured him a very short one . " Not even one friendlyp103little drop with us ? " he pressed Miss Heath . She smiled a practiced no .

Halliday leaned his forehead against the window and stared out at the colored riding lights on the wings . Women would be attracted to young Stearns , he imagined . He was that disarming combination of robustness and sensitivityand he spoke with great earnestness and he listened as if he liked you.  --  But I was more brilliant and I was more of a natural for women ( remember how it used to irk Jere , long before I was unfaithful ? ) and ( losing his way in the dark corridor ) the party itself was the thing . Some of those years were lived from one party to the next , with in-between periods used only for recuperation . He shut his eyes and tried to remember one party in detail , not pop and ha ha ha and who wants gingerale and hey Jere I 'm over here but exactly who was there , what was said , why that fight broke out . . .

They had always seemed to be havingp104so much fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tragediesthat stuck up in his mind like telephone poles stretching across the desolate landscape of the past ; once the good times had run glistening and taut and wire-fine from pole to pole , but ill winds and the ravages of time had torn them down . Now only the poles remained , giant uncrossed crosses marking the route he had taken . Miss Heath had removed her trained smiles and her crisp answers . A flickering hive of lights behind them was Salt Lake City . The plane floated through the air and they floated through the plane , talking , talking , talking.  --  " The wonderful thing about your scenes was the way they not only mirrored but seemed to make a comment on the times . The episode in High Noon for instance , where Ted takes Lenoreto the stag party dressed as a boy  --  I remember writing a theme on that for American Lit .

If men went to stag parties , by God , she 'd put on a tuxedo and go along with them . I think that 's what real literature should be , entertaining and convincing as contemporary reporting and yet with overtonesof interpretation . " Halliday repressed a giggle . There was a lot of sound poetry in slang . Oiled for instance . He was getting a little oiled . There was less friction in him . Ideas slid back and forth across one another more smoothly . Just went to show you , you could n't always follow the book . The book said stay strictly on the wagon . Only way to feel well and get your work done . But a few squirts of oil took the squeaks out of the old body , made for greater flexibility , easier to face chores like Love on Ice .. . Shep watched Halliday 's face crease into a relaxed smile for the first time . " . . . give me more credit than I deserve . Never thought of that stag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really happened to Jere and me " ( he groped to remember  --  had he mentioned Jere to this boy before ? ) . " just after we came back from Europe the first time . We 'd decided to do everything together  --  none o ' this **27;4909;TOOLONG business . Shep105was tall , long-legged , no hips , in my clothes with her hair combed back she could 've been Wally Reid 's double . Another time we did it at a party and someone asked Jere to come outside and fight for flirting with his wife . We had some wonderful laughs . " Shep was trying to disentangle Jere from the Halliday heroines . Had she finally made a dull marriage for security like Wilma in Friends and Foes ? Or had she taken an overdose of sleeping pills like Lenore in High Noon ? Had she been a warmheartedflapper with nympho tendencies like Wilma or a brilliant , self-destroying drinker like Lenore ? Had n't he heard something , somewhere about Jere 's having escaped from a home for alcoholics in New York City ( had she slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had she gone on to the Stork in a nightgown so fancy it passed for an evening dress ? ) or was that just a snatch of fiction he had read somewhere ? " . . . Jere was always crazy about speed . We brought a Daimlerback from Europe and Jere used to drive it down Park Avenuesixty miles an hour . If a cop caught up with her she 'd listen to the whole j'accuse and then produce her honorary captain 's badge . " " Then Jere was really the model for Georgette ? " " Oh , you remember that story ? " " I was n't giving you a Hollywood snow job . I told you I 've read everything you 've written . Even that little travel book on Hollywood . " " Not the poems . Not the little chapbook I published at Har-vard ? " " Juvenal ? Yup , that too . " " Oh , my God . I was a lousy poet . Juvenal . I thought that was so goddam clever . The stage when a young bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a satirical Roman poet . " " I remember it well . I even remember it was dedicated to Beatrice . " " You frighten me . Beatrice Vining . I was engaged to her when I went overseas . A real aristocratic beauty . A breathlessly lovely girl . " He sounded that familiar philosophic monosyllable : " Hmnn . Beatrice 's eldest daughter came out last year . Beatrice is stillp106lovely-looking , with white hair like Billie Dove 's , and schoolgirlcomplexion . Lady of the old school . Do n't seem to breed them so gracious any more . " Vocabulary was running over . He had the feeling that talking , talking , talking would keep the wolf away from his door . No , he did n't mean that , was it the river away from his door . No , no , keep the skeleton in the closet , the nose to the grindstone  --  oh , he knew what he meant but he could n't find the words . Must be getting tired when he could n't find words . Wine made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always said sleep on a plane or a train was no sleep at all , just a brief , uneasy numbing of his consciousness . He 'd rather stay awake .. . " ... I remember one time " ( for some reason he was saying this ) " Jere and I tried to see how long we could stay up . It was in the dance-marathon days and we wanted to see if we could stay up that long . On the morning of the fourth day we thought it might revive us if we went swimming . So we drove out of town to the first body of water we could find and got arrested for swimming in a reservoir . " He was traveling along the singing wires , consciously or unconsciouslyleaving out the poles . His was the generation that discovered it had a sub-conscious . " I know the trouble with you , " Jere had turned on a rival , " you 're repressed . " Could one have said anything more crushing then ? " Jere was the most unrepressed creature I ever knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man  --  must be careful of him , he listened too well . ) " She was a one-woman assault on Puritanism . I think she started shocking her parents when she was three . Never really remembered her mother . Her father was strict Episcopalian . Awfully rich . She used to say We hated each other on sight . He said I bit his hand before I was a year old . ' When she was sixteen she picketed with a bunch of suffragettesoutside his house on Fifth Avenue . That 's when he packed her off to Europe . One time at a cocktail party my publishersgave for me one of those Helen Hokinson literary ladies gushed over Jere . It must be simply fascinating to live with a famous author . I 'm sure you 're a great help to him in his work . ' Jere answered in a very ladylike tone , All I do is  --  . ' Itp107was a frightful thing to say . I never liked that word myself even if Jere and all my friends did . But I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old busybody . " Jere could always get away with those words , in three or four languages . Somehow they never seemed indecent with her . She was just speaking her mind in a simple and direct way . She could use those words in erotic poetry for instance and make you like it . She was as high-strung and high-spirited as a finely bred show horse . She did n't want anyone to put a bit in her mouth . That 's why she kept moving away from me to other  --  interests . " Inquisitive as Shep was about everything concerning Halliday , he felt for the first time a certain reluctance to listen . It was surprising , after all their years of unrest and separation , to find Halliday 's wound at losing Jere still so sensitive . He could not seem to mention her without paying court to her . There was always a silent I-love-you attached to the mention of her name . It was , Shep felt , private talk , of impressions locked away in a vault with fading souvenirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like a trespasser , digging into Halliday 's past . But Shep exaggerated . Actually Halliday was skillfully censoringout all the strain and stress , all the mess and the ugliness . He was sailing along the singing wires : " Going to a party in the Village one night we got a hansom in front of the Plaza and Jere made the old cabby ride inside so she should sit up on the high jump seat behind . When we got there we took the old driver in with us . It started to rain and Jere burst into tears because the poor old nag was getting wet . She finally took two blankets off one of the beds to wrap around the poor creature . Neglected animals always broke her heart . She was forever picking up stray cats and dogs because they looked so hungry  --  and half the time forgot to feed them . People thought she was hard and cynical but she was really a sloppy sentimentalistin an age when sentiment was out of fashion . . . " Listening to the tales of escapade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been if they tried those stunts in the Thirties . In fact he had once seen a girl take off her clothes as the early morning climax to a fraternity house party and itp108had seemed to him merely a dizzy blonde hangover from an era of exhibitionists . Not in a million years could he imagine Sara doing any of these things , and if she tried he would have pinned her ears back . But , Shep decided in the words of the old joke , on Jere it looked good . In their own setting , their frivolous little acts of escape took on a romantic glow Shep could not help enjoying vicariously . There were no hills or valleys or fields or cities or state lines beneath them . In an uncanny vacuum of darkness they roared eastward . For these few hours they were freed from the landmassthat claimed them . The combination of words and wine is an ancient and delicious one . Between them time folds into itself accordion-wise . Somehow , as the first pale shafts began to streak the eastern sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reeling from topic to topic , had fixed on the point of departure between the writer who succeeds only in catching the moment and the artist who relates the particular moment to the universal " like Eliot . Maybe you 'd call him a capitalist lackey , a clerical apologist , a bootlicking Anglophile or worse . But a hundredyears from now will people remember that he was a monarchistand that the New Masses sneered at him or that he wrote lines likeApril is the cruellest month , breeding Lilacs out of the dead land , mixing Memory and desire , stirringDull roots with spring rain . With his eyes closed , remembering in a sort of trance , he did not stop until he had remembered it all , right down to the mysterious codaDatta . Dayadhvam . Damyata Shantih shantih shantihFor fully half a minute after he had finished his eyes remainedclosed , though whether in reverence or champagne drowse , Shep could not be sure.  |p109Then  Halliday said , " Jere and I used to be able to start anywhereand recite alternate lines to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in years . Never thought I 'd remember it . " " Datta . Dayadhvam . Damyata . Shantih shantih shantih , " he repeated childishly . Faint grays and pale blues , those anemic heralds of dawn , were gradually lighting the plane 's interior . " What time is it ? " Halliday groped for the old-fashioned watch he carried in his vest pocket . " Two-thirty . " " It 's five-thirty , " Shep said . " You have n't set your watch ahead . " " I seem to be living in the past . " Halliday smiled . " Have we been talking all night ? " In the cheerless morning light Halliday looked gray and gaunt . An overnight stubble was beginning to roughen the exceptionalsmoothness of his face . It was not the kind of face to which a beard is becoming , Shep thought . Essentially boyish and delicately made , it was a face for starched white collars and fresh toilet . " It 's been a wonderful night for me , " Shep said . " But I hope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You might as well start calling me Manley . After all the things I 'm afraid I told you , you know me too well to keep up these formalities . " The second bottle of Mumm 's had run dry hours ago and the effects were wearing off . As if irritated by an itch that ca n't be located and has no physical cause , Halliday 's sense of guilt made him think he had been more revealing than he had been . " You know , it 's strange , Shep , in this one night I think I 've talked to you about more of the things I really think about than I have with my son in his entire life . " Shep glowed with the compliment . His own father had been a devoted parent until Shep began to rebel against the car-rental business . Then had come the years of bitter battles over ways of life and politics , interspersed with periods of uneasy truce . " Does Douglas show any signs of wanting to write ? " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , he was con/fiding in young Stearns "  --  Douglas has an excellent mind . He 's even written a few poems in the Lawrenceville Lit I 'm rather proud of . But Douglas is an incorrigible snob . He lives for the New York holiday parties and the invitations to Newport . Of course I realize I was just as bad when I came East from Kansas City in 1913 . It 's only in the last few years I 've gotten over brooding about my failure to make the Racquet Club . But at least I sublimated my snobbishness in my work . That scene in the Racquet Club in High Noon , for instance . I made my snobbishness pay off , you might say . " " Would you have liked Douglas to become a writer ? " " I 'm not sure . Rationally , no . It 's really an awful curse to wish on anybody  --  from the day you begin you never completely relaxagain . Right this second , to be very , very frank , I 'm thinkinghow I might use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , middle-class radical . Even those years I threw away , when the book reviewers were giving me up , I was always worrying about writing , wishing I could find the way to get started again and wanting to push on beyond where I had been . This morning , for instance , when I should be thinking about your story  --  we 'll work that out yet , do n't worry  --  I keep thinking about my new book  --  how I 've got to make it the most thought-out , the most honest piece of work I 've done . But to get back to Douglas . Emotionally I 've got to admit what a kick it gave me to see those things of his in the Lawrenceville magazine . The whole process of parenthood is completely irrational anyway . Just when you begin to think you 're a completely civilized man , you find all kinds of horrid , primitive things popping out of you . You feel an absurd pride when your son turns out to look like you . And another savage shot-in-the-arm when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be anything he wants as long as he 's happy , but secretly your ego is fattened when he chooses your profession . So I suppose you might say I 'm disappointed in Douglas . Even though I know damn well the way he 's turning out is mostly my fault . When he was seven I enrolled him at Lawrenceville . I made him feel he could never be a gentleman if he was n't a graduate of Princeton , Harvard or Yale and didn'tp111date approved daughters of approved Eastern families . I suppose I passed on to him all the shabby insecurity of a Kansas City parvenu . So I should hardly blame him for not finding out what it took me at least thirty-five years and a lot of unhealed wounds to discover . " " Mr. Halli  --  Manley , if Douglas did turn out to be a writer , what would be the main things you 'd want to tell him ? " Halliday spoke seriously , a trifle pompously . " The first thing I 'd talk about would be self-dedication . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none of the American by-products , fame , money , adulation , glamorous living , is the only permanent reward . I 'd try to teach him not to lose his way . " He paused so long that Shep thought he had finished . But finally he went on , with sudden harshness : " If I had only followedthat brilliant advice fifteen years ago , I would n't be having to think up the plot for a Hollywood campus musical this morning . " His face , turned to the window again , was silhouetted against the grim morning light . Prompted by Manley 's words , Shep saw things in that face he had not seen before . He saw pain pulling it taut . He saw the erosion of anxiety scarring it with deep lines . He saw fatigue , not the natural exhaustion of a day and night without sleep but a profound lassitude of body and mind . And he saw , too , a refusal to surrender . If it were not quite possible for Shep to read all these things into Halliday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the thoughts that crossed his mind as he watched the older man . A moment too late , Halliday seemed to realize how his confessionalreference to their movie job might discourage Shep . For now he turned back to him with an unconvincing cheerfulness . " Do n't worry , baby , we 'll lick this movie . After all , we 're still a couple of craftsmen , are n't we ? " Miss Dawson , who had replaced Miss Heath at Kansas City , and who could easily have been her twin sister , came up with orange juice , a too-hearty good morning and the promise of hot coffee.  | " Morning , you old stay-ups . " Diana at five thousand feet servingcanned orange juice in Lily cups . " You can see the New York skyline if you look real hard . " They both turned obediently . There it was , shrouded in wintermist . " It 's always an amazing sight , " Shep intruded on Halliday 's thoughts . " Right now does n't it look like a phantom city floatingabove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was staring at the dim turrets of the distant city . Once he had been able to think of it as his city . It was all one massive temple built in worship of Success . You brought to its altars your best-sellers , your Wall Street killings , your home-run records , your golden voice , your famous face . And the greedy gods of Success rewarded you , temporarily , with headwaiters who knew your name , with hotel managers who reserved special suites for you , with columnists who recorded your wit , with envious onlookers , with fellowcelebritiesfor friends . Halliday was remembering the times he had come to New York in triumph . But commit the unforgivable sin of failure , of letting your batting average or your reputation slump and the temple doors slammed in your face . Headwaiters who guarded them looked the other way . The gods of Manhattan were more ruthless than Jehovah . On his last visit , Halliday had stayed in his third-class hotel room and eaten fig newtons . He could not call his publishersbecause he had needled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised manuscript . He could not go to the Algonquin or " 21 " or the Plaza because he had never answered their requests to pay his bills . He could n't call his old friend Burt Seixas because he felt self-conscious about owing Burt two thousand he knew Burt could use . At least five other friends had to be ignored for the same reason . He had been afraid to linger in the lobby for fear some enterprising sob-sister would track him down for one of those riches-to-rags humaninterestyarns . He even had taken the precaution of registering at a dingy hotel under another name . On that last visit , he had hidden away in a hole in the wall on a nondescript side street . He had not really been in New York at all.  |p113Now  the early morning mist was lifting . The skyline , still a great many miles away , rose up like a giant battlement . Somewhere behind that formidable barricade of stone and steel , Jere slept . The roar of propellers sent thunder bowling along into the morning . Datta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boy ! " Shep was saying happily , " whatta city ! "  |p114The  white tile of the Holland Tunnel rolled past them as the airline 's black limousine raced through the enormous artery feedingthe heart of the city . Finally they burst out into the open , into the swarming labyrinth of downtown Manhattan . There were the trucks , the cops , the bars , the stores , the cabs , the reckless pedestrians pickingholes through traffic like shabby Albie Booths . There were fruit , all colors , vegetables , hock shops , Italians , Jews and the global hustle of the water front . Here the bright boys and the smart girls from the provinces come to make their fortunes ; here grimy , overcrowded streets offer frantic hospitality to refugees from German bullyboys , Irish famine , Balkan wars , Italian poverty . Bagdad and Rome and Paris and London had had it once , but it was all here now , it was all here , from the Stock Exchange to the pushcart market , from Young and Rubicam and millions of dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of a dollar . It was all here now , the money and the power and the brains they employ and their great army of camp followerscatching the crumbs from the tables of Voisin and " 21 " ; and another world that lived richly without wealth at the New School and the New Friends of Music and the old-film programs of the Museum of Modern Art ; and another by-far-the-largest world rushing back and forth across the island , punch-in punchout , spiced-ham sandwich and a cupa coffee , knocking themselves or one another out simply in order to exist in one of the cramped compartments of the Great Hive . As they rushed uptownalong the elevated express lane , Shep felt a resurgence of energy . As an eye-opener , this city of New York was a bagful of benzedrine . But Manley lay with his head back on the seat , his eyes closed . His body felt twitchy with exhaustion and from time to time hep115slipped into uneasy fits of sleep , some no longer than a few seconds , from which he kept wrenching himself desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through midtown traffic , the screeching stop in front of the Waldorf , the bustling proximity of Shep Stearns , the sense of beingpiloted around the outer circle of the lobby 's vortex . Then a rushing upward through the elevator shaft , an opening of doors and other bits of stylized service from the bellboy , the business of a few coins changing hands ; they were deposited in their suite overlooking Park Avenue , each with his own bedroom opening on a central living room . Shep tossed his coat toward the couch but it slipped off and he let it lie there . " I 'll probably collapse in about five minutes , but I 'm feeling great all of a sudden  --  all hopped up . How you feel , Manley ? " " Like a million dollars , " Halliday said slowly , " in old Spanish doubloons buried ten feet underground . " They withdrew to their respective bathrooms . Shep , in an effusionof pent-up vitality , performed some deep knee bends and , a few years out of top condition , was gratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calisthenics were interrupted by a call that warbled uneasily across the suite : " Shep  --  could you come here a minute ? " Shep found Halliday in the bathroom , sitting on the edge of the tub . He was wearing one-piece BVD 's , the old-fashioned kind Shep had never seen in use . His legs looked spindly , his arms were unmuscular and very white and his knees were bony as a small child 's whose legs are growing too fast . On his left thigh was a red line where the needle had slipped and scratched his skin . " I hate to ask you , but would you do this damn thing for me ? " Halliday 's voice went a little strident with self-consciousness . Shep was squeamish about taking the hypodermic needle . He did n't have much heart for these things . " I 've always been lousy at it . " Embarrassment kept Halliday talking . " Broke the needle off in my leg once . Been sort of edgy about it ever since . "  |p116Feeling  a little sick , Shep plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these old chassis in on new models . " Shep did n't answer . He was still a little faint from the business of the needle . He felt a genuine compassion for Halliday 's discomfort , but a more basic reaction resented the older man 's flaw . If he was n't up to the trip why had n't he said so in Milgrim 's office ? In Hollywood it had occurred to Halliday : no matter how nice a young man is , inevitably there must be times when an older man will begrudge him his youth . And now Shep was thinking : no matter how much he understands and makes allowances for him , a young man in good health ca n't help despising , at times , an older man who is ailing . " You must be tired as hell , " Shep said . " We were a couple of dopes to stay up all night . " Damn it , do n't patronize me , Halliday thought . It is the one thing I can not bear . " I suppose a little sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halliday said . " I think I 'll try to nap for an hour or so . " He stretched out on the bed and closed his eyes , but the intensewinter light streaming through the ineffectual shades penetratedhis twitching eyelids . He rose and drew the curtains . For a moment he thought he had created the atmosphere of sleep . But then , intensified as if by some inner amplifier , he heard the cacophony of the avenue below : the rhythmic a-slosh a-slosh a-slosh of the wheels turning on the melting snow , the **26;4938;TOOLONG of that inevitable loose chain , the constanthonking of irritable cab-drivers , the persistent whistle of the doormen . He rose again , groped in his pockets and found some cotton pellets Miss Heath had given him on the plane . Then , with his ears plugged and his head pressed down into the pillow , he tried again . But the elimination of outer distractions only succeeded in intensifying the inner ones . The highlights of this pleasure town pinwheeled in his brain . Where was he now , 50th and Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ? Every time they threw something , they won a prize . One was so small you could n't see it at all but the other had won many prizes . Jere and her limericks . Jere just a few blocks away . He wanted to see her and he did n't want to seep117her and  --  once they had had to be separated for a week when he went home to his mother 's deathbed . He had called her from Kansas City three times a day and each time they had said all the same things over again and at the end of every call he had hung up with the same egomaniacal conviction that no two peoplecould have felt this , no not this , not this exquisite meeting and melting of minds and bodies and dreams . And now , a few years later  --  he could come to town and not even call her . And there she was , right around the corner . He could be there in five minutes . . . but there was no sleep at the end of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ann was one of the few people whose judgment of others he trusted . She could make cool judgments without emotional prejudice . Unusual talent . Most people like to think they have it . Funny thing was Jere 's transparently subjective judgments . If she did n't like a certain girl it meant the girl had an eye out for him . She was usually right . If she said she did n't like a man , Manley would guess . she was physically attracted to him . He was usually right . " The trouble with you , Jere , " he remembered saying once , " is that you were n't content just to drink from the Fountain of Youth . You kept leaning over to see your own image in it until you fell in and almost drowned . " " I was n't leaning in to see myself , " he remembered Jere 's saying , " I was trying to fish you out . " This is no way to take a nap . He had to get some rest . That trembling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I 'll put myself to sleep  --  he thought of it as a joke  --  I ' 11 think about our picture . Once upon a time there was a college boy who invited a waitress out of a diner to a Webster house party week-end etcetera and etcetera and somehow or other she becomes the Queen of the Mardi Gras . Could we freshen it up with a little satire on high-pressure advertising ? Each of two rival cosmetic companies wants its model to become Queen . They try to rig the election . I know , its rank , but anyway I 'm thinking about it . Shep ca n't look at me with those big brown calf 's eyes and beg me to have a try at it . Oh , well , if I 'm doing this , I might as well stay up and talk to him , I 'm not getting any rest anyway.  |p118He  went back to the bathroom , took out a benzedrine tablet and then , with a sense of Ann 's restraining hand on his shoulder , broke it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had traveled in than to unpack the ones Ann had folded into the large case . There had been other times in New York when he had felt such devotion to the creases in his pants that he would not have thought of wearing the same suit twice without pressing . But in recent years he had lost nearly all sense of externals . Perhaps the swing of the pendulum had been too extreme in each direction . Unless Ann removed it he would keep putting on the same shirt for days simply because that was less trouble than taking the pins out of a new one . Entering the sitting room , he found Shep in his bathrobe hunched over the desk , writing in pencil . " Got our script finished ? " He realized he sounded like AI Harper . Shep grinned . " I thought it might help us get started if we made a list of all the ideas we 've had so far . " " Do n't forget the one with Jeanette MacDonald as Dizzy ' Dean . " Shep stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Halliday directly . But he talked up as if he were by himself , rehearsing lines for a play . " Manley , I know it 's easy to kid this thing . Most the time I feel like doing it too . But after all , we accepted the job . Sooner or later we 'll have to  --  roll or give up the dice . " Shep had all the makings of a hack , Halliday thought rebelliously . He had the hack 's conscientiousness , the hack 's ability to divide his imagination into watertight compartments . And at the same time he thought  --  that is n't quite fair . The boy is right . It is a job of work I 'm accepting money for . He himself had been critical of these Hollywood writers who sign long-term contracts and then save their best lines to excoriate the sources of their income . Like any dishonesty pushed to the extremes of logical conclusion , this was a form of insanity . He preferred Shep 's attitude . At least the young man professed an honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new attitude , replacing the cynicismand self-contempt of the writers of his generation who hadp119gone out for a soft touch and had developed a taste and finally an insatiable appetite for soft touches . " Shep , you 're right . Let 's pitch in and solve this thing . " He sat down as if he meant business . " This is where we 'll lick our story . A hotel room . No personality . No associations . The traditional refuge of harassed playwrights , suicides , and other desperate men . " For half an hour or so the room had an atmosphere of righteouslabor . As a token of honest effort , Halliday presented his cosmetic advertising idea . It was a small bone to a hungry dog and Shep leapt at it and began to run . The cosmetics model goes up to Webster just to win the Mardi Gras title . Her date , the ski captain , heads the Mardi Gras committee . She vamps him shamelessly all week-end to pull the necessary strings that win the title for her . When he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having fallen for her . Then , in the finals of the ski-jump , he 's injured . The model , who has been falling in love with him all the time , of course , rushes to his side . Somehow all the commercial big city dross has been washed away by the crisp mountain air and the freshly fallen snow .. . " By God , I think we have it ! " The anti-business angle even began to embellish it with " honesty " in Shep 's mind . " Would the boy turn on the girl merely because she was a model for Helena Rubinstein ? " Halliday asked . " Maybe we should make that a little stronger . She 's not only a model but the mistress of the sales manager . He 's the real prince of darkness in the piece . He 's come up to Webster as a kind of Iago . He 's a typical product of our age , everything reduced to public relations ' in quotes . He still dreams of retiring to the country club with five million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bought a seat on the Exchange when he was twentysixand shot himself in the men 's room of the Exchange when he was thirty-three ... " This time Shep 's sturdy presence blocked Halliday 's trap-door exit to the past . Only a few hours before Shep had been fascinatedwith Halliday 's double sense of time . He did not go back to the past , he carried it with him . But now Shep had begun to be on the lookout for these nostalgic cut-backs . He be/gan to draw a line between the Manley Halliday whose works had so impressed him and the middle-aged collaborator who could not seem to differentiate between plot analysis and reminiscences . " This sales manager , " Shep prompted . " You may have something there . He 's a kind of shadow over the week-end . Mmm , how about this ? As the climax to his advertising campaign the sales manager wants to stage a mock marriage . You know , just pictures for a full-page magazine lay-out . Well , it 's after the skijumpinjury  --  this would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip away and what the sales manager believes to be a mock marriage is actually a real one ... " Shep 's enthusiasm , self-cranked and back-firing like a hopped-up Ford , struck a rubber wall of silence and bounced back . Halliday gave him a funny look . Then he said : " Nize baby , et op all de ice . " " What  --  what 's that , Manley ? " " When we did n't like people that 's what we always used to do  --  answer ' em in Nize Baby talk . " For the first time since they met Shep was n't sure he was goingto like Manley Halliday . " I see , " he said . But he did n't . His vision hopelessly normal , he could not see around corners . As soon as Halliday saw the look on Shep 's face he hastened to explain . " Oh , my goodness . I did n't mean that . I like you . I like you very much . In fact , you 're the first person I 've liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . No , good God , Shep , I did n't mean you . I was talking back to the story , to this ogre of commerce I invented . " " I thought he might put some life into the story , " Shep held on . " He would . But the wrong kind . I suppose you could make a real character out of him if you went ahead and developed him  --  gave him some shading . So he is n't just a cipher in a morality play . But is n't he really an extraneous element ? There 's an unwholesomequality about him that leaves an ugly stain on the picture . After all , a college house party is a romantic time . It should be a gay , pretty , frothy picture . There should be a kind of innocence about it , a youthful glow ... "  |p121She|p  sank down into the couch . " Right now I feel about as glowing as a dead fish . " Halliday said : " Was I making sounds like a producer ? " Shep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milgrim him-self . " " There 's something about the movies that brings out these damn generalizations in you . You never think of doing that about a work of fiction . You know who your people are and you track them down specifically one by one . " " Manley , that 's what we 've got to do , get back to characters , same as if you were writing a book . " " But the trouble is , a book is something that starts inside of you . You work from the inside out . You do n't have to sit down and mechanically invent characters and situations . They 're all there , ready to be released . A movie is just the opposite . It does n't start inside anybody . Where was Love on Ice conceived , for instance ? Certainly not inside Shep Stearns , though I 'm sure you could write your own college story . Not even inside Victor Milgrim . It 's an orphan child born of artificial insemination on a box-office counter . " At another time Shep might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be coming in on the next plane . He began to wonder if they were up ( or down ) to the assignment . He was pretty sure any reliable Hollywood hack would have had it in the bag by now . It was mainly a question of adjustingone 's aim . When Halliday was n't shooting way beyond the target , he was firing right into the ground at his feet . " Christ , I do n't know , " Shep said . " This thing 's beginning to drive me nuts . Maybe we should go back and take a look at that waitress line again . There is a certain human interest appeal in a waitress  --  a completely ordinary counter girl  --  competing against those Wellesley and Vassar debs . " " Completely ordinary except that she 's played by Ginger Rogers . " " O.K. Ginger Rogers . Ginger is n't a bad actress . She could play a working-class girl . " " I see . You want a proletarian heroine , Shep . A pretty little union member . None of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor boy has the waitress up , the rich roommate has the Vassar girl , and it 's Vassar who turns out to be the Marxist . At least that would be more authentic . So the Vassar girl falls in love with the boy who 's working his way through and the waitress , who 's a good little opportunist , sets her sights for the rich boy . Why , that rather appeals to me . " Shep had a desperate impulse . It was something he had n't done since a peerade to Worcester for the big game with Holy Cross . He was going to have a mid-day shot . " I think I could use a drink , " he said suddenly . " How about you ? " Use a drink ! Yes , he could use one all right . Champagne had saved the night . Now he could use something to get him through the day . Christ , if ever a man had a good excuse . Uh-uh . Self-pity Halliday . Damn it , would he go to pieces the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would . " No , thanks , Shep . I 'd rather not . But you go ahead . " He hoped Shep would decide not to drink alone , but Shep was jittery and at the same time  --  perhaps still under the stimulusof finding himself with Manley Halliday  --  expansive . It was still a sort of spree , this being flown across a continent to a great hotel to work on a story with Manley Halliday . Halliday was pleased with his own moral strength in rejectingthe drink . But he was a little dismayed when he heard Shep order a bottle of Ballantine 's . " Might as well have it in the room , " Shep had said casually . Halliday nodded and tried to smile , but he was frightened . " Tell him to bring me a pitcher of ice water . " What day was this ? Only Friday ? And they would n't be going back till Tuesday . Tuesday was a precipitous height rising above him . And he would have to climb all the way . The young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But supposing he should lose his footing and slip , dragging the young man down ? A long way to fall . Mountain-climbing had always seemed to him a tedious and needlessly hazardous excuse for sport . Tobogganing and skiing had been his speed . He and Jere liked to be carried up and to swoosh down . Together he and Shep made another pedestrian circle around the stubborn walls of the story . The waiter appeared with thep123Ballantine 's , soda and ice . " Gut morning , chentleman , " he greeted them and both of them could feel his obsequiousness filling the room . Halliday glared at the intruder . " The ice water ? " " Ach ! Ice vatter . I haf forgotten zer vatter . " " Yah . Zer vatter , " Halliday mocked . Shep frowned . The waiter looked unhappy . " From zer zink maybe . . . " he began hopefully . " I want a pitcher of water , " Halliday said sharply . " And mach schnell . " More like a rabbit than the walrus he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Shep was appalled and went into action . " The poor guy . I always feel sorry for waiters . " " I feel sorrier for writers . Waiters in big hotels probably make more money than you do . They 're the trickiest people in the world , with the possible exception of Hungarians . And when you get the two together you 've got the New Machiavelli . Shep , I 'm going to have to get you over this ridiculous notion of sentimentalizing everybody . Most of us are swine . But when it comes to German waiters in big hotels , I tell you there are no exceptions . " Shep poured himself a big one and held up the bottle as an invitation . " I 'll get you some water from the bathroom . " " Well . . . " Desire and reason staged a brief , unequal tug-ofwar. " . . . a very , very short one . " Ah , he had a glass in his hand again . It had happened so easily . He was hardly aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even before the touch of the rim to his lips , the fumes whispered relax and promised euphoria . He drank thirstily . Shep had taken him too literally . It was good but not strong enough . The waiter arrived with the pitcher . Manley regarded him slyly . " How long have you been in this country , Adolph ? " The waiter looked miserable . " Excuse me , pleece . My name iss not Adolph . It is Yoseph. "  | " You would n't be ashamed to be called after your leader , though , would you ? " Manley was questioning him with theatrical severity , as if he were playing some official role , an FBI man perhaps . Watching the waiter redden , Shep felt miserable for all of them . " He iss not my leader , zer . I am American Zitizen . " " So is Fritz Kuhn . But I know you people . Ein Fuhrer . Ein Volk . Ein Staat . " The waiter 's face screwed up as if ready to burst into tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , I am gut Zitizen . " Manley poured himself a second drink . He poured it recklessly , without measuring . Shep watched uneasily . It hardly seemed possible that Manley could be in the bag , and yet there was an unfamiliar edge to his voice , a combative look in his eye . And see how his hand trembled when he tried to hold the lip of the bottle to his glass . Of course that could be merely fatigue on top of illness . But these wild things he was saying : " Tell me the truth , Yoseph , you felt pretty proud of yourself the day your schone Knaben goose-stepped into the Rhineland , did n't you ? " The waiter 's eyes rolled toward Shep . " Chentleman , pleece . " He was trying to edge his way out . " If you zhould vish somet'ingmore ... " But Manley would not , perhaps he could not , let go . " Our country 's too soft . Like Athens , we 've got to be destroyed . When we let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big hotel like this , a gold-mine for espionage . . . And who thinks to notice a waiter ? They 're like part of the furnishings ... " This was too much even for Joseph 's habitual docility and he broke into an emotional protest , an outburst of anger choked by shrill self-pity . " Nein , nein , das ist nicht water  --  " In his excitement , after sixteen years he could hardly remember his English . " Ich bin  --  I am not spy . I gut American Zitizen . My zon Hans has four months already in the American Army . You haf no right to say spy of gut American Zitizen. "  | " All right , all right , Joe , he was only kidding . Beat it , forget about it , " Shep said . Joseph retreated behind a rear-guard defense of muttered denial . Shep looked at Manley carefully . What he saw was deceiving . Manley certainly did not look as far gone as he sounded . " Manley , I hate to say this , but  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why  --  what did I do ? " He was really bewildered . " Picking on that poor guy like that . Sure I 'm all for the Nazi boycott but we ca n't start baiting every German we meet . Next thing you know you 'll be kicking dachshunds . " " Oh , my God  --  is that the way it looked ? " It was slightly ludicrous the way he lowered his head . The small boy scolded by his father . " Lord , baby , you 're right . I guess that was a wet thing to do . " He jumped to his feet . Shep was still watching him carefully , wondering what he was going to do next . Manley ran across the room to the corridor door . " Where are you going ? " " Catch the waiter . ' pologize . I 'll give him some money . " Shep tossed his drink down and paced the room nervously . In a few moments Manley was back . He was no longer a member of counter-intelligence . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeling almost too sober , Shep built himself another drink . He hesitated to freshen Manley 's . But afraid to patronize him again , he said how about another . " No , thank you , " Manley said . The business of the waiter had frightened him too . Just ca n't drink any more . Not since I was dealcoholized . Got to be careful now . Damned careful . Shep was trying to talk story again . " We 've got to bear down now , Manley . Jesus , Milgrim will be on our necks any minute . " The story . The waitress . The roommates . The misunderstanding . The ski finale . The big clinch . Manley stood at the window , thinking of the city. - " What if the waitress had a baby ? " " What ? "  |p126He  did n't have to look around to see the annoyance in Shep 's face . " I see her on an ice floe with her baby . The ice is beginning to crack . The Webster skier comes by and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shep could n't think of anything to say . He stared morosely into his glass . " I was just trying to get away from all the generalizing , " Manley tried to bridge the silence . " Trying to think up a good movie scene . " Is he kidding me ? Is he drunk ? Is he out of his mind ? Shep felt himself being hemmed in by terrible alternatives . For the first time since they left , he saw the gargoyle face of fiasco grinningdown at them . " Maybe we should both go douse our heads under a cold shower , Manley . And try a fresh start in half an hour . " It was the most tactful reprimand he could summon . The willfulboy in Halliday seemed to recognize it for what it was . For he answered , " Go ahead , you shower if you like . I think I 'll catch a breath of fresh air . Meet you back here in half an hour or so . " " All right  --  " For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . This was the seventeenth consecutivehour without sleep , without rest from each other . "  --  but do n't get lost , Manley . We 've got to get our lumps in on this damned story this afternoon . " The homburg seemed to restore Manley 's dignity . The crisp " See you anon " was more in key with the **45;4966;TOOLONG of the day before yesterday . Shep said a dull s'long . He hated this feeling of nagging wife . Get home early , dear . He noted , with what seemed almost a wife 's loving disapproval , how Manley staggered slightly on his way to the elevator . As soon as Manley reached the sidewalk the winter air took care of that heavy feeling behind his eyes . For the first time all day he felt New York , the rush of cabs , the correct doorman , the Park Avenue wives chic and aging in their furs , the beauti/ful blue poodle in the arms of the beautiful blonde girl on the arm of a dapper fifty-year-old Park Avenue blade . For just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , absurdly , boyishly free . Just as on the day he had come down from school to meet Mother and her train had been late . That was one of his first memories of the luxury of time that does not have to be accounted for . Sometimes he wondered if all luxuries could not be reduced to this single formula . For an hour or so he would be free of World-Wide Pictures , of Victor Milgrim , of Shep Stearns , of Hollywood , of responsibility . He took a malicious , vengeful glee in throwing the young man into the pot . It was only when he turned off Park Avenue toward the East River that he realized where he was going . His need to see her had been compulsive from the moment of arrival . Even though he was quite sure of what was ahead , a vestigial , irremovable romanticism hurried him on . His mind 's eye , incurably bifocal , could never stop searching for the fairy-tale maiden who made his young manhood a time of bewitchment , when springtime was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum of sunlight , twilight , candlelight and dawn.  |p128Manley  's eyes searched along the apartment-house roster : Keyes , Abrahms , Winsch-Barry , de Martino , Wilder-Halliday . There it was , just as in the early days when Jere had clung so desperately to her maiden name . Jere Wilder . She used to love to write it in an exotic flourish over and over again , covering phone books , walls , message pads , tablecloths . Horribly brought up , he 'd say jestingly , meaning every word of it . In the white sands of a dozen watering places : Jere Wilder . Sometimes it seemed as if God knew who was going to be named what and then created personalities to fit . Maybe it was because Shakespeare was wrong and Stein was right  --  once a rose becomes a rose never again will it smell as sweet by any other name . Jere Wilder was Jere Wilder was Jere Wilder . This had caused Manley a good deal of futile speculation : one 's name is an active factor in conditioning . Could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparative Wilder provide abnormal stimulation ? It was hardly a scientific theory . And yet  --  characteristically , Manley 's mind was half-serious  --  to take an even more obvious case , would n't there be a special incentive for a man called Strongfort to stand up to danger ? Anyway Jere loved her name ; it fitted her ; she never wanted to let go of it , and , like all impracticalpeople , she had devised a highly practical reason for posting it beside his on apartment doors and hotel registers . In touch with a number of little magazines interested in her translationof French Symbolist poets ( would he ever forget that interminable translation of Une Saison en Enter ? ) she had pointed out that they would continue to address her by her professional name , Jere Wilder . But since the divorce , with a perversity he could well understand , she had published two or three brief translations ( Harper 's Bazaar and Twice-a-Year ) underthe name of Jere Halliday . An over-intense romanticism lent consistency to these seemingly conflicting gestures . Married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morep129famous one . " I can love you better if I 'm me , " she had said one night . " I always want to be the girl you 're sneaking into your room past the desk clerk . " Now , unmarried , she had grown sentimental . Rarely affected by things as they were , accepting as real the things she made up in her head , she had become increasinglysentimental toward their marriage , imagining them to have been married in a way they never could have been . Christ , he thought bitterly , turning toward the little selfoperatingelevator ( a conveyance that always mildly alarmed him ) , it is all so beautifully simple in the beginning . And now look at us , twenty-one years later , tied up in knots like two fish lines snarled together . Flashing across the years came that crazy counterpoint of shrill toy horns , the indiscriminate kissing of strange mouths seeking partners , the brief unprecedented love of Aussie for Tommy , Tommy for Yank , Yank for poilu , enlisted man for officer that seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried along with some drunken sergeants from the 301st Tank Battalion and their mademoiselles . One of these girls , an overjoyed lady of fifteen , silly on Calvados like the rest , had thrown herself into Manley 's arms , squealing , " My cute little lieutenant , I am going to take him home with me . " The sergeant who had been counting on this privilege announcedthat he had fought his way into Brancourt and was not going to let any swivel-chair hero swipe his piece . Manley had no wish to interfere with the sergeant 's pleasures . On those occasions , twice as an undergraduate and rather more often here in France , when he had accepted women on the basis of availability , even of proximity , he had  --  what was the phrase ?  --  hated himself in the morning . ( Ah , those cliches , our emotionalshorthand . ) So , interested neither in this worldly child nor the disputatious sergeant intent on celebrating Armistice with her , he had slipped away through the crowd to the first hospitable doorway . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , cheerfully sad and sweetly familiar , Poor Butterfly , in the blossomswaiting , Poor Butterfly . . . reminding him of the show hep130and Beatrice Vining had taken in at the Hippodrome his last night in New York . They had made a night of it and when he brought her home at two-thirty , Mr. and Mrs. Vining had been understanding about it in their almost ludicrous efforts to be good sports . After all , Manley was going overseas to defend civilization , that exalted abstraction inseparable in the Vinings ' mind from the British Empire . And although he was hardly their first choice ( a dear boy , Manley , but from Kansas City and a family not even on the Priest of Pallas Ball invitation list ) , Beatrice seemed to have her heart set on him . And Beatrice had always been given everything she wanted , within reason . Out of the crowd 's reach for a moment , Manley listened to the saxophone bewailing poor butterfly 's solitary fate . Banal songs , he always thought , were the saddest songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enjoying a sense of pathos he oftencultivated , he gave himself completely to the tin-pan condolence . The mood offered him a sense of detachment . Shouting and singing and clowning and kissing anybody was the fool 's way of reversing emotions from war to peace . Manley liked parties , but more exclusive ones . Probably he would have stayed there only long enough to catch his breath until the song ended and then plunge into the crowd again to continue fighting his way toward the Cafe Continental , where Ross , Woollcott , Winterichand the rest of the S &; S'ers were supposed to be throwing a memorable brawl . But just as he turned away from the door , it was thrown open violently and two staggering doughboys appeared . They were shouting , exactly as drunken doughboys should , Finay la guerre ! Then , in a gesture completely baffling to Manley , they turned around , touched their thumbs to their noses and jeered , " Yah , ya still a bunch o ' kikes ! " Laughing uproariously at their own wit , they threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , into the howling sea of faces in the street . Through the half-open door he had seen a girl so good to look at that he could feel himself smiling . What he noticed first was the contrast of golden skin against white satin . A black satin choker adorned a long slender neck . Another black satin bandp131around her waist accentuated her slenderness . It was the waist of a girl of fifteen . Yet there was nothing fragile or pathetic about her . She was smiling at a tall , Lincolnesque , Jewish-looking soldier of whom Manley was instantly jealous . The smile emphasizedthe Asiatic cast of her eyes . Her dark hair was cut short ( something he had n't until this minute approved ) , smartly combed back except for a little fringe of bangs across her forehead . At that moment he also became an enthusiastic supporter of bangs . He was aware of marvelous bones , the fine bridge of her nose , the sweep of the jaw , and the high cheekbones . Must be one of those French Indo-Chinese girls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided . He must have been staring rudely . For suddenly his reverie was interrupted by a most unexpected gesture . She was sticking out her tongue at him . Before he could recover , the music had resumed " Oh , Johnny , oh , Johnny , how you can fight . . . " . and she was carried off lightly in the arms of the tall Jewish soldier . Then he became aware of Jewishness all round him , dark , semitic boys in khaki , and a sandy-haired , moon-faced blond-Jew sergeant wearing the proud Red-1 of the Fighting First whom a hostess called Julie . The hostesses , too , with the exception of his and one or two others , all had the ancient out-of-style beauty of the Jewess . The saxophone player was a Jew , though the drummer and pianist were Negro SOS privates and apparently the fiddle player was a French civilian . They were surprisingly good . His mind was on the girl . He took a young man 's interest in the long , slim legs , the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck unusually long but graceful and oddly becoming . Above all , her smile sparkled , There was a naughtiness about that smile that rushed a young man on . It was not the practiced and slightly cynical smile of the American coquette , the Y or Red Cross girl in Paris with whom he had become so bored . The dark pianist raised his young face from the keyboard and letting his fingers dance lightly on the melody , sang " Oh , Johnny , oh , Johnny , how you can love , oh Johnny , oh , Johnny , heavens above ... "  |p132Manley  was walking toward her . His hand dropped gently on her partner 's shoulder . " Sorry , old man . " Prom style . The tall Jewish soldier melted away . " Merci bien , mon cherie , " her words curled silkily around the head of the departing dancer . When he touched her , an unfamiliar recklessness possessed him . They moved off , miraculously together .. . The voice of the pianist filled their silence . Manley was musteringhis college French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time with Americans ) . Something in the yellow-green eyes of this fawn in white satin cued him to put aside the stock openers  --  What is your name ? Do you like Americanjazz ? Do you come here often ? Finally he decided on , " Who are you ? " He had expected the question to catch her off balance , but , behindan elfin smile , her words poured out in such a rapid flow that his college French was soon outdistanced . " J'ai de mes ancestres gaulois l'oeil bleu blanc , la cervelle etroite , et la maladresse dans la lutte . Je trouve mon habillement aussi barbare que le leur . Mais je ne beurre pas ma chevelure . " He caught something about the blue-white eye of Gallic ancestorsand finding clothes as barbarous as theirs and something that sounded like " I do not butter my hair , " but he said " Je cornprendspas . Si vous ne parleriez que plus lentement . " He translated her deliberate , mock-serious answer . " It is not important that you understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " He was always at his best in conquests that gave his mind a chance to turn a cartwheel or two . He forced his French to its farthest limits . " Perhaps you can tell me what is important . " The quartet had left Johnny for a sing-song classification of smiles . " Pleasure is important . Not just contentment but plaisir . " Her emphasis made it sound tantalizingly dangerous . " The enjoymentof beauty . The only truth . " " Ah , mademoiselle , " he could almost feel his own charm spraying from his pores , " you are much too beautiful yourself to be worrying about definitions of truth . " " Ho hum , " she exaggerated her yawn.  | " Oh , I bore you ? " She moved effortlessly in his arms . He wondered what the perfume was ; there was a scent of something fresh and growingabout her . He was lost in her . " Being told I 2m beautiful ? Why should n't it ? Every soldier who wants to use me for a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that I am beautiful . In the morning after my bath I love to admire myself in the mirror . I say to myself , How much more beautiful you are than those overweight nudes of Renoir : " He said , accepting her unconventionality for an invitation , " Perhaps I should be fortunate enough to look into your mirror some time . " She said  --  he would always remember how out of character itseemed when he still knew her so slightly  --  " Ish ka bibble . " He : " Oh , I see you 've picked up some of our slang . " She : ( in English for the first time , with an exaggerated Frenchaccent ) " Yes , zees slang is  --  how you say ?  --  very funnee for uz . " He : " Oh , you speak English ? " She : " Just what you call ze bedpillow Engleesh . " She gave him an outrageous wink . " You know uz French girls . " That was the only trouble with these girls over here , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to pluck them , they placed their choicest blossoms in your hands . " Where do you come from ? What do you do ? " " I will tell you a secret  --  if you promise not to be frightened . I am a sorceress . " Manley laughed . " An amateur sorceress , or a sorceress by trade ? " " I have a horror of all trades , " she quoted gravely , but with something behind the gravity that was laughing at him . " Masters and workers  --  base peasants all . " " Have n't I heard that somewhere before ? " " You are not a very well educated young man if you have n't . " " Before I could finish advanced French literature I dropped out of college to do some field work in mass insanity and advancedannihilation . " " At least you recognize French literature . That was written by  --  my husband . "  | " Oh . " He would not have believed , five minutes before , that such an admission from the lips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Of course , over here , it was n't the obstacle it would have been in America . There might still be room for an ami . The musicians , running out of smiles at last , had momentarily subsided . Two soldiers , on their way out , grinned at her familiarly . " S'long , Jere . Happy Armistice . " " ' Night , Sid . Come back soon , Leo . " Manley stared . " You 're not French at all ! " Manley thought she looked like a half-grown cat when she smiled . " Were you really fooled ? Oh , I love to fool people . " Manley 's impressions did a rapid somersault . A moment before she had been a strange French girl . Now she seemed like a young American . " What sort of place is this anyway ? Looks like a reunion of the Twelve Tribes . " " You mean you do n't even know where you are ? The clubhouseof the Jewish Welfare Board . " He heard another hollow oh echoing from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  are you Jewish ? " She answered him gaily . " Of course . My name is Jere Wild-berg . " Jere Wildberg . He was afraid the disappointment would show on his face . In these few seconds he had to improvise a new setting . Her father was probably a wealthy clothing manufacturer who could send her to the best schools , well , almost the best . His name was undoubtedly Jerome Wildberg . He really had wanted a boy to take over the business but had thought it would be cute to name her Jere . " Whatsa matta , you did n't take me for a shicksa , didja ? " She was laughing at him . It was waltz time now and the musicians , who seemed to know all the new ones , started up with Will You Remember ? Jewish , or not , Manley conceded , she was something to look at . And there was a quickness in her , an imaginativeness , a streak of non-conformity , a high-keyed vitality new to him . Wait till he told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish Welfare Board dance , in the arms of an indescribably beautiful Jewess . He was just about to draw her a little closer to him for the waltz when a short , swarthy corporal muttered , " Sorry , Lieutenant , " and took her away . For an hour he was alternately ecstatic and glum as he cut in , yielded , cut in again . In the minutes when he was forced to the sidelines he was startled to find how desperate he became . He had to touch her again , feel her lithe , young body moving with his and marvel at the way her mind whipped unexpected words to her impudent tongue . " Lieutenant , you must n't monopolize me . " " You sound like a Bull Mooser . " " You see , it 's part of our job to remain in circulation . " " I refuse to have you sound like a lending-library book . " " And anyway , you 're much too handsome . " " Why , Miss Wildberg ! " " It 's true . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't , by any chance ? " " Just call me George Gordon when we 're alone . " " I always have to be on my guard against handsome men , men as good-looking as Francis X. Bushman but with something delicateand ethereal about them , something poetic . " " Have you fallen in love with many like that ? " " Oh , hundreds . " " I hate them all . " " So do I  --  now . I fall out of love even quicker than I fall in . That 's why I know I should never be married . " " But  --  did n't you tell me you were married ? " " Oh , did I ? " A thin-faced private was in the way . " Cutting in , Lieutenant . " Manley retired to the sidelines in frustration . It was like trying to hold a piece of quicksilver , glittering in the palm of his hand but slipping away each time he tried to enclose it . Before he could cut back , another soldier had taken his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing him the way she ( lid all the others . Look at her smiling up at that Hebe . Well , she was n't the only girl in Paris , God knows . Ah , he had her back again.  | " Now to get back to this mysterious husband of yours . " " Such a grim look , m'sieur . You are n't an agent of the Surete by any chance ? " " Madame , I have been shadowing you for months . Your name is not Jere Wildberg . It is Baroness Hilda Von Fruhling-Spitzel Horsthausenschaft , Operator x2y37 of Imperial German Intelli-gence. "  --  " Ach , ausgefundet ! " Jere cried . She looked up into his face with her eyes wide open in Theda Bara intrigue . They were dancing past the musicians . " Play Madelon again , Eddie . " She smiled at the pianist . Then she looked up at Manleydisarmingly . " I like dancing with you . You 're romantic . " " How do you know that ? " " The way you put your cheek against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open my eyes , there are yours , your yellow-green cat eyes staring at me . What are you looking at , Jere , when you stare like that ? " " I 'm trying to look inside you to see what you really are . " " You told me you were a sorceress , but I did n't take you seriously . " " Never take me completely seriously . But always take me a little seriously . " " I 'll remember that . " They took a good look at each other . It was a look of both tenderness and appraisal . " What is your name  --  Lord Byron ? " He thought quickly . " Mannie , " he answered . " Mannie Hallen-stein . " She stopped to execute a little curtsy , playfully but very prettily . " Welcome to our humble chambers , m'lord . " He thought her adorable  --  exquisite  --  her bright eyes  --  her quick ways . An intruder attempting to cut in was rejected rashly . " Come back later , fella . " " Mannie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale . " " Not for my morale . Now , what 's all this nonsense about a husband ? " Her laugh was a little cry of triumph . He did n't see anythingp137to laugh about . Had there ever been a husband , and did he write that stuff she had been spouting before ? Well , in a way . In what way ? She had quoted from something she was working on . And could n't a girl be married to her work ? What kind of work ? Translating Rimbaud . She was going to do an English translationof Une Saison en Enter . It was such a magnificent poem , no not magnificent , terrible . She 'd say it over to herself at night and feel almost too frightened to be alone . It was that kind of a poem . It was n't just the words , the meaning , but the sound , the feeling . But the job of translation drove her to the limits of madness . It was so perfect in French , so passionate , so direct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a letdown . " Dingy and blah , " she said . " What made you want to do it ? " " Why do people try to climb Mt . Everest ? " The intruder was back and this time he would not be denied . Manley sulked as she was led away . Once , as he waited on the sidelines , she caught his eye over her partner 's shoulder and stuck out her tongue again . When his turn came , he held her closer . The connection was made and the currents of youth poured through them . Shyly his lips pressed through her hair and began to explore the soft warm lobe of her ear . He could feel the involuntary fluttering in her , the quickening . Into the darkness of her ruffled hair he whispereda mysterious incantation , " Jere . . . Jere . . . " " Mannie . . . " She spoke softly . " Yes  --  yes ... " He waited for the whispered words of assurance . " That tickles my ear . " He drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't an officer and a gentleman , I 'd ... " " Oui , cheri ? " " I do n't know you well enough . " " Oh  --  foof ! Either they tell you you are beautiful , or that they do n't know you well enough . "  | " But I 'm ready to devote a major portion of my time  --  something I 've got plenty of  --  to knowing you well enough . " " Beware , beware my young friend , I warned you , I 'm a sor-ceress . " " And I am already bewitched . " She stopped dancing , placed her palms against his cheeks and puckered her lips in a little mock gesture of commiseration . " Poor Mannie Hallenstein . " He traced the provocative curve of her lips with his fingers . Suddenly she took a little cat-bite . It really stung and she laughed when he pulled his hand away . The band had reached the final chord for the dancers . The party was officially over but the pianist started fooling around with the keys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventiveness . A crowd formed around him and they started singing home songs , When Johnny Comes Marching Home , and East Side , West Side , Beautiful Ohio , My Old Kentucky Home and Just Try to Picture Me Down Home in Tennessee , which soon gave way to the Tattooed Lady , with everybody joining in with gusto and a tingling sense of being wicked . This led inevitably , almost religiously , to a recital of the charms of the busy Mademoiselle from Armentieres . The pianist began with the version acceptable even to the Y and slyly worked his way down to the words the boys really sang . Then he grinned around at Jere , " Come on , Miss J.  --  " With one foot on the piano bench , Jere sang in a comic , unmusicalvoice : " Oh , Mademoiselle from Armentieres , Parlez-vous ? Mademoiselle from Armentieres , Parlez-vous ? She met a Y man here in France , And showed him what he had in his pants , Hinky-dinky parlez-vous . " The soldiers whistled and cheered . But a plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all ! "  | " But Armistice only comes once in a lifetime , Mrs. Levinson . " " You can have a good time without being indecent . " Manley whispered . " How soon can we leave ? " " Meet me in the coat room in ten minutes . " Hidden behind the rows of trench coats , Manley uncorked his bottle of brandy . He needed fool 's courage to keep up with this one . What had that goose called her  --  Wilder ? Was it just a nickname ? She was wild all right . The brandy felt hot and encouraging . All right , Jere Wildberg , he was up to anything the evening might offer . Ten . . . fifteen minutes . What if she should n't come ? Why should he have believed her ? She had been full of lies  --  wild stories rolling off her tongue like  --  quicksilver again . Would she be cruel enough to let him waste away out here in this cloakroomSiberia ? She had the deviltry for it . He had almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , just as she had tricked him with the business of being French . and being married , when in she came . He ran to her and grabbed her hands crazily , " Jere , you 've come  --  you 've come ! " " Of course I 've come , little idiot . Did n't I tell you I would ? " " Yes  --  yes  --  but you told me so many things ... " She placed her hands against his cheeks again . " My poor MannieHallenstein . " This time he held her there and came forward to her until he brushed her lips . But at the last moment she turned way and laughed . " I ca n't possibly kiss you until I reek of brandy like you do . " " As you do . Like is a preposition . " " Oh , grammar . " She tossed her head . " You know what I mean . " The impulsive way she hurried to catch up with him could have been a forewarning . " Rimbaud is my first love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'll tell you a secret  --  I do n't care . " Hopelessly infatuated , even more hopelessly alarmed ( hearing faintly the whispered warning from Kansas City and Cambridge was he letting himself in for more than he bargained ) , he took her arm . Together they went out into the swirling night of songs and horns and drunken heralding of the end of a war.  |p140On  the corner the deformed little man , who until the day before had been the Emperor , was going up in flames of papier-mache while revelers in a dozen different uniforms danced around the pyre crazily singing We 'll Hang the Kaiser Under the Linden Tree . Jere and Manley watched a private and a lieutenantcoloneldancing together wearing each other 's caps . A full colonel snatched up a laughing Red Cross girl and kissed her long and passionately while onlookers cheered . Emboldened , Manley reached for Jere . She slapped him. ne comprends pas , " he said . " I do n't want you to kiss me just because everybody is kissing everybody . When you kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went along with the crowd , they sang La Marseillaise and Oh How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning and endless verses of Mademoiselle , they were in and out of packed cafes , they danced , drank champagne on the house , were picked up by a general in an open General Staff car on his way to Maxim 's . He insisted on assuming they were married and kept patting Jere 's hand and promising he would see to it that her husband was promoted , decorated and sent back to the States . When the generalbecame too interested , they excused themselves to dance and slipped away through the crowd on the floor . Outside on the Rue Royale they were caught up in a squad of riotous doughboys executing the goose step and shouting in unison " Ein , zwei , drei , vier  --  Ach du Himmel ! When they spied Jere they yelled , " Ein Fraulein ! " and broke ranks to embrace her . One was wearing a Kaiser 's mustache of charcoal and several sported Prussian helmets . To Manley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lips . Dawn brought them to Les Halles , where they found themselvesgorging on pig 's feet , washed down with champagne , in the company of a happily drunken French butcher and a giant Senegalese sergeant . Then the four of them , arm-in-arm , walkedp141around the market place together , singing the foulest songs the butcher and the sergeant could think of , which , with a great show of conscientiousness and affection , they were teaching Manley and Jere . It had been one of those nights when their luck was high . It would have been impossible to find a cab and they were miles from Jere 's quarters in the Cite Bergere but suddenly they were embarrassed by too much transportation . The butcher wanted the honor of taking them home in his truck . The Senegalese , for some mysterious reason they preferred not to question , had a motorcyclewith a sidecar at his disposal . He would consider himself insulted if they did not avail themselves of its use . The butcher and the Senegalese fell into argument as to who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a magnificent match . They were both well over six feet tall and two hundred pounds . " The first morning of peace in Europe in four-and-a-half years , " Manley muttered to Jere as they watched their two friends smash each other 's faces . At last the butcher was overcome . As he lay panting on the sidewalk , his left eye and his nose a bloody mess , Jere addressed him sweetly , " Thank you just the same for your kind offer . Now go straight home and wash your face . " The burly Frenchman , from his sitting position , touched his hand to his sweaty forehead in a casual salute . " Vive la Victoire , " he said , and then , with an admiring nod toward his conqueror , " I leave you in good hands . " Except for the fact that their Senegalese seemed to lack either a brake or any interest in slowing down , the ride through the city was uneventful . The Senegalese deposited them at the gate , insisted on kissing them on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , like all good characters in fairy talcanddrunken escapades , zoomed off down the street , never to be seen by them again but always to be remembered as a F'xe figure of a man with a superlative memory for earthy lyrics . Jere tried the gate . " I was afraid it would he locked , " she said . " Shall I come up for a few minutes ? "  |p142He  felt sure of himself . The easy way she had handled those blunt verses and how she had laughed at the stories at Les Halles and the little remarks she dropped . She looked at him playfully . " It 's half past five , my lipstick 's all smeared , my hair 's a mess , I 'm two-thirds blotto , I feel older than Elsie Janis ' mother  --  and you still want to come up ? " " I 'm a very determined young man . " " Oh , dear , and I 'm a very undetermined young woman . That 's dangerous . " She turned her lips to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It made him want to kiss her brutally , to stop this incessantplaying . For a moment their kiss was the only reality . But as suddenly as she had offered her lips she withdrew them again . " People who close their eyes when they dance always close their eyes when they kiss . " Ready for her to go limp in his arms , he was furious . " I did n't realize I was dealing with such an expert . " " And your Shall I come up for a few minutes ? ' Oh , handsomeLieutenant Hallenstein , how many Red Cross girls and telephone operators and visiting entertainers have you thrilled with that silken phrase ? " He would have liked to throttle her . Her hand dropped lightly on his arm . " Mannie , you 're forgettinghalf my warning already . Never take me too seriously . " Her hand slipped down into his , and squeezed it consolingly . " Thanks for a swell time . " Managing to mutter something polite , he staggered off in the general direction of the quays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard a piercing whistle . It was Jere , with two fingers in her mouth like a tomboy . " Do n't slouch when you walk , " she called . " You 'll get round-shouldered . " As he groped his way down to the Pont de la Tournelle , he whistled his own flat , who-cares arrangement of Butterfly . All the next day , through a party at the apartment that was less an Armistice celebration than a counter-attack against ennui and let-down , drinking Big Berthas , a violent concoction he had named with Hank Osborne , his French nurse Mignon and officersp143and girls who came passing through , Manley 's mind kept wanderingoff to the cite Bergere . The problems of the Armistice stirred him less than the riddle of Jere Wildberg . Was she fast ? Was she a New World flapper in bright colors ? Or was she somethingstrangely un-American , a true eccentric ? A self-acknowledged " keen judge of character , " this time he had to give himself a failing grade . All he could be sure of was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild , and he reached for a more accurate one  --  incited . Talk curled around him in argumentative smoke-rings . A PRO major from Tours , hopefully Wilsonian , believed in the Armistice as the first step toward a lasting peace and a new world order . But Mignon  --  Minnie they called her  --  was n't sure it would n't be better for France and the Allies to crush Germany once and for all while they had the chance . Hank did n't think it mattered too much one way or the other . The Revolution was bound to spread from Russia to Germany and France . " When you keep on using people for cannon fodder , they finally explode in your face . " He was n't a Bolshie , but Christ when you looked at all the raw stuff pulled in the name of Democracy . . . Manleydrank his Big Berthas and thought of Jere . " This time the people are gon na be heard from , " Hank insisted . " Aw , in a month you 'll be flying against the Bolshies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the PRO prophesied . " The hell I will , " Hank said . " This boy 's applying for his dischargeas soon as he c'n sober up enough to find his C.O. and make ' im sign the recommendation . " Then they were back on topic A. Provided the war was really over ( which no one quite believed yet ) how soon would they get back into civvies . And B : what would the States be like ? And C : whatinhell were they going to do ? " I know what this boy 's gon na do , " Hank announced . " I 'm goin ' out with Minnie to her folk 's farm and grow a long beard and sleep till noon and tank up on Burgundy every afternoon and jump into bed with Minnie every evening after supper and sleep until noon again and then get up and eat half a dozen eggs and comb my beard and . . . "  | " But Henri , " Mignon interrupted ( they were the only **25;5013;TOOLONG Manley knew that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . You can not do that all your life . " " Who 's talking about all my life ? I was just thinking of the next forty or fifty years . " Manley was thinking about his plans too . Of course the sensiblemove was returning to Beatrice . If he could get through law school , Mr. Vining would be obliged to take him into the firm . Why , in twenty years , he and Beatrice  --  the slide blurred and refused to stay in focus . Damn it , if he was a writer , now was the time to prove it . He had a third of a novel written , and a little money saved up . He should stay in France , where a dollarhad n't lost its prestige , and finish Friends and Foes . He could n't imagine himself explaining the plan of his novel to Beatrice Vining . Jere was the girl to tell . She had that nice kind of madness . Nothing surprised her . She had a horror of ruts and grubbing . " Where you goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta call Pershing . He 's waiting for me to tell him what to do next . " " Tell him I said to get the lead out and let 's get the hell home , " said a bleary-eyed captain in the Field Artillery . As Manley flung open the great iron gate , he felt a shortness of breath , a pounding in his heart , a quickening of pulse  --  familiar symptoms of the psychosomatic affliction called , in the poverty of our vocabulary , love . Behind the desk a powerfully bosomed concierge wearing a prominent black crucifix was primly knitting an absurdly small pair of socks . " Mademoiselle Wildberg ? Ah , Mademoiselle Wildairre . Oui , m'sieur . " It was room 37 . She would send a message . " Do n't bother . I 'll run up , " Manley said . The woman began to protest , then shrugged and returned to her little world of yarn that she could control . He knocked on the door . " Come in , Mannie . " The odd yellow-green cat-eyes , peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did I know it was you ?  |p145Your  knock , m'sieur . No one else bold enough to come up and knock without being invited would knock so shyly . " He looked around at incredible disorder . Old clothes on a pile on the floor . Ends of things hanging out of bureau drawers . Books and magazines scattered on tables , in the windowseat and on the floor . Crumpled papers that had missed the wastebasket . Cigarette butts crushed into damp coffee saucers . She followed his eyes and grinned . " I suppose you 're terribly neat . " " I guess so . I 've always had to keep after my roommates . " " Good . Be neat for both of us . " He noticed the steamer trunk in the corner , used as an auxiliarybureau . Stenciled on top was the name W-i-l-d-e-r . " So your name is Wilder ? " " Yes , my lord . " " What made you say Wildberg ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Everybody there has a name like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Manley felt as if a sack of stones had just been removed from his shoulder . " But why in the world do you work for the Jewish Welfare Board ? " " Well , first , Anne Morgan bounced me for being AWOL . Then I found out the JWB let their hostesses wear evening clothes at dances . And I hate uniforms . On women I mean . I would n't mind so much if I were plump and homely . But I 'm not . " She was wearing an ankle-length green chiffon tea gown that followed her tall , wiry figure . " That 's the main reason I work for the JWB . And then it makes me laugh to think how much it annoys Pate . " " Pate ? " " Papa . Calling him Pate annoys him too . In fact everything annoys him that is n't done exactly the way he orders . Sometimes I think I might marry a Jew  --  it would serve him right for being so narrow-minded . " " You know , my name really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p146She  curtsied prettily again . " Welcome back to the Anglo-Saxon fold , Halliday . " Just the same , and all fooling aside , he was damned relieved . " For twenty-four hours you were the most beautiful Jewess I 've ever seen . " " Are you rich ? " she asked . The uniform was expensively tailored and he had the airs that go with money . He was beginning to get used to her sudden questions . " You mean permanently ? Or tonight ? " " Oh , tonight will do . " " Tonight I 've got a month 's pay in my pocket  --  my allowance from Uncle Sam in return for putting in an occasional appearanceat the S &; S office , where my official job is not to interfere with the journalistic activities of the most ornery assortment of enlisted men to be found this side of a Russian Soviet . But to come to the point , Miss Wilder , my entire wealth is at your dis-posal . " " In that case you can take me to Prunier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive tastes ? I 'm a fiend for caviar and oystersand buckets of champagne . " Even in the crush of diners waiting for tables at Prunier 's , they found it easy to talk to each other . And all through dinner and on to the Cafe de Paris and further on to a little place in the Montmartre that specialized in second-rate champagne and second-handAmerican jazz they talked the way only young people can when their words glow with the special intensity of romance . Manley liked the way she listened , her head down , her eyes very wide , attentive  --  somehow she was able to make listening a positive act . ( Or was this , he wondered , simply phase one of falling in love ? ) He told her things he had n't even revealed to Hank Osborne  --  his sense of loss , of having missed something vital to his career in not seeing action at the front . His fear , " to be absolutely honest about it , " that Hank might crack through with the first great war book ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own account of rear-echelon stagnation would seem narrow and tame . It was probably a silly damnfool notion that he could write a novel . The stuff he had written so far was so much flatter thanp147the way he saw it in his mind . But sometimes he had come right back to the room from evening chow and pounded till daylight and he could feel it coming , pouring out of him in a stream that seemed strangely independent of him . Then he could see it in print , with his name in big letters , hear everybody saying Have you read Friends and Foes , why , Halliday has it all over Hergesheimer . Oh , he was a fool , a callow simpleton to have such dreams . There were things he wanted to say but they stayed locked in his head . He would never be a second Wells or Conrador Compton Mackenzie , he was morosely convinced , jus one more unpublished would-be author . More than just listening , Jere was going through it with him . He found himself telling her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of his revulsion for the profane and ignorant American major who treated all Germans as if they were pigs and of the chance meeting with a prisoner who happened to be a mild but inquisitive philologist . " It made me wonder , " Manley was summing it up for Jere over cognac and coffee , " which was friend and which was foe ? Which was the man we 've been fighting to defend and which was the tyrant we 've been trying to crush ? I left the States with a lot of juvenile black-and-white notions about noble and atrocious causes . I would 've made a peach of an editorial writer for the Literary Digest . Now I just want to write about people , good and bad , some on one side , some on another , caught up in something that carries them all along together , combat men going about their bloody business reluctantly and with no grand heroics , and SOS officers having the time of their lives working the old Army game . I want to get down to the rock-bottom truth of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render American songs in rag-time had made it impossible for any but the enthralled to concentrate . But now it slipped into something more comfortable . Poor Butterfly fluttering from weeping violins . They looked at each other ; they already had quite a repertoire of looks with different meanings . " Our song , " Manley said . This was suddenly much more important than any discussion of literary dreams.  | " Dance with me . " Tall and thin  --  supple he would have said  --  she reminded him a little of Irene Castle as they whirled slowly together in a kind of floating somnambulism . He became aware of admiring glances from seated onlookers and other dancers . It gave him a racy sense of appreciation of what a startlingly handsome couple they were . Somehow the tragic death of Vernon Castle lent poignancy to the moment . Just a year or so before , Vernon Castle had lived with the world literally at his feet , with his sweetheart for a partner , his partner for a bride , personifying the triumph of romance over reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sky . But suddenly the castle had become a plane and the plane a junk-pile of twisted metal and torn flesh on a Texas field . Fame , romance , success  --  these things were so preciousthat no one could be entrusted with their possession for more than a moment . Here , hold this , it 's yours , for an instant ! Then it was snatched back and something fell away from under you and you were plummeting to earth  --  Crash . Poor Butterfly , In the blossoms waiting .. . Somehow it was good to feel so sad , to be so young , to have such hope and such vanity , to move with such delicious ease . As they circled slowly in perfect time together she asked , " Why are you so sad , m'sieur ? " It was a little coy , but he did n't mind . " Because while we 're enjoying this it 's slipping out of out hands . Jere , if we could only stop the big clock and be us tonight the rest of our lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and ugly and say humph to young people . " He held her very close . She liked the pressure of his hand urging her closer . She was the goddess of fleeting time and if he merged her body with his , prone together like the midnight hands , the works might be stopped , the hour of youth forever suspended . All this leaped up from a dark fold in Manley 's brain as he studied the panel in the entrance of the Sutton Place apartmentp149house and pushed the button beside the little black letters formingWilder-Halliday . What is more painful than the memory of lost pleasures ? As the self-operating elevator moved up the shaft on its creepingjourney toward the roof , Manley 's mind , in another building and another time , moved slowly down into the past , level after level , until he was back at the Cite Bergere . They were closing the gates for midnight curfew . If he went up with Jere now he would have to stay until dawn , thanks to this medieval architectural appendix Paris was too sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed so anxious to hear , provided a semi-respectable motive for going back to 37 with her . Jere poured them each a cognac . Lighting two tall candles , she turned out the overhead light . It seemed to Manley that the yellowglow of the candles was exactly the color tone of her skin . " Rimbaud and bright lights just never seem right together . He lived in his own world of half-light . When you read Rimbaud  --  or go into Rimbaud , I should say  --  you feel sure he must have written by the light of hell-fire . " Manley realized for the first time what an extremist she was . She drank her brandy avidly , searched haphazardly among the helter-skelter of her desk for the work in progress . It was an atmosphere of dark intensity she created as she began to read , first from the Rimbaud original and then her own : " Now let us hear the confession of a companion in hell . O heavenly bridegroom , do not refuse the confession ofthe saddest of your servants . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She paused . " The next words are Quelle vie ! ' That 's what drives you crazy . You 'd have to say What a life ! ' or even What an existence ! ' But the thing about Rimbaud is , he 's so direct , blunt . If I could only find two short words that produce the impactof Quelle vie ! It 's a better language , that 's the trouble . Much better for poetry . So the best I can ever do is a dullish paraphrase . " " How about Some Life ! ' "  | " Mmm . That 's closer to the feeling . But is n't it awfully American ? " She tossed the scribbled page away impatiently . " Oh , the hell with it . If people want to read Rimbaud , let ' em learn French . " She had drunk her first cognac quickly and now she poured herself another . Manley was still inhaling his luxuriously . He was wondering , should he grab her suddenly , should he lead her gently toward the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think I 'll miss the air-raids . When they came over it gave you such a  --  such a whole feeling . All your little worries and fears seemed so futile .. . " Purification by TNT , " Manley said . His voice was low . He had come up behind her at the window . Lips , open a little in hunger , fed upon each other . His hands were two thieves , one holding her fast while the other made a desperate search , a hurried , clumsy thief pulling at buttons , tearingat openings . " Mannie , I  --  I hate that feeling . " Fighting him off was passion too . " Jere , I  --  I ca n't help it  --  you make me . . . " " Fingers under my clothes ... " " Jere , please , please , you must . . . " The words struck him like sharp little stones ; " There is n't anything in this world I must do , except die , and I 'll never forgiveGod for making me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp , gross , boorish ; he loathed himself . All lathered up in a sweat of passion , he thought in disgust . But she was the one to apologize . " Mannie , I know  --  it 's a compliment . My nose would grow long as Pinocchio 's if I told you I did n't want you to want me this way . But  --  when it happens , there wo n't be any tugging at buttons . If it happens , we 'll both know it 's going to happen and we 'll come to each other and the clothes will fall away . " Idiotically  --  or did it only seem so in retrospect  --  he had taken her hand and kissed her fingertips . " Bien entendu , Mademoiselle Wildberg . " The balance was restored.  | " I hope you do n't think I 'm one of those RCV 's who 's listened to one too many lectures on a Christian mind in a Christian body . " " Now do n't forget , we 're a couple of JWB kids . When a Hallensteinca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews coming to ? " At one o'clock in the morning , with nerves still taut , that made them howl with laughter . " After all , " Manley ventured , " it 's not your fault if your father slipped an old-fashioned chastity belt on you before you came overseas and locked the key in his safe . " " That 's my father  --  holding all the keys , always  --  thousands of them  --  he wears them all on his belly like a fat sommelier . " Conversation and brandy flowed through the night together in a swift , warm stream . Everything one had to tell the other seemed of enormous importance to both . Manley learned that Jere 's father was the George Nibely Wilder of Wilder , Spence &; Worthington , the Wall Street law firm . Knowing she was a Wilder did n't make her any more attractive . But it did make her attractive in a different way . There were no obstacles to his falling in love , maybe even marrying a Wilder . He learned that Jere had been packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of banishment from the Wilder realm . " I was the only one who talked back to Pate . My sisters were broken early like good little colts . Everything he ever asked me to do , I 'd do the opposite . He thought he could run our lives by deciding how much money to allow us . He thought money and what he called all the advantages ' could take the place of  --  place of . . . " She laughed defiantly . " I showed him . I ran away from that school in Geneva with a French boy called Jean-Jacques . Named after Rousseau . I loved the name . I guess that was the only thing about him I was in love with . As soon as I got on the train with him I could n't stand him . It had just been one of those school things . When you 're with a lot of girls , and you 're competing , and you see a boy somebody else likes very much , you can make yourself believe all kinds of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and had read the complete works of Casanova and he was all mishy inside . "  |p152Mr  . Wilder , using a convenient Government inspection tour , had arrived promptly . He had meant to be patiently firm and severe because , after all , he was a reasonable man and he realized what a handicap it had been for a high-spirited girl to be raised without a mother . But Jere 's emotionalism and hateful temper had finally unnerved him . When he placed her in a highly recommendedschool in Nice , it was with the understanding that they would no longer bother with the conventions of a proper father-daughter relationship . " I will continue to support you and pray that you do no more than you have already done to besmirchthe Wilder reputation , " he had said stiffly . " Well , " Jere went on , " at Madame Legendre 's in Nice , the headmistress was sleeping with the Latin teacher . I found out  --  oh , in a very sly way  --  and she hated me like rat poison after that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night and went riding with some French junior officers . We all got caught , because a teacher 's pet snitched , but I was the only one Madame expelled . Then I said right out loud in front of teachers and everybody what I knew about her and Monsieur Guillon . It was a terrible thing to do . Because Madame Legendre ran a very respectable school and M. Guillon was married . Sometimes I think I like to hate people . Hurt people , I mean . Always dominatingor being dominated . That 's why I like Rimbaud . He was such a good hater . I mean , he hated the whole thing  --  religion , domesticity , business and laws , respectability  --  ' these Occidental swamps . ' " He was beginning to see how her mind worked . It traveled no rational straight line . It was an active but reckless and whimsical mind that rushed to sudden violent conclusions , a mind often struck by brilliance but a brilliance that zigzagged as haphazardlyand uselessly as lightning . While the little cubicle of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jere Wilder Halliday as tediously as a potato bug , the memories slide by with the speed and invisibility of light . That first post-war winter in Paris , for those who knew theirp153Army game , foreshadowed the waves of American tourists and expatriates soon to come . More than ever , Manley felt that his uniform was a masquerade , especially since , through a bit of discreetcultivation , he wore the Croix de Guerre . They mingled with the American crowd busy straightening out the world in the plush corners of the Crillon . The spectacle provided Manley , with a new ending for his book . His last chapterviewed the goings-on at the Crillon as " the crowning absurdity of a generation with a singular talent for embracing absurdities  --  for rising with earth-shaking enthusiasm to the most absurd of occasions . " Jere , characteristically , expressed her feelings somewhat more directly . At the Crillon bar one evening she and Manley were boasting about their athletic prowess . Manley insisted that he had once sparred with Freddy Welsh and that the champion had told Manley he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of turning pro . ( This fistic myth was to cause Manleyconsiderable difficulty , much climbing through imaginary ropes with six-drink courage . ) Jere had boasted of her ability to do cartwheels and backward flips ( " I dive fantastically well , " she had added ) . " Look , I 'll show you ! " she had said suddenly . She executed a perfect cartwheel in front of the bar . It rated a box in next morning 's Paris Trib and a few scandalized lines in the Dyle Myle . Jere was quoted as saying , " Was it any sillier than some of the things going on in the ball-room ? " Everyone knew Jere Wilder after that . She became a sort of femme du moment like Regina Flory . In March of 1919 , to a young man in love , inefficiency , absentmindedness , lack of regard for money and the ease with which she slipped off the corset of responsibility all seemed to be delightfultraits . People would turn to smile in appreciation when they entered rooms . Manley and Jere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of double Narcissus . Spring came to Paris like a big traveling circus . There was music in the streets and the girls were pretty again . Pinched faces filled out , children played round the fountains , Paris worep154bright skirts bordered with chestnut blossoms and blue violets . Merry-go-rounds whirled and lovers took to sidewalk tables , parks , little boats , carriages , benches on the Seine , the Eiffel , lacy iron balconies , bridle paths .. . The first Memorial Day Manley wangled one of the S &; S Fords and they drove out to the ceremonies at Suresnes . Jere looked charmingly  --  deceptively  --  provincial in her white organdydress and oval-brimmed straw hat with its little black band running under her chin . They could n't help laughing as they drove out along the cobblestone streets of the suburbs . Not until they saw the incredible number of little white crosses on the hillside of Suresnes did they remember the mood of the day . They were able to get quite close to the President . With his top-hat and frockcoat accentuating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader than an undertaker presiding at the burial of a world . They had never seen anyone so severely in earnest . A personification of irony , this dry Scotch Presbyterianscholar who permitted himself to dream , this stern Princetonianaristocrat who , alone of the peacemakers , had captured the imagination of the common people of Europe . They heard him say : " These men came . . . to defeat forever . . . arrogant , selfish , dominance . . . and to see to it that there should never be a war like this again . " It is our duty to see to it . . . that the mothers of America .. . of France and England and Italy and Belgium . . . shall never be called upon for this sacrifice again . " These men . . . have given their lives that the world might be united . . . in order to secure the freedom of mankind .. . The people . . . are in the saddle . . . this age rejects the standardsof national selfishness .. . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely a peace settlement . . . There shall never be a war like this again ... " Righteousness , heavy as dew , settled on the brows of the listeners . Prayers . Taps . Artillery salute . The minute of silence . In their graves , should dead soldiers lie in a heap as they fell ? Or at parade rest ?  |p155Stiff  with virtue , fat with hope , the assembly moved off . Mr. Wilson , the good man gone wrong and/or the wrong man gone good , retired with appropriate solemnity . " I 'm glad you made me come , " Jere said . " He makes you feel so positive  --  and hopeful . " She was easily carried away . Two days later she would be agreeing with all the pronouncements of Wilson 's mistakes . " It sounds good , " Manley admitted , " but when you think about the Italian demands , and all this talk about secret deals  --  Oh , hell , it 's too beautiful a day to think . Let 's just drive some-where . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seine through Paris to the Bois de Vincennes . They stopped for vins blancs at a funny little place on the corner across from the fortress and then , beyond the suburbs at last , they went rolling on through the soft green countryside , following the Marne in the general direction of Reims . Manley had never seen her so relaxed . She kept saying how much she loved the sunshine . She stretched and purred in it . All winter she had seemed high-strung and brittle . They turned up toward Chateau Thierry . Farmers were plowingaround shell holes . A country church lay in ruins . A native caretaker was a scarecrow figure of desolation in an orderly gardenof white crosses . For the first time since their meeting half a year before , she talked about the war . He had grown used to the idea of her beingso self-centered that the problems of translating Rimbaud would seem more important to her than human suffering and the puzzle of converting Armistice to peace . " Maybe the little white crosses are better off , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did a little aid work at a base hospital at Neuilly  --  I do n't think I ever told you . There were quite a few French gueules cusses there . There was one with no arms and no legs and just a mess of burned flesh where his face used to be . He had no mouth at all , just a little charred hole . And yet  --  this was the scary part  --  he could talk . He kept pleading with the doctors to kill him . His name was Robert Denise . Before the war he had been a bicycle racer.  |p156One  day I had to read him a letter from his fiancee . From the sounds he started making in his throat I could tell he was crying , but there was n't enough face left to be able to see . . . " A shadow of silence slipped past them . She took a deep breath , opening her mouth as if the air were something good to eat . " Too nice a day , " she said , " too nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Her straw hat had fallen back on her shoulders . He had never liked her so much before . They had passed through a number of partially destroyed villageswhich were slowly coming back to life . Now they were approachingVaux . Rising on the left was a gentle slope covered with apple trees in blossom . Just beyond was another small American cemetery where perhaps a company had been wiped out in one of the bitter battles of the last-gasp German counterattackthe year before . " Mmmm , smell the apple blossoms , " Jere said . They had seen enough white crosses for one day . Vaux was the first village of their journey to be totally destroyed . The broken neck of the church steeple drew a harsh line against the sky . Every one of the modest stone houses had collapsed into a pile of rubble . A great city in ruins is a tragic sight . A little village reduced to a junk-lot of broken stones makes one want to cry , the way the crushed body of a little girl side-swiped on a roadside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a battlefield . Human emotion has never excelled at higher mathematics . They had to pick their way carefully along the battered road of the ghost-village . Nothing seemed to live here , not even dogs or rats . Then , in front of the house next to the last , they saw two old people sitting motionlessly on their broken stone steps , staring without watching anything . The roof that shells had ripped away had been replaced by stray boards and tattered tar paper . The torn windows had been boarded up . The only inhabitants of Vaux did not seem to see the Ford as it approached . " Mannie , " Jere said . " Those two old people . " They parked and got out , but the old couple gave no sign of having seen them . Jere said " Bon jour " and " Are you the only ones who have come back ? " and " When did you return ? " Thep157old man answered in toneless monosyllables . Manley offered them a pack of cigarettes . The old man accepted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , frowning . They had a common impulse to break through this wall of suspicion , to say , " Look , we 're sorry for you . It is n't our fault . We 'd like to help you . " " Are you able to manage here all alone ? " Manley asked . His heavy American accent hung awkwardly in the silence . For an answer , the old man merely shrugged . " But why do you stay here ? How is it possible to live ? " The hostile silence , infecting them , made Jere sound almost petulant . The old man shrugged again . The old woman 's voice was cracked and she had too much hair on her lip . She was not at all the beautiful silver-haired vision of an old woman young people like to imagine . " Perhaps if one of our sons is living he will come here . " She glared at Jere . Jere 's lips straightened as if she might cry . Then she quickly slipped off her necklace of amethysts set in tiny heart-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have this . " When she closed it into the woman 's hand , her own hand recoiledat the boniness . The old woman neither protested nor thanked her . It was all very unsatisfactory . There was another awkward silence , and then Jere and Manley got back into their car . They thought they could feel the eyes of the old couple boring into them . These stupid American sightseers touring the battlefields . They had little to say to each other as they drove on to Epernay . The Marne flowed peacefully , as if it had never seen a war . A red-purple sun was sliding off into the hills behind them when they turned back toward Paris . The world was powder blue when they reached the edge of Belleau Wood . The bare , amputated trees made grotesque silhouettes against the early twilight . " Look , pussy-willows , " Jere said . " I 'd love some for my room . "  |p158Manley  held her hand as they walked to the edge of the ravaged wood . Young pussy-willows had pushed up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the loosened root of a fallen beech . Suddenly , Jere did n't have the heart to pick it . " All these nice trees with their arms and their trunks cut off , this lovely countryripped apart , and then  --  " She stared at the pussy-willow . Tears came , then she was weeping , and finally she was sobbing in his arms . But in a minute it was over and her voice , still shaky , tried to be smart again . " Do n't I deserve the sterling silver spittoon though , bawling over a godamn pussy-willow ? " Manley kissed a shiny spot on her cheek where a tear had passed . She was not wise and self-sufficient and untamably wild after all . The sobbing of her body in his arms had told him all the things she had to cry for that she had been forcing back into herself . She gave him a funny little grin . " When you take me back to Paris will you make me see a doctor  --  I 'm beginning to babble like a shell-shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , " he heard himself say , " I 'm going to marry you . " " Why , Hallenstein , " she said , " do you know what you just said ? Maybe you 're the shell-shock case . " Jere cuddled under his arm as they drove back to Paris through the cool Spring night . At Meaux they stopped at an unassuming little restaurant where they had a surprisingly good Potage Crecy and two bottles of St. Emilion . Whenever their eyes met they would smile and everything that was said about the food , the room , the horse-faced waiter seemed uproariously funny . Then for six hectic weeks the Army of the United States and the Republic of France seemed to be conspiring against the sanctificationof their love . They went to sleep and awakened schemingabout certificates : birth certificates , death certificates , certificatesof residence , marriage certificates , certificates on lost certificates , climaxed by their wheedling a reluctant certificate of permission from Jere 's father by a bit of indelicate blackmail fictionizing the urgency of her " condition . "  |p159Jere  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be married in the Cathedral of Notre Dame . " Josephine and Marie Antoinette and Mary Stuart and Joan will be our handmaids . " But an Episcopalian and a Scotch-Irish Protestant , little better than heathens from Our Mother 's point of view , were not entitled to marriage in the eyes of the true Church . Then Manley had a bright idea . Where should Mannie Hallenstein and Jere Wildberg be hitched ? In a Jewish synagogue . They found one near the Etoile . They were just crazy enough to try it . " To make this legal , you 'll have to stitch a hem on your dick , " Hank Osborne had razzed with a best man 's prerogative . But the Rabbi had rebuffed them with ancient pride . " Children , even if you were serious  --  which I fear you are not  --  this is not your father 's house . Only if you were to take instruction . . . " Then , to satisfy the whim , Jere remembered the chaplain she had known at the JWB . Capt . Lorwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought them together . Everybodyhad a good time at the wedding and the party at Hank 's place afterward . " To a couple of wonderful kids who deserve each other , " Hank had said over the champagne . " May they be as young and as beautiful and as nuts about each other on their golden anniversary as they are tonight . " They drove out toward Barbizon with a case of Pommery 1911 and another case full of dreams , both sparkling , both born in years of bright promise . Forgotten was the bristling cable from Jere 's father , still resenting her marriage to " your rash young man from Kansas City , " and carrying out his threat to cut her off . Why worry ? They had enough money for two months , for Manley was still in the Army , on a sixty-day leave before reporting to Gievres for his discharge . They had borrowed a Dodge staff car from a friend of Hank 's who was an officer in the Paris motor pool . And they had been able to get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their first dinner had been exquisitely prolonged , though urgentmessages kept passing back and forth between their eyes and their fingertips . When they were back in the bungalow , Jere turned out all the lights and lit her candles . He could never forget his first sight of the honey-yellow thighs , the narrowp160waist , the small , perfect breasts , the slow , serious way she approachedhim , the surprising shyness of her eyes . But best of all he would remember the sharp pleasure and surprise of finding he had been the first . After all her limericks and bawdy verses and obscene jokes and sly references  --  the first . He had told himself that it would not matter . After all , he was a man of reason and this was 1919 , not 1909 . But those had been merely words , merely thoughts . When the moment came , he was buoyed up in an atavistic triumph . " You silly darling . Why did n't you tell me ? I never would have tried . " " I felt like such an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wickeder than Theda Bara . " But she was not virginal in mind or heart and she joined him willingly . Those nights at the Cornebiche . In the light of Jere 's candles they looked on in wonder at the things young lovers do . It was all new to Jere , but she was eighteen and she had thought about it . In the candlelight , until dawn tapped lightly at the windows , at the Cornebiche , Jere clung to him with a woman 's knowledge . She gave herself  --  as she had given herself to Rimbaud and hatred of her father and adolescent rebellion and a good time  --  with nothing held in reserve . Jere 's moods were changeable , but they never overlapped . Each mood was pushed to its limits , sometimes almost a little beyond . In those weeks at the Cornebiche there was nothing she would not do for love . Nine years later , retracing their steps in a last desperate search for what they had lost along the way , they had returned to the Cornebiche . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a fraud and the plumbing in the cottage had been abominable.  |p161The  door opened into a room that was also a tomb . Jere was standing there surprised , pleased , wishing he had given her time to make up ( she had been lying down and looked a fright ) . " Well , Mannie , fevensakes , will you please get your ugly puss in here ? " She had always called him ugly-puss , and she tried now to recall the old tone of bantering affection . He came in stiffly . She had put on weight , even more than last time , around the middle and in the face . He had thought it could no longer matter , but he felt a sharp sorrow for the departedzz-inch waist and the boniness of her face . She still wore the bangs though , exactly the way she had that Armistice night . He wished she would n't . It was a senselessly frivolous style for a middle-aged woman . ( Only thirty-eight . Could it be possible ? She looked ten years older at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one would take him for early forties . At least he no longer wore his hair parted in the middle . ) The bangs irritatedhim . Christ , would the woman never grow up ? When she got to be eighty would the needle still be grinding in the twenty-year-old groove ? Sure , she had been marvelous at twenty . But you ca n't go on being marvelously twenty all your life . He had learned that finally . Thirty had seemed so old . The trouble with both of them , he was able to see with such brilliant hindsight now , was they had thought youth was a career instead of a preparation . She led him through the hallway to the large living room handsomely furnished in modern decor , with an extra-sized windowlooking out on the river . On the table he noticed the leather-bound set of all his books that had been Jere 's birthday present to him ten years before . On a smaller table was a photograph of Manley and Jere when their profiles had been a sightp162to behold . These things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were too many symbols of the past . She led him to the couch and pulled up a chair opposite him , crossing her legs . By some corporeal miracle , it was always disconcertingto notice , her legs had remained exactly the same . There was something repulsive about that now , the legs of the marvelously lithe young woman he knew so well supporting the thickening middle-aged body of a stranger . " In the Times this morning I read you were coming on . What in the world are you writing  --  the Ice Follies ? " " Oh , I 'm doing a thing for Victor Milgrim I 'll be finished with in a month or so , thank God . " " I ca n't imagine you working for the movies . " He gave a mirthless little laugh . " Neither can I. " She said , " Oh , by the way , I win the fur-lined cuspidor . It looks like New Directions is going to publish my Saison en Enfer . " She had pushed one version through a porthole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fireplace of a villa near Perpignan . She was forever fiddling with the translation , doubting it , fighting it , until the very mention of Rimbaud had made him a little sick . Something had cracked in her . She could never finish anything she started to do , a translation , a marriage or her own growing up . " Good . They 're doing nice books . " He was careful not to kid with her . He had teased her about this life 's work before . " Laughlin seems to like it . I just have to sharpen Matin and Adieu and change a few words in Faim . " He tried not to smile . Long ago the second psychiatrist had told him about Jere and her translation . He tried very hard to keep his voice neutral . " Good . " " Oh , I forgot , Mannie  --  would you like a drink ? Is n't it silly , now that I 've stopped I forget all about offering it to people . " The last ones were wearing off ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pounding desire . " No , thanks , Jere , I 'm drinking very little these days . " She looked up suspiciously . He did n't act drunk , but he al/ways could carry a lot and his eyes looked fixed and sodden . " Mannie , I know what you 're going to say , but we really get the most amazing results with AA . " " Look , Jere , I do n't need AA . I did n't have a drink for eight and a half months before I came on this job . " " But , Mannie darling , once you take the step , it 's such a satisfaction , such a sense of peace . " " God damn it , I do n't want to spend the rest of my life nursingother drunks . I only have another fifteen , twenty years . I 've got to work . " " Manley , if you could see yourself . You look ghastly . " She came over to the couch . " And your clothes . " She bent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your tie 's all off to one side . " She touched him to straighten it . He pulled away . " Jere , for God 's sake , relax . I do n't care about my tie . I do n't care how I look any more . " " But , Mannie , there 's a difference between being informal and being  --  disheveled . " He was up , spleen angry . " Jere , I came up here for  --  well , I certainly did n't come to be picked at . " She softened disarmingly . " All right , Man , I guess I am getting to be an old spinster bitch . " She came up to him with a smile he recognized . " But will you just let me straighten your tie like a good fella ? There . Now I want no more nonsense out of you . " She sat on the couch beside him . " Who have you seen lately  --  of the old crowd ? " " I do n't see anybody any more . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios and extra girls . " " Harold ? " " At Romanoff 's every night , half-potted , playing gin with his agent until closing time . " " Sic transit . . . " Jere suggested . " Not gloria . Promises . " " And you 've really been working on a book ? " Three thou/sand miles away , writing only to remind him , occasionally , how much he was in arrears , it was remarkable how closely she kept tabs . " Margit told me when she came in for the holidays . " " Yes , " he said , " I 'm working . When I get rid of this ton of ice I 'm lugging , I 'm not going to take another movie job until the book is in . " " You 'll have enough money to take the rest of the year off ? " " Oh , I 'll still be in debt up to here , but at least I 'll be able to throw a few dollars to the nearest of the wolves . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , I still have a following.  --  " I hope it 's a good book , Man . " " Pray for me , baby . I 'm sweating blood . " " I think it 's heroic of you to try this way . " " I do n't have to try . I 've got the call . As bad as you with your AA , I guess . " " Mannie , frankly , I 'm surprised to find you so  --  pulled to-gether . " " Ho ho , I 'm pulled together all right . Do n't believe everything you hear , Jere , about Halliday coming apart at the seams . They are n't ready to cart me off to the laughing academy yet . " I 'm not drunk , he thought , not drunk , just a little wordier than usual , that 's all . At this point Jere decided it was time to say : " Mannie  --  I hate to bring this up the first time I see you in nearly three years but  --  well after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibly  --  you owe me eight hundred and seventy-five dollars . God knows I 'd never ask you for it if I did n't need it , but I owe two months rent on this apartment ... " " God Almighty , Jere , give me a chance . The main reason I 'm in this jam is because of you  --  the sanitariums , the psychoanalysts , the nutty extravagances . . . " He indicated the apartment with an impatient sweep of his hand . " We ca n't afford apartmentslike this any more  --  you should see what I 've been living in these past three years . Lord , Jere , when are you going to realize I 'm not made of gold any more ? I 'll always do my best not to let you starve , but I ca n't keep you in the style of a  --  of a ... "  |p165An  elusive figure of speech led him off into the shadows . From the Cornebiche they had gone back to Paris with the manuscript completed . Then began the Hungry Hundred and Seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a while they lived on severance pay and some money in Jere 's private account . The manuscript came back . " Goddam philistines , " Hank Osborne had said . " They just do n't dare tell the truth . " The manuscript went back across the Atlantic , readdressedto Dorset House . Meanwhile Manley had gone to work for the Paris Trib . Jere made the gesture of giving French lessonsto discharged Yanks staying on in Paris . But she was alwaysforgetting her appointments . And Manley got fired after five weeks for oversleeping after a rough night at Mamma 's on the Rue Tabout . The severance pay and the private account had run out weeks before . Manley hated to do it but he hit Hank for twelve hundred francs . It had been at this nadir that Jere came home with a new eight-hundred-franc hat . An enormous chartreuse hat with peacock feathers . " Wildberg , that is a beautifulhat , but I would like it even better if we could eat it . " He was still too much in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Mannie darling , I was feeling so depressed . And this makes me feel fabulous and wicked , like Madame Pompadour . " Two days later came the check for five hundred dollars from Dorset House . They wanted changes , of course , and they wished he could tone down the satire on the " goings on at the Crillon , especially relating to our own peace commission " but at least they recognized " a new voice . " Jere insisted that her hat had changed their luck . The fact that the check had been mailed a week before the purchase of the hat did not disturb her kind of logic . " Oh , I hope we 'll make millions on the book . " They did n't make millions , of course . It was twenty-three thousand . They were terribly rich that next year in France with the franc at seven to a dollar . And everywhere they went everybody knew them and adored them . And all the critics said young Halliday was the first American author to reflect the serviceman'sreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Hun-hating that had been served up to them by journalists and popular novelists after ceremonious " tours to thep166front . " And now all the magazines , not just the few good ones but the high-paying , big-circulation ones , wanted more from Manley Halliday . As fortune would have it , as they say , Friends and Foes was not only an impressive first novel but the first work of fiction to be post-war in spirit as well as in time . ManleyHalliday was the man of the hour and Jere Halliday was his queen . The story of the hat she had not been able to afford became " typical of Jere , " not typical of irresponsibility and emotionalinstability and neurotic selfishness ( as it seemed later ) , no  --  of irrepressible vivacity and unconventional impulsiveness and an infectious wildness.  --  " Jere  --  Je-re  --  do n't cry . " Crying , if you close your eyes and listen , makes a horrible sound , cat howling on a midnight fence and gasping and sniffling.  --  " Jere  --  Je-re  --  please do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sounded . For a curious little rhyme formed in his head : ah weeping is bleary and weeping is smeary and weeping is very , very dreary . At the same time he remembered his trick for cutting through when she suddenly fell to crying.  --  " All right , Lillian , let 's have that scene once more , and this time make it gush . " They had heard that when Griffith had invited them to Mamaroneck to discuss filming Friends and Foes and they had gone on the set to watch him direct the Gish girls in Orphans of the Storm . It still worked . Jere said , " Look at me , would you , leaking like an old hose . " Manley made the mistake of putting his arm around her . " Oh Mannie , Mannie . I 'm sorry but it 's  --  being so goddam alone . God almighty , the nights I have n't been able to sleep thinking about it . The pills I 've taken  --  tracing it back . Where , where was it that it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been at the phone to call you . I just drag along , existing without you . I 'm sure my maid thinks I 'm a lunatic because once in a while I forget and she hears me talking to you . " He dreaded what was coming next . They had tried it once ,  |p167the  year before he left for Hollywood and it had been strained when it was n't listless  --  no good for either of them . They had nothing left for each other . They were like a couple of runners who pace themselves badly and run themselves out in the first lap . They had tried to make a sprint of what turned out to be a crosscountryendurance contest . But it had been a honey of a first lap . He braced himself . It came . " Man , we 're both getting older . We 're more sensible now . I do n't drink any more  --  after all , that was the main trouble , was n't it ? And it would be so good for Douglas . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " Jere  --  " he did not mean his voice to be so harsh but he felt himself cornered and he had to fight free  --  " I simply have n't got the time or the strength to go through all this with you again . " " You seem to have plenty of time and strength for that slut I hear you 're living with on the Coast . " " Jere , stop it . Right now . Miss Loeb has nothing to do with this . " " Oh , do n't think I have n't heard all about your wonderful Miss Loeb . And you dare write me that mularky about having no more personal life . My personal life has become my writing life . ' Merde . " This time her hysteria only made him calmly superior . " Jere , believe me , Miss Loeb is getting no bargain . She 's just a collector of old relics who went around picking up the pieces of Manley Halliday that nobody seemed to want and brought them home for safe-keeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She came along years after our cause was lost . " " Just the same if that woman were out of the way , if she did n't have such a hold on you . . . " He took her hand tenderly . " Jere , Jere , what have we done to each other ? We ca n't go back to the dream and we ca n't go on to anything else . " " Just what I need this afternoon  --  philosophy . " She had always been too soft or too brittle . Either God had made her without a balance-wheel or the psychiatrists were right about the need for a father . " Well , Jere , good-bye . I 'm sorry I 've upset you . " " Good-bye , Manley . "  | " And , oh , I 'll send you that money just as soon as I can . " " Thank you . " Silently she led him to the door . In search of a dream , he had found only this carping middle-aged impostor . Well , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn quickly from experience . But what he learned these days he applied . He would never do this again . He would keep Jere Halliday where she belonged  --  ababe with bounce and beauty on the memory-couch of youth . Going down in the elevator the let-down hit him hard . When he came out into the cold air he turned once to look up at the window . She was staring down at him . From the angle of the sidewalk , with the curtains shadowing her face , she looked startlinglybeautiful again . Hating himself and her and confusion in general , he turned toward First Avenue without waving . Near the corner of Third Avenue was a bar he recognized as a blind-pig he used to know as Paul and Tony 's . Now it had a life preserver in the window and was called the Ship Ahoy . Well , he needed a life preserver . This had been a day . Do n't worry , Ann , I know what I 'm doing . But I could do with a shot before goingback on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are  --  are Paul and Tony still around ? " " Who ? " " Paul and Tony  --  used to run this place . " The bartender looked over toward a small man with glasses studying the Racing Form in one of the booths . " Hey , Al , ever hear of Paul and Tony  --  useta run this place ? " The man in the booth did not look up . " Never heard of them . " The bartender : " When wuz they here ? " " Oh , Twenty-five , Twenty-six . " " What ya givin ' me , ancient history . What 'll it be ? " " Scotch and soda . Pinch bottle . " The bartender ignored Manley while setting up his drink " Hey , Al , how long you figger it 'll go tonight ? " " Aah , the Bomber ought a take him quick . "  |p169It  was peaceful being the only customer in the Ship Ahoy . Ocean travel always gave him a sense of peace . " Same thing again . Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink raised his hopes . He was really feeling remarkablywell , much better than he could have expected after a full day without sleep and an upset diet . He 'd go back to the hotel in a little while and block out the college story in half an hour 's time . On the third drink the thin red line of confidence was climbing steadily.  |p170Four  or five drinks ( he could n't be sure how many hours ) later Manley came back to the Waldorf . The session at the Ship Ahoy had been just what he needed . He came in singing " I 'm on the Crest of a Wave , " parodying under his breath the uninhibitedbleat with which he had heard Harry Richman render it so often . Shep hurried to the door . " Jesus , Manley where the hell have you been ? " The violence of the young man 's accusation brought Manley 's head up stubbornly . His body stiffened , sobered , with a sense of outrage . Who was this young snip to talk to him this way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " Why all the excitement , Stearns ? " " Milgrim is here ! Called just a few minutes after you left . He 's been phoning every half hour to know where you were . I 've been covering for you . Said you had to see a doctor . Then he got on the phone himself . Said he 's concerned about your health  --  your agent promised you were physically fit . So I said you wrenched your foot getting off the plane . God , I 've been going nuts ! " " Stearns , I  --  I ' preciate your efforts in my behalf . But I do n't need anyone to cover up for me . I 'm  --  not in the habit of being covered up . " " But look , Manley , I could tell Milgrim was getting sore , and I did n't want him to think . . . " Manley swayed slightly . If Milgrim fired him now he 'd be through . And if he was through in Hollywood . . . damn it these Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surer of himself than he could possibly be . " Young man , if you want to make screen writing your career  --  " he closed his eyes and struggled for the lines like an actor in trouble "  --  let me give you a little advice . What Hollywoodneeds is a new generation of writers who wo n't trouble ,  |p171I  mean tremble every time a producer picks up a phone . If screenwriters are ever going to amount to anything they 've got to be as independent as we were when we were starting in to write twenny "  --  he made a conscious effort to articulate  --  " twenty years ago . We did n't give a damn for the public or the critics or anything . If they did n't like us it just showed us how much behind the times they were . We were cocky . I never saw a good writer yet who was n't cocky . " " Sure , sure Manley , but listen : we 've got to go up and see Milgrim right now ! " " Remember something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer is ' sentially our inferior . Because no matter how low they stoop , the executive element is helpless without the creative element . That 's why Milgrim treats me with  --  well , noticethe respect ? And I 'll tell you another thing , he does n't want me to start truckling to him . That 's what he pays me for  --  so he can look up to me . I know these first- and second-generation tycoons . Inferiority complexes a yard wide . " " Okay . Okay . But do you mind if I call him and tell him we 'll condescend to come up and see him this afternoon ? " Manley glared at him . " Tell him I 'll be ready to see him in  --  fifteen minutes . " At the entrance to his bedroom he paused . " And do n't let your voice sound as if you 're  --  genuflecting . " Feeling rather pleased with the performance , he went into the bathroom . There his confidence began to falter . He was n't sure about the dosage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . And the caloric content of the whiskey would have to be figured in . Damn it , this lousy trip  --  for all those months before it he had been so careful . Ann and Dr. Rubin would have a fit if they knew . In the elevator up to the Towers Manley decided that he was sorry to see the look of annoyance souring Shep 's good-natured , conscientious face . As a peace-feeler , Manley produced a smile . " Sorry I blew my top , " Shep said . " I guess no sleep and the damned story on my mind and Milgrim needling me . . . " " Do n't worry , baby , we 'll work that touchdown play yet and both win our big block M's. "  |p172Milgrim  's suite in the Tower combined the hectic activity of his office with the full-staffed solicitousness of his home-life . William , Mr. Milgrim 's personal valet , opened the door . Mrs. Chenery , the English social secretary , greeted them . Mr. Milgrim was in conference and she hoped they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wide entrance-way that had been converted into a waiting room . Already there , with the set , bored expressions of those who have waited and are prepared to wait and wait , were a pale young man undoubtedly seeking stardom and a publicity underling from the New York office with the lay-out of a half-page ad on Live Tonight for Tomorrow , the World-Wide picture for which a gala opening was beingplanned upon Milgrim 's return from Webster . The waiting , Shep thought again , the waiting . But this time Manley had no objection . It provided a brief cooling-off period in which to collect himself and perhaps force his mind back to the story . With her maid carrying a number of large white boxes in front of her , Mrs. Milgrim came in from what she called her shopping spree . She was a real English beauty , faded , but pleasinglyso , with a cool grace . Although she had not seen him in years , she recognized Manley Halliday at once . " So nice to see you again , Mr. Halliday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . I hope we 'll see something of you while we 're all in New York . " Her voice was gentle , cultivated , and perhaps just a little more British than it should have been after all these years in America . Manley was gallant , in a quiet , tired way that appealed to Maud Milgrim as becoming reticence . She wished Victor would hire more writers like him , distinguished and well-mannered . It would help elevate Hollywood social standing . Although Hallidayhardly looked distingue in his baggy suit . And he could stand a shave . And his eyes were red-rimmed . The poor man must have been working terribly hard . Victor was such a slave-driver , driving everybody as hard as himself . " I know Victor wo n't keep you any longer than he has to . The poor dear always wears himself out so when he comes to New York . "  |p173They  only had to wait twenty minutes . Then they were usheredin by a Peggy Dillon considerably more restrained now that she had to function within earshot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shep 's benefit , " Greetings , Buster . Welcometo our little madhouse , " as she led them into the large sitting room where Milgrim reigned . He was wearing a dark silk lounging robe , in excellent taste , and a manicurist was doing his nails while an Eastern magazine writer tried to sell him an original . Clearly disconcerted by the entrance of Manley and Shep in the middle of his presentation , the writer said , " Of course I do n't tell it as well as I could write it . . . " and paused uncertainly , which both Manley and Shep recognized as a fatal openingto give a man like Milgrim . Milgrim said , " I can see where you 're going , Pierson . And I 'm afraid it 's not my sort of thing  --  not enough importance . " " I think you 'd like the ending , " Pierson suggested unhappily . " Tell you what you do . Write me a letter outlining the whole thing . Thanks for coming up , Pierson . " Pierson rose reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know where to begin . He hesitated , and then suddenly turned to Manley , with a false heartiness meant to cover both his embarrassment and his genuine respect . " Halliday , you probably do n't remember me . We met in Marseilles a helluva long time ago  --  at that hotel out on Grand Corniche . " " La Reserve ? " " By God , yes . That 's what I call a good memory . " " I used to have a better one . " " Well , I-uh-have to dash . But I-uh-want you to know I thought Shadow Ball was a honey of a job . My better half thought so too . " " Thank you , " Manley said , using only his head for the bow . " And thank the better half ' too . " His voice italicized the phrase with gentle scorn . " She passed away six years ago , " Pierson said , and then he was gone , leaving the compliment in Manley 's hand like a faded flower.  | " How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear you tripped or something getting off the plane . " The or something was vaguely accusing . " Oh , it 's  --  it 's coming along . I 'll be ready to run against Yale , " Manley said . " If it gives you any trouble , let me know . Dr. Lobell , the best orthopedist in New York , is a great pal of mine . " " A little hot water and a good night 's rest , " Manley said , uncomfortably . " Christ , be careful , will you , fella ? " Milgrim 's warning was still good-natured . " We do n't want anything to happen to the star on the eve of the big game . " The manicurist , finished , put her things away with such practicedefficiency as to seem invisible . Milgrim admired the shiny pink surfaces of his nails . " Well , I suppose you 've got the screenplay ready for me to read ? " It was always delivered in the same laughing tone , this tired industrial joke . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shep looked at Manley , trying to warn him with his eyes . But Manley would not look at him . Milgrim ( sharply ) : " What 's that , Manley ? " Manley ( mildly ) : " You make a joke . I make a joke . Score 's fifteen all . " Milgrim looked at Shep , asking a wordless question . Shep lowered his head as if in thought . But he could see Milgrim 's eyes shifting appraisingly from one to the other . " Well , gentlemen , if it is n't asking too much  --  " Milgrim still managed to retain what he believed to be his sense of humor "  --  I 'd like to hear the new attack on the story . " There was a pause . Afraid of what Manley might say , Shep decided to head him off . " Well , we . . . " he began . But Milgrim was n't looking at him . Milgrim was waiting for Halliday and Shep 's words faded from inattention . Manley ran his hand back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to look at Milgrim . It was a little silly to be so frightened , but after that inquisition of the waiter . .  |p175When  Manley began , however , he gave a surprisingly able digest of the various story lines they had discussed . There was no cheap attempt to sell , nor to gloss over difficulties . As Manley spoke , Milgrim pushed out his full lower lip , which Shep had come to recognize as a sign of thinking in a deeply troubled way . " I had hoped you 'd be a little further along , " he said when Manley had finished . Manley seemed calm and poised and Shep began to admire him again . His mind was still in the room . Shep had been uneasyabout that . " This is the period of gestation , Victor . In my own work I often think for weeks without getting anywhere . Then one day everything seems to drop into place . " " I suppose regular screen writers are geared a little faster , " Milgrim acknowledged . " I know when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real Milgrim idea . I would n't try to rush you at all , Manley "  --  Shep was n't there at all for Milgrim  --  " if it was n't for this damned second unit at the Mardi Gras . When we get up there we 've got to have enough of an outline to know what stock and process backgrounds to go for . " " In other words , you 're not rushing us , " Manley said with an insolent smile , " just giving us one more day . " " I once rewrote an entire screenplay in nineteen hours , " Milgrim said . " I wrote a short story in a day once that 's still being anthologized . But . . . " " But  --  ? " Milgrim waited . A puzzled look came over Manley 's face . " But what ? " There was a different kind of pause this time , disturbing to Milgrim , confusing to Manley , painful to Shep . Mrs. Milgrim looked in from the doorway . " Victor , dear , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how long it takes you to dress . " She smiled at her husband 's writers graciously . " Forgive us for letting you in on family secrets . " " All right , Maud . We 've gone as far as we can now anyway . " Shep tried to catch Manley 's eye to say : Mr. Milgrim may run everybody else but Mrs. Milgrim runs Mr. Milgrim . But Manleyp176was unreceptive . His eyes were not glassy ; they merely had seemed to lose interest in what there was to see . The fine blond head of Mrs. Milgrim popped in again . She was a busy woman . " Just had an idea , Victor . Maybe Mr. Halliday would like to join us and the Swopes for dinner and the Bea Lillie show  --  what 's the name of it again ? " " Set to Music , " Manley mumbled . Shep was constantly being reminded of Manley 's ability to deal in specifics , even when he hardly appeared to be thinking or listening . " Yes , of course . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Milgrim said . " Thanks , but  --  did n't even bring evening clothes , " Manley said . A brightness came into his eyes . " I 'm just the plumber  --  brought nothing but working clothes  --  only came in to fix a few leaky pipes . " Milgrim and his wife laughed hollowly . Then he said : " I have a notion Manley wants to work tonight anyway . Say , I have an idea . When I get back from the theater tonight , why do n't we huddle again ? What do you say I give you a ring around one or two ? " One of the occupational risks of Milgrim writers was this compulsive habit of avoiding sleep . " You really think that 's a good idea , Victor ? " Manley said curtly . " With a strenuous week-end coming up ? " " In case you 've turned in , leave word at the desk , " Milgrim persisted . Apparently still unaware of Shep 's presence , the producer walked Manley to the door . The would-be star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting but Milgrim did not see them either . " You would n't want to come back and have one drink with us and meet the Swopes ? " Manley shook his head . " I 'll see you in the morning , Victor . " As the door closed , Miss Dillon was telling the publicity man he could show the lay-out to Mr. Milgrim in the bedroom whilep177the producer was dressing . The beautiful girl and the pale young man would have to try again tomorrow . On their way down in the elevator Manley said , " I may have to work for Milgrim . But I 'll be damned if I let him show me off like a gold key on a watch chain . " " The gold key and the invisible man , " Shep said . " Yes , I feel bad about that . I certainly do n't want to hog this thing . When our picture comes out I 'll make sure you get equal credit . " " Do n't let it worry you , " Shep said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both began to laugh . They had forgotten to give the elevator boy their floor number and had gone all the way to the lobby . " I 'm hungry , " Manley said . " Do n't you think we should clean up ? " " Oh , let 's just go out and get a bite and then come back and polish off the outline . " " But we ca n't go out this way  --  snowing outside  --  no coats . " " Spur o ' the moment . " " What ? " " Always used to do things spur o ' the moment . Never make plans , Jere ' n me . Go t'a nightclub , like that . Europe , like that . Bed , like that . Divorce , like that . Suicide , like that . " Shep looked at him and Manley quickly reassured him . " Do n't be frightened . I was joke-making . " They were under the marquee , waiting for a cab . Air 's supposedto sober people up , Shep thought . Seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Manley , it 's a lousy night . I think we really ought to go back ... " " Suppose you think I 'm trying to commit suicide by catching my death of pneumonia . Lis-sen . No suicide in my family . We Hallidays 're stronger characters ' n we look . " As the doorman opened the taxi door for the party ahead of them , Manley hurried forward and jumped into it first . There were righteous accusations and angry words . Shep waited uneasilyon the perimeter of the tense circle.  | " Aw  --  so 's your old man , " Manley was saying . He never said these things seriously , but always with a sense of satire . " Get out of that cab , god damn it , or I 'll pull you out , " said a man who looked as if he could . Manley started out to meet the challenge . Shep leapt in and slammed the door . " Let 's get away from here fast , " he told the back of the head behind the wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , he was , Manley . " " Well , I did n't see him . " " Manley , do you consider me a friend of yours ? " " Ho , ho , how many people have asked me that ! " Shep did n't say anything . He looked out at the soiled slush . After a few moments of this , Manley said , " Okay . Okay . Be a friend of mine . " " Let 's go back to the hotel , sleep till midnight , then get up and work on the story . " " Well , where you wan na go ? " a gravelly voice demanded from the front seat . " Twenty-one , " Manley said . " Have n't you seen enough celebrities ? " " Have to eat somewhere . This 'll give me a chance to pay an old bill . " Monty on the door , dour by disposition , affable by profession , knew his business . " Mr. Halliday , " he said . " Have n't seen you in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the auburn lights , Jack came over . Manley Halliday had been a good customer in the old , even 99th Street days and such things were not forgottenhere . " If you 'll send a blank check to the table , I 'll pay an old debt , " Manley said right away . Having once had pride in his reputation as an easy spender , he was sensitive about his fall from financial grace . " We 've been awfully worried about it , " Jack said nicely , with a wink at Shep . Passing the bar on their way to the tables they saw Dick Watts and Quent Reynolds and at the big table reserved for him in thep179corner , John O'Hara . Afraid Manley might stop for a drink , Shep took his arm and piloted him on to one of the small tables against the wall . A big man across the room who must have been quite handsomeonce , before all the drinking , looked over and nodded . Manley said , as if the name itself had significance , " Larry Bane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Larry Bane ? " Manley said . " You 've heard of The Grouch ? One Million a Year ? " " Must be BMT , " Shep said . " BMT , " Manley caught it . " Before my time ? Is that used much ? " " It 's one of Sara 's , " Shep said . " The New Deal influence . Calls her story editor FOB . For fascistic old bitch . " " Well , " said Manley . " BYT Bane had two hits running on Broadway at the same time . Even Nathan liked ' em . Popular ' n satirical . Like Barry , only better . The critics kept waiting for him to write that great American play . " " What happened to him ? " " Hollywood . " The captain was ready to take the order . Shep could have used a drink but he decided to pass . More important to get Manley back on the story . " Let 's have a drink , " Manley said . " I thought you were hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have a drink first . " " Okay , a drink , " Shep said . But he made Manley order dinner at the same time . Manley ordered elaborately , Chateaubriand with Bearnaise sauce , Pommes de terre allumettes , broccoli Hollandaise , tossed green salad .. . Shep went back to pick up the conversational stitch . " Why does everyone blame it on Hollywood ? " " On Hollywood ? " Manley had forgotten . " This great playwright Bane . " " Oh . Oh , Bane . Bane was brilliant  --  best we had . Charley Brackett in the New Yorker , I think it was , said Bane and Eddie Mayer  --  you know Eddie Mayer ? "  | " But , Manley , this Hollywood stuff . Why must Hollywood alwaystake the rap ? Why did n't Bane have enough guts to stay with his plays ? " " Temptation , " Manley said . " That 's writers in America . " " Maybe in your time . But if you mean the new writers , I think you 're wrong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them moving forward . " " Too easy , " Manley said . " Always too easy . " His eyes were almost closed and it hardly seemed possible that he could be concentrating . " Your high mortality on writers , that goes on all the time in America . Y'know why ? " He was signaling the waiter for another drink . " American idea of success . Nothing fails like success . Write one bestseller here , one hit play , Big Success . Do one thing , get rich ' n famous . Writers get caught up in American system . Ballyhoo . Cocktail parties . Bestseller list . Worship of Success . " He paused . " Got ta find the Johnny . They moved it since I was here last . Whole place turned around . Do n't know where I am . " He rose and wandered off . When their next round arrived , Shep sneaked a third of Manley 's behind the waiter 's back and refilled it from the water glass . Then he watched Manley threadinghis way back between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change his clothes before they saw Milgrim again . How long had it been since they left the Burbank airport ? Was this only the second night ? He could have believed it the twentieth or the two thousandth . Sara , California , normal life seemed remote and unreal . A few tables away Shep saw Manley stop and bow to a lady of uncertain age expensively dressed and still attractive in a fleshy , dissipated way . Shep saw her take Manley 's hand and talk up into his face with a great show of animation . " My God , Mimsey Layton , " Manley said when he squeezed in behind the small table again . " Shep , take my advice . Never grow old . Too painful to see the women . Bad enough for the men . Alwayshate to see an All-American ten years later . But the women . Mimsey . That Mimsey . She was the cutest little hell raiser . Married three times  --  each one richer . Hadda funnyp181hobby  --  collecting writers . Ever meet those women who are n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d make the most interesting lovers ? That was Mimsey . " What he was thinking made him snicker . " Good ol ' Mims . Pro'lly the greatest living authority on the sex lives of American authors . Wrote a book once , or had it written , Faithful in My Fashion , in which all the lovers became dear friends . ' Some of us thought it was fascinating in a horrible way and some of us thought it was horrible in a fascinating way . Charley MacArthur was the one who said Both schools are wrong . It 's horrible in a horribleway : " He was sipping from the watered highball . " Poor ol ' Mimsey . Still trying to have a figure . And the Martinis . And you should have heard the gay chatter . Wants me to drop up for cocktails . Does n't know I do n't drop up for cocktails any more . I 've put away my childish toys . Jere thought I was in love with her once . Maybe I was , one afternoon at a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You can still see a little of what she must have had . " " We had some sexy babies . Or maybe I was just younger . Mimsey was the original flapper . Something new on the face of the globe . Full of merry hell in a way that women had never known how to be before . " He smiled vaguely . " Remember one time . . . " He paused and finished his drink . The Chateaubriand had arrived and Shep was wolfing his . Despite the flourishes of the waiter , Manley was letting his get cold . " Yes ? " Shep prompted . " What was I talking about ? Slipped my mind . " " Something about Mimsey . Something you just remembered . " Manley caught the waiter 's eye and held up his glass . " Another Scotch and soda ? " the waiter said . " Never say another . Bad manners . Just say a Scotch and soda . Good waiter never rubs a guest 's nose in his own lack o ' will power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shep said . " Stop nursing me . I 'm going to get awfully goddam sick of you if you keep on nursing me. "  | " Listen , Manley . I 'm trying to help you . " " You do n't know me . Why should you want to help me ? And who the hell told you I needed your help anyway ? " " Forget it , Manley . Take it easy . " " Think I'ma ' fraid of you ? Pro'lly got thirty pounds on me and twenty years . But I 'll fight you . I 'll beat the living  --  whaddo I care if they hear ? Come on . Right now . " He started to rise . What he needed was air . He was very dizzy . Shep said with authority , " Sit down . " " Bet you 're pretty handy with the gloves . " Shep said , " I 've done some boxing . " " You look like a boxer . Did I ever tell you how I boxed the ears off Freddy Welsh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . You think I 'm an old bourgeois windbag . You think I ca n't write any more because I do n't worshiplabor organizers . You think I drink because I 'm aestheticallyfrustrated and  --  and decadent , is n't that the word ? " " Manley , I 'm telling you . You better eat something . " " What in hell were we talking about again ? " " Mimsey ? " " Oh , stow Mimsey . No , I should n't say that . Though it was a mighty sweet little assignment once upon a time . " " Does n't look so bad right now , if you remember the advice of Ben Franklin . " The thought of Mimsey sobered him , or at least saddened him . " No , she 's just a ghost now , a ghost in a tight corset , pan make-up and a Martini mask . " The waiter hovered solicitously . " Are you through with your deener , Meester Halliday ? " Manley waved the dish away with a nod of his head . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I donate this meal to the culinary proletariat . " It got the rise out of Shep that Manley had anticipated ; that , in fact , had been his motive for saying it . " Garcon  --  " At a certain point in his drinking Manley had a tendency to restaurant French  --  " deux Ecosses  | " Manley , what do you say we cut out of here ? " " Have to have a nightcap , how would you say that , le bonnet de nuit ? " Again nature called Manley from the room ( " Gon na trade these kidneys in for a couple of good sieves " ) and again Shep worked his sleight-of-hand to dilute the drink . Again Manley stopped at Mimsey 's table and again he told Shep this was a girl he used to know . " My youth tails me like a third-rate private detective too clumsy to keep himself from being seen . " " Come on , Manley , let 's take off . " " Shep , what were we talking about when we came in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several minutes neither one could remember . " It could n't ' ve been unimportant , " Manley laughed . " Oh  --  I remember . American writers . Here they come  --  there they go . " He sipped from the watered drink unprotestingly . " That 's it  --  wanted to finish my thought . " He closed his eyes , straining to bring the subject back into focus . " ' Merican writers , full o ' promise , tremendous promise ; when they die , still promising . Ca n't seem to keep their promises . Hart Cranes  --  all Hart Cranes , the best of ' em . Even Ernest . Ernest 's a promising writer . Maybe the most promising we ever had . " Suddenly his hand flew up in an ascending line . " European writers , like that  --  but ' merican writers , like this  --  " His hand checked its upward flight and nosedived back to the table . " Know why ? " " I think I do , " Shep said . " Their unrealistic approach to ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trouble with all our writers is they never read Marx . Poe , Melville , Dickinson , all of ' em frustrated'cause they did n't worship Marx .

Pottsville country club  --  wherever it is . Book 's a success  --  writer 's like a race-horse  --  moves up in class .

" Shep found it disconcerting , a little too much like having a corpse suddenly rise and deliver his own funeral oration , or , worse , perform his own autopsy . " Know what you 're thinking , " Manley said suddenly . " What ? " " Said I knew what you 're thinking . You 're thinking this old windbag 's deflated . Uprooted . Ausgespielt . ' Mong my souvenirs . Well , I may fool you , sweetheart , ' s Al Harper ' d say . I 'm not stewed  --  I mean I 'm not through . Oh , sure , I see it in your eyes , methinks he doth protest too much .

He must be thoroughly potted to have gone so far . In the early days he had told . Kissed and told . Told and written . But he knew better now . Could n't afford to waste words now . Or emotions , or energy . They were his stock in trade . Sorry , no free samples . Could n't give anything away any more . Had to keep careful inventory when you worked on narrow margin . Had to marshal his strength , get back on the routine he had started before he came on this damned picture . No drinking , no late hours , no wasted conversations with expendablepeople . No ( it was one of his most important words now ) sloth . Keep in training , concentrated , dedicated . A wreck , Shep was thinking self-righteously , a shell , a skeleton that will not give up the ghost and goes wandering through the capitalist wasteland . " Marcel ! " Manley was holding up his empty glass . " S'il vous plait . " " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get some air . I want to get out of here . I 'm feeling a little woozy myself . "  | " Okay , keed , let 's take off , as you say . As you say , let 's cut out . We got ta stick together , baby . We 're in this together , baby . We 'll travel along singin ' a song side by side . " Manley paid the check with a flourish , tipping the waiter , the captains and the headwaiter in an open-handed way that would have interested both Veblen and the family psychiatrist . At the check-room counter there was a bad moment when Manley insisted that he had come in with a topcoat and misplaced his ticket , but Shep managed to ease him out onto the street and hustle him into a cab . " Where to ? " asked the hacky in a guttural , discouraged voice . Before Shep could say Waldorf , Manley leaned forward . " EddieBell 's still open in Harlem ? " " Damn ' f I know , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , le 's take a look . " " Manley , we ca n't go up to Harlem tonight . " " We ca n't ? I can . " " Why do n't we do it on the way back ?

Two o'clock in the morning , go to bed , ca n't sleep , Jere 'd say le 's go up to Harlem . Went up in our pajamas once . Nigger cop tried to arrest us . We said we just came from a costume ball dressed as Time to Retire . Then we bought the nigger cop a drink and etcetera and ditto and at seven in the morning he came back to our place for scrambled eggs and started playing the piano and another party started that went on for two days .

Luther got kicked off the Force for being AWOL and made a lot of money bootlegging . Have n't seen him in  --  Lord  --  ten years . Almos ' half your lifetime . Seems like ten days . Goes so damn fast . " At the Waldorf Shep tried again . " Manley , do n't you think you might as well come in with me ? " " No , that 's what I do n't think . " " We have a hell of a lot to do . " " We 'll do it . Promise . Work with you when I get back . "  | " But , Manley , we 've had no sleep . We 'll fall apart . " " Miss Dillon 'll keep us alive with benzedrine .

And if Victor calls , tell ' im , tell ' im to get some sleep . " Shep shook his head , with a stylized look of resignation , and climbed into the cab . " Okay , " he said , in exactly the same tone Manley had used earlier in the evening , " Okay . "  |p187All  the way up to Harlem through the white hush of the park , Manley kept recalling fantasies of shrill Harlem nights in the era when Harlem was the gin-spangled corridor for all good citizens with early-morning itch . Their legendary antics , his and Jere 's and their twinkling friends ' , made him laugh in a way that was new to Shep but old and no longer familiar to Manley . The laughs they had had , the innocent laughter . People did n't laugh any more , just to be laughing ; now it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manley would n't let Shep pay for the cab . He pulled out a crushed handful of bills , selected one at random and flung it to the driver . It happened to be a five-dollar bill . " Manley , you ought to hang on to some of that money . " " ' Fi drove a cab , that 's how I 'd like to be paid . " From the entrance they could hear a small , sloppy combinationracing through a popular riff . " The Dipsy Doodle . " Steps led them down to a dark , red cave . There were just two couples in the place . It was a desolate pleasure-dome and the tinny , bogus jazz made it unbearably forlorn . " Place useta be jammed all the time . But Eddie ' d always put a table on the floor for us . " Manley closed his eyes listening to the old time din : say this stuff is n't half bad sometimes I 'm happy sometimes I 'm blue-hoo my disPOsition depends on you-hoo .. . A dapper , light-skinned Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a hurry and gave Manley not just a big but a warm hello . " Hello , Pops , you 're a sight for sore optics . " He held Manley at arms ' length and appraised him fondly , " Here 's my boy . Here 's a creature I approve mightily . " Shep had the feeling they were making more of it than had ever been really there , because the room was so empty and the glory so long gone.  |p188They  clustered around a small table where Eddie bought a round  --  " Your money 's no good here , Pops "  --  and another round while they talked remember-the-time and what-ever-happened-to ? Manley felt grateful to Eddie for remaining unchanged . These last ten had been fierce years , not doing anybody any good , an intense erosion eating away flesh and spirit . But here was Eddie Bell with the same smooth figure , face and line , apparently as cheerful a failure as , in more propitious and amoral days , he had been a success . " Eddie , " Manley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever forget that night The Gimp got it ? Le 's see , he was sitting right over there . " " You can still see the bullet holes , " Eddie said proudly . " The Gimp was a small-timer who tried to hold out on Schultz , " Manley explained to Shep , remembering how pleased he and Jere used to be when important mobsters came over to their table . " They 're so polite and so much more dignified than respectable people , " Jere had insisted . " We were all here one night when The Gimp came in with a blonde . " Manley insisted on telling the whole story . " Lucinda , " Eddie said with the accuracy of acute nostalgia . " Lucinda Edwards . Cute as a flute . She was fingering him for Schultz all the time . " " Let 's see  --  what was the band you had then , Eddie ? Oh , Kenny Watts and his Five Kilowatts . " " Man , you 've got a good rememory , " Eddie said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when something cracked and The Gimp started slipping down under the table . The band was playing a medley and , this you 'll never believe , but while the waiters were carrying The Gimp out the dancing went right on . And the tune the band had switched to  --  Kenny swore it was n't on purpose  --  was And Then My Heart Stood Still . " Eddie chuckled . " That was phony as Coney . But it happened just like Pops says . " " You wrote a short story around that , " Shep said . " Midnight Frolic . ' You got the whole crazy speakeasy era into that story . "  | " It was one of those things that just drops in your lap , " Manley said . " Wrote the whole thing in two hours when I got up that next afternoon . " " It won the O. Henry for the best story of the year , " Shep said . " Yeah man , we had the times , " Eddie Bell said . Grinning at Manley , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying couplesin the place was drinking nothing but beer . You could n't even pay this band with what you made in beer . " Come on , Pops , drink up , let us be gay . " Shep was drinking with them , from outside , watching them and wondering how much of this Manley could take . He seemed a little clearer than at 21 . Apparently the cool ride through the Park and Eddie Bell 's reminiscences , spiraling around them like confetti , had helped to revive him . He was slipping easily into the illuminative atmosphere that had flared up between him and Eddie Bell as if they were two matches struck together . The band was resting from its fruitless exertions . " Anything you want ' em to play , Pops ? " " Why Do I Love You ? " The words gurgled through his mind with their catchy rhymes that had always pleased him . " Pops , will you ever forget the night  --  we had a line of Sepia Sirens then and you and Mrs. H had just come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I was ? Mrs. H sneaked off to the dressing room and when the kids came stepping out , there she was . . . " " Eddie , you talk too much . " It caught Eddie with his guard lowered and brought him down to now . " Now , Pops , do n't snap your wig . I was just trying ... " " Aw , shut up . " " Pops , you all right ? You 're pretty far in the bag . " Manley ignored him . He had remembered something else . That same Arabian night . Some goings-on between Jere and Eddie Bell he had never been sure about . He had always been afraid she had taken Rimbaud 's vilification of the white race too much to heart.  |p190He  stood up from the . table and though he felt positive he had done so quietly , the chair fell over behind him . " Come on , let 's get out of here . " Manley came back to their rooms at the Waldorf shaken and depressed . What a wild-goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run up to any more ; it was just a sprawling dark ghetto now . " What y ' say we do a little work ? " If it had been two other people , Shep would have laughed . " Right now ? You know what time it is ? " " What 's difference ? I always used t ' work this time , early i ' the morning . Some my best work early i ' the morning . Come on , le 's get the damn thing over with . " " Manley , do n't you think we 'll feel more like it after a little shut-eye ? " " Damn you , always telling me what I should be feeling . One thing your time my time have in common  --  young men lecturingto old men . " " Lecturing , hell . I 've had too much myself to be able to keep my mind on our damned story . " " Hell with all this talking . Real writers get sick o ' talking . What y ' think I am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're both writers . What d' ya say we both sit down ' n start writing ? " " But what are we going to write ? " " Love on Ice . Le 's just sit down and write it . " " You mean both write it at the same time ? " " Sure . Le 's each write half . Le 's both go in separate rooms ' n write . Then in , say , two hours we c'n meet back here and piece it together . " Shep searched the gray , strained face for some sign that Manley meant to be humorous . But no such sign was to be found . At this moment Manley believed quite seriously in their ability to saw a plot in half . " But Manley . . . " The entire idea was so incredible that Shep could n't even devise a sensible protest . " Come on , le 's start ! Which half you rather take ? "  |p191For  no other reason than helplessness , Shep said , " Okay , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom with a sheaf of hotel stationery and , somehow falling in with the absurdity of it , began writing whatevercame into his head . To his surprise he found this madcap plan a little less senseless than it had sounded . Having to make words on paper forced him to characterize in more detail than he had in all the days of talking the story . Several times he paused to rebuild his highball from the bottle in the living room . Once he went to the threshold of Manley 's room and looked in . Manley , using the bed for a desk , was writing furiously . Dawn was just beginning to filter in when Manley suddenly appeared in the doorway of Shep 's room . He had a thick pad of stationery in his hand . If it had n't been insulin or a shot of something , the work had revived him . He was , obviously , delighted with what he had done . " Anywhere near through , Shep ? " " Well  --  I guess so . " " I think mine went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splice ' em together . " Shep was not at all sure they were even writing the same story , or the same characters , but , accepting topsy-turvy logic as one does in a dream , he followed along . " Now first you read yours , then I 'll read mine and then we 'll drive in a golden spike at the place where they connect , " Manley said . " just the way they joined the first railroad line in The Iron Horse . " Self-consciously , Shep read his section aloud , feeling more and more like a damn fool . But Manley listened seriously , sometimes nodding in agreement . It never seemed to occur to him that what Shep had written was an improvised jumble . When Shep finished , Manley said , " Well , it needs a little touchingup but it 's not too bad , " mixed himself another drink and began with an air importance to read his section . It rambled  --  at times incoherently , and it had practically nothing to do with any college musical they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoking a wonderland of evergreens in freshly fallen snow and the reckless laughter of bright-eyed girls , it was much toop192good for what they needed . But for what they needed , not nearly good enough . When Manley finished , Shep did not know what to say . It had the Halliday touch all right . Apparently the old boy had n't lost that magical gift of not being able to write a bad line . The only trouble was , it made no sense . As a future item for Halliday collectors it might have some value . But it was n't exactlywhat Victor Milgrim was expecting for his $2000 a week . " There , " Manley said . " I told you we were writers , did n't I , baby ? " " It 's  --  it 's got some nice feeling . " Shep struggled for an out . " I think we 've got a real heroine in Diane . " His voice was paced with an ebullience that made him sound youthful . " Could n't you feel her coming to life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who throw off restraints . Diane 's really a second cousin to Julia in Midnight Frolic . Your mentioning that tonight gave me the idea . " Shep said nothing but Manley was too pleased with himself , or , more kindly , too pleased with the motions of writing he had gone through , to notice . " I told you we could do it , baby . I told you if we just sat down to the writing we 'd be all right . " " Yes , you did , " Shep said . This was , as Sara would say , a major worry . What did Manley Halliday need , a cup of black coffee , or a whole new life ? " How 'd you like that line where Diane sees Toby make his jump , a giant bird plunging downward ' and so forth , that is n't bad prose , is it , baby ? " That he was supposed to be writing a bare outline for a film seemed entirely forgotten . He had gone home to prose style as an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It left Shep with a sense of confusion as to how he felt about Manley now . The morning light was insistent , unflattering ; their beards looked rougher , their clothes seedier . The morning light , tauntingShep with its irritable arithmetic , now added up to forty hours of fruitless wakefulness . The morning light led Manley in a happy daze to the little balcony outside the sitting room . It 's a hard job but I 'm getting it done , he was thinking . I 'm a craftsman , not a bohemian : I get things done . Shep watched him leaning on the railing in the hazy winter'sp193light . He must be weary to the breaking point after that last try . The bones were sharp in his face and from Shep 's point of view there was a terrifying illusion : the fine profile was bony and motionless as a death 's head . For two-and-a-half days  --  according to Shep 's impromptu recapitulation  --  he had thought about nothing else but Manley Halliday . At first he had thought about how to make himself attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was learning from Halliday , and how to say the things that would bring Halliday out . Then he had begun to wonder about Halliday , and criticize . Now he was worried about him . He had been looking out toward the balcony , thinking he ought to tell Manley to lie down and get some rest , when a streak of independence flared : the hell with it , nobody appointed me his keeper . He went on into his own bedroom and closed the door . Put Manley Halliday out of your mind . Why worry about a ruined man whose mind stopped with the clocks of Twentynine ? This business of thinking every man was an island . Could n't they see that just below the waterline they were all connected ? Should n't every honest writer feel himself inextricably bound to society , to his fellow-men ? How could he take off on a ten-year binge like Manley Halliday ? He shifted on the bed and tried to change the subject . This was n't getting away from Manley Halliday . But the ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become of him ? Closing his eyes , he could not close out Manley Halliday . How long had he known him ? Already the worshipful beginning , the awe seemed part of an earlier incarnation . He had known him always , always his intimate and confidant . All Shep could remember was that he had started out as a healthy , robust , relatively uncomplicated young man . Now he had lost the most luxurious of all youthful accomplishments  --  the ability to take sleep for granted . He shifted and tossed , felt his nerves hopping under his skin like sand-fleas , and slipped off into brief , disordered dreams only to twitch into wakefulness again.  |p194Slowly  Shep began to realize that he must have succumbed to sleep at last , for he was being awakened by a new , strange voice , a voice that sounded as if a man and a girl were using the same vocal cords . Someone was making a shrill accusation . Shep heard " drunk again " and " you 're a damn fake " and " you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . " " Now , Douglas , " Shep heard Manley trying to calm him , " now , Douglas . " " Why the heck should I spare your feelings ? When did you ever worry about me ? " Shep could n't resist putting his eye to the keyhole . He saw a tall , thin , boy who would soon grow into being handsome and who looked as if he had stepped out of Brooks ' pre-college display . A cigarette flipped into his mouth with adolescent casualness and Shep noticed that he could talk with it between his lips like an old hand . Even without seeing Manley , Shep knew how disturbed he was . When he was able to get a word in , his voice was low and strained . From what he had told Shep he was deeply concerned for Douglas , anxious that he become a " useful , integrated human being " and he probably wished this even more keenly than most fathers because of his guilt at having failed Douglas in the formativeyears . " What 's the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding . " What kind of meatball do you take me for ? How do you think I feel when the Bursar 's office calls me in and asks me if my father knows my tuition is two months overdue ? Tells me you have n't even answered their letters ! Holy Cow , I 'd rather quit and get a job selling cars or something . " " Douglas , there is to be no more talk about leaving school . " " Well  --  I 'm disgusted , " Douglas said . " One of the reasons I 'm making such an effort to write for Hollywood is to be sure you finish your education . " " Maybe if you did n't drink so much it would n't have to be such an effort . " " Douglas , I  --  I can not allow you to talk to me that way . "  | " Aah  --  look at you  --  you 're drunk right now . You never did anything for me in your whole life . " Listening behind the door , Shep was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brat could n't talk to him that way , not to Manley Halliday . One more crack out of Douglas and he was tempted to go out and punch the kid 's face in . Douglas was talking about Mother now . From the way he capitalized and softened the word , one could tell what had happened to Douglas . " God knows you 've made Mother 's life a holy hell . It makes me sick when I see how she has to worry about money . And all the time you 're spending it on flit and some Hollywood floosie . I 'll never understand  --  never understand why you left Mother in the first place . " Manley came within range of the keyhole for the first time . Apparently the pain had sobered him . If only he did n't look so run-down , Shep thought possessively . The shapeless suit , the bristled face , the stupefied look . " Douglas . " Manley shut his eyes a moment in weariness . " Of course I respect you for standing by your mother . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed in you if you did n't . " Douglas waited with his mouth open a little to relieve the tension . It was easier when his father fought back . " ' Parently your mother has discussed me with you . More sorry than I can tell you that you have to be dragged into adult sit-u-ations . " He had to pick his way very carefully not to stammeror slur . " You are remarkably sophis-ticated for sixteen . Nev ' theless I suggest there may be certain ' motional problems that are still beyond your  --  comprehension . " It would have been more impressive if Manley had n't had a tendency to stagger and to try so hard not to soften the edges of the consonants . " Aw , if you were a man you 'd go back to Mother and take care of her . " " Ah , Douglas , it 's not so simple as all that . " " Sure it is n't simple "  --  suddenly rising hysterically , Douglas '  |p196voice  sounded even younger than sixteen  --  " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quietly , " If you were not my son , and you were a few years older , I would have to Punch you in the nose for saying that . " " Go on , go on , " the young voice screamed , " try it anyway  --  I 'll  --  I ' 11  --  I 'll  --  " Then Shep heard an unexpected sound . Douglas was sobbing . Manley put his arms around him . He held him like a small boy . " Why do things have to be so damned lousy ? " he sobbed . " If only you and Mother had stayed together . " Families , Shep was thinking behind the door , hating each other without ever having stopped loving each other . So it all ended with Manley consoling Douglas , telling him not to worry and giving him some extra spending money for the week-end . " I 'll pay up that tuition the minute I get next Wednesday'scheck . Why do n't you go in my bathroom and wash your face ? " A soft family ending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the corridor close behind Douglas , he wondered what he should do . To burst right in on Manleywould be too obvious . But he thought  --  perhaps Manley needs me . Or was that only what he wanted to think ? He was still trying to make up his mind when Manley came in . Manley looked drunk again . He had this strange ability to go in and out of sober focus . It must have been a terrible effort to hold himself in for Douglas ; now he was going slack . " Suppose you heard the whole bloody business ? " Shep nodded . " Sorry you had to hear that . ' Pologize . " Shep heard himself muttering broken , meaningless assurances . Manley slumped to a bowed sitting position on the bed . " Lad , " he said almost inaudibly , " if you 'll fetch me a drink I 'll give you half my kingdom . " When Shep brought it to him , Manley 's hand was shaking so badly that the top of the highball slurped over onto his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to explain . " Just nerves.  |p197Damned  sugar balance all shot . " He tried to rise above it . " I 'm quivering inside like a Model T. " " That 's an awful lot to take . " " My fault . Poor kid 's confused . Do n't blame ' im . We 've led him a merry chase . Jere and I both . He 's just bouncing all his resentmentoff me . " " But , hell , he 's old enough to know . " The corners of Manley 's mouth began to turn up in an effort to smile that made him look even sadder . " You 've probably forgottenalready . An adolescent 's the most conservative citizen there is . Wants everything to stay just as he finds it . Sixteen-yearold'sa moralist . When he says , Mama Love Papa he is n't kidding .

An ' the hell of it is it 's too late to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him any day , " Shep said . " You 're  --  I ca n't exactly explain what I mean . My old man flies off the handleand thinks with his blood pressure . " It was strange to be considered anybody 's father , Manley thought . He never stepped up to a full-length mirror without beinga little shocked at the middle-aged image . He could not shake the obsession that middle age had ambushed him unfairly . Nearly all of his life he had been such a very young man , the very model of a very successful very young man . Now suddenly here he was , middle aged , old enough to be a young man 's father . But inside he was n't ready . Inside , he had n't done enough growing up . Oh , he would have to hurry , hurry to catch up with himself . " Gee whiz , " Shep said , " almost forgot . We have to see Milgrim in fifteen minutes . " Manley shook his head . " This morning I would n't keep an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , we ca n't stand Milgrim up , can we , Manley ? " " If that 's a question  --  yes , we can . Get him on the phone . Tell him we worked all night and  --  wait a minute , do it myself . " It suddenly had become a question of honor with him . He was alwayshaving to prove to himself that he was not a timid man . Since when did he have to hide behind a boy ? Who did Milgrimp198think he was , pushing him around as if he were a beginner like Stearns ? He would set Milgrim straight , in a quiet , dignified way . " The more you push them around , the more respect they have for you  --  I know how they think , " Manley said to Shep while he was getting Milgrim on the phone . But when he talked to Milgrim  --  Shep noticed and Manley was a little disgusted by it himself  --  the independence he had meant to assert was diluted by a self-protective sense of caution that was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind I 'd like to duck the conference this morning ... You know , to be perfectly frank , conferences are n't my metier . I 'm a writing man , Victor , guess you know that . . . Yes , yes , we 've been working " ( here self-contempt set in as he heard himself sinking into the great mass of screen writers alibiing , fawning , selling ) " all night  --  we 've got an outlineon paper ... " What was meant to be a pause became extended silence . Milgrimwas doing the talking . Shep saw Manley close his eyes . Shep could hear the loud , positive voice of Milgrim on the other end . To the young man it was a charade of injustice , that Manley Halliday should have to sit there and take it from Victor Milgrim . Suddenly he heard Manley say , " Victor , I 've always been a man of my word . I 'll be on that train this afternoon if you insist . But I wish you 'd let me wait here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure he can fill me . . . " Then Milgrim took over again . Occasionally Manley would attempt to break in and when he did so he sounded half exasperated , half intimidated : " Yes , it 's not that , but . . . " " Of course , Victor , of course , but I just thought I could be . . . " Finally he said , " All right , Victor , I 'll be on the train . Yes , I 'm feeling all right , a little weary of course , but . . . " He was interrupted again , and then he said , trying to pitch his voice smartly again , " Aye , aye sir , " and hung up . He avoided Shep 's eyes . He was n't at all sure how he was goingto manage . The trip would be an ordeal and the script a terrifying chore , but there was not the slightest doubt in his mind that he would survive both and go on to the come-backp199novel . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in danger of losing himself , Shep 's admirationand knowledge of his work helped him become Manley Halliday again . " Remember , we 're in this together , baby . Do n't leave me alone up there . I 'm going to need plenty of moral support . " " Even a little physical support if you do n't lay off the booze . " Shep thought it was time to put it to him . For a moment Shep thought Manley might lose his temper .. But all he said was , " All right , I guess you can talk to me like that . " He had a way of popping a cigarette up out of the pack that Shep associated with old-fashioned collegiana . God , he was old-fashioned . A fascinating relic . " I 'll tell you the truth , Shep , " he said gravely . " I had n't had a drink for nearly eight months before I took on this job . That 's why it sort of knocked me off my trolley when we started on the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dr , Ruhin 's hands and go into my health routine again . Now that I 've started , the only way I 'll ever get through the week-end is with the help of God and my friends Haig and Haig . For God 's sake , stay with me , Shep . Stay with me and I think I 'll be all . right " " Sure , I 'll stay with you , Manley . " " Le 's go over that deathless prose we wrote las ' night and see how it stands up in the cold , crass light of day , " Manley said . " But first le 's have one little drink to two intrepid explorers on the eve of their departure for the frozen North . " They held up their glasses and touched them with the mock formality of two vodka-happy officers of the Czar . " To us and the frozen north , " Shep said . " Mush . " " Tha 's what we got ta write , " Manley said brightly , as if it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trainload of houseparty girls , girls of sixteen and eighteen ; here and there a sleek , smart veteran of twenty-one ; girls in bright colors and bright smiles , whose perfume and laughter transformed the Pullman into an Ivy League harem , charged with the special kind of excitement that only a very young woman can feel as she looks forward to the company of a preferred young man . If all brides are beautiful , Shep found himself paraphrasing , so are all houseparty dates . From behind the lavatory door of their drawing room , Shep heard the miserable sound for which up-chuck is mild onomatopoeia . A few moments later Manley appeared . He took a quick glance out at the aisle and said , in a weak voice , " Ah , the sweet young lambs going forth to slaughter . " " Manley , are you all right ? " Manley made a drunken face of reassurance . " Stay with me , baby , just stay with me . " From the baggy pocket of his shapeless suit , Manley produced a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have a drink , kiddo . " " Where in hell did you pick that up ? " " Old pro'bition training . When in doubt , ask the bellboy . " " But was n't I with you all the time ? " Manley put his finger to his lips roguishly . " P'fessional secret . " Victor Milgrim appeared in the entrance . He was wearing one of the soft brown tweeds he had bought in London the previousfall . He brought a fine , tangy scent of expensive cologne into the stale little room . As an apparent concession to the collegiateatmosphere he had given up his cigars for a straight richly grained Dunhill . He was all aglow with self-conscious good taste and self-satisfaction . The perfection of his dress and his toilet made Shep feel scaly and dissolute . " Are n't these girls terrific ! " Milgrim said . " Such youth . Suchp201freshness . It 's a tonic . Now do n't you see , Manley , why I insisted on your coming along ? " Manley looked at him expressionlessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've seen prom trotters before . Wrote a story called Prom Trotter , ' long , long ago . Las ' word on the subject . You pro'ly never read it . " Milgrim 's eyes went sharp and cold . But his voice was still respectful . " You and I are old codgers , Manley . These girls are a  --  a new race . No more gin and sex . These girls are healthy , realists , future mothers ... " " Crap , " Manley said under his breath . Shep did not like the look in Manley 's eyes . " Our picture has to give the audience the same feeling we get as we walk through these aisles , the same lift , the same sense of ... " Milgrim 's eloquence outran his vocabulary. " ... of cute little tits , " Manley said . " Why do n't you say what you mean , Victor ? " " You woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning , " Milgrim said . Into his face came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't wake up on any side . " It was a little pathetic , Shep thought , the way Manley drew himself erect , drew his dignity around him like a tattered coat . " Victor , we might as well have this out right now . I am not used to being talked to as if I were "  --  ( the pause , a beat too long , weakened the effect Manley was trying for ) " some frightened little screenwriter . " " Why , Manley , where 's your sense of humor ? " Milgrim gave a little ground . " My sense of humor lives its own life , " Manley said . " Right now it 's pro'ly on another train , going west . " " Come on , " Milgrim said , " walk through the cars with me . It 'll do you good . I want you to breathe in the atmosphere  --  it 's terrific atmosphere ! " Manley turned to Shep . " Go with the man . Breathe in some of that terrific atmosphere for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Milgrim cunningly . " You know , Victor , we had trains in my houseparty days too . And the female anatomy has n't changed appreciably . "  | " Seems to me a writer  --  an author  --  would want to keep up to date . " " Victor , believe me , " Manley said persuasively . " Maybe their figures have changed a little , And their clothes . Maybe they call a girl on the make a fast-worker instead of a speed . Or maybe they even have a new word for it I have n't picked up yet . But underneath the new styles and the new expressions , they 're still the same little savages they were in my time . " " All right , Manley , " Milgrim conceded , " we 'll see you later . " " At your service , sir , " Manley said . The bow was more mockingnow . " And remember , Victor , do n't go around pinching their little bottoms . This is n't Hollywood . " Milgrim frowned and went out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't let him intimidate you . Stay here and talk to me . " " One of us better keep him happy , " Shep said . " When I want to go through a train brushing up against nice little sixteen-year-olds , I 'll do it , " Manley said . " But I 'll be damned if I call it research . " " Be back in a little while . Now take it easy . " " Do n't worry , baby . I wo n't disgrace us . " In the corridor outside the drawing room , Milgrim looked around carefully and then said suddenly , " Has Manley been drinking ? " Shep fought back an hysterical impulse to laugh . " Oh , we 've had a few highballs  --  nothing to speak of . " He kept his eyes away from Milgrim because as a liar he was hopelessly without talent . " His agent said Manley had given him his word of honor that he was permanently on the wagon . " " We 've been pushing pretty hard , Mr. Milgrim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to hire him because I was afraid of this damned drinking , " Milgrim said . " I suppose you know he 's a post-graduatedipso . They say one drink and he 's off for months . " Shep thought of Sara 's champagne and the way he had urged Manley to that first ceremonial drink . " Hell , someone might have warned me. "  | " I thought everybody knew , " Milgrim said . " For God 's sake , do n't let him drink any more . " " Christ , I 'm not a male nurse . " " But you seem to be hitting it off . I know he resents me . Some sophomoric idea of his  --  a fix in his mind of the ignoramus producer . I could fire him right now and get Ben Hecht to jump in and save it  --  but I 'd rather not . That would finish him in Hollywood . And I know he needs the money . " " I 'll do what I can , " Shep said , thinking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milgrim . He 's moving up into the Ivy League . Maybe he 's bucking for an honorary degree . Manley Halliday , one of the few living American authors whose works are recognized by English professors , is the calling card . " Shortly after we arrive , " Milgrim said , " the English Departmentis giving a reception for Manley . I want you to make it your job to see that he 's dressed and shaved and coherent . " " There 'll be an extra charge for valet service . " Shep was tired enough to speak his mind . " Save your humor for the script . I know how much work you 've done so far . I 'd fire you right now if I did n't think you had some influence with Manley . " Shep wanted to talk up  --  a fighting speech about a man 's pride and the degradation of the marketplace . But he thought of Sara , and of his ambition to do Informers and Deeds . And then there was Manley . On the flight east he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now he had begun to sense the dim outlines of a prolonged struggle . What sense was there in standing up to Victor Milgrim if that only further undermined the cause of Manley Halliday ? So a bitter " Thanks " was all he said . Milgrim led him down the aisle . " Take a good look at them , listen to them . Get the feel of them . " Shep was following him automatically . There were girls stretched out across Pullman seats , girls giggling together , girls playing cards , girls chattering . There was a girl waxing skis , a girl combing and combing her hair , a girl knitting , a girl reading Screen Romance . There was even a girl reading Rainer Maria Rilke . There was a sixteen-year-old siren with honey-colored hairp204who eyed them . There was a tall , dark girl who looked Spanish and had marvelous breasts . But at this moment nothing was vivid but the strained , wretched face of Manley Halliday hanging over the little toilet in the drawing room . " Look  --  over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Carole Lombard ! " Milgrim went through the Pullman making snap-judgment discoveries . " Excuse me , miss . Allow me to introduce myself . Victor Milgrim . " When the name did n't take as quickly as he had hoped , he added , " Victor Milgrim , of World-Wide . " " Glad to meet you , " the youngster said , " I 'm Margie Hart of Minsky 's . " Milgrim laughed uncomfortably . " We 'll be making some shots at the Mardi Gras and I 'd like to spot you in a couple . It would be a sort of screen test . " " You mean you want little me for Hollywood ? " the girl said . " If you photograph  --  and I certainly think you should . " She struck a mock glamour pose . Milgrim had picked himself a sharp one . " Do my eyes sparkle too much for pictures ? " " Seriously , young lady , I would n't have taken the trouble to come over if I did n't think you had possibilities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnard , my old man 's on the faculty there , and he 'd kick my derriere from here to Hobokenif I took you seriously . " Milgrim smiled defensively , asked her to call him at Webster Inn if she changed her mind , and , relatively undaunted , went on down the aisle . " See what I mean ? " he told Shep . " Fresh personalities . Fresh dialogue . Full of that new spirit . " In the next car Victor Milgrim discovered a young Kay Francis , a young Katharine Hepburn and a young Irene Dunne . There was even a demure child from Miss Wadleigh 's who impressed him as a young Janet Gaynor . Shep passed a nondescript girl who might have been anybody and said , " Look . A young Marie Dressler . " Milgrim looked reproachful . Then he saw a girl who was really startling , with soft yellow hair , peach complexion and enormous blue eyes . " A young  --  a young Dolores Costello ! "  |p205Milgrim  gasped . When he introduced himself she was all dimplesand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She turned out to be a professional model from Conover 's who had come up from Savannah to go on the stage . Her name was Savannah Castle . Milgrim told her to look him up at WebsterInn . She would simply adohre to . Milgrim felt better when he moved on . This was more like home . " See what I mean  --  a fresh face ! " Shep wondered how Milgrim could reconcile his quest for freshness with his search for younger carbon copies of established stars . But he went along in silence . " This is why we should all get out of Hollywood every so often , " Milgrim said . " No matter how creative we are , we need to meet new people , new ideas  --  there 's nothing like outside stimulation . " Thus Victor Milgrim walked from one end of the train to the other , eyeing the girls and feeling better and better . On the way back he smiled and bowed to Savannah . Her little pink hand fluttered up to her hard , magnificent mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Milgrim said . " I wonder if our publicity man could fix it for her to be Queen of the Mardi Gras . Make a nice tie-in for the picture . " Back at their drawing room at last , Milgrim said , " Shep , you know a little bit about this business . We 'll have a camera crew waiting for us in the morning . You 've got to give them some idea where the main scenes are going to be played so they can pick up their backgrounds for the transparencies . You 'd better see to it that Manley gets on the ball . You can use Peggy if you want to dictate tonight . " " We hired a secretary from the hotel . She 's on the train some-where . " That had been a last-minute whim of Manley 's , to bring Miss Waddell along . Miss Waddell was a large , eager woman in her late forties who had not been out of New York since she had arrivedthere , for some reason long since forgotten , from Kansas City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because he sensed that this would be the most exciting thing that had happened to her since a man followed herp206through lower Central Park in the Spring of Twenty-six , Mani ley had insisted that she accompany them . " I do n't care how you do it , just so long you two geniuses come up with a workable line by the time we get in , " Milgrim said . When he found their drawing room empty , Shep was mildly alarmed . Searching through the adjoining car , he thought he recognized Manley 's voice behind the dark-green curtain of the men 's room . Inside , surrounded by smoke and a group of natty , good-looking , junior executive types , Webster men , vintage thirtyfive , - six and - seven , there he was , passing around the last of the gin . Shep recognized Gene Hoffman , a big , blond boy who had won his block W in football three successive years without ever making first-string . Gene had been one of those aberrant athleteswith a restless , second-rate mind , who begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . In Shep 's class , Gene had been elected president of the Socrates Society . As a result Gene had passed from the halls of Webster to his bond salesmanship with a swollen idea of his intellectuality . Four years beyond the academic life , he still took himself seriously . Shep shook hands with Hoffman , who had put on twenty-five pounds since they had last seen each other at Commencement . After the stylized classmate repartee , Hoffman said , " This joker is trying to tell us he 's Manley Halliday . " Hoffman 's chums , going back for Mardi Gras in holiday spirits , would have laughed if they had been a little more certain who Manley Halliday was . Manley glared at Hoffman . " Wha ' I have t ' do t ' convince you I 'm Manley Halliday  --  write you a goddam novel while you wait ? " Hoffman winked to the boys superiorly . " Look , old man , I saw Manley Halliday once . He spoke to the Socrates Society . " " Nnn , nnn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college students . Sure it was n't William Lyon Phelps ? " " No , I do n't think so , " Hoffman said , but he was less sure now . He had lost touch with these things since going downtown.  | " I still think it was Halliday , " Hoffman said . " No , Gene , it was John V. A. Weaver , " Shep said . " Weaver , that 's right ! " Hoffman said . " What got me mixed up was you both used to write for College Humor . " One of Halliday 's serials and a few of his stories had run in College Humor , a lot of quick , bet I c'n tell you the las ' book you finished . " " Mind reader , huh ? " Hoffman laughed . " Do you want a blindfold , or are you blind enough without it ? " " The Yearling , " Manley said . " By God , what 've you got in that gin  --  you 're right ! " Hoffmansaid . " And the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  Rebecca . " " Little man , you win the daily double , " Hoffman said . " I know everything about you  --  your reading habits , your sex habits , your mental capacities , the extent and the limits of your ambition , " Manley said . " My , my , you should get yourself a job in a 42nd Street Flea Circus telling fortunes . " It bothered Sep that Hoffman confused what Manley was sayingwith the way he looked . " Come on , Manley , let 's go back to our room . " " No kidding , Shep , you mean this is really Manley The Night 's High Noon Halliday ? " Under the surface of Hoffman 's contempt was a worn lining of admiration . " No  --  ' low me t ' introduce myself , " Manley said . " Zane Grey 's the name . An ' this is Boola-boola , my Tahitian baitboy . " Hoffman laughed , but not with Manley . " He 's like one of the screwball characters in his own books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Manley said . " Come on , Manley , let 's go , " Shep begged . " What'sa hurry ? " Manley said . " In'eresting case , Hoffman . Gets a liberal arts education if fit him for business that 's as far removed ' s possible from liberals an ' art . " " Look who 's talking , a fugitive from the Twenties , " Hoffmansneered . " You jokers went off on one long tear and left usp208to pay the check . And you do n't seem to know yet that the party 's over . " " How you 've suffered ! " Manley said . " Bet the only time you 've worked up a sweat since college is when your boss takes you to the Racquet Club to play handball with you  --  and you let him win . And I bet the boss has a daughter or a niece who goes for good-looking husky blonds who used to play Ivy League football . And one of these days you 'll be a junior partner . And you 'll be faithful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ha ha ha , " Hoffman said , not liking it at all . " With a plot like that you ought to be able to buy yourself a clean suit . " " Use if have fifty suits , " Manley said . " Lot o ' damn foolishness . Use t ' think appearance was important . " " I can see you 've reversed yourself on that one , pal , " Hoffman said , winking at the chums and directing their laughter at the stained , baggy suit . " Better'n buying clothes y'ca n't really afford , " Manley said . " I know ya , Hoffman . Y'have n't changed . Pro'ly do n't get over five hundred a month . " " So this is the great Halliday . What 'd they call you  --  the spokesman for your generation ? Boy , your generation ought to buy you back and keep you under cover . " Hoffman 's two hundred and thirty pounds draped in an immaculatepin stripe seemed to be crushing down on Halliday . " All right , Gene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell are you , his bodyguard ? " Shep would have to spot him fifty pounds but there was a lot of fat on Hoffman . " Yeah , " he said . " As of right now I am . " " I 've heard about you Hollywood tomboys , " Hoffman said , very ready . " Do n't need anybody if fight my battles , " Manley said . " Know how much I make , Hoffman ? Two thousan ' a week . Three hundred ' an ' thirty three dollars a day ... " Shep felt painfully embarrassed , but Manley was insulated behind a child 's pride . " Even Shep makes twice as much as you do . An ' I  --  did I tell ya how much I make  --  two thousan ' dollars a week . " The prolonged sleeplessness and drinking seemed to havep209shrunken him . He looked very small and emaciated as he sat there among the young grads in the men 's room holding up his little boasts like half-inflated balloons . " Oh , sure , you Hollywood bigshots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me , do all great authors go to Hollywood when they die ? " Manley rose , his small hands clenched , his face bloodless and taut . " Why , you young snotnose ! Nobody c'n say that to me . Don ' care how big he is . . . " " Put your hands down , Halliday , " Hoffman said , " or I 'll swat you like a gnat . " There was a terrible expression on Manley 's face . " Come on , you sonofabitch . Not afraid o ' you . Use ' t ' hold my own with Freddy Welsh . " " Who the hell was he ? " The insult to Freddy Welsh drove Manley to violence . He threw a wild punch that Hoffman easily avoided . " Do n't get me mad , " Hoffman warned . Shep felt a nightmare closing in like an ether cone over his face . He forced himself between them and grabbed Hoffman 's arms . " Go on , beat it , Gene . Leave him alone , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoffman . " Manley , you take it easy coo , " Shep said . With his body checking Hoffman , he turned to pin Manley 's arms . " Leggo , I 'll box his ears off , " Manley insisted . " The great Manley Halliday , " Hoffman sneered . " Stinkin ' as a skunk and twice as drunk . " " Disappear , Gene , " Shep said . " All right , I 'll leave you two geniuses to earn your hundred dollars a minute , " Hoffman said . Manley sank down against the leather seat . His head was heavy . His chin came to rest on his chest . In the silence they could hear the idiotic rhythm of the spinning wheels and the flirtatious laughter of young men and women passing in the corridor . " Manley , I 'm no Freddy Welsh , but I 'm going to start getting tough . " " Do n't lash me , baby . I feel lousy enough . "  | " It 's your own goddam fault . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All my fault . All the things ' at happened , my fault . Pick people who destroyyou  --  it 's second degree self-destruction . " " Manley , listen to me . I 've got to score on this job . I ca n't slide by on a famous name . Keep on like this and we 'll both get the heaveroo . " " Heaveroo ? Never heard o ' that word . You make it up ? ' r is it generic ? " " Manley , forget all that . Forget everything but Love on Ice . You 've got to concentrate . Quit drinking , quit thinking , and con-centrate . " " All right . All right , Shep . All right . All right , baby . All right ... " " How about some coffee ? " " All right . " " A little food with it ? " Manley shook his head . " No food  --  stomach feel lousy . " His head rolled on his chest . " I 'll be thinkin ' ' bout the story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shep touched his shoulder . " Manley , you ca n't sleep here . If you want to sleep , let 's go back to the ... " Manley sat upright . " Sleep ? Who wants if sleep ? Let 's work . Let 's get the damn story straightened out . Where 's Miss Waddell ? Le 's dictate to Miss Waddell . " " Okay , I 'll look for her . Will you meet me back at the drawing room ? " " Shsure . " Miss Waddell was n't in her seat or in the diner and Shep was afraid to search further for fear of leaving Manley alone too long . Manley was n't in the drawing room when Shep returned . Shep found him still in the men 's room , half sitting , half lying on the long leather seat , his eyes closed , his mouth open , breathing heavily . Shep was n't sure whether to wake him and get him back to the drawing room or to let him enjoy the first nap he had had since leaving Hollywood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Manley 's voice startled him . " All righ ' , meeting ' 11 come to or/der . " Manley still had n't opened his eyes . " You 're suppose ' t ' be a clever young man . Why don ' you come up with a brigh ' idea ? " " I do have one new notion I thought I might try on you . Manley , are you listening ? " " Shsure , shsure , I 'm all ears , " Manley said , suddenly smiling . " It 's just a stab in the dark but it might work . What if the boy , Joe , stops near one of those schools where the girls are supposed to go out and get practical training every so often . You know , Antioch , or Bennington . So the waitress in the diner , Gretchen , or Diane , is really the daughter of the President of Webster . Joe goes for her and tells her all about Webster , thinking he 's impressingher with being a college man . She plays dumb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped that some clay she 'd meet a Webster man , she 's heard so much about the Mardi Gras . So Joe winds up asking her to the Mardi Gras and when he gets back to school he tells his fraternity brothers about it . He 's playingit strictly for kicks  --  as a kind of practical joke on the typical upper-class chicks who always show up for Mardi Gras . He even thinks he can fix it to run her in as Queen . Manley , are you listening ? I think maybe this 'll work . Now , when Gretchen , or Diane , gets to Webster , the first thing she does is . . . " " Wait . Got a better idea . " Manley 's eyes were half closed and his head still lay against the back of the seat ; the beginnings of a smile pulled at the corners of his mouth . " ' Stead of the President having one beautiful daughter , le 's give him twelve .

" Manley opened his eyes and chuckled . " In the whole , I mean old days Ben Turpin would ' ve been great for the College President . Or Chester Conklin . " " Who 'll play the twelve daughters ? " " Anita Louise , " Manley said . Feeling a little guilty for encouraging him , as with a disobedientchild who draws attention from his own misdeeds by being consciously , precociously " cute , " Shep had to laugh . " Maybe we could get Chaplin for the President . Always wanted t ' write something for Chaplin . Anita Louise would 've made Charlie an ideal dream girl . I mean a dream ideal girl . Edna Purviance .

Real art , real tragedy , only tragedy I ever saw in the movies . That face on Charlie . The pain . I c'n see it right now . All his pictures , same idea , the dream 's a beautiful balloon , a kid 's balloon an ' reality 's a sharp point on a fence . The balloon drifts over into the forbidden garden , hits the point ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back where we were . Chaplin 's the only one saw the movie as the bes ' medium in the worl ' for dreams , the child being the father , the tramp beingthe millionaire , the homely little bum being the elegant Don Juan . Jere ' n I were Chaplin fans in Paris right after the war.  |p213Saw  he was the mos ' serious way back when he was playing slapstick . ' Member one picture little one-reeler , ca n't even ' memberthe name of it . Charlie 's a drunk being dragged along , grabs a bush as he struggles , finds a daisy in his hand . Daisy changes mood entirely . Becomes a poet , a dreamer , an aesthete . So convincingit looks like impro  --  improvisation an ' when you think of Charlie as a child not even unrealistic , you know the way a little boy sees a toy boat an ' becomes a boat captain , picks up a gun an ' goes right into character of a soldier . See what I mean ? Do n't think of Charlie as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting like a grownup . Like The Gold Rush . Jere ' n I saw it five times , wrote a ' preciation of it for Vanity Fair . If movies did n't die so fast it 'd be considered a permanent classic like Hamletor Cyrano . Funny as hell on the surface and full of inner meanings an ' the idea , the Gold Rush , just when the whole country was rushing for gold . Money crazy . One of the signs of an artist is his sense of contemporaneity  --  did n't say it right , you know what I mean  --  without going opportunist . Like my books . Lot of writers tried to cap'alize on the era . You know , cheap books about jazz babies n ' bootleggers . Some of ' em got serious review in their time . My books were lit up with the light of our time because that was n't what I was trying to do . I mean not consciously but  --  how the hell did I get talking about myself ? Thought I was talking about Charlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his comedies  --  that 's how true they are . No good work of art I mean there 's no good work worthwhile work of art without the artist 's exposing himself . You ' n I f'r'instance , Love on Ice is n't us , that 's why it 's so hard to concentrate , easier to write something good than somethinklike that . Only two kinds of writing come easy , when you 're a real writer ' xpressing yourself or when you 're a natural hack an ' have n't got any self to ' xpress . " He paused finally . " Damn . Ca n't stay on the subject . Whatsa matter with me ? Charlie Chaplin . Notice how there 's always a great big brute of a man pushing little Charlie around  --  prospector in Gold Rush , millionaire in City Lights , employer in Modern Times , always the same father image , switching suddenly from love to hatred of Charlie like the millionaire picks him up when he 's drunkp214takes him home lovingly tucks him in , then sobers up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father , whether Charlie sees it or not . All Charlie 's pictures full of it . Psychiatrist c 'd do a helluva book on Charlie 's movies . Thought of it myself . Another of the things I left undone but I was too much of a layman even though I read a lot about it trying to figure out Jere . Read so much about it it was no use being analyzed . Just enough knowledge to make a bum patient an ' an '  --  " he faltered  --  " what 'm I talking about . . . ? " " The Chaplin movies . . . " " ... do n't switch from comedy to tragedy . No phony , mechanicalchange o ' pace . The funniest parts , the parts where you laugh the loudest , are tragic . That 's where the genius comes in . .. " " But is n't there more to Chaplin than a comic interpretation of the Oedipus Complex ? " Shep interrupted . " Now in Modern Times  --  " Seeing that Manley was only coherent enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater effort of listening , Shep stopped abruptly . And Manley went on talking , like a man hypnotized , in an automatic stream : " Jere and I talked to Charlie when we were out there about writing a story for him . It was an idea Jere had . She wanted me to write it with her . Almost did it . Charlie was interested for a while . Hollywood was  --  a lot crazier then than it is now  --  more of a factory town now . But in those days it was  --  it had the quality of a vulgar fairy land . There were wonderful parties that lasted for days and there was a nice sense of sin that 's only found in worlds of true innocence . The girls were  --  Lord  --  they were beautiful and the leading men looked the way leading men are supposed to look in a salesgirl 's dream . Tall dark and handsome and completely unreal . When you have men playing leads , even becoming stars , who are n't conventionallydreamily handsome , it means the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic as all hell . Even though we thought of ourselves as terribly realistic . Oh , we knew the facts of life . We called a spade a spade . We were n't a-Freudp215of anything , Jere said once . It was a shameful pun but it made a kind of sense ... " Manley rubbed both hands up and down his face from his hairline to his mouth as if he were washing . " Oh , hell , What am I-talking about ? " Shep was n't sure whether to say Jere or The Twenties or Chaplin or Hollywood or For Christ sake go to bed . Was ManleyHalliday ( the ominous way Milgrim had said it ) a dipsomaniac ? Shep had known some heavy drinkers but he realized that dipsomania was still an abstract apprehension . What did dipsomaniacs do ? Shep had nervous visions of urinating in publicplaces , of committing rape , of stabbing friends with bread knives , of falling off trains , of challenging a dozen stevedores to suicidal combat ; an alcoholic maniac . But Manley , at least now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , , but actually seemed to grow more gentle , and in some ways more sensible , than he had been at the beginning , despite the rambling and the thickening tongue and the heavy lids . Shep lit his pipe and settled down to listen , resignedly at first , but sympathetically and then with increasing fascination as ManleyHalliday , a ghost figure on a phantom train , went back and back and back in restless search of Manley Halliday.  |p216We  ca-me out for the opening of High Noon at Grauman 's . Mona Moray  --  she played Lenore  --  let us use that fantastic castle of hers in Beverly Hills . We thought it was going to be awful and that we 'd only stay a week , but scads of New York friends had come out and we found a lot of the Hollywood people were fun , in a mad way , like Mickey Neilan and Pringie , Aileen Pringle . We never thought we 'd stay so long . We were really on our way to Hawaii  --  some friends of ours who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when everyone was pressing wonderful houses on us . I have a perfectly marvelous house for you to write in , ' they 'd say . Of course no one needs marvelous houses to write in . I still knew that much . All you needed was one room . But somehow the next house always beckoned . Everybody was waiting for my next book then . My publishershad announced it two years before , when High Noon was still selling . And each time we settled somewhere I found a new excuse for not writing it . A good excuse . There were too many people around . And I wanted to go back and take another look at America , at the Kansas City I was trying to write about ( it was one of those books I never finished ) . And there were magazinestories to write  --  it was such an easy way to make twentyfivehundred dollars  --  and we were always short . The year I made sixty thousand , I had to borrow from my publisher . One time when we were very broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mediterranean I locked myself in for a week and wrote four short stories and got ten thousand dollars . They were good stories too . I could n't do anything badly then . It took me years to reach the point where I could do things badly . There were other reasons , of course . There is never a simple reason for not writing a book or not writing your best . It 's fear ,  |p217it  's greed , it 's sloth  --  I suppose I suffered from all of these . It was Jere , too . Oh , we were in love , if the word had any shred of meaning left in 1927 . In her lean , sharp-boned , restless way she was still more exciting for me than all the Billie Doves , Mary Astors , Corinne Griffiths , and they were lovely women . It was n't beauty with Jere , though she had some of that . She had a way of saying things , of wearing clothes , of doing things , aquaplaning , gambling , talking French or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous mimic  --  once she had done Helen Morgan we could never take Helen seriously again ; she could walk on her hands , she could fly a plane , until I made her quit , thinking a high-strung girl like her did n't belong in the air ; she might have made a first-rate Symbolist poet if she had had any discipline or any confidence . It was strange that a girl as handsome as Jere , who could do so many things , should have such a confidence deficiency . She could do things and she was fine to look at and I loved her and we had too much money and needed more , and all the time , she was a failure and  --  though it would have seemed preposterousto me then  --  I was failing too . I never knew exactly when Jere began to fail . At first I was afraid it was some flaw in me , but I learned it was earlier and earlier , something to do with motherlessness and paternal neglect . It was all moonlight and champagne at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slick stories of gay crossings and Riviera nights . I wrote some of them myself , God help me . When we were good we were very very peaches-and-creamy **34;5040;TOOLONG good the way our public believed us and wanted us to be . And when we were bad we were horrid to each other , though that was our secret for a long time . Whenever we were out we were those amusing Hallidays ; they 're so charming , so witty , so perfect together , and they adore each other like a couple of kids , and after all their Success  --  we must ask them for dinner , for the week-end , for the winter . Here we go ' round the prickly pear , the prickly pear , the prickly pear , here we go ' round the prickly pear at five o'clock in the morning . . . He remembered the afternoon they went to a Dadaist performance , where Tristan Tzara read aloud from a newspaperp218while an electric bell sounded so clangorously he could not be heard . That same afternoon Picabia had drawn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , erased it , to demonstrate the creative process negated and defied . Manley , who wrote grammatically , with precise syntax and with periods and even semicolonsand whose influences were largely Edith Wharton and Henry James , had been appalled at what he called " artistic hooli-ganism . " Jere had not agreed with all of it  --  " a good Dadaist should n't agree with anything , " she had explained . But she did believe in the seriousness of Tzara 's motives and in the possibility that they were groping toward a legitimate art form . Manley had become quite violent about it . Literature was communication . The masters dealt with character and ideas , not with an exhibitionistic play on words . " But this century is a turmoil , " Jere had tried to explain . " It needs a new form to express itself . Maybe bells and reading aloud , maybe something no one has thought of yet . " She was quite sure Rimbaud would have been a Dadaist . " He was trying to tear everything down  --  only he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sick of Rimbaud ! Do we have to live with Rimbaud ? " In the dark he heard Jere crying . " Jere . Jere darling . Please . " No answer . The silence was a warm pillow blotting up mysterioustears . At three-forty-five in the morning , by the luminous clock , he heard her moving near him . " Jere ? " " Yes , pet . " " What are you doing ? " " This . " " Ah ... ah ... " A long time passed too quickly . ... In Nineteen twenty . He remembered the long white yacht cradling in the moonlight on Alcudia Bay . The sky was paling . Sunrise would bep219soon . It was that delicate moment just before . It had been a good evening , with champagne and native Majorcan musicians who had rowed out from the island . Their hosts , Freddie and Gilly Patterson , very rich and rather nice , had finally given in to sleep . So had Cholly Prince , the popular composer , and Bootsie , the strange English girl , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and had meant it in a way that had frightened them . Sleep had caught up with Whitings , who were such good sports , and with the rest of the motley , amiable crowd . The Pattersonscould have been more select , but they liked people with a little added seasoning , writers , theatrical folk , almost any celebritiesas long as they were " regular , " which , to the Pattersons , meant being just a bit irregular . Anyway , they were all sleeping now . At last the ship lay silent . From her bunk Jere whispered , " Mannie , are you awake ? " " Diane , obey me . " It was their new game , ever since they read , on shipboard , that serious farce The Sheik . " Take your compelling stare away from my bosom heaving under this soft silk , " she answered . " I know . I 'm a brute and a beast and a devil . " He slipped out of bed . She was wearing the nightgown with the black lace top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to fight ? Would it not be wiser after what you have seen today to recognize that I am master ? " " Are all Arabs hard like you ? Has love never made you merciful ? " " Shall I make you love me ? I can make women love me when I choose . " Laughing together , and warning each other to hush like prepschoolroommates , they tiptoed up on deck . The Mediterranean had not yet turned the color for which it was famous ; the oncomingsun had filled it with rose-water . Small dark clouds lay curled up asleep on the horizon  --  " like little cats , " Jere had whispered . " I love you , " Manley said , as close to her as he could be . " If you were n't my wife , I 'd ask you to marry me. "  | " Shhh , do n't move for a moment , " she had whispered . " I want to hear the water . " The ripplets murmured against the hull . Here the world beganand here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later they dove from the bow into the clear water of the harbor . Manley watched as she poised on the edge , enjoying the clean lines of her nudity . The dive was perfect ; she swam away from the boat with a strong stroke . He kept up with her for a while , with a sense of exhilaration at their being in the sea alone together at daybreak , feeling deeply involved with love and water , primary forces . But after fifty yards he began to tire . " How about turning back ? " She shook her head , humorlessly he thought , and kept on . A little farther out : " Jere , we better turn back . " " You go if you want to , " she said . " I 'm going to see how far I can go . " She 's so damned extreme about everything , " he thought as he slowly paddled his way back to the boat . In his towel robe , he watched the small dark spot moving out toward the open sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of panic set in . She would n't do that , she would n't  --  would she ? A minute later he realized the dark spot was growing larger . Thank goodness she was on her way in . He held the white towel robe for her as she climbed aboard . " I thought you were on your way back to Monaco . " " When I get started like that I feel like swimming on and on and never coming back . " " But , Jere , you were so happy a little while ago . " " Oh , Mannie , I was  --  satiated . That 's the way I 'd like to go . " " You 're a crazy minx . " " Look at that fat sun . I 'm glad I came back . It 's going to be a beautiful day . " They sat on deck together until the sun was up , so happy with each other that they felt sorry for the people who could not be there , could not be them . The midday heat had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dressing for lunch and feeling logy , much worse than on no sleep at all , Manley said , " Darling , I meant to remind you , I'mp221afraid I was n't careful this morning . " And she said nervously , " Manley , it 's a fine time to tell me  --  I was a little woozy from all the champagne  --  I did n't even bother to ... " " Is it too late for you to  --  do something ? " " Yes , damn it . Manley , that 's lousy of you . You know how afraid I am of being ... " " Jere , let 's not worry yet . It 'll probably turn out all right . Why spoil the trip ? " " But I do n't want a baby . I 'm too young . I 'm not ready . We 've been so free , so lucky . A baby would make us so horribly settled . Mannie , honestly , I 'd rather die than get too big in front and heavy in the rear and sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet-training . " " You make it sound like an inferno . " " Well , you would n't want me that way either . Oh , damn it , being a woman is a bore sometimes . " When she had found herself a day overdue she had gone to bed and wept . It seemed like such a dirty trick for nature to sneak up on them that morning at the very moment when they had been indulging themselves in the most delicious , romantic fling of irresponsibility . Two months before " her time " ( why were all the terms connected with childbirth so repulsive ? Jere complained ) , they had embarked for America ( Jere discovering a patriotic devotion to the obstetrics of Manhattan ) . But the child had been delivered by a French ship 's doctor three days out of New York . If it had been a girl , Manley had joked , they would have called it Oceana . Jere was grateful for one thing : the most ungainly period of her pregnancy had been avoided . After a while she even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , or Manley either , for pressing on her the dowdy crown of motherhood . All the Halliday friends and followers felt the same way . The Hallidays were n't ordinary people who bothered about formulas and two-A.M. feedings and jollying infants back to sleep . Except in rare periods of economy , when Douglas was depositedwith Grandma and Grandpa in Kansas City , Douglasp222was entrusted to a series of French governesses who took elaborate , bilingual care of him , pampering him and practicing the delicate art of platonic seduction that lonely women of middle age know so well how to impose on bewildered and lonely little boys . To her delight Jere found that , quite the opposite from her worst narcissist fears , the existence of Douglas contributed to her perpetuityof youth . " Darling , you are n't the mother of a ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) year-old boy ! No , I refuse to believe it ! With that waist  --  why it 's positively indecent ! " This sort of thing always , and Jere 's eyes growing bright with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaware of its precociousness . " Oh , up in them Kaintucky Hills we 're courtin ' at seven , lovin ' at eight n ' nursin ' at nine . " But under the half-developed breast under the tight crepe-dechinethere seeped from the half-developed heart a tiny maternal leak . When they had decided to leave the child in Paris while they went to North Africa ( Jere 's brilliant idea to make a sentimentalsearch for Rimbaud 's trading post at Harar ) she had asked Douglas if he minded their leaving him for a month or so . " Will Mademoiselle be here , Mommy ? " " Yes , Duggy . " " Then I do n't care how long you stay . " To her surprise , she had cried all the rest of the morning . Manley had n't taken it very seriously , even when , several times that day , she thought she had changed her mind about going . He knew her tears and her laughter , her conscience and her whims were just a little closer together than most people 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Julien in the dining car , they were hilariously amused by a crotchety old gentlemanand his " niece " across the aisle . They improvised indelicate details of the incongruous couple 's relationship in a free adaptationof Petronius Arbiter . One afternoon in nineteen twenty-eight they woke up in Mona Moray 's Hollywood-Spanish castle of stucco . Jere ( whose sleep had been interrupted by a particularly painful dream : she had seen her mother , clearly , holding her in her arms and when she , the baby , had put her mouth down to nurse , the breasts had been hard and flat like a man 's and she had awakened with fitful sobs ) came over and sat on the edge of Manley 's bed ( still look/ing seventeen in his pajamas ) . " I have a wonderful idea for a party . " Manley had been lying in bed half awake , vaguely worrying about his novel . Started two years ago , put aside for short stories , started again , put aside for travel , then started a third time , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing , the right follow-up for High Noon . Hell , he had never had that trouble in the beginning . Friends and Foes , The Light Fantastic and the early stories and High Noon had to be written . What happens , what happens ? He was wondering . But almost at the same time he was computing how much money he 'd have to make in the next six months to stay ahead of the game . At twenty-five hundred a story , one a month would do it , with back royalties and extras coming in  --  maybe a little help from the Market . His Wall Street classmates were saying Radio might go to 400 . With ten grand he might make himself forty . Then a whole year off to write his book . No more of this playing around . There were so many things he wanted to try in writing , so many things he had n't accomplished . At twenty-nine he was a contemporary success ; one critic had called him a " Titan . " But it had n't really turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed with himself , half asleep , half thinking , half knowing where he was and what he had to do . Manley sat up and flipped out of his mood and into hers . " How about an Elinor Glyn party ? Everyone has to come in a red fright wig and bring an original novel entitled This Passion Called Love . " " No , Mannie , listen  --  and then tell me you are n't proud you married me . Let 's give a party in honor of Rin-tin-tin 's stand-in . " Neither of them felt well enough for breakfast , so they got Naga , the Japanese house-boy they had inherited with the place , to bring up a batch of Martinis . Then they sat down together on the bed and planned the party in detail . They both had a way of being completely serious about frivolous things . " We must ask Tom Mix , he 's a dog 's best friend , " Jere said . " Do you think we have to ask Rin-tin-tin ? He 'll be hurt if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " He 's a smart dog though . I 'll bet he 's got the first dollar he 's ever made . " " A canny canine . " Jere made a face . " Please , Mannie , be serious . Let 's see , we 'll need at least one genius ; I suppose two is always safer in case one of them turns out to be somebody 's kid nephew from Hungary , three producers , five directors , three Germans , maybe a Swede and one American for local color , ten assorted male and female stars , all flavors , a dozen Wampas stars , including one virgin for laughs , three or four screen writers , young and bitter ... " Jere 's laughter tinkled like the ice in the shaker she stirred . With quick dance movements she hurried to the desk , found pencil and paper and started making out the list : " Now for the odds and ends : one assistant director who thinks he 's at anotherparty , a smattering of girls who came from Council Bluffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands around denouncing Hollywood all night and then goes off with one of the Wampas stars , and , oh yes , two fairies , no three is always more fun , and a call girl who 's been given the wrong address and whom we all mistake for the countess who never shows up . Now , anyone else ? " " Do n't forget the Capone trigger-man from Chicago  --  we need at least one underworld celebrity . And a Grand Duke and a Prince or two . We c'n probably get enough real ones but if worse comes to worst we c'n always call in a couple of extras . " " Is the Queen of Rumania in town ? She 's a good kid . " " That reminds me , should we get a date for the dog-of-honor ? " " Do n't worry , they 'll be plenty of bitches at the party , Man . " " We should send out some sort of announcement . We 're giving a little party for Rin-tin-tin 's stand-in  --  let 's see , what 'll we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Sin-gin-fin . " No , it should be a name with character , with canine it , " Jere insisted . " Like Strongpaws . " " Wonderful ! A little surprise party for Strongpaws , a fine artistp225who 's made good in Hollywood and still has his four feet on the ground . Formal dress . Bring your wife or any other dog you know . " Planning a party for three hundred people is like planning a modest-sized socialized state to exist for a single evening . There is the question of supply , in this case Branstatter 's to cater , and Rudy , the MGM bootlegger , to provide the principal entertainment . Bartenders must be hired , and musicians , butlers , maids . There had to be two attendants to park the cars of those who came without chauffeurs , and a private detective to see that preciousjewels were not removed , or precious skins molested . The days of preparation rushed by in a joyous blur . The terraced gardens were a wonderland of Japanese lanterns , peopled by a super race of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for the genius , the producersand a director or two , were tall , handsome and marvelouslyjoined with their tuxedos . Manley was proud to see that even surrounded by ladies known for their beauty , Jere held her own . Standing near a bush of flaming hibiscus , the green sequinsof her gown flickering in the lantern light , the fascinating planes of her face reflecting the soft glow , looking up wittily ( she could , he thought ) into the collar-ad perfection of Wister La Salle 's face ( what do girls see in him ? He is n't handsome ; he 's pretty ) , Jere appeared to Manley as a green goddess . There were girls here with the most beautiful faces in America but not even Bebe Daniels had the vitality , or was it vivacity , no , that was n't exactly what he meant either , the inner spirit , the range from Rimbaud to McKinney 's Cotton Pickers . He looked at her now as he had stood looking at her the night he had found her , falling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words out of lovers ' mouths . ) She would always be his necessity . Everyone was laughing at their sign on a small palm-tree in the Garden : " First tree in Hollywood honored by the attention of Strongpaws . " And everyone applauded as the guest of the evening made an entrance on two feet . Like his master at his side , he was in evening clothes . Jere hurried forward , curtsiedp226prettily and took his paw . " Strongpaws , I ca n't tell you how delighted I am to see you . I thought you were wonderful in Each Night I Bark . You stole the picture ! " Everyone crowded around , cocktail in hand , playing the game so well that the panting canine might have been John Gilbert or Don Alvarado . " Is it true that you 're going to sing in your next picture ? " a young writer asked . " I love you when you smile , " said either Clara Bow or one of a dozen young hopefuls made up to look like her . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are saying about your going to marry that platinum blonde ? " Manley asked . There was a laughing crowd around the outdoor bar . " I 've never had so much fun in my life , " announced a sixteen-yearoldWampas star in the shortest dress of all , lifting her little glass to her exquisite little mouth . " How did they ever think of anything so cute ? " " This is tame , " said her escort , a director who had been around . " You should have seen the one they threw at Deauville last winter . " He whispered some of it . " Oh ! " the child exclaimed . " Why , they 're really terrible ! " " Enfants terribles , " said the director . " You said it ! " Mona Moray , the star of High Noon , described in the fan mags as the " Sophisticated Lady of the Silver Screen , " too exotic to be real in gold lame , was talking to the husband she was divorcing . " No , darling , not half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . " She smiled up at him exactly as she had when the cameras had flashed for their celebrated rites the year before , and moved off toward the circle favoring Strongpaws . " Darling , " she cried , throwing her golden arms around the creature 's neck in a convincing burlesque of a Hollywood greeting , " I think you 're the most virile-looking thing in Hollywood . All that hair on your chest . "  | " Mona should know , " at least half a dozen cats whispered to their partners . Naga had decked out the buffet with true oriental attention to detail . A Hawaiian orchestra moaned softly in the background . Three hundred and fifty guests ( for the party was so large that one could crash merely by arriving and going to the bar ) clusteredaround the little rented bridge tables . Manley sat at a table with Mona , Strongpaws and his master . At the next table were Jere , Wister La Salle , Mickey Neilan and Sally O'Neill . Jere was laughing at something Wister had just said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the one she used in flirtationbecause she thought it was more musical . All the time he was talking to Mona he seemed to be able to see Jere without ever looking at her . To admit he was jealous was a hangover of provincialism ; it disturbed him . But lately , she had been worryinghim a little : her absurd notion that people only paid attention to her because she was Mrs. Manley Halliday . Increasingly , she had imagined that people were snubbing her and she was sure , from the way women smiled when they saw him approach , that he was having all kinds of mad affairs . While Manley chuckled at something Mona was saying to Strongpaws and at the way Strongpaws ( the best-behaved guest at the party ) turned his head and seemed to listen , he glanced at Jere . She was raising her lovely head and emptying her wine glass . He frowned . She never used to drink champagne like this , not sipping or tasting . Especially in this last year there had been a new urgency in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled at him , challengingly . The dinner was climaxed with ice cream sculptured to the heroic form of Strongpaws himself , enclosed in a circle of black cherries in wine . There were calls of speech , speech for Strongpawsand he obliged , rising with his forefeet on the table to deliver a series of well modulated barks . " What 's Al Jolson got that he has n't got , " Jere was saying at her table , " except knees ? " " He 's got better manners than my husband , " Mona said . Everyone was getting drunk . Accents slipped off . Men 's handsp228moved with practiced stealth under gowns hospitably kneelength . Words bumped into each other and coupled like little box-cars . Mild attractions suddenly flamed to irresistible passions ; minor irritations flamed to violent hatreds . Couples slipped off into dark corners of the garden . A wife said to her actor-husband " If you talk to that slut once more I 'll leave you " and he took the challenge and she kept her word . This is what Jere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life 's normal pulse ; they made dull people bearableand bright people brighter ; they put people in a dice cage and shook them up to see what new combinations would appear . A look , a word , a right or wrong move , after the third drink , could make a friend , a career , a lover , an enemy . The sum of a party was so much more than the mere addition of all its parts . The Hallidays loved the sense of mystery , of teasing the fates and tempting the furies , of **30;5076;TOOLONG . This party was in its ascendancy . It needed only the slightest turn of the swizzle stick to start it bubbling up . The white orchestra ( that alternated with the black jazz band ) was all soft strings and muted saxophones . There was a spatter of applause and Manley saw that Wister La Salle was on the band stand . His sweet , almost feminine tenor fluttered gently over the garden . " Two by two , they go marching through  --  the Sweethearts on parade ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fay Lamphere over there ? "  --  " Shhhh . " The simple-sweet lyric and the simple-sweet voice crooned on.  --  " He 's a terrific bet for talkies. "  --  " I hear he 's as queer as a square grape . "  --  " You should be that queer , honey . " Manley did not miss the way La Salle , turning his head prettily , sang directly to Jere . And he did not miss the way her eyes laughed yes ! Damn them , he could hear it.  --  " Listen , chump , Grange never saw the day he could play with Wilson . He just had a better publicity man . "  --  " Lou , you missed a fight in a million Friday night . "  |  --  " Do n't worry , honey , one more wo n't hurt you . It 'll make you feel better . " ... Sweethearts on parade .

Hot ginger and dynamiteThere 's nothing but that at night Back in NagasakiWhere the fellers chew tobaccyAn ' the women wicky wacky woo .. . Mona came up with a drink for Manley while he was watchingand kissed him playfully . " What 's this scandalous talk I hear about your being faithful to Jere ? " " Know what I am ? Inverted Vic-torian , tha 's what I am . " Mona 's personality , in the artificial twilight of the colored lanterns , flashed like radium . She was not so much a woman of infinite charm , Manley was thinking , as a brilliant imitation of a woman of infinite charm . " I wish I had more chance to talk to you . I love intelligent men . I 'm so fed up with these Hollywood males  --  all shop talk and passes . " " Mona , been thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little egotist ' n at the same time you 're still scared , still searching  --  in here you know "  --  the thought was receding from him like the backwash of a wave and he was running down the strand to catch up with it  --  " you know  --  you have n't fulfilled yourself . " " Darling , " Mona cried in triumph , throwing out her arms as she had learned to do , " you know me ! You know me ! " In some pagodaShe ordered sodaThe earth shakes milk shakes Ten cents a piece . . . Jere and Wister La Salle were doing a burlesque adagio . " Your wife ought a be in pictures , " Sam Loeb , a veteran producer , was telling Manley . " She 's a natural little comedienne. "  | " Sir , " Manley said , " I 'll have you know you are speaking of the woman I love . " The dancers had drifted to the side of the pool illuminated with underwater lights of red and blue and green . A trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was always taking her clothes off did so again . She posed on the edge of the diving board and for a tantalizing momentManley enjoyed the unreal sense of beauty of the scene  --  the fine young body offered so freely to the night , so fearlessly . The sight of her clothed only in moonlight aroused no other emotion in him than a strange pride . When she was old , forty or fifty , she would remember that she had been alive and that her youth had lit up a pool more brightly than all the colored lights . The child with the marmalade hair , now that everyone had seen her , made her dive  --  up , up , with mermaid grace , ah now  --  too bad , a belly flop . He was angry with her , the anti-climax lending a sudden vulgarity to the performance , the mood of fantasy interrupted by the slap of bare breast and belly against the water . Jere would never have spoiled it that way . He had seen Jere diving nude from the bow of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the surface so perfectly that she had seemed not at all a naked woman but some nymph of the sea returning home to the green depths . Wonder where Jere is . Time he and Jere had a dance together . Time he and Jere .. . " Watch this kid , it 's gon na be rich . " A dapper Middle-Westerner , who passed on the screen for a European sharper , flashed his toothy trademark grin in Manley 's face . Manley turned to see a stubby little man impeccably dressed with a red ribbon of honor slashed across his chest approaching the producer J. C. Coles , who had come from Eastern Europe as Jakob Kolinsky a fast twenty-five years before . Coles was fifty , bald , vain , with a hard mind in a soft body , a terror to his employees but clearly inadequate and insecure at parties that were not his own . He would never have come to such a wing-ding as this if his wife of five months , the young star Mary Gay , had n't insisted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of insanity . He phoned her from the studio every hour of the day and night . He had studio detectives follow her . He adored her . " Allow me to introduce myself . I am the Count Pierre de Corday de la Corbierre . " " I am delighted to have the honor , " Coles announced with a slight accent and a sense of European deference . The Count whipped out a jeweled cigarette case with his crest on it . He identified himself , modestly , as a cousin of the French Consul-General . Coles , preparing a French Foreign Legionstory that required French Government co-operation , becameeven more attentive . " Permit me to compliment you , " the Count said , " on the extraordinary beauty of your wife . " Coles , tugged one way by pride and another by jealousy , mutteredpolitely . " Such complexion , " the Count went on . " Such elegance . Such hair . Eyes that would turn the meekest of men into Casanovas . . . , " Yes , yes , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count , apparently swept on by his own romantic momentum , could not be put off . "  --  with the figure of Diana , Salome , shoulders as pink and full as ... " " Count , excuse me , but I must ask you to . . . " " And breasts , ah , like white peonies , with their ... " Red-faced , dry-throated , Coles began to choke his protest . " Mr. Coles , I am something of a sculptor , " the Count persisted . " Perhaps you know my work . I have done some of the most famous beauties of England and France , in the nude , lovely creatures all  --  " he kissed his fingers appreciatively "  --  but none to compare with the charming Mrs. Coles . If I could have the honor of using her for a model  --  if you would allow her to come to my studio in Carmel for , say , just a few weeks . . . " Coles let out a terrible sound , between a cry of pain and a warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to shake him hysterically , while the Count screamed Help ! Help ! and the crowd around them laughed and laughed.  |p233Manley  , watching the scene in a kind of fascinated horror , broke through the circle and tried to separate them like a referee , somewhat sobered by the unhappy sound of struggle . " I do n't know who you are but I 'll have to ask you to ... " The Count snickered and suddenly switched from his accent to plain American . " F ' Chris'sake , Mr. Halliday , I 'm Gus Jones . " " Who ? " " Gus Jones . " Something about the bluntness of the name hammered home . Gus Jones . The professional ribber who hired out to parties to needle the guests . He and Jere had talked about him , but he did n't remember engaging him . Maybe Jere had . Anyway it was a joke , just a little gag he was explaining to J. C. Coles and Gus Jones ' impromptu audience lifted their voices in laughter as if on cue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Coles repeated , but the bloodpressurecomplexion , so suddenly risen , had not yet begun to subside . " Manley , you 're a card , you really made it look real , " somebodyhe did n't know chuckled in his face . Manley drifted toward the bar . " Wha'luhave , kiddo ? " The bartender grinned . Everybody was drunk . The pool was full of bathers now . Manley noticed that a swimmer who had n't bothered to remove his tux looked rather indecent . Manley was conscious only of the background babble of water splashing , laughter splashing , music splashing ( the colored band In a Mist ) pierced by the occasionalshrieks of frolicking young ladies to whom playful things were being done . In a Mist  --  he and Jere were crazy about the Beiderbecke record , he was telling Colleen Moore or somebody who looked an awful lot like her . The girl who except for the cut of her hair did n't look anything like Colleen Moore melted away . Jere 's face floated up big-eyed and expectant . " Jere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking for you too . Did n't think it would be nice if I left without telling you . " Her face seemed to bob back and forth like a balloon in a breeze . He could see that her eyes were unusually large the wayp234they always were when she was excited by anger or happiness . " Hear what they 're playin ' ? They mean well but they are n't Bix or Tram . . . " " Mannie , I 'm leaving with Wister . " A hurried kiss touched his cheek . The sounds of festivity swirled around him . Somebody fell , glass splattered , band tore up 12th Street Rag , marmalade girl costumed in towels now did a hula on the diving board . There was a terrible cry from somewhere in the garden , Wha'happened ? Wassa matter ? Manleymanaged to reach the circle of curious guests jostling for a better view of the little blonde who had been playing the drums . " Sonofabitch bit me , " she said , pointing to the dog several men were holding . The owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good dog  --  she was teasing him . " The victim 's escort came nobly to her defense by swatting Strongpaw 's owner on the nose . The dog barked hysterically . The little blonde sobbed . It was all over in a moment . Manley , surprised to find he still had a hundred dollars in his pocket , told the owner to take the beast home . " Go on , shake hands with the man and say thank you , " the owner insisted . Strongpaws and Manley complied reluctantly . Christ , now he 'd probably have to pay for the little blonde 's dress , maybe doctor bills . Who 's idea was that Strongpawsgag anyway ? Jere 's . Say , where the hell was Jere ? " G'night , ' night , wunnerful time  --  " The party was thinningout . The hopefuls and the die-hards were still going strong . And the white band was tapping out an old favorite , " Why Do I Love You ? " Look for Jere . No Jere anywhere . No Jere and no Wister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good-bye . Did she say she was going ? Was the whole thing in his mind ? He was n't sure . All he knew was he could n't find her . Fine thing for the hostess . Should always wait ' n say ' night to all your guests before runningoff with another man . " ' Night , ' night , glad ya did , see ya soon , lost your what in the pool ? Oh y'r anklet , look f'r it in the morning , ' t 's morning now , ha ha ha all right some other morning . . . " Seeing Mona to the gate ( " This hour of the morning alwaysp235frightens me , Manley . Never know what I 'll do . " " Be a good girl now , Mona . Le 's Montmartre later this week " ) his eyes were distracted to the parking space . Wister 's Daimler must be along there some place . They would n't just go , would n't just  --  " Manley , I 'd adore it if you 'd come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips were cool and tasted more of promise than of passion . " Love to , Mona , any time . " He waved vaguely . No Daimler . No Daimler and no Jere . God damn her . So this is the way the world ends this is the way the world ends this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a Daimler . The last melodic phrase had drifted out over the garden . The last drunk had been subdued . The last promise was made for lunch or cocktails this week . The last pair of high heels climbed wearily into the last limousine . The last of the bartenders made off with the last of the booze . " Do n't bother , " Manley heard himself mutter to Naga . " Le 's clean it up t'morra . " He reached in his pocket to give Naga an extra tip but his pockets were empty now . Must 've given it to someone else . He walked slowly back into the big house , barred the heavy medieval door and stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear his own heavy breathing . Only in the days of feudal lords or now in Hollywood would anyone think of inhabitingsuch a house . It was five times too big for two people , a hundred times too large for one . He walked slowly through the cold , formal spaciousness of the living room . Living room ! Who had ever lived here ? This heartless , phony barn of a house . There was only one room fit to live in and that was the little barroom paneled in pine and decorated with ToulouseLautrecposters . You could live in the bar . He peered into the icebox under the bar and found a split of champagne . He lifted the glass to himself in the mirror . My God , was that he ? He looked forty . St. Bernard eyes . He brought his face closer to the mirror , staring at himself as if the image were a stranger . When the champagne was gone and he could find no more he settled for half a pint of Golden Wedding . Always Goldenp236Wedding , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful . To get it down he had to drink it fast . When the bottle was empty , for hell or for spite , he threw it as hard as he could through the archway into the living room . It fell without breaking and slid harmlessly along the carpet . Could n't do that again , he thought . But then , what can you do again ? He opened the closest bottle on the shelf . It was peach brandy but he did n't care . Jere was gone , out somewhere in the languid Californian dawn with a languid hero whose personality was as synthetic as his name . Where were they now , making for Palm Springs , to some improvised love-nest along the road , or settling down to first-time intimacies in the elegant bachelor bedroom of some luxurious hide-away ? And did she have that look in her eyes that no other man was supposed to see ? And was she makingher own little loving sounds , her monosyllabic incantations that had only the most accidental connection with vulgarity ? He poured out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuckold 's cocktail , he thought darkly , new recipe for Harry McElhone , and flung the empty bottle without aiming . It crashed against the far wall and the crash of glass splattering sounded good and violent . He staggered out from behind the bar , heavy-legged , heavybrained , up the long winding wrought-iron staircase ( overwrought , he and Jere had joked about it ) to the bedroom that was n't cozy was n't theirs because they had no home . He stared into the empty room and noticed the lipsticked tips of half a dozen crushed cigarette butts ( " Jere , three packs a day , you 've got to cut down " ) crumpled on the floor near the chair , the beige suit she had taken off to dress for the party ( never in all their living together had he ever seen her hang anything up ) , near her bed the murder mysteries she bought and left behind in hotel rooms by the dozen . He picked one up  --  The Club of Masks  --  wish she would n't waste her good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leaf of stationery from the Hotel del Coronado where they had spent the week-end before last . Manley made out the few scratchy pencil lines of an abortive poem :  |p237A  STUDY FOR THE LEFT HAND NOT KNOWINGWHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOINGWe are me and me are I loosened goosened loreleiif she hollers let her gonium eeney miney pandemoniumI am what I never couldbeing what I never should if she dies before she trieswho 'll put pennies on her eyesShe is I and I am whAnother one of those things she was never finishing . The discardedclothes , the cigarette butts ( some crushed out after only two or three drags ) , the books on the floor , the unfinished poem made him feel as if he were some sort of tourist of the emotions visiting the sentimental monuments erected to the memory of Jere Halliday . Maybe those songs are n't so far off after all , he thought . There 's nothing left to me of things that used to be , I live in memory among my souvenirs , even if they are cigarette butts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse and other symbols of feminine disorder . Even so , he was moved now in a sentimental way . Salt drops burned in his eyes and he wanted to bawl . He groped to the sleeping porch where he and Jere had lain together a dozen hours before . He looked more closely and found a tiny gold heart ; one of her earrings had come off . She had a hole punctured in only one ear because she had started to faint and had been afraid to let the jeweler go on . Strange , she was a daredevil swimmer , diver , flyer , hunter , but the thought of anything sharp drawing blood from her always brought on vertigo . The memory of her one pierced ear , for some reason , was more than he could stand . Flopping down on the day bed he cried hysterically into his hands . Some time later ( an hour , a day , an eon ) he must have gotten up , must have gone down to the living room and turned on the radio , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heah-vun when I see you smile , smile for me , my Diane ... comes to you from the famous Cocoanut Grove , playgroundof the stars . . . he 's in with a short jab to the mouth , another jab , and then Young Nationalista . . .

Ought a write a novel about Aimee . He thought he was having an inspiration : female Elmer Gantry with Hollywood trimmings . " And so I say to all you good people tonight do n't just get out and get under the moon , get out and get under God ! " The bottle in his hand was n't empty , but he sent it hurtling against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupefied to remember he could turn it off , too stupefied to tell day from night , gin from brandy , love from hate . Beyond drunkenness he lay on the floor and felt himself slidingdown as it swung around to serve as wall , ceiling , floor , wall again . Chri'sakes , wh'sa'matter wi ' me ? Must 've gotten sick . Could n't be drunk because just a minute ago I was thinkingclear as a bell . " Jere . . . Jere . . . " His voice came to him as from another room and an unfamiliar throat . " Jere . . .

The house that had always been so cold roared with the heat of a blast furnace . Upstairs in the study with the red leather furniture one hundred and three pages of the novel that Dorset House had expected to publish the year after The Night 's High Noon was curling to a soft gray ash . At the same time Manley was remembering 0 Jesus Burt Seixas had always begged me to make him a carbon . Forcing himself up out of the crackling stupor , he managed to reach the bottom of the stairway , but as he decided to go up , the stairs were deciding to come down.  --  " Mannie darling , it 's me ! Can you see me ? Mannie ... " He had seen nothing but whiteness but now a fuzzed impression of dark red hair came down to him . He concentrated on seeing . He was in love with that face . Never knew why . It just pleased him . It had always pleased him . The twinge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Darling , can you hear me ? When I heard what you had done I  --  I almost died too . . . " It took him a little time to realize what she meant . Oh , she would love him now . It was one thing to say I ca n't live without you . It was another to , to actually try to take your own  --  well , had he ? The last thing he remembered was thinking with a terrible , hypertrophic clarity about his life , his shortcomings and the things he did or did n't believe . And he remembered calling Jere . And something about fire . " Darling , darling , how can I ever make it up to you forp240being such a  --  dope ? I 'm going to buy you a pearl-handled horsewhip . " " Accident , " he started to say under the bandages . But then he thought : is that fair to her when her face is lit up with rededication ? No , for loss of my girl I tried to take my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " Mannie , I was a dope , " she was saying into the bandages , " a sixteen-cylinder dope . " And then she said , beginning to feel back with him again , " I am not afraid of anything with your arms around me . Ahmed . Monseigneur . " Involuntarily , his shoulders began to shake . " Please , Mrs. Halliday , " said the stern-faced nurse , " you must n't make him laugh . "  |p241Sitting  on the leather seat of the men 's room he felt no leather ; bouncing on the spinning metal wheels he remembered a time of peace ( " that great beautiful hunk of peace " he had called it ) that floated in the turbulent sea of his life like a magnificent iceberg , cool and detached and reaching so far below the surface that waves could not stir it . He would never completely recover from this irony : in that brief period when he could not walk and when the bandages had not yet been removed from his eyes he had felt more sensiblyalive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young manhood . He sat on the beach and felt the sun and listened to the sea . At last he had time to think about his own relationship to sun and sea . Timidly , because the experience was still so strange to him , he began to feel himself a part of this natural trinity . Within him was a soothing awareness of wheels that , having spun too violently , were braking gradually to motionlessness . He listened to wind and gulls , to breakers and the whispers of their spray . Within himself it was as if the motor of a furnace had suddenly gone off , eliminating a sound that had throbbed so incessantly that it had come to be accepted as silence ; now at last the silence was real , a perfect hush . For years he had been in the midst of life and now , at this beach bungalow at Santa Barbara with Jere , he had removed himself to the outermost edges ; yet sitting there on the beachrenewing himself he came to realize that in a deeper sense it was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge and he was coming home to dead-center , returning to himself , just as he and Jere were not merely resuming their marriage but caulking the seams of their joining to check the leakage and waste . Now they began to hear each other 's voices , each other 's heart beats again . On the beach and in the cottage after dark Jere would read aloud to him a new translation of Verlaine Yvorp242Winter had sent down from Stanford , the Journals of Baudelaire , Byron 's Don Juan , Stendhal On Love , fragments from the Old Testament , the letters of Browning and Flaubert , whatever could be found in the local library . All through these quiet days Jere was as attentive , as devoted as a hospital nun . With her way of dedicating herself to one enthusiasm at a time to the exclusion of all others , his physical and professional recovery was now her only concern ; she was convinced that nothing but his welfare had ever occupied her mind . The webs of doubt that had gathered between them dissolved . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and through sleep to awakening , in which affectionate silences bridged the things worth saying . At first Jere had shied away from mention of Wister La Salle , but the first time he brought it up in a calm and off-hand way she was relieved and found herself able to talk about it with complete detachment . It had simply been part of the vast confusionthey had mistaken for the good life . The mere thought of the fellow now aroused nothing more in her than a great yawn . To reassure her he told her of his brief intrigue with Mona and they laughed together at the dark woods through which they had finally found their way . Again and again ( with the unmonotonous repetition of the waves outside ) they spoke their gratefulness at having each other . It was not the loving abandon they had celebrated in Paris ten years earlier . But in its place was something they thought to be more durable , that second-wind of love based on understanding , affection and a romantic sense of duality that makes the facing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could walk again , the thrill of the child 's first steps and first impressions were filtered through the speculative appreciation of the thoughtful adult . The sheer joy of watching the blue sparkle of the sea was intensifiedby the idea of watching the sea . He could sit for hours meditating upon its fascination . It offered the peace of looking out over a stationary prairie and at the same time the pleasure of rhythmic motion . He thought : in all of us the desires to root and to roam are in contention . The sea , like the best of mar/riages , was a harmonious interflow of opposites . The sea was that exquisite equilibrium of movement and matter we call serenity . To his delight and amazement , for he did not think he had that quality of mind , he was discovering the ancient pleasure of meditation , the priceless luxury of inner tranquillity . In the morning before breakfast he and Jere would walk along the beach looking for driftwood , the seashore 's own objets d'art . How pleased they were when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some celebrated collection of primitiveart . Another morning he picked up a water-smoothed abstractionthat would not have disgraced Brancusi . Was this accidentalpiece of driftwood a work of art ? Along the beach they talked for the first time about what they believed in . Until the rust was worn away , the machinery of their minds moved slowly , protestingly . Why had they never stopped to ask themselves and each other the basic questions ? Too many things to do , too many radios and phonograph recordsand party-chatterers to listen to . He had to confess that he did not know enough of the world 's wisdom to be ready to believeanything . He just had a few schoolboy prejudices , he admitted . In their walks along the beach they argued good-naturedly the eternal either-ors . In a restless search for something to believe she had come to the Pensees . From the beginning of the decade that was reaching its end , she confessed , she had been rushing madly from one belief to the next  --  Dadaism , Freudianism , Anarchism ( momentarily converted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Hollywood she had met , at the home of one of the most voluptuous movie stars , a Swami who had almost won her devotion to the Bhagavad Gita . Now , like her noble , disarranged Rimbaud , she was gropingher way to the True Church . It has to make some sense , she kept saying as they skirted the water 's edge and his answer would be why ? Maybe it makes no more sense than that sand flea hopping from hole to hole . Like a Rip Van Winkle of the intellect , he felt that he had slept through a lifetime of opportunity . Here he was , he com/plained , already into his thirties , with nearly all of the world 's recorded wisdom still outside his mind . He threw himself into a feverish program of study  --  he had never read the Bible or Freud or Nietzsche or The Golden Bough or the notebooks of Da Vinci or all of Flaubert or the Greek philosophers or Sophoclesor Euripides or all of Henry James , not even Conrad or Hawthorne thoroughly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dandyish dealer in externals . He began to consider as the most important event in his life the fire that had burned to dust the tawdry merry-go-round that had seemed so dazzling . And that had brought him and Jere , literally , to their senses . It was , he decided , a symbolic fire consumingthe highly inflammable , long-condemned , elaborately decoratedbut essentially flimsy playground in which he and Jere had existed . The burning of the manuscript which had seemed such a tragic loss in those first blistering days , began , in perspective , to assume its proper place , as a warning . He examined himself as an artist now , more thoroughly than he had in the pre-war days when he had carried a green baize book bag across the Yard , and found himself almost hopelessly wanting . Ruthlesslyhe made a list of all his faults and found them all to be the same fault , an over-supply of vanity , an over-developed concern to hear his name at the end of the cheers . The wish to be publicly admired . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Babbitts with their ordinary business success , their abysmal bourgeois ignorance that passed for " being a smart operator " and yet inadvertently he had allowed himself to be caught in the great American net . Like an omen , it seemed as if every book said the same thing , as if each book knew his weakness and spoke for him alone . In the letters of Browning he underlined : I never pretended to offersuch literature as should be a substitute for a cigar or a game of dominoes to an idle man . . . on the whole I get my deserts and something over  --  not a crowd but a few I value more . From the letters of Flaubert he learned how that author would labor over a single effect until his bones ached . He took counsel from the reflective struggle of Henry James to purify his themes ; from the notebook of Chekov , Aristotle 's Poetics , the work/habits of Trollope  --  even Arnold Bennett . He heard the warning of Marcus Aurelius ; cease to be whirled about ; and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us choose . Men as far apart as the Bible poets , the Elizabethans and the French symbolists all seemed to agree that if there was a single wisdom it was simply To thine own self be true . All he had to do now was decide what was his own self . How idiotic and disgusting  --  and remote  --  from the perspectiveof convalescence in Santa Barbara their party for that damned dog seemed . As they had with Wister La Salle , they found it an emotional purge to abuse themselves for having stooped to such vulgarity . It had been such an artificial display of merry-making . Here come the madcap Hallidays , they had sensed everyone 's saying , I wonder what they 're up to next . Like troupers they had gone into their act . With a solemnity they still found refreshing , they decided on a program of rehabilitation . They would cut away the slough of false friends . They would conserve themselves for inner growth . They would go out to people only for necessary relaxationfrom creative work . Their motto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jere suggested , Datta , dayadhvam , damyata  --  give , sympathize , control . And the first test of control was drinking . After a thirty-day period of drying out , they would make an experiment of moderation . We 'll use the stuff , we wo n't let it use us , they agreed . And everything I write will be nothing less than my best , he promised , having written into his notebook his own rough translationof Flaubert 's warning : . . . art is a luxury . It needs clean hands and composure . If you make one little concession , then two , then five .. . He even formalized it by drawing up a Declaration of PersonalIndependence , forcing himself for the first time to answer the artist 's catechism : What is my motive in writing this book ? Money ? Fame ? Social pressure ? Moral influence ? Personal need . . . ? He confessed to himself and Jere how much he had enjoyed the wealth and popularity his books had brought . It had taken fire , infidelity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is n't too late , he told Jere . Before I corn/pose another book I will learn to compose myself . Out of his twenties at last , with his century itself facing its Thirties , there was no more time for literary catch-as-catch-can . One night after dinner they sat on the beach together with their backs against the low stucco wall of their cottage and watched the tiny yellow and red riding lights of passing ships . In the sky the milky cluster of stars could be read as clearly as on an astronomical chart . I feel clean and calm inside , he said . I 'm ready to go to work . He had been making notes for the novel that would treat Hollywoodas a world of topsy-turvy values where film people were the shadowing two-dimensional reflections of reality and only the figures on the screen were real . And I 'm going to finish Une Saison en Enfer , she promised . 1 know , Mannie ! Let 's not leave here till we 're both finished ! With the ardor of converts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their married life they stopped relying on room service and Jere tried to do the cooking . She plunged into housewifery with enthusiasm . She became economical , made marketing lists and was childishly pleased when she found ways to pare her budget by a half dollar . She became a budget devotee and worked out an elaborate scheme whereby they could live the ensuing year for just half of what it had cost them in 1928 . On liquor alone , she estimated with a flourish of arithmetic , their new austerity program would save them at least five thousand a year . Only in one respect did their retreat to tranquillity seem anythingless than perfect . Their physical relationship subsided to infrequent moments that were almost casual . In the past an equal partner at the very least , Jere seemed to become increasinglypassive , responding more from a sense of duty than desire . And yet it was during this period that she spoke of and seemed to feel most deeply her attachment to him . Days when he would be working at a table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would say  --  as she never had before  --  Manley , I love you so much . In the days when the beat had been stronger between them , she would have teased him with horrid names and said I hate you . At night when he was working now shep247would bring him coffee she had made  --  which he did n't have the heart to tell her was invariably bitter  --  and kiss him with earnest affection , but more like daughter to father than woman to man . None of this seemed serious though , for he was pouring all his energy into his work and his reading . With Jere 's housekeeping and the Rimbaud to finish they were always ready for sleep by midnight . If there was a minimum of erotic pleasure , there was a maximum sense of companionship and achievement . They began to feel , keenly , the absence of Douglas and they had him come on from Kansas City . They found him amazingly " grown up , " in that intense stage of development when reason and wonder had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave catechism of a seven-year-old . Where does the sun come from ? Where do people come from ? Why are waves ? Who is God ? Out of guilt at having failed him so often those first five years , they lavished too much attention on him . They decided it was unfair to Douglas to leave him as an only child , and Jere , all in her role of homemaker , mother and wife-of-the-artist , decided they must have another . In a rather matter-of-fact way one evening , they attended to this . All was going smoothly with their work and their lives when the telephone , which had n't rung a dozen times in a month , pierced the quiet of the afternoon to announce a lady reporter from the local paper . Somewhat hysterical at her own ingenuity in having tracked them down , she was eager to interview them on why they had chosen Santa Barbara . The good , cultured peopleof Santa Barbara , the phone assured him , were thrilled at the thought that Manley Halliday would honor them by writing his next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she called again and again , and they made the fatal mistake of saying no courteously  --  which , to the worldly , is the same as saying yes  --  they finally gave way to the old appeasement : maybe it will be less of an interruption to have her in and get it over with . The coming of the lady reporter ( she was the local book reviewerbut she was all a-flutter at the prospect that an interviewp248of this importance would start on page one ) meant locating a bootlegger to supply them with gin and perhaps some Scotch . And to prepare themselves for the ordeal , he and Jere thought they 'd better have a drink or two before she descended upon them . Mrs. Lucinda Hunt Hitchcock ( who quickly identified herself as a grand-niece of the author of Ramona and the discussion leader of the local Bookworms Club , " which gives us lots in common " ) was thrilled to meet the Hallidays , thrilled to find them such a young , charming , attractive and sensible couple , thrilled to have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up with this younger generation " ) , thrilled to hear ( by putting most of the words into their mouths ) that they were seriously considering permanent residence in " this lovely bit of Old Spain by the Pacific we call Santa Barbara . " Having forced him to the half-promise that he would address the Bookworms ( " The B.W. 's simply wo n't take no for an answer " ) she hurried off to write her rosy and totally erroneous impression of the young love birds gaily creating works of art ( that sell for fabulous sums to magazines and Hollywood ) in their cozy ( but exotically redecorated ) bungalow by the sea . The departure of Mrs. Hitchcock was as if a sudden gale had blown through and left them wind-tossed in its wake . In a drinkingmood for the first time since they had come , they finished another batch of cocktails . He had planned to go on working that evening , but the alcohol had eaten away his will and he took refuge in the decision to relax tonight and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Jere more insistently than usual but she complained of a headache  --  " ca n't seem to take the pain-killer any more "  --  and for the first time since they had come he brought into the open his fears that she no longer had that kind of love for him . She gave in , to put an end to such foolishness , she said . But when it was over he felt even more letdown . What had dulled the fine , shining blade of their passion ? Alone he wandered out onto the beach with a bottle in his hand , less sensitive to the elements than he had been a month before , to find an easy peace in solitary drinking . The next day he was full of remorse and sour humors . Whenp249Jere reminded him of their pious resolutions , he accused her of being surly and unsympathetic . So it just happened that he was especially vulnerable when **44;5108;TOOLONG call  --  " had no idea you rascals were in Santa B. till I read the big write-up in the local Bugle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of people " and were " simply panting to have you two booze-hounds in for cocktails . " He and Jere could hardly say no . The last time they had seen Bertie they had had an outrageously good time drinking wine together in the Blue Grotto and the coincidence of their all turningup together in Santa Barbara-of-all-places was an event that called for at least a token celebration . From the Marstons ' , where they had a much better time than they expected , they came home ( as they now called the hotel bungalow ) pleasantly pie-eyed and it was Jere 's suggestion that they make up , though there had been more ennui than disagreementbetween them . That night recalled earlier times when they had been too impatient to wait for darkness . After that they decided it would n't hurt to have a cocktail or two before dinner . Nothing after dinner was the new rule . Since he was working fairly well , there was no sense in being too rigid . But their appearance at the Marstons ' led to a rash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still managed to accomplish a good deal . Jere , the better linguist of the two , was studying Greek . Forever crossing a dozen bridges beforeshe reached the first , she thought it would be fun for them to try a modern translation of Iphigenia in Tauris . The Rimbaudhad been put aside again . Unable to catch the rhythm of the poems in the Delirium section , she was quickly sure she had gone stale . At first their week-ends began at Saturday noon ; then , withouttheir quite noticing it , the social drinking began Friday evening . When Bertie insisted his heart would be broken if they did n't come along with him on a yachting party that was to get under way late Thursday afternoon , they thought it 'll be an exceptionthis one time and we 'll make up for it next week . What to do with Douglas was a problem for a while , but Bertiep250solved that by getting the Marstons to take him in with their little boy . They had a peach of a time cruising down the coast to Laguna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody everywhere , had some friends who had a marvelous house down there . They stayed over for a party that turned out to be a beaut . They could n't get back until Tuesday . By the time he finessed his hangover , Wednesday was all used up . Another week down the drain of secondary pleasures . They would have to be firmer , they warned each other . He went back to reread that document he had drawn up for Personal Independence . But they had to make an exception when Bertie was leaving for Honolulu . The bon-voyage party for him would be their last stab at whoopee in Santa Barbara . " After Saturday night we 'll retire with the championship , " he laughed with Jere . It was a good party , no better or no worse than a hundred others , with the normal proportions of genuine release , harmful and harmless flirtation , moments of beauty , ugliness , boredom and titillation , happy and unhappy drinking , breakage , cigaretteburns , fits of laughter , tears and several calls from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after four o'clock Douglas ran in crying from his bed and drove most of the guests away with his determined hysteria . At five-thirty , all quiet at last , they held a troubled postmortemwhile they watched the dawn roll in . What had the party accomplished ? How could they have wandered so far from their course ? What was this compulsion to please other people ? Bertie Heinemann was a playboy pure and simple with good taste , money , nice manners and a cultivated sense of humor and his generosity had made things comfortable for them in some very nice parts of the world . But he had nothing to say to them they had n't heard a hundred times . " He 's exactly the sort of nice guy I should start cutting out of my life if I ever want it to have any meaning , " he had decided . It was at Santa Barbara that he had begun to think of his talent as if it had an objective existence separate from himself , as something precious that had been entrusted to his care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bellboy who is given a **34;5154;TOOLONG loaf of bread . Or maybe they had you scheduled for something fancy . Maybe you were due to be coffee cake , and then they ran you through a different mill and sprinkled raisins and chopped nuts around on you and baked you a little less or a little more . What good does it do to fight it ? a treacherous little voice said in his mind . You 're on a treadmill , you just waste your strength . But he put the voice down , and he assured himself that even though Marx said the domination of the proletariat was inevitable , and that capitalism would ultimately destroy itself , yet there had to be agents and workers and fighters to bring the destruction about , and maybe hurry it . But it was really unfair the way they mixed life up for a man . They carelessly dropped nuts and raisins around in ordinary dough and produced something like himself , neither bread nor coffee cake . The whole futile cloud of his ambitions rose up before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist . A musician . Akh ! He stayed at the window a long time , watching the jerky unalterable motions of the baker , until the baker pitched three tubs one inside the other and slid them down the table and the light clicked off to leave only a vague interior glow in which shadows of movement went on , incomprehensible for all his peering and staring and straining to penetrate the smeared light-struck glass . THE MORNING newspaper told him that the cornerstone had been laid at a new Mormon ward house , and showed him the faces of the men and women who had participated in the ceremonies . It informed him of a controversy between a Better Government committee and the sheriff about conditions at the county jail , and of the death of a tramp who had beenp201found along the Western Pacific tracks between Salt Lake and Black Rock , and of a family stabbing in Bingham . It gave him the information that ore shipments from the Silver King , Daly-Judge , and Apex mines were up thirteen per cent above the same period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in Switzerland and denouncing nationalism and war . But it told him nothing about what was happening in Sacramento , and he looked carefully among strange names and strange faces up and down the columns of the whole paper without finding any clue to the expectancy he felt . It was as if he had come here to meet someone and could not remember who . At noon he ate in a workingmen 's eatery on Second South , and came out afterward to pick his teeth and lean against the wall , watching people pass . A bum panhandled him for a cup of coffee , and Joe gave him a nickel . Another bum struck him for a match , but Joe did n't have any . He leaned comfortably against the wall , watching faces . Along the sidewalk came a dapper young man with a mustache , his legs encased in peg-topped riding breeches , his calves booted in glistening British boots . In his hand he carried a crop with which he tapped the side of his leg as he walked . His heels were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , Joe was moved by ribald amusement . He was astonished that such a dude would have the nerve to appear on the street . With the corner of his mouth he chirped twice , sharply , as if to a horse . The dude looked sideways , startled , his crisp walk uninterruptedbut his hand forgetting to tap the crop against his boot . He had large soft brown eyes and his mustache was brown and luxuriant . As his eyes met Joe 's they went angry and hard , and his mouth stiffened . Joe gave him a still , intent look , one the poor prune could n't misunderstand . " Giddap ! " he said , and removed the toothpick from his mouth . For a hopeful instant he thought the dude was going to take the challenge , and he shoved his shoulders away from the wallp202eagerly . But the dude 's face , a face like a girl 's with an artificialmustache pasted on it , turned ahead again , reddening , and the crisp bootheels clicked on . Two men standing across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe let himself back against the wall , taking advantage of the narrow ledge of shade . As he leaned , his eye caught a glimpse of a man who passed and hesitated , turning ; a man with loose shoulders and loosely hanging arms , and a face that took on a hanging , sheeplike grin . Otto Applequist . As they shook hands he felt Otto 's eyes all over him , like the slapping hands of a cop , slapping the corduroy pants , the worn shoes , the shirt that he had washed himself at Mother Wynn 's . Otto himself looked prosperous . His shoes were new and shiny , he wore a collar and tie and a straw skimmer . " Well , well , well , well , well ! " Otto said . He pumped Joe 's hand and studied Joe with a secret smile . What he saw seemed to tickle him . His smile broadened . " I heard you was in jail . " " It 's a fright what stories get around , " Joe said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get out unless you 're in . " Otto 's smile widened until his eyes almost closed . " Same old Joe . Still keeping the mouth shut . " " Same old Otto , still trying to get something on somebody . " That brought a burst of coughing laughter from Otto . Fora moment , still laughing , he watched two girls go by . Turningback , he said , " How 's old Manderich ? " " He 's dead . " " Dead ! " " You hear all the stories , " Joe said . " You should have heard that one . They killed him at Oatfield . " " Well I 'll be damned . " Otto 's loose shoulders moved . " That old gorilla , " he said . " He was all right , I guess , but he sure took his politics hard . " Joe said nothing . Otto , working his genial white eyebrows , looked him over again . " You been in Zion long ? " " Just got in. "  | " Damnedest place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full of Swedes . The Mormon missionaries must 've cleaned out the old country . I 'm forgetting how to talk English . " They moved back into the shade against the wall of a drugstore , putting their hands behind them on the wall . Joe was glad enough to see Otto . He was a petty-larceny thief , and he liked to snoop out every scrap of information about anything , but if he had no hard feelings about that night in Pedro there was no reason Joe should . And he was somebody familiar ; he took the edge of strangeness off this town . " Doing anything ? " Joe said . " Murray smelter . " " Honest working stiff , uh ? " " Want to see my letters of recommendation ? " " I 'm afraid I 'd recognize the handwriting . " They laughed together , two old acquaintances gabbing in the street . " Where you staying at ? " Otto said . " Wobbly hall ? " " Mother Wynn 's . You know it ? " " I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want an agitator they look there . " " They do ? " " What do you care ? " Otto said with a laugh . " The cops are n't nothing to you . " Joe shrugged . " You got quite a rep since I saw you last , " Otto said . " You 're the kind of an agitator the cops 'd really be interested in . You still writing songs ? " " Not lately . " " Sticking around long ? " " I do n't know . " " Bound anywhere special ? " " Nowhere special . " " Jesus , you do n't know the answer to anything , do you ? " Otto said . " My father was a Pismo clam , " Joe said . " I would n't be surprised . " Otto crossed his feet and raisedp204his hat to cool his forehead . With his hat still off he turned , as if a thought had surprised him , and said , " Say , you know who I met here ? " " Who ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna Olson . " Alertness awoke in Joe . He felt in the pit of his stomach the kind of paralyzed expectancy that had come in childhood games when his hiding place was discovered , the moment of staring exposure before the screaming race for the goal . " Sweden ? " he said carefully . " That 'd sure be a freak . You sure it was me ? " " Joe Hillstrom . She said you went away to be a sailor when your mother died . " " I do n't remember any Anna Olson . " " Well , she remembers you . She was a friend of your mother 's . " Joe raised his shoulders vaguely . The street lay hot and sun-drowned before him , and it was suddenly as strange as a street in a dream . Beyond it , over the flat roof of a building , he saw the slopes of the mountain rising . It was a strange place , and he the strangest thing in it , with the past washing in on him . " Maybe she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered Anna Olson all right , in her house and his own , summer afternoons on the streets of Celle . His mother 's friend , one of the few . " She lives right near where I 'm boarding , out in Murray , " Otto said . He shoved Joe 's shoulder . " Say , you know what you could do ? There 's a kind of a potlatch of Mormon Swedes out at my place tonight . You could come on out . " " That 'd be a treat . " " Do you good , " Otto said . " Stick around by yourself too long , you 'll begin to smell your own breath . " " Yeah , " Joe said . He rubbed the scar at the corner of his mouth , and from under his hand said , " What kind of a pot-latch ? ' " Whist , " Otto said . " Coffee and cake . Just a bunch of good Mormons getting together to talk Swedish . "  | " What 'll you be doing at this party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They laughed together again . With an appropriate and calculatedcarelessness Joe said , " All right , I have n't got anything to do . I might come along . You sure it 's all right ? " " All right ? You 're a Swede , that 's enough . For that matter , I can introduce you as the big IWW song writer . " " I guess we can get along without that . " " Plain Joe Hillstrom , uh ? " " That 's my name . " " Okay , " Otto said . He took out his wallet and found a scrap of paper in it and scribbled an address . " This 'll be a new experience for you , " he said , and the sly grin spread and curled his lips . " Respectable churchgoing people to associate with . " " I guess I can stand it , " Joe said . " What time ? " " Seven-thirty maybe . " " Nell , " Joe said , " Ay see you dar . " " Plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormons got twelve pretty daughters . " He crossed the street , natty in his straw hat , and Joe turned back toward Mother Wynn 's . It was hard to figure what Otto was up to , or whether he was up to anything . It could be that he had found out something about Joe from Anna Olson and thought he could use it . But what could he use it for ? Plenty of people had no fathers . It made no difference who knew where Joe Hillstrom came from . But the cold expectancy , like the sensation of cold against a decayed tooth , was still with him . This whole town was prickly with the sense of something due to happen . In store windows he examined himself as he walked , trying to label himself , looking himself over as if he were Anna Olson seeing the son of her old friend for the first time in sixteen years . He observed what thirteen years of knocking around and three years in the labor wars had done to Joseph Hillstrom of Gefle , Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself the once-over : a pretty glum customer , longhaired , bag-kneed , with an intent scarred face.  |p206The  moving arms of a taffy-pulling machine in a candy store window stopped him momentarily , and watching his own image in the glass he cracked his face just to see if he could look human . Ghostly among trays of pinoche and peanut brittle , a reflected stranger smiled at him . HE KNEW Anna Olson the moment he came in with Otto from the porch and saw her talking with other women in the hall . Plain , faded , comfortable , she meant Gefle so strongly that even though he had been anticipating the meeting he was stopped dead inside the door by the intense familiarity of her face . Quiet mouth , plain flat hair , the hands that worked on a half-knitted gray wool sock even while she talked : they leaped out of his mother 's kitchen over the gap of years , and voices with them like voices that he knew , women 's voices talking Swedish . When her eyes moved casually to brush his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and her nod was for Otto . She did n't know him . If he wanted to , he could still walk out of here without speaking to her . In the other room someone was pumping a player piano . The party had n't begun yet . He could beat it out and drop the hatch cover on all this past . But Otto was at his elbow , shoving him forward , and he stood with Otto 's hand pinching around his muscle and enduredthe questioning eyes of Anna Olson and two younger women . " You know who this is ? " Otto said , and he shook Joe slightly , holding him like something he had captured . Anna Olson 's eyes searched his face . He felt that her eyes were soft and her brows arched with a question . " Do I know you ? " she said . " I guess not , " Joe said . " Not any more . "  | " Did I once ? " " A long time ago . " " A long time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Gefle ? " " Yes . " Half smiling , she searched his face again . He was conscious of his scars . " I do n't . . . . How long ago ? " " I left there in ' 98 . " " Before we did , " she said . Her forehead was scored by a frown . " It 's so long , I ca n't .... You 're not Olaus Berger ? " " No . " " There 's something familiar , " she said . " Your eyes , especially . " " Come on , " Otto said . " You 're a punk guesser . " Then suddenly her hand came out and touched Joe 's arm , and her eyes were warm with recognition and surprise . " Why of course ! " she said . " Of course , I know you now . But you 've changed . You were just a young boy the last ... " " I have to have proof , " Otto said . " Who is he ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ignored Otto . " You used to be such a funny solemn little boy , " she said . Her hand with the gray sock in it reached and pulled one of the younger women over , a woman Joe vaguely noticed as tall , neither quite pretty nor quite plain , with eyes of a placid temperate blue like Anna Olson 's , and with long strong white hands . " Ingrid , " Anna Olson said , " just imagine . This is Joseph Hillstrom . You two went to school together . " Ill at ease and feeling that a dozen people were listening to the talk , Joe shook the young woman 's hand with a vague impression of quick eyes and a confused pink blush before the girl stepped back . There were other hands to shake , and a string of names : Andreen , Strand , Carlson , Erickson . It seemed to him that the parlor and hall were as noisy as a tree full of blackbirds , and he was astonished at these people that Ottop208had fallen among , who welcomed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna Olson 's . They were already , in the way they accepted Otto , like sheep sheltering a fox . Now here they were admitting a kind of wolf , a revolutionary and rebel . By the time the first awkwardness wore off he began to be amused . He let himself be dragged into the parlor and seated at a table opposite Anna Olson , where he played clumsy whist for two hours , listening , keeping his mouth shut except to answer the questions Mrs. Olson put to him : What had he been doing , what was he doing now , was he working in Salt Lake , what brought him here , did he hear from anyone in Gefle . This last question she asked him a second time , as if she had n't heard or did n't believe his first answer , and her mild blue eyes probed him with a sort of insistence as if she expectedsome cryptic information that the others would not catch . He told her what he had told her before , what was true . He had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except his cousin John Alberg . And where was John ? That one he could not quite answer straight , for the last he had heard of John , he was shacked up on the beach at Hilo , bucking sugar bags on the wharf when he had to , and indulgingin a continuous luau between jobs . A dehorn , one of the casualties . He said that John had apparently settled down in Hawaii . " You left about the same time , " Anna said . " Pretty soon after Berta died . " " Yes . " " She had such hopes for you , " the woman said , with her look which invited all sorts of personal details , and held her head ready to listen , but he moved his lips and his eyebrows and said nothing . She took a trick and stacked it neatly and put her enlarged knuckles down on it while she studied her hand . " Do you still draw ? " " A little . "  | " Play the piano or violin ? " " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost absently , on the scars that marked his face and neck . Then she led out the remaining tricks swiftly and triumphantly and pawed them in toward her and said , " Ingrid plays the piano too . She gives lessons . We 're all proud of Ingrid . " Joe nodded to register politeness . Across at the round dining-roomtable where the girl sat he saw her flick a sideward look and knew she was aware they were talking about her . She brought her cards close to her face and consulted them seriously , rearranging them in a neat fan . At the third table Otto was being jovial , slamming his cards down on tricks with force enough to drive a stake . There was a lot of laughing going on . Joe grinned to himself . Such hopes for you , he said . Now look at you . Scars all over your map , rough clothes . It 's a cinch you have n't done so well . But we 're all proud of Ingrid . She gives music lessons to runny-nosed kids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost . In the midst of his abstraction , poking in like a stick into a snug rat 's nest , there came to him without warning or reason Moe Dreyfuss ' question : Where are you going , a fellow like you ? What are you after ? In what he suddenly perceived to be this stuffy middle-class parlor he sat and catechized himself in old Moe 's excitable voice , and with the whole batch of good Mormons in front of his nose he did not have to look far for an answer . Look what you might have done with your knack for music and drawing , he said . You could have been Professor Hillstrom with long hair and a violin case under your arm and given lessons to ten-year-olds and made almost enough to live on if you did n't bother with breakfast . You could have taught drawing in some grammar school and been a man who was asked to whist parties by a lot of pious Swedes like these . You could have played the organ in church , or sung in the choir.  |p210They  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " What ? " he said . " Your deal , " Anna Olson told him . The whist broke up about ten-thirty , and he found himself back in a corner with a plate and a coffee cup awkwardly balanced on his knees , listening to some woman whose name he did not know . She was telling him about her conversion and about how she was frightened to death when she first heard that Mormon missionaries were in town , as though they might have been gypsies  --  such stories you heard about the Mormons  --  until one night she was coming home and heard one of them speak on a street corner , and he seemed such an upright , clean young man , and he tried so hard in bad Swedish , falling all over himself so everybody laughed . But they were friendly , he was so obviously sincere , and she was struck by something he said . He said .. . Trapped and getting desperate , Joe moved the plate and crowded the coffee cup in among the crumbs of his cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sons of Otto 's landlady , looked at him , and one of them nudged Otto and they laughed . It made him sore to have been brought into this henyardand now to be stuck here . On the other side of the room somebody said clearly , " Play something , Ingrid , " and here was the girl standing up and working her way over to the piano . People backed up a little and arranged their chairs as she sat on the stool rubbing her fingers and smiling a little and blushing with the quick , passingsurge of pink . Two people moved their chairs directly in front of Joe so that now there was not a chance in the world of getting away . He found a table-edge for plate and cup and hooked his hands around one knee and leaned back , resigninghimself . At least the woman next to him could n't go on any further about her conversion while the piano was going . Ingrid Olson bent her head and touched the keys . Her face grew serious , almost strained , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He watched her curiously , a girl hep211had gone to school with and did not remember at all . Not a girl , actually , only a couple of years younger than he was , and he was thirty-one . He kept his eye on her , this old-maid music teacher who blushed at everything and was his contemporary , from his home town . She was supposed to be one of the smart ones , one everybody was proud of , and what had she arrived at , with her respectable start as the daughter of a shipwright ? As she started to play he said to himself , Well , somebody 's been spared a good Christian wife . The high jabber that had been raucous in the room since he came fell away to a hush , and she played . The thing she played was quiet and grave , as sedate as this whole roomful of people . At first he listened with mild contempt for the formlessnessand vague posturing ornamentation of the piece , but after a while he found himself listening harder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in the piece itself or the way she played it . The song did n't repeatitself like an ordinary song , but ran along like water . When she was finished she dropped her hands in her lap and blushed , and looking around the room Joe saw in the way they clapped and called for more that they really were proud of her . She gave them reason to think well of themselves as immigrants , Mormons , Swedes . Through a fringe of ferns he met Anna Olson 's proud eyes and he clapped with the others . All right , he admitted , she 's pretty good . Why should n't she be ? She 's a music teacher . They were still calling for more . " Maybe I 'll play a Chopin nocturne , " Ingrid said , and massaged her fingers and bent her head to the piano with the concentrated tightening look . This too was music of a kind he did not know , highbrow stuff . No Salvation Army tunes here , no Sunday band-concert marches . Something dreamy and fey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly ? Nighttime music ? He watched her precise hands with the realization that she was miles ahead of him , that by comparison he was no musicianat all but an uneducated amateur fit only to play on street corners with a tin cup strapped to his shin , or in some waterfront saloon.  |p212The  realization made him coldly mad . When they started clapping again he left his hands clasped around his raised knee . Then with a feeling like the feeling of being grazed by danger he felt a group turn to look toward him , and as the clapping spattered away to nothing he heard Otto say , " Sure , on the piano . He 's a composer , he 's written dozens of songs . " Full of respect , ready to be edified , their faces stared at him . Otto was grinning as if he had pulled off a good joke , and Ingrid Olson had half risen , clearing her skirts from the piano stool . " Come on , Joe , " Otto said . " Take your turn . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . " Not after that . " " Oh come on ! " they said . " Play some of your songs . " Beyond the ferns Anna Olson 's motherly accusing eyes were on him fondly . " You did n't tell me , Joseph , " she said . Shaking his head , Joe smiled at them and waved them off , but he got in one sharp look at Otto warning him to stop it at this , not to go on with any spiel about Joe Hill the Wobbly Troubadour . " Pie in the Sky " would sound pretty crummy after this highbrow nocturne stuff . " Otto 's just making a big joke , " he said . " I ca n't play the piano . " His eyes met the questioning eyes of Ingrid Olson and he said , " You play some more . " " Everybody 'd rather hear you . " " Come on ! " they said . They were full of laughter again , the chummiest , good-naturedest bunch of people he had ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and laid hands on him to pull him from his chair . Embarrassed and angry , he held back , a ridiculous object in a ridiculous position . " I ca n't play , " he kept telling them . " No , you 're mistaken . Otto 's fooling you . " " Do n't let him fool you , " Otto said . " He can play the fiddle too . Make him get up there . " Joe jerked away from their coaxing hands , really angry now . He saw them leave off their urging and their good nature at the same time . Their faces were hurt and offended , and in the silence he sat furiously , knowing that he looked sulky and not caring a damn . The hell with them , the bunch of Christers ,  |p213what  were they to him ? What business had any of them to yank and pull on him and try to make him do what he did n't want to do ? Finally he heard the quiet voice of Anna Olson . " I guess Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't you play some songs people can sing ? " To walk out now , while they gathered around the piano , was perfectly possible , but he resisted the impulse out of a stubborn intention not to show that he was bothered or in any way aware of the huffiness that had come into their looks towardhim . He picked up a magazine and read it while they sang . Once Otto went by with a girl and leaned to grin and whisper , " Say , I did n't mean to get you in a jam . " " No , " Joe said . " Oh holy smoke , not " Stubbornly he sat until the singing dwindled and people began to shake hands all around and start home . They shook hands with him too ; their concerned eyes looked him over , and he saw conversion in their looks and wondered why a Christian could n't be content with his own slice of heaven but always had to be yanking some sinner up beside him . Eventuallyhe got into the hall on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar : " Du , Joseph . " Anna and Ingrid Olson were behind him . " Are you in a hurry ? " For a moment he hesitated , but his anger had worn away and only his ironic amusement was left . " Not especially , " he said . " We never had a chance to talk . Why do n't you walk home with us ? We live just down the street . " " Getting pretty late . " " Oh , come along , " she said , and hooked one hand through his arm and the other through Ingrid 's , keeping the grip on his arm even when the path narrowed and he had to walk along in the weeds . " I 've been thinking all night , " she said . " I can remember when you were born . " " Yes ? " He meant the tone to imply that he was not particularlyanxious to have all the details . " It seems so long ago and so far away , " the woman said . Herp214fingers dug into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little forward and walking heavily . " I can hardly think Gefle is real , any more . You said you never heard from anybody there . " " No . " " And you 've never been back . " No . " I keep thinking it might be nice , " she said . Her sigh was a comfortable , wistful noise in the dark . " Maybe I 'd just be disappointed . We 've been here fourteen years . The old countrymight not seem the same . " Joe said nothing , walking beside the two women up the path along the wide unpaved street ; in the night air the weeds were aromatic and brittle ; somewhere , when Anna Olson 's voice paused , he heard the grassy low mutter of water in a ditch . " You 're not a Latter-day Saint , " Anna said . " You would n't know what I mean , probably , but this is more than home to us now . Arne and I came here partly so we could be married in the temple for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe coughed , feeling about as appropriate as a billy goat at a picnic . They were passing open weedy lots , and he saw the faint outline of the mountains in the starlight , a high black continuous rim beyond the shapes of houses and trees . He asked himself sarcastically if it was n't about time he got baptized ; about all he had done all evening was listen to faithpromotingdiscourses . The pause lengthened until he found himself absently counting their steps . Anna Olson finally said , " Your mother would have been glad about the music . Have you written lots of songs ? " " Only a few , " he said . " Otto was trying to get my goat . " This time , as she sighed , he heard her corset creak . He kept on walking beside her because she had been a friend of his mother 's and because she was the kind of woman his mother might have been now if she had lived . Quite suddenly he remembered a night when Anna had sat in the kitchen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy shapes of trees uprose on their left . Untrimmedshrubs hung over a fence and forced the sidewalkpathto bend outward toward the road . The women stopped at a gate , and Joe stopped with them . He could see the glint of Anna 's eyes as she looked up at him with her hand on the gatepost . " I always thought your father should have done something for you . " " Why should he ? " " But if he had the slightest feeling ... " " He never showed any signs of it , " Joe said , and tried to see Anna Olson 's face by the faint starlight , and added , " How do you even know for sure who my father is ? " While they stared at each other the girl moved restlessly across the gate from them . " Do n't you ? " Anna said . " I 've heard tales , that 's all . " " She never told anybody , " Anna said . " At least she never told me . But it was plain enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And your looks , too . After I 'd looked at you for a minute tonight it was very plain . Your eyes . " " Well , it 's a comfort to look like a small-town baron , " Joe said . " Not so small-town any more . Had n't you heard about him ? " " Yes , " Joe said , " I heard about him , but I 'm not very in-terested . " Ingrid pushed at the gate , interrupting something her mother had started to say . " Come on in for a while . " " No , I 'd better be getting back . " " Come on , we 'll make some coffee . " " Is n't it terrible ? " Anna said . " I 'm a good Saint otherwise , but I just ca n't give up coffee . I tried and tried , and so did Arne . " " No Swede would want to go to heaven if they did n't have coffee there , " Ingrid said . Her mother clucked at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mentally adding this to his other astonishments of the eve/ning . You had to be pretty hard up for sins before you could begin to bullyrag yourself about coffee-drinking . But he came along because his curiosity was growing . If his mother had lived she might have been just like this , even to the coffee . Suppose the Mormon missionaries had converted her  --  and they might easily have done so ; she was a sucker for salvation , and neither the state church nor the Mission Church was too friendly to fallen girls . Suppose she had been converted and had lived and had brought him to Utah as Anna Olson had brought her family . He might now be a returned missionary himself , worrying about his corrupt taste for Postum . On the narrow porch hidden behind the vines it was utterly black . A bird rustled , alarmed , in the curtain of creeper . From some stooping place Anna fumbled up the key and found the lock with it . " Shall we sit out ? " Ingrid said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " her mother said . " I 'll go get the coffee on . " Bumping around finding chairs , Joe could smell the girl , like Castille soap . Then a lamp flickered and steadied through the window and he saw three chairs , the hanging surfaces of leaves , the almost-buried porch rail . " Shall I bring the light out ? " Anna said from inside . " We do n't need it . It would just draw bugs . " Joe eased himself into one of the chairs . Inside there was the sound of a stove being shaken down and kindling being broken . " I ought to beat it , " he said . " She 's having to build up the fire . " " Do n't go , " Ingrid said . " She gets lonesome for home since Dad died . She loves having you . " She spoke in English , as she had spoken from the beginning to him . It was as if she wanted to emphasize a difference between herself and her mother . Her voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the church choir . But she seemed a pleasant enough girl . With the lamplight strikingit obliquely , her face was cleanly outlined ; he noticed that her eyes were rather deeply set , and that there was a long shadowy curve at her throat like a drawing that only suggestedp217neck and shoulders by a hint of line and a touch of shadow . He could see none of the self-consciousness that he had observedearlier . At least if she blushed over every word now it was too dark for him to see her . " What was that first piece you played tonight ? " he said . " Sinding 's Rustle of Spring . ' " Having asked and having been answered , he found himself with no ready thing to say . She sat with her hands in her lap and watched him . " How long did you have to take piano lessons before you could play a thing like that ? " " I do n't know . A long time , I guess . I started when I was seven . " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at how easily and naturally she laughed . " That 's something we do n't say out loud . " " Twenty years , say , " he said , and stared at her speculatively in the diffused lamplight . Twenty years while somebody else paid the bills . That was the difference . Without much more than dutifulness , probably , with no more than average talents , she spent twenty years learning to play pieces that would impressa lot of churchgoing Swedes at a whist party . He thought of himself and how he had followed organ grinders and street singers with violins and accordions , and of the hunger that had driven him to hang around fairs and festivals as a boy . As palpable as a wind came the memory of the YMCA piano and the Scotch sailor who had taught him his first chords and his awe at his own accomplishments when he first chorded out one of Luther 's hymns by ear . There had once been an itinerantmerry-go-round with a calliope and little painted horses , all of it run by the leg-power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen working like a galley slave and listening happily to the wheeze and whine of the music and taking his pay in free rides on lions and giraffes and spotted ponies . He remembered himself in one powerful multiplerush of recollection as he had been at ten , eleven , twelve , and the duskiness of the porch moved and flowed around him as the duskiness of his cottage bedroom had flowed aroundp218him in boyhood . He felt like knives the innocence and futility of the dreams he had dreamed . The bastard son of a sickly seamstress , to lie in his bed and imagine splendors and triumphs . Suddenly he wanted very much that this girl should know the man who sat beside her as Joe Hill , the maker of cartoons and writer of songs . He wanted to say , " Go into the lumber woods or any construction camp or any Wobbly hall up and down the coast and ask if they know Joe Hill . Start up one of the songs and see if they know it . Maybe it is n't highbrow stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the worker 's world . Once , let me tell you , I saw men sing a song I wrote and come right on into the deputies ' guns ... " As if she read his mind she said , " I wish you 'd played . " " I told you the truth , " he said . " I ca n't play . I 'm good enough to pound a piano in some saloon , that 's about how good I am . I never had the books . Nobody ever taught me . " " But Mr. What's-His-Name , Applequist , said you 'd written a lot of songs . " " Labor songs , " Joe said . " Most of them set to Salvation Army tunes . " " Did n't you ever try to write music yourself ? " " Once or twice . I never got anywhere . I do n't know enough . " There was a momentary hesitation . " I should think you could , " she said . Her face was turned out of the light so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " What makes you think that ? " " I do n't know . You look as if you 'd thought a lot . You look like a sensitive person . " Interested , he sat back in the chair . " Yee ! " he said . " That 's a new one . How do you figure out I 'm a sensitive person ? " " I was watching you tonight . " A late scrap of moon had climbed over the mountain wall and its light came through the leaves in flits and flashes . Anna Olson came and leaned in the door . " You must have had a lot of exciting times , " she said.  | " Where have you been to , you sailor ? " " Just about everywhere , " Joe said . " I started out on a passengersteamer between Stockholm and Hull . After that freighters , mostly  --  tramps . Around the Cape of Good Hope one voyage , and out through the Indian Ocean and Australia , and back to the states . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just around , generally . " " Imagine ! " she said , without any real interest . Then she added , " I 'm sorry the coffee is slow . The fire was clear out . " " You should n't have bothered . " " It 's no trouble . Just a minute now . " After a minute she went back in , and Joe said to Ingrid , " Most people that look at my face get the idea I 'm some kind of hard guy . I 'm supposed to have a poker face . " " You 've got a poker face all right , " she said seriously . " But it 's not like some poker faces . Some people just do n't have any expression because they 're dull people , but some freeze their faces so they wo n't show anything . That 's the kind you are . He was staring at her hard , surprised at her . Propping his knees on his elbows , he leaned forward , rubbing his hands together with a dry calloused rustle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read my character like a fortune teller ? What did my sensitive face give away ? " Ingrid stood up as if she had thought of something . " You ca n't freeze your eyes , " she said accusingly . " You were seeing everything that went on tonight , all around that whole room ! " She went inside and brought out a little table , and in a minuteher mother came bringing coffee and cake . There was no chance to pursue the interesting conversation with Ingrid . He praised the cake and then they were back in Gefle , recalling the dancing and fiddling contests on Midsummer Eve , and Pastor Eklund 's unlucky series of wives , and the fish peddler who sometimes got drunk and destructive and kicked his cart apart in the street and scattered herrings over half a block . The moon had climbed a long way , clear above the high eaves of the porch , when Joe stood up . " How late do the streetcars run ? "  | " Oh my goodness ! " Anna said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into town . " She hurried in to look at the clock . " It 's after one , " she said , returning . " The owl car will be gone . I just got so interested I did n't think . " " How far is it in to North Temple ? " " Oh , you could n't walk . It 's seven miles . Maybe we could ... " " What about Mrs. Erickson ? " Ingrid said . " She 's got a spare room for rent . He might get that for tonight . " " She would n't be up , " Joe said . " The boys would be . They never go to bed , or Mr. Applequisteither . " " All right , " Joe said . " I 'll try there . " " I feel responsible , " Anna Olson said . " I 'll go over with you . " " No , " he said . " I can make out . If I have to walk in , it wo n't kill me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " you 'd get a lot of chances to play the piano for them . " She was laughing ; after a moment he laughed too . " I 'd be right handy for music lessons , at least . " " Why sure , " she said . " Any time . " " You mean that ? " " Of course . " " Could you teach me about harmony ? " " What are you talking about , you two ? " Anna said . " Teach you music ? " " Sure , " Ingrid said . " If I brought over a song sometime , could you try out the arrangement and maybe take the kinks out ? " " I should think so . " " You got a new pupil , " he said . " When 's the best time ? " " I do n't have any pupils after five any day . " " Expect me sometime after five . ' For a step or two she followed him along the path . " Any particular day ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have to write the song first . " Their goodnights and their invitations to come again wentp221with him through the overgrown gate . He walked two blocks back to the Erickson house and found Otto and the two Ericksonboys drinking beer on the high front porch . When he asked about a room Otto was all over him , urging him to move out for good . " Listen , " Otto said . " You 're right next to the smelter , practically . We could maybe get you on the bullgang , at least . You better move out . You know the kind of grub Ma Erickson spreads ? Herrings , the only place in Salt Lake , and coffee cake and fruit soup . You live out here a week you 'll start putting some meat on your bones . You could stick around all winter and organize the smelter . We 'll all join the One Big Union and wear buttons and damn the boss . " " It would n't do you any harm , " Joe said . Karl Erickson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Otto said , and put his arm around Joe 's shoulders . " I 've known this guy a long time . He 'd never tell you who he was . He gave you that deaf-and-dumb act about the piano , but you know who he is ? You ever hear of Joe Hill ? " He mauled Joe around . " These guys are no scissorbills , they know the score . " The Erickson brothers peered at him . There was respect in the way they leaned in the shadows . " Joe Hill ? " they said . " My God , are you Joe Hill ? You better stay . " That was something , at least , after the beating he had taken from Chopin . He let them lead him upstairs , and in the end he let Otto talk him into sharing his room . In the morning he could decide whether or not he would stay . HE AWOKE sharply and alertly , instantly aware of the strange room , instantly taking it in and understanding it . He saw the white-enameled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston rocker , the dresser . He saw his own and Otto 's clothes on floor and chairback . His recognition of them was like a renewed recognition of himself : the vague expectancythat had haunted him ever since his arrival in Salt Lake did not make of these things the sources or keys of future events . They existed for themselves , and so did he . Otto was sleeping heavily with his face to the wall , taking advantage of Sunday morning . Lightly Joe got out of the bed ; bending and stooping and exercising himself for a moment , he felt as limber and tough as a whip . There was no doubt in his mind that he would stay here . It was clean , it had none of the notoriety of Mother Wynn 's . And there was a piano a couple blocks away , and Ingrid Olson for a schoolteacher . He had not written a song for a long time . In the kitchen he found Mrs. Erickson slapping around in old felt slippers . With her teeth out and her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , and before ten o'clock he caught a streetcar up the long straight reach of State Street toward the scaffolded dome of the Capitol . A halfhourlater he was at the Wobbly hall . This too was a strange place of the utmost familiarity . There was a class in socialism going on . When it broke up he eased into the conversation  --  an old song , both words and music  --  about the proper conduct of a union hall.  --  Yes , but that 's just the point . A union hall is n't a flophouse , even if you do organize migrants . The minute you make it a flophouse you start getting in bums that join up just for the free flop and the mulligan.  --  What harm does that do ? You got a house committee , the place can be kept clean . Go on in there now , it 's clean . What harm does it do to let stiffs roll a blanket on the floor and maybe boil up a pot of java ?  --  I told you . It brings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get so choosy ? I thought we wanted everybody in.  --  Maybe we do , but not to flop in the hall.  --  Like me ? I flop in the hall.  --  No , not like you . What the hell ! But I 've seen some guysp223come through here and spend a week that I 'd sure hate to count on as union men . And I know plenty of home guards that stay away from here just because it 's always full of hoboes with their socks and undershirts hung out to dry.  --  That 's too damn bad about the homeguards . They got wives to wash their socks . Let me tell you , if it was n't for the hall sometimes .. .  --  What it seems to me , the hall is the surest way of maintainingsolidarity . If a worker knows that wherever he goes he can find friends and fellow workers and a place to put up in for a few days while he hunts a job , he 's going to think a lot more about the union , because it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he does n't have to sleep in it and hang out his socks in it . There are plenty of workers right here in town that would bring their wives to meetings  --  and that 's something we want too , is n't it ? But they wo n't bring them because they 're never sure what kind of guys they 'll find around.  --  So the only thing to do is what I 've always said . Have two halls , one for business and social meetings and one for a unionrunboardinghouse . They worried the argument back and forth in a desultory , Sunday-morning way while Joe listened . Through an open door he saw a massive man with a head like a block of granite come into the next room and sit down at a desk . That ought to be Jud Ricket , the secretary . Joe rose and went in . The secretary looked at him across the littered rolltop desk with eyes of a startling , polished black . He bulged with life ; a look from him was as intense as a stab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A manager , a corner . He put out his hand . " Ricket ? " " Yes . " " Joe Hill . " Without taking his eyes from Joe 's , Ricket reached out a big blucher-cut shoe and hooked a chair within reach . While Joe sat down Ricket studied him with curiosity , a jerky tic like a smile moving one corner of his mouth . " Nobody told me you were coming , " he said.  | " Nobody knew . " " On your way somewhere ? " " I thought I might eventually get over to Colorado . " " Look in on Mr. Rockfeller , uh ? " Ricket said . " Do n't let anybody fool you , that can get bad . " " Lately I 've spent a lot of my time raising money for the Oatfielddefense committee , " Joe said . " You doing anything about that ? " " Usual thing . Collection , street meeting . We 've sent in a couple of contributions . But I do n't know , I just ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why not ? " The fleeting wide smile touched Ricket 's lips , held for a moment , and snapped off . " Fuzzy Llewellyn was a member in bad standing , for one thing . He 'd been blacklisted out of the Stockton local . " " Art Manderich was in good standing . " " I know , " Ricket said . " I ought to be in there pitching , but I just ca n't get my heart in that one the way I can in some others . " " An injury to one is an injury to all , " Joe said . " That 's a fact , " Ricket said solemnly . " That 's a fact , sure enough . But some injuries just advertise better than others . Who 's this Hale ? Just some little punk rancher . If those boys had been used up by the lumber trust , or the copper trust , or John D. , then the case would advertise better . " " Maybe they did n't go in there and get killed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes . The twitch moved Ricket 's mouth again and he flapped his hand on the desk . " Well , " he said , and shrugged . " We 've sent what we could . It 's a little far away from us here . We 're sort of in a backwater . " " Anything doing at all ? " " Mainly on-the-job organizing . We 've got to lay a foundationin this state before we can get anywhere . Haywood tried Bingham last year . You know how far he got . They busted his strike with Mexican scabs . But he left a lot of buttonsp225behind . We 're trying to spread it in the smelters and up in Park City and down in the coal camps . Next time we pull a big strike we want support . " There was a question in his black eyes , but Joe shook his head . " I do n't want to waste my time working on some smelter bullgang when I could be doing something important . Do you know how many dollars it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cost to save a man from the chair ? " " Yeah , " Ricket said , not as an answer but as an acknowledgment of the force of the argument . He rubbed his hands circularly one upon the other and then reached for a big brass-ended advertising pencil and twirled it between his palms . " This is a bad town for raising money in , " he said . " No town 's much different . " " I do n't know , " Ricket said , " maybe these Mormons tithe away all they got . I should think for the Oatfield boys you might do better down on the coast . " " I just came from the coast , " Joe said . He knew what was the matter with Ricket . Ricket liked the organizing and he liked a fight , but he did n't like dispersing himself in a dozen directions helping defend every organizer that got thrown in jail . " I had a hunch when I came into this town , " Joe said . " I can do something here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ricket tossed and caught the pencil . " That was a suggestion , that 's all . " Looking restlessly around the jamb of the door , Joe nodded at the old flatbed press in the main room . " I see you 've got a press . Ricket nodded . " A song printed on cards will double or triple your take at a street meeting , " Joe said . " A really good song can make you fifteen or twenty dollars . " Ricket nodded again . " Now I see where you come in . You got a song ? " " I can write one . "  | " Then you 'd be a sucker to go to work organizing in a smelter , " Ricket said , and hitched himself forward to hump over the desk . He gave Joe a glance of almost winsome friendliness . " I got a single-track mind , I try to drag everybody I see into what I 'm interested in at any special time . I want you to know we 're glad to have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm at a boardinghouse down in Murray . " " There 's a cot up at my place . " " Thanks , I 'm fixed . " " About food , " Ricket said , and smiled his phantasmal smile . " If you go broke , there 's a Chink on First South will give you credit any time on the strength of your card . " Joe stood up , and the swivel chair shot backward against the wall as Ricket struggled to his feet . " Any time you get a song ready , " Ricket said . He shook hands with Joe and watched him go out  --  Ricket , a great black bear of a man with an odd manner , and a smile that came and went like the play of muscles when a man grits his teeth . Maybe he was getting everything that the traffic would bear out of Salt Lake and maybe he was n't . They would see what a Joe Hill song would do . Maybe it would wake this burg up a little . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning heat with his mind already beginning to churn out scraps of rhyme , sort among the old familiar tunes . One song , we will sing one song . . . and there was the tune . The words same thronging to pair with it , and he went up a strange street wrapped in his inner swathings of contemplation , working at the verses . My Old Kentucky home sold for taxes , gobbled by the landlord , raided by the cops , taken over by the bank , sold by the sheriff at public sale . There was plenty you could do with the idea . He walked a street in Salt Lake City , in the bright stare and clarity , the barren brilliant light of a Septembermorning , with words moving in his head , and he inquired the way to the public library and turned left out of the sun . As he turned , he saw something out of the corner of hisp227eye . Inside a pawnshop window , ringed by harmonicas and banjos and watches with thick chains , was an automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs , he felt the emptiness where the Luger had used to ride , and he thought of how once in their talk Jud Ricket 's shiny black eyes had dropped to the place where a hidden gun would be . In that flick of Ricket 's glance he had seen a reflection of his own legend : Joe Hill , an ice-eyed stiff with a rod under his arm , a maker of songs and a hunter of trouble , an uncompromising enemy of the master class but maybe dangerous , maybe hard to handle . With hardly a break in his stride he turned into the pawnshop , and five minutes later he came out with the gun in a package in his pocket . Now he went full stature again , veritablyJoe Hill , wearing the things that completed and uttered him : an empty purse , a gun , the forming words of a song . By the time he reached the stone library below the spread wings of the Eagle Gate he had arranged the easily alternated counters of his belief into a stanza . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The horny-handed son of the soil , He 's toiling hard from the cradle to the grave , But his master reaps the profits of his toil . Other stanzas were clamoring at the gate , half seen . One song of the politician , one song of the children in the mills , one song of the girl below the line , one song of the poor and ragged tramp , one song ... of the preacher , fat and sleek , He tells you of homes in the sky . He says " Be generous , be lowly and be meek , If you do n't you 'll sure get roasted when you die . " At the circulation desk he waited impatiently for the girl to come from sorting cards at a file . " I 'd like to borrow a pencil for a few minutes , " he said . The girl 's eyes behind round windows of glass jumped to meet his . He saw her mouth pop open . Two words came out : " We do n't ... " Her tongue touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word and without taking her eyes from his face she reached sideways and groped up a long sharply pointed pencil and laid it in his hand . " I GUESS I do n't quite understand what it is you do , " she said . It was the third time he had been to the Olson house . On the music rack of the piano sat the scribbled and erased music notebook they had been working on : a song he had begun long ago , in San Pedro , and had never been able to finish . Between the lines of music Joe had copied out the first verse , to see how the words matched with the notation . Workers of the world , awaken ! Break your chains ! Demand your rights ! All the wealth you make is takenBy exploiting parasites . " I 'm an organizer , " he said . He heard Anna Olson at the dishes in the kitchen . Through the open window he saw a man and two little girls setting up a ladder under an apple tree red with fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . There was a smell of mown alfalfa . Eastward the Wasatch showed between poplar trees , its slopes bronze and pink with the late sun and the first beginnings of autumn . He had a momentary perception of how peaceful it was , and he thought of a little shanty somewhere in the hills . " You do n't work in any particular place , " Ingrid said . He let himself look at her serious , interested face , into her eyes that held his a moment and then dropped . She had nice skin and a faint clean smell , and sitting next to her was still an unfamiliar and faintly disturbing experience . He remembered having been bumped by her arm as she leaned to pencil somethinginto the music notebook . " Have n't you heard about the IWW ? " he said . " I go some/place and stay long enough to plant a few sticks of dynamite , and then I clear out and go blow something up somewhere else . " " No , seriously . Do you make speeches ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " How do you organize , then ? " " Talking to the men . Generally there 's dissatisfaction , maybesome trouble . I get them to pull together , form a committee . At meetings , I 'm generally the guy that thumps the piano . Sometimes I draw cartoons just to get people laughing , you know , promote solidarity . People fight a lot better when they can sing , or when they 've got something to laugh at . " " Who tells you what to do ? Do you get paid by the locals where you go , or by a national office , or what ? " He stiffened a little at that , delicately touched in his pride . " I never took a dollar from the union . " Her face went pink with the easy blush , and he saw that she felt rebuked . Watching her reach up self-consciously to smooth the pages of the music notebook , he thought of how much he could tell her that would shock her pious ignorance , and felt magnanimous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what it is you do . " I guess not . The struggle of labor against the bosses was more than she ever would understand . " You have to live somehow , though , " she said . He laughed . " A man can live quite a while on what he can mooch from free-lunch counters in saloons . " That brought her eyes up , testing him to see if he were joking . In a careful voice she said , " I see . Where do you sleep ? " " Under bridges , out in the jungles , on park benches . Or I can always unroll a blanket on the floor of the local hall . " Just when he expected her to smile she gave him her direct , serious look . " It 's your whole life , is n't it ? " Somehow he felt the question as an accusation , and he stood up , tired of this conversation . He had taken a lot of satisfaction in doing for the past week what he had been doing , butp230he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ingrid Olson . " Let 's go down and take in a show , " he said . A little smile of malice curled her mouth . " Can you get tickets at a free-lunch counter ? " Joe shrugged . " You gave me my supper . Why should you kick at buying me tickets to a show ? " First she laughed , and then she touched four black keys on the piano , and then she looked up at him with the pink washing again into her face . He saw that she would take him to the show if he asked it . Holy smoke ! he said to himself . Aloud he said , " Quit worrying how I live . It 's been two or three years since I even thought about it . Right now , as a matter of fact , I 've got five dollars that I borrowed from Otto . " " You 'll have to pay it back sometime . " " That 's Otto 's worry . " " You 're a shiftless man , Mr. Hillstrom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket and smiled at her . " I can afford to be shiftless . The world owes me a living . My labor has created enough wealth already so I could retire on my fair share of it . " " If you could get it . " " Yeah , if I could get it . " That night late , standing under the dark vines , he kissed her and found her lips warm , her body willing . For half a minute his hands were all over her , his mouth hot on hers , but then she strained backward , pushing him away . He reached for her again , his blood thick in his ears and his breath fast , and felt how the thin stuff of her dress slipped on her shoulders . " No , no Joe , please ! " The hot fit passed , and he saw her coolly : a middle-class , conventional , pious , proper woman , a believer in marriage and property and children and cottages with vines on the porch and a husband with a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much about him and did n't half understand what she knew.  | " Okay , no , " he said . " Joe . . . " What ? " With her hands on his arms she turned him so that the vague glow of the lamp inside the parlor fell across his face . Her eyes looked into his so long that he began to wonder what she was up to . It was as if she hunted for something , her eyes pried at him . But she said nothing . At last she shivered suddenly and crowded against him , pressing her face into his shoulder , and broke away and ran inside . Walking home , he spoke ironically and with some astonishmentto himself . He said , Joe , look what you 've just had offered to you on a platter . This is the chance of a lifetime . You can marry this girl and get a house and a couple of acres of land thrown in . All the rest of your life you can sit around the house in carpet slippers and spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while your wife earns the bread and butter giving music lessons . You even get a mother-in-law to boot for cook and bottle-washer . You can settle down on Forty-Eighth South Street in the middle of the Salt Lake Valley and to hell with the workers ' revolution . To hell with the troubles of miners in Colorado or gyppo men down on the D &; RG or stoop-crop pickers in the San Joaquin Valley . To hell with the radicals in the capitalistic jails . You can sit around the rest of your life eating apples and playing whist with a lot of Swedes and talking about the old country . That 's a fact , he said to himself  --  more and more astonished , more and more ironical . All you have to do is reach out your hand . And be good , he said . You 'll have to promise to be good . You could n't be kept around the house unless you were housebroke . The Erickson house was dark . So was every other house on the thinly built-up street . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard the dry unwearied noise of the cottonwood leaves like the rustling of thoughts in his mind.  |p232The  loneliness that always lived with him , and especially late at night , came out of the dark and hobnobbed with him on the empty porch : a melancholy nighttime yearning washed in on the barely moving night air . He put his feet on the rail and pushed his chair back against the wall and closed his eyes . After a while he found himself in the midst of people he admired , the uncompromising enemies of the system , men and women he would have gone a long way to see and would have used for the models of his own life . As if he had been there , he saw Frank Little parading back and forth in the street , up in the Mesabi , his tough , onesidedmouth distorted in jeers and his tongue going in a steady stream of profane catcalls , daring the finks inside their headquarters to come out and get him . You think I'mafraid of you , you scabby sons of bitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away . What 's holding you back ? You hired out to beat up workingmen . Why do n't you start on me ? I 'm a red , red Wobbly , I 'm a radical agitator , and I hate the guts of every scabby fink of you . Why do n't you come out and startto work ? He saw Frank Little throw his crutch fifty feet out in the dust and hobble along without it between silent , watchingminers and the company headquarters full of finks . A human flame , a fire of hatred and protest , he dared the whole wage system and its gunmen single-handed . And Frank Little faded and the picture of Gurley Flynn 's red mane came in . He saw the veritable twist of her lips as she spoke from a soapbox , and felt the electricity she gave off . Another flame . And The Flynn faded into Katie Phar , the kid Katie with her child 's eyes and her child 's silvery voice , a kind of saint , an innocent homely Joan of Arc , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And behind Katie as she sang outside the Spokane jail came the other faces  --  the grim creased mask of Art Manderich , the gopher teeth of Fuzzy Llewellyn bared in a still grin , Herb Davis ' cocked jaw , the serious , intellectual intentness of Tom Barnabas , the rocky immovable face of Big Bill Haywood . They came like a parade , the fighters , the devoted and dedicated and incorruptible . They came in crowds  --  the free-speech fighters in San Diegop233driven back by the white blasts of firehoses , washed away like chips , and re-forming and coming back to be blasted again , and re-form again , and come on . He heard them singingin the Fresno jail , and opened his eyes on the darkness of this sleeping street , the blotted shadows of trees and houses , the high crestline of the Wasatch cutting off the stars . He remembered himself kissing Ingrid Olson at her front gate , and the way her eyes searched and pried at his for some assurance , and said to himself , No , my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to wear that collar . Then what was he doing hanging around Salt Lake ? He ought to get out of here and hike for Colorado where he could do some good . What he had told Jud Ricket was strict truth . He did n't want to spend his time in the routine slow groundworkorganizing in preparation for something a year or two years away . He was a trouble-shooter and he ought to be where trouble was brewing . Yet there were Fuzzy and the others in the Sacramento jail . He knew precisely why Fuzzy had stuck to his soapbox in that fracas . As definitely as if Fuzzy had told him he knew that Fuzzy stuck because he wanted to prove he was no dehorn . The Stockton local that had blacklisted him had to be shown that Fuzzy was as truebluea rebel as lived . And Joe Hillstrom ? Why was Joe Hillstrom breaking his neck to raise money for Fuzzy 's defense ? Oh yes , he said to himself , that 's a good question  --  and saw himself cutting through the clutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . His mind ducked and bent , reaching out for the thought of the songs . Down at the hall the cards with " My Old KentuckyHome " still drying on them ; over at Ingrid Olson 's the notebook with the half-completed " Workers of the World . " As if talking with some questioner or critic , he framed an orderly plan : I want to stay in Salt Lake long enough to get a lot of songs done . I can always have the use of a piano , and this Olson girl can help me with the harmony when I bugger it up . Maybe I 'll try a popular song or two , waltzes or two-steps , not labor songs at all . If I could get one or two of those publishedp234and sold I could turn over the royalties to the defense fund . There 's a lot more money in that kind than in a labor song printed on a card , and besides , the money for a popular song comes out of good bourgeois pockets , not out of workingmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will overturn it .. . A vaudeville singer in a straw hat , leaning on a cocky cane , sang from a brilliant stage , and a face , unrecognized but unmistakable , looked at Joe Hill with admiration and said distinctly , " I hear your song all over , everybody 's singing it " singingwhat turkey trot singing what and he bent his head at the post office window and said " I want a money order for five hundred dollars make it to the General Defense Fund , IndustrialWorkers of the World . " I ca n't get all that on one line , the face inside the window said , and turned his pad , too bad , and Joe said , " Make it IWW , that wo n't trouble you . " He fell back from the window as Ingrid Olson put her head out , serious , with her hair in thick braids , and she said , " You 're so shiftless , Mr. Hillstrom , " but he held the blue slip of the money order up in front of her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mean to the union to have just one rich bird in it . Everybody in the whole IWW is a working stiff without a cartwheel to his name , or an intellectualwith shiny pants . Suppose just once some old Moneybagsdied and left a million to the union . Just suppose there was a really fat defense fund , plenty of money for strike relief . What if we had the money to fight them in the courts and in the press and everywhere where money gives them every advantage . Out of the darkness beyond the porch came Joe Hill , walkingerectly in a good blue suit . As he passed along a picket line , men spoke to him in friendship and admiration . He went into a hall and saw a strike committee sitting at a table and he said , " How much of a strike fund do you need to keep from being starved back to work ? " The checkbook unfolded before their astonished faces . Angrily , shaking himself , he stood up in the dark and the silence . The noise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it began again , a dry , clicking whisper . He leaned out to see if he could detect any sign of light down toward the Olson house , but saw none . All alone , he felt how his thoughts and desires warred in him , how much remained to do , how everything he did was not enough . A man could go sleepless for a hundred years , and work like a horse the whole time , and complete not one tenth of what he wanted to do . He thought of Thor , trying to drink the ocean dry and tear up the roots of the Midgard Serpent . Hell , he said , and let himself in . The house was still , the dining-room clock a loudness in the enclosed dark . He walked along the edge of the stairs , off the carpet , to avoid the squeaks . In the room he scratched a match , found the lamp on the dresser , and touched flame to wick , so that the room brightened around him into enameled bedstead and pottery pitcher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed was empty ; Otto still tatting around somewhere . His pleasure at finding the room empty gave a shove to the vague intention that had brought him upstairs . As if he had planned just this , he got paper and pencil and sat under the lamp with a magazine on his knees for a writing pad . A popularsong . Something for lovers and kids in high schools , some tune for bands to play on Sunday afternoons in a thousand parks . A waltz , maybe , some joyride song , something to sweep the country like Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay , some song that every good middle-class housewife would have to have on her piano , something every music teacher would give her pupils . Thoughtfully he opened the magazine , turning its pages , looking among its words and pictures for inspiration , for a starter , an idea that would set him off . Much later the sound of someone coming in made him look up from his paper with its scratched lines and its tentative annotations for a tune . He looked across at Otto 's alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were muffled for a moment in the hall carpet . Then the door opened and Otto looked in.  |p236For  an instant he hung in the doorway . His grin was turned on ; in the shadow he looked hare-lipped . Then he closed the door carefully and quietly and crossed to the bed and sat down . He did not look as if he had been out with a girl , or at a show . He wore corduroy pants that were streaked with mud . A patch of white cobweb like cheesecloth clung to the shoulder of his coat . Around his neck he wore a red bandanna handkerchief loosely tied . Joe glanced down at the pockets of Otto 's coat and saw that they sagged heavily as if full of apples . " You 're up late , " Otto said . " So are you . " Continuing to smile , Otto untied the bandanna and threw it on the dresser . He yawned and shook his head with a doglikeshudder . " You do n't have to make that whistle in the morning . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work-ing ? " Joe folded his papers and put them in a drawer . When he scratched himself he felt the lean bars of his ribs . " I 'm thinking of making it permanent , " he said . " I can always borrow from you when I need a few bucks . " Otto turned his back and slipped out of the coat and hung it up on a wall hook . It sagged heavily , and Joe speculated on what it contained . Silverware , maybe . Something compactand heavy and valuable . Or maybe just Otto 's secondstorytools . Interested but not especially curious , he watched Otto undress , and thought of Ingrid 's question , " But how do you live ? " It amused him to think what she might say if she knew how that jolly whist-playing Mr. Applequist managed to get along . Or Joe Hillstrom either , for that matter , though he kept himselfcarefully in another category . At that , he would probably have to do something about a job . He could n't coast all winterwithout a stake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , answering so long after the conversation had stopped that Joe had to hunt back for what he had said . Otto pulled down the striped police suspenders.  | " Up to a certain point , " he said , and grinned widely , full of slyness , pleased at something he knew , and yawned so cavernouslythat deep in his mouth the lamplight discovered the spark of a gold tooth . THE WEATHER in Salt Lake City in late September is likely to be even , temperate , so balmy that the mind sinks into it as the body might sink into a featherbed . There are no dramatics to mark the transitional season : the earth tilts gently , day by day , away from summer and into fall : the oakbrush on the mountainslopes goes dull bronze , and then red-copper ; in the gullies the sumac flames , and on the high slopes , among the winterdarkeningspruce , the aspens are groves of gold . The morning sun lifts over the Wasatch crest into a faint haze that fills the valley , and as September draws on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley haze , it sets like a bulbous orange . In the wake of the year the poplars yellow along ditchbanks and lanes . It is weather for parables of the grasshopper and the ant . The industrious glean and gather and preserve and store , bins and barrels are full , the storehouses of the Mormon bishops bulge with the accumulated tithes in produce . Along West Second South the stiffs with a winter stake begin thinking of California , or settle in against the coming cold in boardinghousesand the rooms of small hotels . In Europe the nations eye one another and hurry the preparations for war ; in San Francisco Kelly 's Army is being assembled to beat its way across the continent to storm Washington in protest against unemployment . In the reading room of the Carnegie Public Library , which he uses scornfully and of right as a meager compensation for what Carnegie has taken from the pockets of workingmen , Joe Hill sits almost every morning with paper before him , workingp238on verses , or putting into six-by-six drawings the acid of his discontent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a big watch chain hiding behind a corner near which lies a wallet labeled " Fair Wages . " Stooping to pick up the wallet is a worker in overalls , but leading from the wallet to the fat man 's hand is a string with many little tags on it . Of the three which can be read , one says " Premium holdback , " another says " Company store , " and a third says " Company boardinghouse . " Or many men with strong faces are marching toward a dawn called " Industrial Freedom . " Or a man is sweeping a littered street with a big broom entitled " Industrial Unionism , " and the broom is heaping into a trash cart assorted debris named " Starvation Wages , " " Lousy Bunkhouses , " " The Ten-Hour Day , " " Company Spies . " Alreadyin the cart is a dead horse with all four feet in the air , and tied to one ankle a label : " Exploitation of Labor . " Or four men press their faces against the bars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four dangling nooses . The caption says , " They fought for you . Will you let them die for you ? " He makes these drawings , or awaits the inspiration of a rhyme , and at noon he goes out for a sandwich and coffee . After that he drops off at the hall what he has ready for Jack Carpenter , the printer , or leaves with Jud Ricket a cartoon to be sent to the Industrial Worker . For reasons that he does not thoroughly phrase even to himself , he does not spend much time at the hall . Sooner or later someone he knows is bound to come through , and he does not want to see anyone he knows . There is the unfinished business at Gaviota , and the near recollection of the police at Lund 's door . He tells himself that he is scrupulous about getting the union involved in anything , and he is honest in this belief . His expenses are for carfare and the noon sandwich . The newspapers that he reads religiously he gets in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already a week in arrears , he is not troubled . He does not drink or smoke , andp239his relations with the only women he knows in Salt Lake are such that they expect to feed him any time he shows up at their door . His musical handmaiden will sit with him at the piano for hours any afternoon or evening . They have finished the " Workers of the World " song ; " My Old Kentucky Home " has so far earned eighteen dollars at street meetings . And by himself , secretly , wanting this to be entirely his own , Joe has written words and music of a popular song called " Come Joyridewith Me in My Aeroplane , " and begun a waltz to which as yet he has put no name . One after another the days pour westward into the dead lake , windless days without stir or commotion or portent . And yet sometimes , looking up at the enigmatic wall of mountains , he feels how close to something these days may be . In this lotused interlude he sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming as sure it will come . Until one day he came out onto the library steps in the hazy heat of afternoon and shook the change in his pocket , brought it out to count it in his palm . A quarter , two dimes , two pennies . The quarter would go for lunch , a nickel for carfare . Tonighthe would arrive back at the boardinghouse with seventeencents in his pocket . The day was placid , cloudless , a little warmer than usual . On the exposed east side of the street it felt like hot summer . The trees drooped with heat ; in the opposite gutter he caught the hurrying gleam of water . Aimlessly he pocketed the change . When he started walking he took the direction that he had taken every day for more than a week , turning right on First South and moseying along under the awnings on the north side . Midway in the block he stopped , as he had several times stopped before , and looked in the window . There was a piano there , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its cover was propped up on a stick so that he could see its gilded strings like a harp laid sideways inside the curved wood . He had never played a grand piano ; he wondered howp240it would feel , how it would sound . A chaste card propped against one leg of the instrument told him what it would cost to find out : $984 . A reverie held him there at the window . A thousand dollars for one musical instrument , and in plenty of homes that he could suppose and imagine , a piano like this one would be standard equipment , as much taken for granted as dishes or beds . There were people in the world who could buy a piano like this as offhandedly as he would buy a hot pork sandwich . As he stood looking , his fingers felt the coins in his pocket , sorted them , slid them one over the other . On the carpet between the piano and the plate glass , sheet music was spread in a carefully careless fan so that titles showed , and sometimes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang or played or wrote the music . As far as Joe could see , the faces of these ornately successful people were alike , with oiled hair and little mustaches , except one who wore a derby cocked over one eye . That one was George M. Cohan . He supposed that if a song came into the hands of George M. Cohan , and he liked it and sang it , a hundred thousand people would automatically buy the sheet music . If Cohan sang it on a gramophone record , everyone who had a gramophonewould want that record , and for every record bought there would be a fee or royalty to the man who wrote the song . Say one cent a record , just to be conservative . A hundredthousand records would mean a thousand dollars to the author . And say two cents on each piece of sheet music , where no George M. Cohan would be involved except as a picture on the cover . That would be two thousand more . Three thousand dollars for one song . As gingerly as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with axe and alpenstock , his imagination went over the song he had been carrying around in his pocket for a week , neatly copied into sheets from one of Ingrid 's music notebooks . He tried to summarize and catalogue what a song had to have . Sentiment , sure , some talk about sweethearts and how much a lover missed or loved or would do for his girl.  |p241And  everything had to be like the Garden of Eden , all moonlightand weeping willows , made for spooning . It seemed to him too that there ought to be some twist , some new and catchy note . His aeroplane song had them all , and it had a dancy two-step tune . The slight bulge in his coat pocket might be worth three thousand dollars . The men who wrote the songs that George M. Cohan sang made that much from a song , and they would write a dozen , two dozen songs a year . His impulse was to go in , but he hesitated , wondering if maybe he ought to get Ingrid to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song was his own , she had never seen it . And a glance at himself in the reflecting window showed him the blue suit and the high collar : he had dressed up that morningbecause his corduroy pants were in Mrs. Erickson 's washtub . Well , why not ? What could he lose ? If a song had to be sent somewhere , New York maybe , to get it published , then someone in here ought to know . And if there was any chance of publishing it here in town , this ought to be as good a place to find it out as any . He went in . Among pianos , spinets , parlor organs , sets of drums , tables of songbooks and sheet music , he stood waiting in the abrupt dark coolness of the store . The place was empty except for two young clerks talking confidentially back at the rear , where the office was . Now one of them came forward , snapping his fingers lightly as he came , his head a little sideways in an inquiringsort of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His trousers had a crease fit to carve a roast . On his shirt front he wore a rectangular black pin with a single diamond set off-center in it  --  a lodge pin of some sort , apparently  --  and on his plump left hand a big black and silver ring of the same design . " Yes , sir ? " he said . He had the air of a trained seal waiting for a thrown fish . He was deferential , suave , polite ; he wore none of that superiority that Joe had instinctively tightened in preparation for . Reassured , Joe said , " I want to see somebody about a song . "  |p242The  salesman pivoted as neatly as if executing a dance step and laid one hand on the stacked music table . " Something new ? Ragtime ? Waltz ? Here 's the latest Castle tune , what they call a foxtrot . Everybody 's buying this one . We ca n't keep it in stock . " He whipped the music from the stack and held it in his hand , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " Joe said , feeling foolish , standing still . " I do n't want to buy a song . I 've got one I wrote , I wanted to ask somebody about publishing it . " Absently the salesman reached the sheet music back on the pile . Touched by thought , he stood eyeing Joe , and now Joe felt the inspection that took in clothes , shoes , face . " I see , " the salesman said . " Well , that 's something a little different . You wrote it , you say . " " Words and music , " Joe said . " I 've written songs before , but never the tunes . This is the first time ... The large gray eyes of the salesman remained on him contemplatively . " Who published the others ? " " You would n't know them , " Joe said impatiently . " They 're in a songbook , eight or ten of them . " " Uh , " the salesman said . " I 'd like to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just the new one . I wanted to ask somebody ... " " Let 's see it . " Joe handed it over . He was beginning to feel like a fathead , being quizzed by this dude salesman , but he told himself that if he wanted the song published he would certainly have to show it to somebody . " Maybe that 's not your line , " he said . " Maybe I ought to send it to New York . " " Urn , " the salesman said . Without raising his bent head or interrupting his study of the notebook sheets he called out , " Eddie , come on up here . " The other young man came up , a tall thin young man with pimples , and looked from Joe to the plump salesman . He was one who wore boredom as some people wear loud socks . " What 's up ? " " Man has a song he wrote , " the plump one said . He smiledp243at his companion and said , " I want you to listen to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . Weaving among instruments , he went to the grand piano fronting the window and slid onto the bench . His soft white hand with the black ring on it touched a note or two , surely and nimbly , and skipped through the verse tune . His beaming good-natured face turned back to the others . " Man wants to get it published . Listen to it , Eddie , give it your critical attention . " He propped the notebook sheets on the rack and his hands leaped into the tune , putting into it a lot of fancy frills and variations . Weaving a little on the bench , he leaned toward them like a cabaret entertainer and sang as he played . If you will be my sweetheart I 'll take you for a ride Among the silv'ry clouds up in the sky . Then far away from sorrows like eagles we will glide And no one will be there but you and I.Say , darling , if you 'll be my little honey dove We 'll fly above and coo and love . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is pure and crystal clear and thereI 'll give you my promise to be trueWhile gliding among the silv'ry clouds with you . His smile covered his whole face . " Say , that 's all right ! " he said , and bent against the light from the window , leaning to read the notes . He tinkled out the tune with his right hand . Joe watched him , uncertain and frowning . As the salesman played , he had heard a couple of sour chords , had even had a feeling that the salesman emphasized them and bore down hard on the words at those points . It was possible that he had played the whole piece to make it sound jingly and cheap . Joe set his teeth . A slow heat began to burn in him , something like shame . He looked at the pimpled youth and marked his sidelong smile . " This is wonderful ! This ought to sweep the country ! " the plump one said , and with nimble hands picked up the chorus . He sang again , looking soulfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare and delicate wine.  |p244Come  and take a joy ride in my aeroplane tonightWay beyond the clouds where all the stars are shining bright . There I 'd like to look into your loving eyes of blue And if I should fall , then I know I 'd fall in love with you . " It 'll be a bombshell , " he said dreamily , still playing softly , and shook his head back and forth . " Say , darling , if you 'll be my little honey dove ... ' " Joe moved toward him , so hot inside that he felt his own eyes like burning coals in their sockets . He did not say a word . An organ that stood between him and the piano player he went around or past or through  --  it was behind him . The plump one stood up . " Say , listen , " the pimpled one said shakily behind Joe 's shoulder . The piano player slipped two steps around the piano , almost into the window . Joe moved after him , calculating which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A half-second would do it , one punch , one smash on the smart alec 's mouth . That mouth was no longer smiling . The punk was scared . He said something in his throat , but it never became words , and he did not know what it was he had tried to say . He feinted around the keyboard , then the other way . The plump salesman , slow and clumsy , jerked first one way and then the other . He was pale ; he had begun to sweat ; he wet his lips . Behind him Joe heard the other salesman 's frantic voice . " Say , listen ! You get out of here ! You ca n't start a row in here ! " " Did I start it ? " Joe said softly , holding the plump one fixed . " I came in to ask a civil question . " He did not take his eyes by the merest fraction from the fat one 's face . It shook him with fierce pleasure to see the sweat beading the white lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and put his hands on the piano 's velvet wood , gathering himself . A shadow darkened the window . Across the upraised fat arm Joe saw the blue , the badge , the sauntering ponderous weight . His tight diaphragm relaxed in caution and disap/pointment , and then , balked and explosive with fury , he grabbed the song off the rack . The pimpled salesman scrambledback between a spinet and a stand of drums to let him pass , and the whole seething top of Joe 's mind as he went out onto the sidewalk was full of the picture of how he would look knocked end over end into that tangle of brass and rawhide . The sons of bitches ! The dirty superior mocking sons of bitches ! Anger drove him at a plunging walk around many blocks . Every time the crumpled music sheets in his hand brushed his clothes or caught his eye his blood surged in him hot enough for murder . He felt as if he had swallowed a stone , and at every corner drinking fountain he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his lips and teeth . Eventually he cooled his anger to the point where he could think , but even then he could think nothing but curses . He was not a swearing man : some finicky-ness of language ordinarilykept his talk pure , but now only obscenities came close to expressing what he felt . Every time he thought of himself standing there like a rube while those two played their little insolent game he felt his eyes bulging from his head with rage . Like city slickers playing with a hick they had swallowedtheir smiles , led him along , looked upward and rolled their eyes while they clowned the singing of his words , and played the tune on that thousand-dollar piano till it sounded like some organ grinder 's wornout cranking . Oh , the sons of bitches , the dirty sons of bitches ! The punks in their classy clothes , doing their little slave jobs and leaning elegantly to spit on anybody who did n't tie his tie the latest way . The piddling little salesmen lording it around with diamondson their fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt , the lower than dirt , the slave-shit that they were . He should have known better than to take any song of his to a place like that . If anyone published Joe Hill 's songs itp246ought to be the union . If he wrote songs he ought to write songs that a union could sing , not the kind some dribblechinnedpunk could snicker at . You did n't get any help from the System , even indirectly . No song written by a workingman and a union man would ever have a chance to make ten cents in the world where Cohan coined money for Tin Pan Alley hacks . You fought the System every waking minute or it gelded you . There was no halfway method . Leaning against a wall staring slit-eyed across the glaring afternoon street he was visited by the words of the Preamble , those words written by an unfrocked priest and memorized by working stiffs and fighters for freedom everywhere . He said them to himself as in his childhood , kneeling in the cold by the unwarmed bed , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employing class have nothing in common . . . Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize . . . .

Amen , and God curse the trade-union compromisers and the shopkeepers and the salesmen and the fat-assed clerks and the housewives and all those who wanted security at any price .

Curse them and give them fits and visit them with diarrhea and give them dreams every night that will make them wet their secure little beds with fear.  |p247He  looked at the sheets in his hand , folded and smoothed them and replaced them in his coat pocket . His jaws were lame from being clamped together ; the stone in his stomach gave him a sensation like hunger . At the entrance to the cigar store against which he leaned there was a glass globe filled with colored jawbreakers . The urge for something sweet flooded his mouth , and he reached a penny from his pocket and put it in the slot . But when he turned the lever to release the ball of candy the machine jammed , and no jerking or yanking or pounding would free it . It seemed to him that even the candy machines were part of the general conspiracy , and only by forcing himself to stand over the water fountain on the corner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he stood up , a Murray car pulled down State Street , and on impulse he jumped aboard . AT SUPPER he took pains to make it clear he did not want to be talked to . Karl Erickson was rounding up people to take in a show , but when he tried Joe he got only a short shake of the head . Otto tried joking him about having had a fight with his girl , and got a look that made him move his eyebrows and shut up . When they all gathered in the parlor after supper to pump the player piano Joe deliberately broke his custom and went straight upstairs to the room . For a while he lay on the bed with his hands locked at the back of his head , and stared upward and thought and burned slowly with continuing anger . After a while he got the music out of his coat and studied it , searching for the reasons why the salesman had laughed , but the whole attempt made him so sore that he put the music away . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the dresser drawer the package that contained the automatic . It had never even beenp248unwrapped since the day he bought it . Now he found a rawhidebootlace and started rigging the holster into a shoulder scabbard . Somehow and somewhere he had been betrayed . His hunch that Salt Lake City would turn up something big had not panned out , yet he had felt it strong , as strong as he had ever felt a hunch in his life . From the time when he had first walked up and looked over the town , coming baby-clean from the steam room at the springs , he had had the feeling that he was looking for something : a house he would know , a familiar face , a thing he had planned . And then meeting Otto on the street , and after that Anna and Ingrid Olson , as if his past had crowded up to form a ring around what might happen here and now . And what did happen ? He wrote a couple of songs , drew a few pictures , lay around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System and got himself laughed at by a couple of punk clerks . With his knife he cut the buckle off an old belt , trimmed the belt to the proper length , and bored holes in both ends . With pieces of the bootlace he laced the belt into the holster flap so that it made a loop ; before lacing the second end snug he stood up and put the loop over his left shoulder , trying the fit . He was standing up fiddling with the strings when Otto opened the door . Because Joe had not heard him at all , he was sure Otto had come on tiptoe , trying to catch sight of something private . A born snoop . But after a twitch of irritation he went on adjustingthe strap , saying nothing . Otto sat on the bed and leaned back on his hands and watched . Taking off the holster , Joe cut two slits in the part that housed the barrel of the gun . Through these he threaded the rest of the rawhide lace , and stood up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thong pulled snug around his chest , the holster fitted flat against his ribs . He slipped the automatic in it , pushed it back an inch or two , put on his coat to see if the bulge showed . It was all right.  | " Going somewhere ? " Otto said . Glancing up into Otto 's intent , feeding stare , Joe noticed that the grin was on Otto 's mouth , but it was hardly a grin at all , only an habitual set of the muscles . " Nowhere in particular . " From his sweater pocket Otto fished up a flat can of snuff . As if absent-mindedly he dipped himself a pinch between thumb and finger and tucked it into his cheek . The metal lid caught a dull flash from the darkening windows as he put the can away . " Whatever happened to that little Luger you and Manderichtook away from me that night ? " Joe paused at the job of cleaning up shavings and scraps of leather . He allowed himself a little smile . " I donated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Donated it to a church . " " In the collection plate , I suppose . " " No , in the breadbox . " He watched Otto 's curiosity come out and nibble around at that one , trying to make sense of it . Finally Otto said , " You really got a lot of nerve , you know that ? I do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , donating it to a church , but that was my gun . " Joe bent and brushed up the last scraps from the rug , sayingnothing . " Also , " Otto said , " you owe me five bucks . " He was watching Joe with an intentness that seemed tocarry some special unsaid meaning . In the dusk his eyes weresteady and small and bright like the eyes of a watchful rat . " You 'll get it , " Joe said . " When ? " " When I get it . " " When 'll that be ? You ai n't been hunting a job . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me wages is somebody I would n't work for . " " I been seeing about this trouble in Colorado , " Otto said.  | " Just so you do n't beat it over there and leave me holding the bag for my five . " " Quit worrying , " Joe said . He got up and went out , and Otto came after him down the stairs , tonguing his cud of snus . Mrs. Erickson and her two sons were just leaving for the show . " Sure you do n't want to come along ? " she said . " No thanks . " " Otto ? " " I guess not . " Joe went into the parlor and sat down at the scuffed piano . A player roll of " Over the Waves " was on the spindle , and he pumped it through . The music , of an incredible mechanical nimbleness and regularity , beat in his face . He kept his feet going until it ended and then flipped the reroll button and pumped it silently back to its beginning . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make his fingers performas faultlessly as the player roll . But he did n't really feel like playing , and the mechanical perfection of the player reminded him of the plump clerk and what he had done to the aeroplane song . In a pause he swung around on the stool , and found Otto still watching him . " By God I wish I could figure you out , " Otto said . " Do n't strain yourself , " Joe said . Sitting half sideways , he put his fingers on the keys and played very softly the tune of " Workers of the World . " The thought occurred to him that he might wander over to Ingrid 's for the evening , but he decided immediately that he did n't want that either . He did n't want to sit around and talk old country . He was n't sure what he wanted . He wanted to kick chairs across the room . " You 're one of these organizers that works for nothing , " Otto said . Joe said nothing . " But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side , you pretend you 're too pure for that . " Still Joe said nothing . The glow from the big round-wicked lamp carved deep shadows from Otto 's long upper lip to the corners of his mouth , and his ordinarily pale , rather protrud/ing eyes looked deeply socketed . For an instant he looked like Manderich . " Listen , " he said , and dropped his voice . Holding Joe 's eyes , he got up to lean on the piano . " I know a way you can make enough in one night , tonight , to keep you organizing for two months . " " Yes ? " Joe said . But he did not say it in a way to stop Otto . He wanted to hear what Otto would say . Otto 's eyes were mottled like marbles in the lamplight . They opened wider , bringing back the silly-looking dangling grin . " I know a bird runs a little joint , " he said . " Every night this guy closes up his place and takes the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks two blocks with it , all by himself . It 's as easy as swatting flies . " " You can go pull it by yourself then . " " It 's easier with two . One can keep him quiet while the other goes through him . " Stooping until his rump stuck far out behind and his chin was on his stacked hands , he watched Joe steadily as a dog waiting for something to drop from a table . He looked ridiculous in that position , like the rear end of one of the masquerade donkeys in a political parade . " I always thought you 'd be a good one to hook up with , " he said . " You never fooled me , not for a minute . But you got a talent for keeping your mouth shut . " In front of Joe the player roll was punched with dots and dashes and staggered lines of holes like some intricate code . He felt as if he leaned back against some strong pressure from behind . The last thing he wanted was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world owed him as a workingman , he would take it alone . But he sat silent , and Otto said , " This guy 's somebody I 've had my eye on for a couple weeks . He do n't vary by ten minutesfrom one night to the next . He walks those two blocks like he was walking a beat . " Joe rotated gently on the stool , pushing himself clear around until he was back facing Otto 's mottled intent eyes . " How do you know all this ? "  | " I keep my eyes open , " Otto said . Joe 's foot had started him around again . " What time does he close his joint ? " " Nine-thirty . " He felt as if a pump were blowing his insides full of cold air . Light and empty , he swung around again to face Otto . " What time is it now ? " Before Otto could answer , the clock in the dining room began to strike , and they sat facing each other , silently counting , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1914THE FIRST THING Lund did when he got off the train in SaltLake City was to call the county jail . An asthmatic voice told him , between coughing spells , that visiting hours were three to four Tuesday and Friday . Today was Tuesday . He was lucky . But court would be in session until three-thirty . There was only the half-hour opportunity , and unless he wanted to go to the courtroom first he had more than six hours to kill . He told himself that he did not want to go to court knowing as little as he did . Maybe he did n't want to go to court at all . Eight years of uninterrupted work in the mission had made a provincial of him . The baggage carts and the redcaps and the newsstand girl and the big waiting-room mural that showed the driving of the golden spike were strangenesses , almost dangers , to his senses . He felt clumsy in the cool vault of the station , and when he stepped outside he got stranded on the sidewalk under a blast of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train was torn out and folded into his breast pocket . He had to know more , but where would he go for information ? Not the sheriff'soffice , where there would probably be nothing but official indifference . Not the IWW hall , which would be dispensing partisan hysteria . A helplessness weighed upon him ; when he put down his bag to think a moment , a bellhop captured it and led him to a big yellow hotel bus.  |p254His  room at the hotel held him only ten minutes . In another ten he was standing before the semicircular desk in the public library . A librarian came up and looked at him . " Do you keep back files of the Salt Lake papers ? " " How far back ? " He consulted the scrap of newspaper in his pocket . " BeginningJanuary 9 , this year . " " The whole file from then to now ? " " If it 's not too much trouble , please . " " It may be at the bindery , " she said . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all on the rack over there . " Against the wall where she pointed , the papers hung in their wooden holders . But he did n't want to get the story backwards ; he wanted to follow it as it had unfolded . It was important to him to know , and to know straight . In five minutes the girl was back , sliding two ponderous volumes in new red binding across the desk . " Just came back , " she said pertly , smiling . She shoved a card at him , and he signed , took the volumes in his arms , found an unoccupied table , sat down . The new binding opened stiffly ; he pressed it down , turning the pages until he found the date he wanted : January 9 , 1914 . The front page showed him nothing that he was looking for , and he had hunted through two more pages before he realized that January 9 was the night it had happened . It would n't have been reported until the next day . In the January 10 paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black headlines , a two-column story clear down the page , and more over on page 4 . He read it through carefully , and on to the next day , and so on , hunting up every item . At noon he was still reading . When the reading room emptied he went obediently too , found a lunchroom on the corner , spent fifteen minutes there , and came back to read again . It was nearly one o'clock when he finished . For a considerable still time he sat thinking . Around him was a dry rustle as readers turned pages . He saw , out of his abstraction , the faces of strangers , strange windows in ap255strange room , strange light through the windows from a strange city outside . In this foreign place he sat like a parent brought to hear accusations against his son , and though he willed disbelief he was forced to admit that there were puzzles , ambiguities , qualities of Joe Hillstrom 's character and fragments of Joe Hillstrom 's history , that lent some credibility to the charges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Joe Hillstrom would instantly doubt it . Yet it was his only defense . Things he did not want to remember came to the surface of his mind like corks that could not be held under . Except for stretches of longshoring , he did not know of a job that Joe had held in three years . In spite of his apparent idleness , there were those forty dollars in crumpled bills that he had thrust on Lund in the kitchen of the mission . There was the gun he had thrown him for hiding at the same time . There was that earlier time when he had come in with his face cut and the gun in his pocket . There was the long schooling in violence , the whiplash temper , the fights that had marked his face and jaw . He thought of the way Joe could look sometimes when he was interested and animated , chasing down an idea , how his eyes could widen in the innocent stare while his lips twisted with irony . With that image sharp in his mind he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had torn from the paper on the train . Before he looked at it again he had repudiated the implications of that face . Joe 's cheeks were emaciated , blackened with a week 's beard . The lips were drawn back wolfishly . Out of hollow sockets the eyes smoldered half-lidded and contemptuous . Joe must have known when the picture was taken that he had a face to scare babies , yet he had turned it straight into the camera in bitterness and contempt . It was the face of a desperado  --  or of an El Greco martyr before suffering or art or both had refined the passion and defiance out of the eyes and mouth . He tried to read it , to see behind it , but he could not for his life have said whether it was the face of a guilty man showingp256his teeth or that of an innocent one bitter at injustice . If it had not had a caption under it he would never have known it for the face of Joe Hillstrom . There was more to be learned  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volumes and carried them back to the desk , where the librarian stood up to receive them , an anonymousyoung woman in a green eyeshade and glasses . She looked at him and smiled an indistinguishable smile . " Did you find what you wanted ? " " Yes . Yes , thanks . " Looking at the notes in his hand , he said , " I wonder if you can direct me to a couple of places ? Is the county jail somewhere near here ? " The girl 's glasses flashed up . " The jail ? " " Yes . " " That 's down on Second East , between Fourth and Fifth South . You 'd go four blocks down and one left . " " Good . Now how would I get to Eighth South and West Temple ? " She drew him a little map on the back of the sign-out card . Eight blocks south , two west . " But the blocks here are long , " she said . " You 'd better catch a streetcar down on the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 6 car or a 12 . " She was a pleasant and helpful young woman , and he thanked her . It occurred to him that Joe had probably , during his stay in Salt Lake , used the library . He was tempted to describe him , or show his picture , and ask the librarian if she had ever noticed him around , but that seemed a fruitless sort of investigation , and he thanked her again and left , to emerge from the strange reading room into the strangely brassy and unmisted sun . A sprinkler was going on the library 's lawn , badly gone to plantain weeds . Somewhere chimes rang the half-hour . He had still two hours before he could see Joe in the jail . Down the steep sidewalk , under the freckled shade of trees , he walked to the corner and waited for a car . Eighth South was wide and dusty . In vacant lots the weeds were head high , with a strong pulpy smell . Big cottonwoodsp257grew along the parking strip , shading the whole street . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew from their opening pods and drifted the street like snow . Sprinklers going on the lawns made erratic pools of cool air that he walked through . Crossing Main Street , he passed three boys hunting sparrowswith slingshots . Ahead he could see that the street dwindled off after a couple of blocks , and across the end he saw the smoke of a switch engine . The telephone wires were beaded with blackbirds that suddenly darted up in a cloud and left the looped wires swinging . It was a calm , quiet , neighborly street . West Temple , when he came to it and stopped to fix it in his mind , was another of the same . But he saw the butcher shop and grocery on the corner . Cowan 's Market , Morrison 's Grocery , two neighborhoodshops side by side under the same roof , and he walked up West Temple on the opposite side , trying to visualize how this block and these stores might have looked on the night of January 9 . The newspaper reports had been detailed . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they built up for him now like something played on a stage : The night was mild for winter , with the temperature on the edge between thaw and freeze . The streets were muddy , the slush at the sidewalk-edges just crusting the slightest bit . Exceptin the shelter of bushes and houses the snow was all melted off . Overhead the sky was opaque , without moon or stars , low and shut in by smoke . The winter smoke cloud was an acrid bite in the nostrils , a taste in the mouth like a railroad tunnel . Up this street , coming from the west under tight poplars that even leafless would throw solid pillars of shadow , walkers would have come out of the winter murk like characters out of a story by Poe . First the footsteps , hard to locate ; then the shadows , darker than the dark and smoke , more fluid than the poplars , emerging and taking shape . They came toward the corner , a tall man and a shorter one , and near the intersection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple returning from a show . Neither man made a move to step aside . Theyp258came straight on , crowding the woman off into the slush . As she swung indignantly she saw the taller one for a moment plain : a thin face and a sharp nose , a soft felt hat , no overcoat , a red bandanna tied loosely around the throat . Lund walked in the tracks of the two men to the corner , turned with them up West Temple toward the store . When he stopped before the entrance he saw that the store had been closed for some time . Putting his nose against the windowhe shaded his eyes and looked in upon two dusty counters , empty vegetable bins , bare shelves , the cash register with its drawer hanging open , the icebox with its door ajar . His imagination peopled the stage as the news reports and the testimony of witnesses directed : front left , Morrison trundling a sack of potatoes toward the bins . Back , left , his seventeen-year-old son Arlin sweeping the floor in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Merlin , at the entrance to the stock room . Experimentally he put his thumb on the latch and depressed it , feeling how it might have been for the burglar the moment before the act , this moment with the cold latch under the left hand , the right hand pulling the handkerchief up over his face and then going under the coat for the gun . He felt how it might have been to enter the store swiftly , gun in hand , breath hot under the handkerchief , and to shout the words that young Merlin Morrison heard : " We 've got you this time ! " How Morrison would have started up from his stooping position , his hands still around the ears of the potato sack ; how Arlin and his brother would freeze at their cleaningupjobs at the rear of the store . He felt it as vividly as something remembered , but at that point of confrontation his imagination balked . The story that Merlin Morrison had told in court did n't contain enough of the essential details . A terrified boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed others . And even if he had seen everything that happened , there was nothing in what he would have seen to tell Lund or anyone else why the two men had come to this dusty little store at nine forty-five on a winterp259night with guns in their hands and bandanna masks over their faces . To Lund , at least , that why was everything . Revenge , as the newspapers assumed ? A deliberate murder  --  the quick step in the door , the shout , the shots , the getaway ? Morrison had been a policeman , and had made enemies . Also , since leaving the force to open his grocery , he had twice stood off holdup men with a gun , wounding one of them in the second encounter last September . Revenge , quite possibly . And if revenge , and if Joe Hillstrom had really been involved , then Joe might be guilty of a double murder , premeditated , in cold blood . Or robbery ? Merlin Morrison had not seen who fired the first shot . He had fled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second shot into his father 's body , and as he stumbled into the stockroom in panic he had heard a fusillade . But who fired first , the robber or Arlin Morrison , who grabbed his father 's gun from the open icebox and died with it in his hand , one cartridge exploded ? For some time Lund stood looking through the window into the abandoned store , trying to make the pattern come clear , but failing . There was no pattern , only the shout and the shots and the two slumped bodies and the slam of the door as the murderers fled . He turned and looked down to the corner , the way they had run , and he saw how they had looked in the dark to the women , neighbors , who had hurried to their doors and looked out . He saw the shorter man sprint from the shadow of the trees across the dim intersection and disappear in the murk down Eighth South , and after him he saw the taller man run stooping , his hands to his chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second-rate melodrama  --  except that real death had been died in the store , and except that Joe Hillstrom might have been the man who ran with his hands pressed against his chest . Lund tried to think how it would be to run hard , along slippery sidewalks and through slushy alleys , with a .38 bullet through the lung , and he tried to imagine what might have been in the mind of someone who had just killed a manp260and his son , but he could not get his mind around either . It seemed to him only that in the chest there would be a desperateburning , and in the mind a pounding of fear . Everything in the quiet , closed-up scene of murder led him farther from what he was after . He could not get Joe Hillstrom into it ; the tall thin-faced man who took Arlin Morrison 's bullet in the chest remained a stranger , the villain of a thriller . Across the street a man came out of his driveway and stood in his shirtsleeves , watching Lund so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was saturatedwith guilt . He did not want to stay around it . With his mind groping among contradictions , trying to fit the Joe Hillstrom he knew to the Joe Hillstrom who might have run from this corner five months ago coughing blood from a puncturedlung , and repudiating the whole case the law made as preposterous , unbelievable , out of character , Lund started walking north toward his hotel . The man who might have been Otto Applequist ( and that part of the case was convincing enough , considering what Lund knew of Otto ) was lost in the black alleys , separating from his wounded companion , abandoning him , making a clean getaway . The man who just possibly could have been Joe Hillstrom also disappeared in the alleys below Eighth South . He might have hidden away somewhere , he might have made the tracks and crawled into a boxcar and lived , or got away to die somewhere else . But the real Joe Hillstrom appeared just before midnight on the porch of a Dr. McHugh in Murray , several miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated for a bullet wound in the chest . He was weak , but holding himself stiffly . When he took off his coat to expose the wound , an automatic fell from a shoulder holster . The doctor did not examine it to see whether it was loaded or empty ; he dressed the wound and said nothing to Joe Hillstrom 's request that the whole affair be kept private . There was a woman involved , Joe said . There had been a quarrel over a woman . He was as much to blame as the other fellow , and he did not want to make any com/plaint against the man who had shot him . Neither did he want the woman to be dragged into any unpleasantness . That was all that anybody really knew  --  the fact of his wound and the unwavering consistency of his story , or of his refusal to tell a story . The gun he threw away when a colleagueof McHugh 's drove him home , and it was never found . In pain , weak from loss of blood , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the house where he boarded , and then the doctor helped him in . He was half dead of his wound three days later when McHughtold his story and the police came down to get him . AT THREE-FIFTEEN Lund was at the door of the county jail . The door let him into a little vestibule with an office on the right and closed doors on the left and a grilled steel gate straight ahead . A man and a woman were waiting in the office . Behind the gate a fat policeman in an office chair looked him over with puffy yellow eyes . " I 'd like to see Joseph Hillstrom , if he 's back from court . " The jailer 's eyes went over him in silence , and Lund stood them as he might have stood a crawling yellow-jacket . Living at the mission and working with sailors and hoboes and the drift that washed up and down Beacon Street had made him jumpy around police . If you were on the bottom you were at the mercy of every grafter and sadist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked back into the jailer 's dead eyes , the eyes did not change . A fat freckled hand shoved out a book like a hotel register , and Lund signed . " Fifteen minutes , " the jailer said . " Couple ahead of you . Wait in there . " He yawned , his yellowish eyeballs swam with sudden water , he looked past Lund as if he had already forgotten him.  |p262As  Lund sat down the woman on the next chair drew her knees together , holding her pocketbook on top of them primly . Her consciousness of him had in it a wan echo of coquettishness ; her eyes fixed themselves in a businesslike way upon the opposite wall , strayed , touched him again , jumped back to the wall . Beside her on the other side a chinless little man smoked the fierce stump of a cigar . Behind the desk a deputy read a magazine . There was a noise of flies at the high windows . Somewhere a bell rang , and after a couple of minutes a man came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office stood up uncertainly . From the chair in the hall the fat jailer said something , and the man and woman crossed the hall and closed the door behind them . The deputy turned a page , rolling half the magazine under in his left hand . No more sure of what he would find , or of what he hoped to find , than he had been on the train in the morning , Lund sat on . The papers had given him details but no explanations ; the visit to Eighth South and West Temple had done no more than upset him and accentuate his doubt . He was unable to visualizewhat Joe would look like : like himself , or like the bearded desperado of the morning paper ? And what would they say to each other ? No moral lectures , he said to himself . Above all , no moral lectures . And yet there were questions he must ask , things he felt he must know . After a long time the bell rang again . Though he had found the waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pages , it seemed now that the fifteen minutes allowed visitors would not be enough even for a greeting . As he stood up and looked to the jailer for a sign , the left-hand door opened and the couple came out . The woman was crying , her eyes puffy . She held her handkerchief against her mouth , and in passing looked for a moment full at Lund with an expression of brave suffering . Her tears were for herself and for spectators ; she savored herself as sufferer . " You see ? " her upturned eyes said . Her husband went with his arm across her shoulders ,  |p263his  weak little pucker of mouth clenched on the dead stump of cigar . Oh Lord , Lund thought , and wondered why self-consciousnessmade even real anguish look like a pose , and went through the door at the jailer 's nod feeling furtive and brittle . Inside a chair was pulled close to a barred wicket like a ticket window in the wall . A policeman leaning against the far wall nodded him to the chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicket . His first emotion was relief that the face did not look like the face in the paper , and the instantaneous explanation came to him : that picture had been taken while Joe was still sick from his wound . Now , though his face looked pale and so sharp that the slight bulge of his teeth showed under the drawn mouth , he was clean-shaven and his hair was cut so short that he looked like a boy . His eyes were wide and surprised ; Lund thought they were pleased . " Well , holy smoke ! What are you doing in this burg ? " " I was on my way east , " Lund said . " I read about your trial in the paper I got in Ogden . It was the first I knew . " His face a little in shadow , his eyebrows lifted quizzically , Joe watched him . Their position was a little like that of priest and penitent in a confessional , though which was priest and which penitent , which hoped for comfort from the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and smiled . " It 'd be nice to shake hands , but they do n't seem to approve of that here . " He laughed , but Lund did not laugh . The screen was too unavoidable a reminder that Joe was cut off where friendship and good will could do little for him . Because he could think of nothing to say , he filled his pipe , and when it was full he offered it to Joe . Joe shook his head . " Still a good Christian , " Lund said . " All the virtues . " Frowning at the suck and blaze , Lund got the pipe going and waved out the match . He was full of balked rebellion atp264having to sit here and talk through bars , with a guard listening twenty feet away and Joe 's face so shadowed that he could not see it clearly . He wanted to study Joe 's face , and he wanted the long interrupted unhurried talk they had had in San Pedro . But he would have no better chance than this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " " I 've still got that money of yours . " Beyond the wicket he saw the slow white smile . " You 'd better use that to save souls . " " I guess they 'll have to stay unsaved , " Lund said . " I 'm out of the mission . " " Out ? Why ? " " You 're entitled to your laugh , " Lund said ruefully . " Politicalshift of power in the synod . Evangelicals went out , fundamentalistscame in . I was a little too latitudinarian for them . " There was a pause while they eyed each other . Joe 's face twisted with disgust . " My God , what a bunch of bolt-heads . You ran the only respectable mission on the coast . " " Not enough Augsburg Confession , " Lund said . " Not enough Apostles ' Creed . They want a nice tight denominational mission , and they knew I was n't the one to run it . " But it warmed him to hear Joe 's praise . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " Back to the farm . " " In Minnesota ? " " Yes . " " No more soul-saving at all ? " " There does n't seem to be much place for a latitudinarian Christian , " Lund said . " You ought to get into the union battle , " Joe said speculatively . " You 're educated , you can talk . Get yourself whipped up a little more and you 'd make a soapboxer . " The thought made them both laugh . " I told you , " Lund said . " No soul-saving . Not even for the heaven-on-earth . " Their laughter ebbed and left them with the necessity ofp265finding a new tack . At least five of their few minutes had passed . " I do have that money , though , " Lund said . " You 'll need it for your defense . " " My defense ! " Joe spat the words out so bitterly that Lund leaned , frowning , to see him better . " Is n't the IWW defending you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers said ... " " They go right on wasting money , " Joe said . " They 're crazy . The union should n't bleed its treasury defending me . One man is n't worth it . " Lund straightened a little . " Now you 're talking nonsense . " " No , " Joe said . " I 'm not talking nonsense . " His hard stare was difficult to face ; his mouth was set like a stubborn boy 's . Lund looked down at the warm bowl of the pipe in his hand , looked up again to see Joe 's mouth move as if tasting something . Rather than force a clash , he let the talk edge away . " How does it look , really ? " " You 've seen the papers . " " Anything critical happen in court today ? " Joe shrugged . " What I ca n't understand , " Lund said , " is why you do n't prove where you were that night , and settle this quick . " With the crossed shadows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard to read , but now his eyes were dark , his mouth harshly pinched , the long scar white along jaw and neck . " Why should I prove an alibi ? I 'm innocent till they prove I 'm guilty , that 's what the law books say . If there 's any proving to be done , let them do it . " " But if it means saving your life ! " " You sound like my lawyers , " Joe said . " I do n't have to prove anything . That 's the D.A . ' s job . " " What if they ever catch Otto ? Can he clear you ? " " If they catch Otto he 'll be right where I am , charged with the same thing , " Joe said . " He was smart to take it on the lam.  |p266But  even if they caught him his testimony would n't be worth any more in that court than mine would be . I 'm guilty as hell right from the start . They 're all set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all set to let them ! " Lund said , so angry that his voice shook . " In heaven 's name , what 's wrong with defending yourself ? You 're worth ten times what the IWW can spend to save you , and you know it . And no woman 's reputation is worth a man 's life . " " I 'm surprised at you , " Joe said , soft and mocking . " What kind of woman would let you sacrifice yourself that way ? If you got shot over a woman , she should have been the first one to come up and clear you . " Joe had dropped his chin on his clasped hands . " You sound more and more like my lawyers , " he said . His voice had taken on an edge . With difficulty Lund got control of himself , studying his knuckles wrapped around the bowl of the pipe , forcing his lips into a smile . " Anyway , you 've got a defense and got lawyers whether you want them or not . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourself . " Joe shrugged , lifting his hands and dropping them again . Not quite ready to give it up , Lund said . " Was n't there something about the caliber of the gun ? Was n't yours a differentcaliber from the one that did the shooting ? " " My alert lawyers thought of that one too , " Joe said , and gave Lund a wintry , indifferent smile . " They took me and the hawkshaws down there . The guy had a record of selling the gun but not of what caliber it was . And the guy that sold it to me had left town . " His voice was so apathetic , indifferent , disinterested , and his shoulders and hands so limp and slack that Lund wanted to reach through the screen and slap him awake . He gave no handhold , his blankness and apathy were too smooth for any friendly help to catch onto . Angrily the preacher said , " What were you doing buying another gun in the first place ? "  |p267And  that only got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to kill a couple of guys . " Lund swept his hand across the little counter shelf in a gesture of disgust . " Tell it to the cops , " Joe said . It was going badly , like a cross-examination . The steel between them was flimsy compared to the screen that Joe himself erected . Even Lund 's intense desire to understand , a desire that went deeper than friendship , he knew , and rooted itself in his whole faith that right and wrong were separate and recognizable , glanced off Joe like light off a mirror . There was no confidence , little friendliness , hardly any interest in the face at the wicket , but only a closed , enigmatic , still expression that might have been either apathetic or stubborn . The eyes in their pale steadiness dominated the thin mask of a face ; a little smile moved the stiff lips . " They do n't give me the papers , " he said , " but the other day a trusty smuggled in a piece of the Saturday Blade and Ledger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the dope on Nebuchadnezzar . You know that yarn about how he went crazy and ate grass . Well , this bird has a theory that Nebuchadnezzarreally ate alfalfa , because apparently there 's all kinds of food value in alfalfa . He says you could live on it for a month . " The smile pulled the lips wider . " Work and pray , live on hay . The bosses ought to get hold of that guy and put him in charge of the cookhouse . " He made himself clear . The talk was to stay away from such questions as Lund most wanted to ask . As he moved his hand sideward Lund saw the right one , the shiny patch of scar the size of a dime between the first and second knuckles , and the deformed hump on the back of the hand . Defeated in his attempts to pierce Joe 's surface , he said nothing , but Joe 's eyes followed his to the broken hand , and the voice beyond the screen sharpened in instant bitterness . " That 's another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet through me and just as the cops come in I reach under thep268pillow for a handkerchief to spit in . One of the dicks thinks I 'm reaching for a gun , and he lets me have this . " He flexed his fingers , and his lips tightened and his eyes burned . " They leave you plenty , " he said . " There goes the piano . " Lund sat with his head bent , feeling how everything that he could think of to say died in his mind , inadequate or inappropriateor too likely to harden Joe 's protective shell . At last he said , " Joe , I can only stay about one day . There wo n't be visiting hours again till Friday , and I ca n't be here then . But I 'll try to come to court tomorrow . Maybe I can see you there for a minute . " " Sure , " Joe said . The fury had passed from his face ; the indifferent irony was back . " Come on up and see the show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pale eyes and forced his eyebrows upward . " Man-eating wild animals , " he said . " That 's me . Two clowns . Those are my lawyers . " His finger made a contemptuous rattle across the screen . " They 'll be in here any minute trying to pump me again . " The bell rang . Earnestly and in haste , Lund stood up and hooked his fingers in the screen . " Listen , Joe ! Do n't get sore at what I say , or what your IWW friends say . Let the union do all it will . Put up a fight , and quit standing on your dignity as an innocent man . You 've been in this jail too long . Quit acting as if you wanted to be a spectator at your own funeral . " The upper part of Joe 's face was in shadow . A sliver of dusty light came through the west window and touched his quiet broken hand . He lifted his head a little , and he seemed almost gentle . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do is sit still , is n't it ? I do n't have to prove it . It 's automatic unless they can prove the opposite . And if I 'm guilty , would I let the union spend thousands of dollars getting me off ? I 'd sit still , would n't I ? Either way I 'd sit still . That 's what I 'm doing . " The policeman motioned at Lund , there was obscurep269scuffling beyond the screen , and then footsteps , as empty of meaning or reassurance as any of the talk , as Joe was led back to his cell . THE WINDOWS of the courtroom let in a view of summer sky and moving clouds . Pigeons walked the window sills and fluttered on ledges and cornices , and occasionally the breeze brought in a whiff of locust blossoms from the park below . The room , small , high-ceilinged , paneled , waited like a theater for its opening curtain . The varnished benches were already jammed . Squeezed in with the first of the crowd , Lund sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table where Joe 's attorneys , Scott and McDougall , laid out papers . Beyond were the witness chair , the high judicial bench . On the left side , elevatedabove the benches , was the jury box . In a place so severe and bare as this the most solemn and deliberate injusticescould be done impartially , impersonally , without bias or ill will , because everything in the room , even the expressions on the faces of spectators and bailiffs and attorneys , made it clear that the actors here , judge and jury , prosecutor and witnesses , had ceased to be men and were for the time being mere instruments . Only the accused , in such a room , remained touched by human frailty , and he was reduced to helplessness like a child among grownups . The jury now was in the box : a teamster , a real-estate dealer , a bill collector , a farmer , a clerk , a laborer , a coal dealer , a streetcar motorman , a salesman , another farmer , a blacksmith , a contractor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in silence . One or two glanced out across the room ; they reminded Lund of stagehands peeking between the curtains at a filling house to estimate the crowd.  |p270Now  the district attorney , tight-jawed , preoccupied , with a smoldering look about him and an aggressiveness in his shoulders and his careful clothes . Now the bailiff and two plainclothes men coming in a side door and ranging themselves inside the rail . Unhurried , without rancor , the courtroom readied itself , and watching it as the clock crept toward ten Lund was struck not simply by the way it divested itself of human fallibility and human sympathy , but by how small this home of justice was , and how shabby with yellowed varnish and the smell of cuspidors . The room suppressed the voices of everyone in it , but there was a steady insect-hum of whispering and low talk . Out of it the news grew : " Hillstrom . Here comes Hillstrom . " Handcuffed between two deputies , Joe came through the bailiff 's door at the side . He walked with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , flawed wood . In a gray suit , with the flowing silk tie of the Swedish Young Socialists , a poet 's tie , he looked almost jaunty . His eyes touched nothing , recognized nothing , and when the deputies brought him inside the rail and unlocked the cuffs he sat down between his attorneysand gave the spectators his straight shoulders and the back of his neat head . Around him Lund heard scraps of talk  --  the casual buzz , the cold dope , the shrewd speculation , the guess.  --  like a ladies ' man . Maybe that woman story is n't  --  bringing Judge Hilton , from Denver , the labor lawyer . Seems Hillstrom is somebody important among the radicals . They 're all steamed up.  --  snotty-looking cuss . How does a guy in a jam like that  --  Scott telling the newspaper boys . The person that got Judge Hilton into this is the daughter of Lorenzo Snow . How do you like that ? When the daughter of the ex-president of the Mormon Church  --  Say , it 'd sure be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . Sob sister . She 's been mixed up with the radicals a long time.  |  --  Still , it 'd sure be  --  Lund fixed his eyes on the back of Joe 's head . The weight of custom and tradition and social authority in the stale courtroom , the crowd that came to feed on raw emotion as Roman crowds fed on the agonies of the martyrs , the oppressive unanimityof the forces leagued against Joe Hillstrom , were too much . He felt smothered  --  and if he felt so , how would the prisoner feel ? How demoralizing must it be to be one pitiful little wrong-doer , or one more pitiful , wrongly accused , and sit inside the dock sensing how the quiet many-armed impersonalpower closed in : the district attorney ambitious for political advancement ; the jury of middle class citizens fearful of violence , scared of the taint of radicalism , hating what threatenedtheir security ; the judge an imperfect mortal cast as Omnipotence ; the spectators avid for the sight of the victim 's face as society struck its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulders that he held the whole weight of it up . Now the stage was set , the jury boxed , the prisoner at the bar , the attorneys at their tables , the evidence assembled , the witnesses summoned . The clock above the jury box said four minutes past ten . The bailiff 's gavel whacked down ; there was a rustle and heave as the jury , the intense district attorney , the plainclothes men , dour McDougall and pink-jowled Scott , the prisoner , the whole backward stretch of the audience , surged up in the empty ritual of respect . The door of the judge 's chambers opened and a frail old figure came in and climbed to the high seat . A bloodless , thin-lipped , mottled old face looked out over the court , a bony hand and wrist stretched out of the sleeve , the gavel came down . The jammed room seated itself again , obeisance over . He had forgotten how tedious court procedure could be , how ponderously the revenge of society moved , how legal ingenuityat splitting hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen , elicit at great trouble a cloudy statementof the obvious , sift the simplest statement for hiddenp271meanings or twist it into something incriminating . Just to think of sitting in the prisoner 's box while the case against you grew by such intolerable grain-by-grain accretion , to have it confused by objections , sustainings , overrulings , exceptions , made his head ache . Simply to sit through the proceedings while they convicted or acquitted you was punishment enough for most crimes . He found his mind caught on the word " advocate , " and in fantasy he stood up and asked them all why they did not lay aside all this machinery of attack and defenseand put in its place some honest machinery of inquiry whose purpose was understanding and not the winning or losingof a case . Yet he knew too that at least in the beginning these were the methods by which men had tried to correct blind vengeanceinto justice , and even if it came to quibbling , a quibblerwas an advance over a vigilante . He knew too that the very tedium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of suspense . The drama lay in the gradual approach to a life-and-death crisis by the most trivial and monotonous of means . Here was the matter , first , of a bloodspot scraped from the sidewalk on West Temple the morning after the murder . Here was the state chemist to make his report , which was brief : the sample was mammalian blood , but it had been brought to him too late for him to say for sure that it was human . So now the district attorney in his role of Prosecutor , trying to establish the inestablishable and close a link in a desired chain of evidence :  --  You say you can be sure this is mammalian blood , Mr. Harms ?  --  Yes.  --  It could be human ?  --  It could , yes . It could also be the blood of a dog or cat or sheep.  --  But it is not very likely to be sheep 's blood , there on West Temple Street , would you say , Mr. Harms ? Perhaps at the end of ten minutes of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant . There was a kind of contiguous logic involved . One of the robbers was thought to have been wounded by Arlin Morrison . One chamber of the Morrison gun had been fired . This gout of blood was found nearby on the sidewalk . Joe Hillstrom had appeared later with a bullet through his lung . Therefore this blood on the sidewalk could have been human blood shed by the robber who could have been wounded by Arlin Morrison , who might have fired the discharged chamber of his father 's gun , and this robber could have been Joe Hillstrom . The courtroom was already hot . Not paying too much attention to the circlings of the prosecutor , Lund watched Joe 's head , and he saw with pain , as Joe turned to say something to his lawyers , the theatrical sneer that twisted Joe 's lip . Why did he have to make it worse for himself ? Why , in front of the jury in whose hands his life would be placed , did he adopt an attitude that would insult and offend everybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Mr. Harms , that some chemists would have no hesitation in identifying this sample as human blood ? Joe 's head jerked toward Scott again . " That 's leading ! " he said loudly . He threw himself back in the chair in disgust so histrionic that Lund wished for some way to shield him from the jury 's eyes.  --  Some chemists might , perhaps . I have had experience enough to know that a sample as old as this one .. . Everyone , even the witness , was watching Joe and his attorneys . Scott was shaking his head , half smiling , at Joe 's whispered vehemence . The room buzzed , and the gavel came down . Almost as it whacked solidly on the bench Joe was on his feet . " Your honor , I 'd like to make a few remarks ! " The thin old face looked down at him , a wedge of flesh and bone and legal precedent , the visage of judicial calm . Like an actor Joe whirled on his lawyers . His hair fell on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are too many prosecutingattorneys in this case ! " he said . His voice whinedp274with tension like a bent saw . " I 'm going to get rid of two of them . Mr. Scott and Mr. McDougall , do you see that door ? Now you get , you 're fired ! " With alarm in his heavy dark face , McDougall grabbed Joe 's arm , but Joe pushed him against the table . " You can bring on buckets of blood , " he shouted at the district attorney . " You bring on all the blood you like , but I intend to show a few things myself ! I intend ... " The thundering of the gavel drowned him out , but it was at least a minute before the uproar in the courtroom quieted enough so that the judge laid down the threat of his gavel . Noise whispered and frittered away until it was still . Lund could hear the loud crackle of papers as McDougall gathered them up . The lawyer 's face was hard , and dull red burned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a posture that Lund cringed for , a posture that was preposterouslyshowy and arrogant , suddenly sprang forward and grabbed the papers from McDougall 's hands . " Get out ! " he said . " Those belong to the defense . They 're paid for and I 'll keep them . And you can give the defense back the money it 's paid you , too . " The judge was standing , pounding again . His sagging cheeks quivered , his eyes went like swords down over the room . An irresistible pressure had forced Lund from his seat , and he realized now that the whole room was up . A young woman had sprung up from somewhere and was leaning across the rail , crying " Joe ! Joe ! Listen to me , Joe ! " By the time the room was again quieted the girl had slipped back to a seat near the front on the right side . For Lund she was only one more incomprehensible element in a situation already as incredible and unpredictable as a disturbed dream . That Joe Hillstrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder was incredible enough . That the daughter of an ex-president of the Mormon church should emerge as his defender , that Joe himself should base his entire defense on an unlikely story of a quarrel over a woman , that there should now be a nameless young woman leaning over the rail crying his name in the midst of the bedlam that Joe had ere/ated by firing his counsel in the middle of his trial  --  these were enough to compound the incredible with utter confusion . Looking again for the girl to study her face , he saw only the top of her hat among the crowded spectators . The judge held his gavel in his hand like a weapon . His voice crackled drily over the quieting room . " Now , Mr. Scott , " he said , " I warn you I will not tolerate this sort of thing in this court . You will keep your client under control , or I will have the bailiff do so . " Scott glanced sideways at Joe , and the left side of his face twitched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete surprise to me , " he said . " Last night we were on perfectly friendly terms . " With a very white fresh handkerchiefhe wiped the palms of his hands . " I think he is beside himself , " he said . But Joe was not yet through . He was up again like a man stabbed from behind , shouting at the judge . " Ca n't I conduct my own case ? I did it in the preliminary hearing . Ca n't I examinewitnesses and recall any I want to ? " " That is your legal right . " " Then I 'm through with my attorneys ! I want them to get out . I 'll prove a lot of things without them , and I 'll prove I was n't at Morrison 's grocery store that night ... " " I object ! " the district attorney said . " Your honor , I object to the defendant 's making a statement of his own case . " " Sit down , Mr. Hillstrom , " the court said . Joe remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me , Mr. Scott . " The gavel whammed the bench . " Bailiff , " the judge said , " see that the order of the court is carried out . " Lund drew a deep breath and shoved himself backward from where he had been sitting on the very edge of the seat . His hands were clenched , and his mind felt like something entangled in flypaper . That he should carry his frenzy clear to the point of being manhandled by the bailiff .... He must be , as Scott said , beside himself . Or was the whole outburst an act , cunningly devised to get rid of the defense he said he did not want ? Did he want to conduct his own defensep276because he thought he could do it better or because he wanted no defense at all ? And if it was an act , how ill-advised an act , calculated to prejudice everyone in the courtroom against him . And again , was that perhaps what he wanted ? He seemed perversely determined to do everything backwards . From where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge . " Your honor , I want my attorneys to leave this courtroom ! " The old cold face looked down ; there were broken veins in the flat cheeks . " The court does not believe that it is to your best interests to be unrepresented by counsel . " " It 's my legal right . " " Nevertheless , " the judge said , and his lower lip thrust slightly out in decision , " it is the ruling of this court that Mr. Scott and Mr. McDougall shall remain as friends of the court , to protect the interests of the defendant . Defendant may do his own cross-examining if he desires . " Shrugging angrily , McDougall came back from the bailiff 's side door , where he had been on the point of departing . Scott bowed his head , acknowledging the court 's decision with a slightly ironic deference . From his chair , turned sideways so that he could watch them both , Joe regarded them with the contemptuous sneer on his mouth . The chemist was still on the stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiff of chloroform , the taint of arsenic , the contents of stomachs , the condition of bodies . " Proceed , " the court said , and nodded to the prosecutor . " I have finished with the witness . " " Cross-examination , " the court said . Scott stood up and settled his coat across his shoulders . " Mr. Harms ... " But he was cut off by Joe Hillstrom 's tight voice . " Mr. Scott , there 's the door . Why do n't you go ? " For the first time Scott looked annoyed . A dark flush flooded up his smooth neck and into his face . " I am here by order of the court . "  |p277And  now , Lund saw with an embarrassment that approachedhorror , they were back at it . " Ca n't I discharge my attorneys ? " Joe demanded . The judge was perfectly composed , but in his clipped voice and the careful inclination of his head Lund read patience enforced with difficulty , as if the judge were addressing some incorrigible child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward forms of consideration . If Joe had , fantastically , been trying to show his contempt of judge and jury , and alienate them all , he could n't have succeeded better . " I have asked the attorneys for the defense to stay here for a while as friends of the court , " the arid voice said . " They will cross-examine witnesses as before . You may take part in the proceedings if you desire . " To Lund 's relief , Joe settled back in his chair and said no more . The machinery of the trial ground on . The bloodspot , still unidentified as sheep , cat , dog , or human , was reluctantly passed by , and the chemist stepped down to be replaced by Mrs. Phoebe Seeley . Because Lund had walked out her part of the drama on the corner of West Temple and Eighth South , he attended the questions and answers carefully , with an odd sense of remembering the scene himself . Mrs. Seeley brought out her story promptly , as if she had memorized questions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 9.30 on the night of January 9 . The slushy sidewalks , with just a path beaten along them . The two men who crowded her off into the mud , and the quick indignant look that showed her the taller one plain under the arc light.  --  Were there any peculiarities about the taller of the two men you saw ?  --  Well , he had a mark , a scar like , on his neck , and a sharp nose.  --  Such a scar , would you say , as the defendant has on the left side of his neck ? " I object , " McDougall 's harsh voice said . " The question is leading . " Instantly Joe was on his feet . The inopportune fury that hadp278burst out of him twice before was so violent now that his voice cracked . " Who 's counsel here , anyhow ? " he shouted . " How many times do I have to fire you ? " In the momentary astounded silence Scott put his flat hands on the table and with an air of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand my status in this case , and I 'm sure Mr. McDougall does n't either . I ask for an adjournment until we can talk the situation out with the defendant . " The judge glanced briefly over the heads of the attentive jurors . " The court is recessed for three quarters of an hour , " he said . " The jury is excused until eleven-thirty . " The hubbubthat began among the spectators he quieted with a single peremptory rap . " I must warn the spectators . Now and hereafter , if order is not kept , I shall request the bailiff to clear the court . " Though the voices dropped again , Lund felt all around him the craning and peering to see and hear what went on inside the railing . People creaked with their desire to know . It was clear that more drama was brewing , for almost before the last juror was through the door the district attorney was leaning across the defense table . He was naturally a bristly man ; now he was swollen with anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to say , " he said , speakingdirectly to Scott . " I 'm not at all surprised at this . I recall that there was a long conference in this room yesterday afternoonbetween the defendant and his attorneys . " Leaning forward on the spread fingers of his left hand , he poked his right index finger back and forth at Scott 's chest . " I just want to say that if the defense thinks it can start any insanity business in this trial it is welcome to try it . The state is ready to meet this insanity business right now ! " His head snapped around and his stern eye fixed McDougall . " Do you think the defendant is insane ? " " No , " McDougall said flatly . " Do you ? " the prosecutor said , swinging back to Scott . Scott was swelling and bridling , pulling in his neck and roll/ing his shoulders until his face was turkey red . " I do not , " he said . " But I must say I am surprised at the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh Lord , Lund thought . Now we will have hurt feelings , and expostulations , and demands for apologies , and those whose business it is to win by whatever kind of trickery will turn their incorruptible faces to the court and lay their hands on their breasts and be martyred by the cynicism of doubters . But was it possible that the whole thing was a defense trick , cooked up between Joe and his attorneys and played out like a memorized act ? He considered the possibility and dismissed it , for though Joe 's actions had had a melodramatic unreality . about them , the notion of a planned act was too fantastic to bear scrutiny . He did not believe Joe was a good enough actor to do it ; he did not believe their talk in the jail could have been part of an elaborate and subtle pretense . The district attorney folded his arms and looked Scott over with a little smile . " I have nothing to retract . There is grave doubt in my mind that the conduct of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said his speech in the proper clear , bitten syllables . " And in mine too , " Joe Hillstrom said , and again injected his shock of surprise into the routine acts of the court characters . Apparently the spectacle of defendant and prosecutor bandingtogether against the defense attorneys amused the judge . With a wintry smile he said , " Bailiff , conduct the defendant into the court 's chamber . " To Scott , as he stepped down , he said , " You 'd better go in and settle this in private . " As Scott and McDougall , closely conferring , followed Joe and the bailiff out the rear door , the court broke out into delightedclots of talk.  --  This Hillstrom is crazy as a coot . Did you see him jump up there and try to yell the judge down ?  --  He is n't any crazier than I am . He 's smart . He knows as much law as his lawyers . The D.A . had that last one figured right on the line , they 're trying for an insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's murderous . Have you noticedp280his eyes ? My old man used to say you could never trust a man with those pale eyes . He 'd as soon kill you as look at you.  --  Are they going to put him on the stand ? Have they found that woman he was supposed to be mixed up with ?  --  They have n't found her because she does n't exist.  --  Yes , but I heard this morning there was some jane that had come out defending him , some bigwig 's wife , she got Clarence Darrow interested . Maybe that 's why Hillstrom tried to can his lawyers , he 's got Darrow coming in.  --  What I want to know is , who 's this jane that was yelling at him down there a while ago ? You know who she is ? She been in this before ? So I 'll just sit still , Joe had said . Either way , I 'll just sit still . He was supremely confident , secure in his own innocence of the crime . Or he was fanatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or he had some obscure motive that even his lawyers did n't know for refusing to play his scheduled part of defendant . Or he was guilty and at bay . And what was going on in the judge 's chamber now ? More extravagant defiance and denunciation of his lawyers ? More berserk throwing of anarchy into the orderly machinery ? Was that perhaps his motive in all this , simply a delight in throw -- ing monkey wrenches , a refusal to co-operate with any part of -- society 's institutions ? Or was he more subtle and cunning than anyone gave him credit for being , and deliberately cultivating confusion because confusion was his best defense ? Or was he a little drunk on the notoriety of his trial , and trying to steal the show from the orderly character actors elected by Salt Lake County ? This last speculation , Lund admitted , was evidence of how dizzy his mind had got attempting to understand . He must keep firmly in mind , though the circumstances and the staged look of the whole trial and the histrionics of defendant and attorneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Joe  - -  Hillstrom 's life was at stake . Three or four men had gathered just outside the rail on the center aisle . One of them , as he turned , showed a Wobblyp281button on his shirt  --  a massive man with very liquid black eyes , a mouth that twitched in a gritting , unreal smile , and a habit of looking beyond anyone he talked to , as if picking up meaningful hints of movement in corners of the room . He seemed to be the center of the group ; it was to him that Scott came now from the inner room . On impulse Lund stood up and joined the handful of men . Scott was saying , " Once Christensen and Judge Hilton enter the case officially I 'll step out if he wants , but it would be suicide to let him handle his own case even for one day . " " That does n't seem to be the way he figures it , " said a newspaperman with a pad in his hand . The big Wobbly looked across him abstractedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " he said to Scott . " Can I go in and talk to him ? " The lawyer threw his hands wide . " I wish you would . " " There 's a girl here I think ought to talk to him too . " Scott 's eyebrows worked , but he said nothing . And Lund , to whom the whole morning had been unreal , did an uncharacteristicthing . He pushed forward to the rail and said , " I 'm an old friend of Joe 's , from San Pedro . Maybe I could get him to listen . " The black eyes touched him , moved beyond him . " It 's a cinch somebody has to . Wait just a minute . " He went through and up the side aisle , and the girl sitting in the third row there came out at his crooked finger . They whispered together in the aisle , the girl blushed pink , her eyes , startled , searched the Wobbly 's face , her head dropped a little . Then the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes cover them all . " Well , I guess we 're a delegation . " The man with the pad started to come along , but the Wobbly good-naturedly put a hand against his chest and held him back . " This ai n't for you , " he said . " Not yet , anyway . " Four of them went on through the judge 's door . Going last , Lund turned and looked back into the courtroom . He had the odd unreal shock of seeing the thing reversed , of looking out over the audience while the act was still on , as if he werep282someone called up from the audience to assist the magician in a trick . Every eye in the room was on him  --  or on the doorway where the blonde girl had been just a moment before . JOE WAS SITTING in a chair by the fireplace , McDougall behind the desk . They were not talking . The lawyer was lookingout the window , watching the clouds and the sky and whistling softly between his teeth . Joe seemed perfectly calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in . " Well , Joe , " the big Wobbly said . " You sort of derailed the express . " " That 's sure a shame . " " What 's trouble ? " " I told you . I do n't like my lawyers . I do n't want you wastingmoney on them . " " What 's wrong with them ? " Joe shrugged . His eyes flicked over to the girl , dwelt on her soberly , moved on to Lund and recognized and acknowledgedhim , without ever altering the watchful , sullen expression of his face . " What 's right ? " Scott said , " Joe , I wish I could convince you we 're both doingour best . God knows you do n't give us much to work with ... " " That 's it , is n't it ? " Joe flashed . " You 'd like all the details about the woman . If I 'll give you the whole story and prove I 'm innocent , then you can prove it to the jury and make yourselflook good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving I 'm guilty , that takes work and you do n't do so well . " " Well , look at it this way , " the big Wobbly began , but Joe continued without moving his stare from Scott.  | " Every time a woman 's name comes up , here you come gallopingto snoop something out . The minute you got that wire from Virginia Stephen saying she 'd got Hilton to come into the case you trot around to ask if maybe I got shot in her house . " Again his eyes moved to dwell somberly on the girl , who stood hanging to the rim of her pocketbook . " Tonight you 'll be around to see if Ingrid is n't the one . " - Under the circumstances the words were as brutal as a blow . Bright red flamed in the girl 's face , a blush that looked so violent it seemed it must be accompanied by physical pain . " What you ca n't get through your head , " Joe said , " is that I do n't have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell anybody how I got shot . That 's not the question . The question is how Morrison and his boy got shot . The only part of this business that concerns you is keeping them from convincingthe jury I was in Morrison 's store . " " I must say that with your attitude that 's a little hard to do , " Scott said , and spread his hands at the big Wobbly . " You see , Ricket ? " McDougall continued to look out the window across the pigeon-messy sill . " Joe , " Ricket said , " Soren Christensen is coming in to act for Hilton this afternoon . Could n't you just ride it out till then ? " " Sure . Alone . Without Christensen or Hilton either , for that matter . " " You have to have somebody around that knows the law . " " I do n't know , " Joe said . " Maybe the new ones do . These two do n't . " Joe 's expression was that of a man bored with too much discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all off . But Lund , having thrust himself forward , had to try . He waited until he could catch Joe 's eye , and he forced his smile , and he said , " It 's so easy to miss a trick if you 're not trained to this . Your life could depend on some petty little triviality or a technical point . A jury can convict you because it takes a dislike to your face . " " That shows what their justice is worth . "  | " It does n't do much good to prove justice is blind and get hanged for your pains . " " Shot , " Joe said with a white grin . " In Utah they give you a choice . " Out of their reach , his back against some invisible wall , he sat and rubbed his broken knuckles with the ball of his left thumb . Scott looked at Ricket and then significantly at his watch . A pigeon fluttered onto the stone sill , and McDougall , elaborately holding himself out of the discussion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly . The girl stood where she had stood since coming in , both hands on her bag , her body leaning a little , her posture awkward , and said in a voice with a faint echo of Swedish singsong , " Maybe if I talked to him alone . " Joe did not even turn his head . " You stay out of this . " Trying the faces of the others for a reflection of understanding , Lund saw that all of them were curious , none of them knew . Scott stood with his watch in hand , his legs spraddled , his brows clenched in a frown . McDougall had turned away from his contemplation of the outdoors . Ricket studied the girl with his glowing liquid eyes . " Please , " Ingrid said to them all . Now Joe was very erect in his chair . In the strong light every mark on his bitten face showed , the scar from nose to jaw , the clipped wing of the nose , the ridged welt on his neck . His lips were thinned together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something intense and inward . Then he said , " Maybe you all better chase out for a minute . " People were still at the rail , two reporters among them . Lund felt their curiosity as more professional but no more insistentthan his own , and he felt the exact moment when the courtroom realized that the girl had not come out with the . rest . From the edge of the jury box the district attorney and the judge looked on remotely . " I do n't know , " Scott said , and shook his head repeatedly at the reporters . He was like a man trying to shake off a per/sistent fly . " Her name is Ingrid Olson , that 's all I know . " " She 's a musician , " Ricket put in . " She helps Joe with his songs . " " What songs ? " " He 's a song writer . He wrote half the IWW songbook . " " Is she an IWW ? " " No . " " You think she 's the woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's she mixed up in it , then ? What 's going on in there now ? " " I do n't know . " " You staying in , or is he going to act for himself ? " " Wait five minutes and we 'll all know , " Scott said . " How does Hillstrom act with this girl ? They seem to bepretty thick ? " McDougall said sourly , " An hour ago you fellows all thought the woman story was a pretty weak alibi . " The clock clicked at the half-hour . The judge climbed to the bench , looking a question at Scott in passing . Just as Scott put his hand to the door of the chambers , the knob turned and Ingrid Olson came out . In a breathless swallowed voice she - said , " It 'll be all right , " and with her face held sideward and downward she hurried through the gate and to her seat . Be- - hind her came Joe with the bailiff holding his arm . So the entr'act was over , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bailiff 's henyard gabble of invocation . It was something of a surprise to Lund to see Mrs. Seeley mount to the witness chair . He had the feeling that they should be far beyond Mrs. Seeley , into some other scene . But here she was , careful and with a prim mouth , determined to answer thoughtfully and accurately . Lund thought that as she sat holding her white gloves in her lap she looked out across the court with an air of pride . Justice groaned on.  --  Look carefully at the defendant , Mrs. Seeley . Would you be able to identify him positively as the man who passed youp286under the arc light at Eighth South and West Temple on the night of January 9 ?  --  Well , not exactly . He 's about the same build , and his nose .. .  --  He resembles closely the taller of the two men you saw ?  --  Yes , I would say he .. .  --  Will you describe again how this man was dressed ?  --  Well , he had a felt hat pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cowboy fashion , and no overcoat.  --  How tall would you say this man was ?  --  Oh , pretty tall , close to six feet , and slim.  --  I will ask the defendant to stand up . Now , Mrs. Seeley .. . Lund shut his eyes , listening carefully but with detachment . He had no faith in the district attorney 's ability to extract the truth from however willing a witness . He had no faith that having committed himself as public prosecutor the district attorney was any longer interested in the truth . A conviction in the legal sense was not quite the same as intellectual conviction . And he had no faith in any human being 's ability to be a witness , and he did not believe that anything he himself thought important could come from all the elaborate and intricateformalisms of this court . What could emerge was a barren what and an equally barren how . The elusive who , as the case seemed to him , was certain to be settled by implicationand inference and interpretation of circumstances , withoutclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if Joe Hillstrom were in fact guilty , there remained the final and wretchedly insoluble why . If Joe Hillstrom were guilty , how explain it ? What chain of circumstances , what dark impulse , what private fury or sudden crystallization of long impersonal hostilities , what tie-up with revolution or what need for money , what accidents and what plans and what influences , the whole web of the why was forever hidden , beyond the jurisdiction and beyond the capacity for inquiry of this or any other court . The answer might lie in Joe Hillstrom 's mind , or Joe Hillstrom might be as ignorant of the whole action as he said he was . If it lay in hisp287mind and memory , then how important was it that Joe 's mind was a labyrinth of prejudice and devotion and idealism and half-baked revolutionary ardor and a personal hostility against fate or society or capitalism or some yeasty Enemy called the System ? Lund had seen enough criminals to be impressed by their stupidity and their animalism . Joe was neither stupid nor animal . Then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and saw the back of Joe Hillstrom 's head and thought how strange it was , how suddenly unbelievable , that that little round skull could contain all it contained . Like a Pandora 's box , if it were opened it could overflow the world . But it remained sealed , neatly trimmed by the jail barber , dense with the things it knew , and utterly opaque even to the eyes of justice , of friendship , or of love . That there was love involved , he needed no more looks at Ingrid Olson 's face to know . He kept his eye on her , and when , five minutes before the noon recess , she rose and went out , he followed her . The elevator door was just closing . Dourly the one-legged elevator man  --  some precinct worker rewarded with a job  --  held it open for them . In silence they rode down the creaking old rig . Lund saw that the girl 's face was drawn ; her starched waist was wilted a little by the heat . At the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lund followed she stopped and turned , her face a mixture of impatience and pleading . " Please  --  I have n't anything to tell you . " " You do n't understand , " Lund said , stopping dead still . " I 'm not a reporter . I 'm a friend of Joe 's . " Her eyes searched his ; he found them candid as well as troubled . " Even then , " she said . " I do n't want to force myself on you , " he said , " but I 'd like to talk . Could you go with me somewhere and have lunch ? " " I 'm on my way home . " " Can I come along ? " " I live clear out in Murray . "  | " Out where Joe lived ? " " Near there . " " All the better . " Smiling to reassure her , deliberately working the warmth that he knew people found in him , he waited . " All right , " she said , and turned again toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lush with the jungle growth of summer . Birds ducked and shook themselves under the sprinklers on the park lawn . Out by the sidewalk a fox terrier lay with its hindquarters spraddled flat in the dust . As they passed , a drop fell from its jerking pink tongue . " Why do you come to the trial ? " Lund said , and felt at once that the question sounded blunt . Without turning her face she answered , " He should know his friends are standing by him . " She led him to the corner and across the street and stopped under a tree . " Of course , " he said . " I meant . . . it 's a brave thing for you to do . " " Brave ? " " Considering how people talk . You expose yourself to all kinds of guesses . " " I did n't expect to get involved , " she said . " I just went there so he could see me . " Up the street he saw the yellow car coming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in her expression , but she was looking in her purse for carfare . . " He was n't pleased to see you brought into it , " he said . She shook her head , her lips tightening . " No . " " Though you were the only one who could do anything with him . " The car started from the next corner and came rocking . They stepped down off the curb to meet it , and she surprised him with an absolutely direct look . " If I were the woman , " she said , " would it be any harder for me to go and tell how he got shot than to appear in court and let everybody guess ? " He was embarrassed . " I did n't mean . . . " " If he 'd got shot over me I 'd have told long ago , " she said.  |p289The  car passed them , slowing and grinding , with a whiff of ozone and oil and a billowing of disturbed hot air . " Do you think he got shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the front end . The folding doors opened . " He says he did , " Ingrid said over her shoulder , and mounted the steps . They were in a seat at the rear , away from the handful of other passengers , when Lund spoke again . " You 're very loyal . " " His friends should be , " she said , aiming it so directly at him and his doubt that he kept silence . In the next few minutes he stole looks at her face . She was pale , and she kept her head turned to look out the window . The inconsequentialities of the trackside occupied his eyes and at least part of his brain . The car ran through a little concentration of business buildings , past the board fences of a ball park , and then into something more country than city , with only scattered houses , with big gardens , with orchards and privies . They rocked along at a clattering pace , stopping only at main intersections where the houses momentarily thickened . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said finally . " I 'm trying to understand . Ever since I first heard , yesterday , of the trouble Joe was in , I 've been trying to fit the Joe I know into this . I ca n't . " " Nobody can , " she said . Ingrid Olson 's skull , like the skull of Joe Hillstrom , might contain some of the answers Lund craved , but he saw now , as he should have seen earlier , that there was no digging them out . His methods were the methods of the district attorney . There were no other methods available . Learning what he needed to know was like trying to weigh the impalpable air with a freight scale . " Have you known Joe long ? " he said . " Since September . " " September . That 's when I saw him last . He must have come straight up here from San Pedro . " He wondered if this decent , clean , troubled young woman knew that Joe carried a gun , and what she would make of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizer . He wondered what she would think if he told her the story of the wad of money thrown at him frantically for hiding when the police knocked on the alley door . And yet was n't it a demonstration of Joe 's soundness that he should have been keeping company with this kind of girl , this decent clean troubled obviously good and loyal and dependable young woman ? Or at least keeping part-time company with her . There was always the nameless source of his wound , if she existed . The confusions in his mind began to communicate themselves to his body ; on an empty stomach , the rocking of the car and the smells of ozone and oil and straw seats and cigar butts began to make him queasy . He sat swallowing down his uneasy gorge , making no attempt to press the conversation further , and he was glad when Ingrid Olson stood up to get off . The two-block walk to her house quieted his stomach , but still he said nothing , because he felt there was nothing he could say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the girl finally stopped at an unpainted wooden gate , before a house with a bow window in which stood a cardboard sign saying " Ingrid Olson , Piano Lessons , " she put one hand on the gatepost and stood waiting , and he knew she was only being polite , she wanted him to say goodbye and be gone . Opening his hand ruefully , turning it upward , he smiled . " I wish I knew what to think . It 's almost as easy for me to think Joe guilty of murder as to believe this story about the woman . He just is n't the man for either one . I do n't under-stand . " Under a catalpa tree drooping with long pods , her hand on the gate , she stood quietly , a quiet girl with her own dignity about her . Her voice was low . " Is it so necessary to understand ? " she said . " Is n't it enough just to take his word and try to help ? " " I should think . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's eyes , but she didp291not turn her face . She stared at him through the tears , it seemed to him angrily , and her mouth twisted in an uncontrollablegrimace . " Do you think I understand ? " she said , and turned swiftly up the walk and into the house . THE WOBBLY hall looked like every other Wobbly hall he had ever been in  --  a single big bare room with folding chairs piled against the wall and a " baggage room " in the back corner where migrants stacked their bindles . In the broken-down black-leather hotel chairs along the window side a half-dozen men were arguing . The room smelled of cooking and tobacco smoke and printer 's ink from the old flatbed press shoved against the inside wall where a man in a canvas apron was setting up a stick of type . At first he saw nothing of Ricket , but a second look showed him the cubbyhole office with its door half ajar , and he leaned in to see the secretary sprawled in a swivel chair before a desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the chair , the room , the overflowing desk . His movement of welcome made the chair squeal , and he lunged to keep papers from sliding off onto the floor . " Sit down , " he said . " Glad to see you . " Lund did not take the offered chair . " I 've got to catch a train in a few minutes . I just dropped in to leave something for the defense fund . " " Sure thing . " Pawing among papers and drawers in a halfheartedattempt to find something , Ricket said , " If I could locate the damn book I 'd fix you up a receipt . " " Never mind . " " Oh sure , just as easy as not . " The forty dollars that Lund took from his wallet was morep292than he could spare ; he would be short by the time he got home . But he would not do less . Seeing the surprise flick in Ricket 's black eyes at the amount , he said , " This is a debt . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I 'll send on a contribution of my own after I get back east . " He knew that Ricket 's insistence on the receipt was a recognition of his difference and his status as an outsider , a " sympathizer . " Ricket would demonstrate that the IWW was punctilious and that there was not the slightest chance of graft in its collection of defense funds . Though he had never believed otherwise , Lund submitted to being receipted . When the slip was in his hands he said , " How did Joe behave this afternoon ? " " Well , " Ricket said , and his eyes looked beyond Lund and his mouth twitched in the phantom smile . " He did n't fire any more lawyers . " " Are Scott and McDougall as bad as he says ? " " They 're all right . He never gave them anything to work with . " Ricket heaved back in the chair , found two cigars in a drawer , offered one to Lund , who refused . He bit off the end and sat absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a webbed frown . For an aimless half-minute he tried carefully to get the cigar band onto his little finger , but could slip it only as far as the second knuckle . " I do n't know , " he said , and yawned powerfully , cracking his jaws . " Scott 's been on half a dozen labor cases here , he 's all right . McDougall 's new in town . But Joe do n't even want Hilton . " " He told me he did n't want the union to bleed its treasury . " " Yeah , " Ricket said . " But before he got in this jam himself he was busting a gut raising money for the defense of the Oatfield boys . No , I 've watched Joe on this from the beginning . He did n't fire those two because they were doing a bad job . He fired them because he did n't want anybody defending him at all . " " Some people might take that as a sign he 's guilty . "  | " Or extra innocent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes that seemed pure liquid . His voice was gentle . " Did you ever get hauled into jail ? " No . ' The secretary dropped his head back and blew smoke at the ceiling , and the ghostly smile like a tightening of the jaw muscles or a gritting of the teeth came mirthlessly and went again . " I remember the first time I ever got pulled , " he said . " I was just a kid , maybe sixteen , and I was on the bum in a strange town  --  Denver , if it matters any . So I was rubbering around the streets looking for a YMCA when a cop spotted me , and finally he came up and said he guessed he better look me over . He searched me and found a jackknife I had , one with a button on the handle that springs the blade out , you know ? Bingo , I 'm in the clink , concealed weapons . It was that button jigger that did it . The cop booked me and took me on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side I kind of hesitated , you know , the way you would , not knowing which way he wanted you to go . But I never got my mouth open to ask , because this bull let me have it across the face with his billy . I saw stars for about an hour , and after that I laid all night in the tank thinking over my sins . In the morning I was so swelled up , like a punkin all across this side , that they finally brought in a sawbones to look me over . Busted cheekbone . I kept wanting them to wire my folks in Sioux Falls , but they did n't pay me any mind . They made it plenty clear how I could get a year for that jackknife if they wanted to be tough , and they kept inviting me to confess any robberies or anything I 'd been mixed up in . They even pretended they had me all hooked up with one special job , but I was too dumb innocent to know what went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man , and after three days I got out of there . " Lund waited . " Yes ? " " I was just thinking how helpless they can make you feel , " Ricket said . " You 're minding your own business and right out of a clear sky comes this tough mick in a blue suit and he can pull any damn thing on you he wants . He can murder you ifp294he feels like it , beat you plumb to death , and the rest of them will cover up for him like a horse blanket . You ca n't open your peep . Just squawk once , or even break step going through a door , and he can bust you with a club . If you look cross-eyed you 're resisting an officer , or trying to escape . And then they get you up before some sergeant and start firing questions at you , and there 's something about a jail makes everything you say sound like a lie , even to yourself . In five minutes they got you thinking you probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out about you and will they do it ? They 'd let you rot in jail for a week before they 'd even send a wire . " Yes , " Lund said again . " I think I can figure Joe out , " Ricket said . " Suppose you 're him , and you get hurt  --  how , that 's your business . You 're lying in bed when the cops come and pinch you . If they can make me feel the way I did about that jackknife , how could they make Joe feel about a double murder ? Would you talk for them ? Even if it meant your neck , would you let them beat some alibi out of you ? " Knowing Joe , Lund admitted to himself that it could be that way . He was stubborn and he was proud . " Even hiring a lawyer to defend him is playing their game , see ? " Ricket said . " Once he got really sore he 'd feel that way , would n't he ? " With a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A working stiff like Joe has n't got any old man in Sioux Falls to wire to . Maybe you do n't know how the cops take it out on somebody they think has n't got any friends . " " Maybe Joe does n't want the IWW to spend its money because he thinks it is n't properly an IWW case . " " What do you mean ? " " He could n't have been on union business when he was shot . " " Why not ? " Ricket said . " That woman story could easy be something he got up on the spur of the moment . He could easy have been on union business . " He batted at the smokep295cloud and twisted in the chair . " What you have to keep in mind all the time is that he 's a Wobbly . That 's enough for the boys that are after him . Ever since Haywood tried to organizeBingham two years ago the Copper Trust has been looking for a chance . Last fall we struck the Utah Construction Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RG . That puts the Utah Construction Company and the D &; RG right where the Copper Trust is . This is a labor-hating state . If they ca n't beat us or run us out they 'll frame us . " Ricket 's thesis was so simple , so comforting in its directness , that for a moment Lund was tempted . It made such a close neat pattern : the bosses catching a labor organizer off balance and pinning the handiest unexplained crime on him . Sometimesthe formula varied , the bosses first having the crime committedand then framing a labor man . And both variants were often enough true ; it would solve a lot of questions to believe one or another of them true this time . And certainly that would be the official IWW version , spread through the labor press . The printer in the canvas apron was probably setting up something of the kind now . But there were hesitancies , impediments to belief . " I 've gone through the newspapers files , " he said . " They do n't say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters there this morning did n't even know Joe had written any songs . He 's been in jail five months , but so far as I can see they still think they 've got a common laborer named Hillstrom . They do n't know they 've got Joe Hill . " The ghost smile became real , stretching the wide limber lips . " The newspaper boys do n't tell anything they 're not supposed to tell . Maybe they knew who Joe was and maybe they did n't . But the bosses did . " " What bosses ? " Lund said impatiently . " Have you got any evidence of that ? " Ricket only smiled , and Lund understood him . If there was no evidence , the statement could still be made  --  must be made , as part of the campaign . " Anyway they know now , " Ricket said after a pause . " They were around here this after/noon and I gave them an earful . " With a big brass-capped advertising pencil he jabbed at the scarred desk . " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a week or two every stiff in the West 'll know he 's being railroaded . You watch the support roll in . " More than ever Lund felt himself an outsider , a pale doubting Thomas . The rest of them , from Ingrid Olson and Ricket to the most nameless stiff who sent in a dollar bill in a penciled envelope , were united in a single uncomplicated act of trying to save Joe . Trying to understand ( trying to judge ? he wondered ) he was all alone , useless , perhaps even disloyal . " Is Mrs. Stephen part of the campaign ? " he asked . " You bet she is . She 's a worker , that girl , and she 's got con-nections . " " Her connections have already got her talked about . " Ricket 's laugh was loud and full of amusement , oddly hearty after the ghostly flickering smile . " Did you see tonight 's Deseret News ? " " Not yet . " " Not a peep , " Ricket said . " Daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Unh-uh . Not in the Church 's paper . " " It 'll be in the others , though . " " Oh sure . " Lund hesitated half a breath . " Anything in it ? " The big head wagged and the chair groaned . " I wish there was . She 'd have come out with it and got him out of there a long time ago . " " So she 's just an IWW . " The secretary looked at him in amusement . When he looked directly into Lund 's face his eyes were so shining that they seemed a completely transparent covering for something beyond , some hidden , alert , outward-peering life . " Just ? " he said . " That 's the highest office in this land of liberty . " So there was disappointment here too , in spite of all the certaintyand confidence . He would find none of the answers he sought . The tiny office was layered , with smoke , his legs felt asp297if he had walked a long way , his stomach fluttered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , remembering that streetcar ride and the way he had forced the girl out of her dignity and silence , " The Olson girl does n't seem to be the one , either . " " I do n't know anything , " Ricket said . " I do n't want to know anything . But if I was to guess I 'd guess that kid had taken a beating . " Lund sighed . There was a short silence into which the acceleratingargument in the other room came briefly loud : " That 's a lot of crap ! Look at what they did at the second national convention . If it had n't been for De Leon we'd 've ... " The preacher rubbed his face , very tired . He thought with cunning hidden pleasure of the Pullman , the bed , the close green-curtained darkness where he could lie down and let the motion of the train rock out of his mind the speculation and confusion , the whole war of affection and belief . To hide the treacherous evasiveness of the thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained as a minister . I keep looking for the right and wrong in things . The motive always seemed to me more important than the act . I keep being bothered by things . Why Joe does n't want lawyers , for instance . Why he sticks to a story like that one about protecting a woman . The only thing that seems in character at all is the way he keeps his mouth shut about what actually happened to him . " " That 's a fact , " Ricket said . " He 's a first-class clam . MaybeChristensen and Hilton can get him talking . " " Maybe he 'll fire them too . " Ricket winked . " He ca n't . This thing 's out of his hands . " He rose , a tremendous man , a foot taller than Lund . A buttonof his shirt was undone , and black hair grew in a stiff curl through the opening , positive and direct as grass growing towardsunlight . He shook hands with the preacher and they wished each other luck . The Wobblies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his suitcase , were as automatic as a burglar alarm.  |p298Touch  any part of the mechanism , let one member be misused , anywhere , and they went off in a loud single-minded uproar . An injury to one was an injury to all . They went no further . There was one enemy , the System . No matter what happened , they knew who was to blame . They recognized one virtue , loyalty to the cause , so that their souls and stomachs were not visited by doubt and queasiness . The revolutionary faith was a flux that absorbed moral complexities and even rational doubts as limestone absorbed impurities from iron ore . Once the flux had begun to operate , there were only two possibilities , one choice . Either or , our side or theirs , iron or slag . Joe would have support , if he would accept it ; he would have a defense , if he would permit it ; he would have widespreadand unquestioning belief for any statement he chose to make , or any statement made in his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would , but others would move the chair he sat in . Those who would convict him because he was an IWW or those who would free him unquestioned for the same reason would pick a bone over his fate . But what of those who saw with a twist of almost fatherly solicitude the broken and crippled hand , and those who wondered against their own wish if Joe Hillstrom could really have entered that grocery store masked and armed , and if he had , then why ? Was it disloyal to believe that almost any man was capable of almost any mistake or crime if the circumstances shoved him that way ? Was it unfriendly to know that a friend was not perfect and incorruptible , but sadly human , and to like him in spite of the weaknesses he had : the profound inward hostility that made him strike out in retaliation , the fits of self-pity and self-justification , the pride and vanity , the latent violence , the great vague ambitions ? Did it lessen Christ 's love for Peter to know that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it change his feelings about Joe to know for certain that Joe was guilty ? He did not know . He knew only that he mistrusted the partisans who would hang or free Joe without regard for his THE CAPTIVE 299guilt or innocence . In spite of the clumsiness and inadequacyofthe court he had sat in that morning there was no solution for civilized men except to try to know , and if they could not know enough , then to know what they could . Being imperfectand human , Joe would have to put up with imperfect human justice , but it was justice that he ought to face , and W not either organized vengeance or the organized clemency of .. friends . He had no doubt that justice , no matter which way it decided , would be denounced by one side or the other , or perhaps both.  |p300SALT  LAKE CITY , 1914 - 1915CONSIDER THE WAY circumstance has of taking a man out of his own proper and recognizable character and subtly transforming him , coating him with the ions of a new personality as a lead tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are on trial before the Third District Court in Salt Lake City . One is the IWW poet and song writer Joe Hill , a name known to many , and now a face that begins to be known too , a sensitive and thoughtful and fine face , with a resolute mouth and eyes like a compassionate Christ . Folders bearing his picture are stuck up in every hall west of the Big Sioux ; an indignation meeting in New York has marched with his portrait on banners ; sailors have carried the story of his case over the world . Shining with firm innocence , victimized because of his organizing activities , Joe Hill rises out of the murk of the labor wars , still serving the cause even in the System 's jail . More than life-size , of an immortal calmness and unshakableresolution , he takes shape in the minds of thousands , legendary , even mythical : Labor 's Songster . His origin is uncertain , for who can isolate for certain the egg and the sperm that unite to make a legend ? Who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself upon others and how much that myth is created by those who know him ? Joe Hill began to be born in his songs and cartoons ;  |p301certainly  he lived , imperfectly realized , in the mind of a Swede sailor sitting on the San Pedro waterfront feeding a rat , or looking down the sad trough of Beacon Street and dreaming a dream of leading thousands . But now he acquires stature and outline through the labors of a committee ; he is issued from a headquarters like news bulletins , and the headquarters is not Salt Lake County jail but the IWW hall . Step by step , as the union fights his case against the hardeningprejudices of courts and public , in an atmosphere increasinglyedged and hostile , the character of Joe Hill is filled in by broadsides , pamphlets , appeals , form letters , news stories for the labor press . He emanates piecemeal from a dusty bare room where transient men sleep and cook and discuss and convene : a meager flophouse , a minimal lodge , a scanty asylum , a threadbare club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solidarity . It is in this cell of the new society forming within the shell of the old , this skimpy few square feet of the revolutionary future , that Joe Hill is properly born . Throughout the course of his creation his prototype Joe Hillstrom sits waiting in the county jail . Forbidden newspapers , he can be only vaguely aware of what is happening to his identity . The little information he gets comes to him through the steel mesh of the visitors ' window , or through conferences with the lawyers he has been prevailed upon to accept , or through letters that come to him from old friends , fellow workers , liberal groups , church organizations , sobsisters , the known and the nameless who have heard his legend and wish him well . These are things which must work upon him slowly , sometimes as surprise and sometimes as reinforcementof his buried and incorrigible beliefs about himself . As the myth begins slowly and insensibly to encroach upon the man , which is the truer part ? Is it Joe Hillstrom or Joe Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh or a wronged spirit , who sits through the days of testimony with his bony shoulders turned on the crowd of sympathizers and union-haters and plain emotion-suckers who pack the room ?  |p302Is  it Joe Hillstrom or Joe Hill who is described in the hostile city papers as " cringing " when the prosecutor in his speech to the jury points a dramatic finger and calls him the most bloodthirstyanimal in the annals of Utah crime ? Does he watch with his own eyes or with the eyes of Labor 's Songster while his attorneys denounce the court as unfair and the trial as a farce ; and is the sneer that touches his mouth personal or abstractwhen the district attorney makes a ranting reply : ( My blood boils with keen resentment , gentlemen , when I hear such unwarranted attacks on American institutions  --  institutionswhich are the foundation stones of our glorious concepts of liberty , equality , and justice , and I tell you that when any considerable number of our fellow beings subscribe to the doctrine you heard enunciated this morning , then liberty flees the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ) ? Joe Hill or Joe Hillstrom , he stands before the bar of justice and hears himself convicted of murder in the first degree . Indifferently , standing straight because his body has never learned to slouch , but not respectful , not cowed , he hears the judge 's dry intoning voice ask him if he has any reason why he should not be sentenced , and he shrugs off the formality : " No , let it go at that . " According to the laws of Utah he is offered his choice between hanging and shooting , and his lip lifts ( out of personal insolence or out of some perception of how he must look for the public at such a moment ? ) " I 'll take shooting , " Hill or Hillstrom says clearly . " I 'm used to that . I 've been shot at a few times before and I guess I can stand it again . " With his life already forfeit and his death sentence forming on the judge 's withered lips , he ironically underlines the refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound which properly explained would clear him becomes the source of an acid joke just before the words that will end his life . That joke too goes broadcast from headquarters and adds its touch to the growing portrait of Joe Hill . The verdict has inspired a renewed burst of activity ; the sentence which condemnsJoe Hillstrom to be shot on September 4 doubles itp303again . Defense committee and lawyers sit late in the little office off the Wobbly hall . Jack Carpenter , the gimpy-legged printer , in eye shade and apron sets stick after stick of worn type . Across the country men lounging on corners or outside the doors of skid-road joints hear , among denunciations of war and the Rockefellers and the lumber trust , the story of Joe Hill 's frame-up , and a few of them drop coins in the hat . From his parents ' farm in Minnesota Gus Lund , ex-preacher , sends twenty dollars , and later another twenty . From the ranch crowded with lushes and hangers-on in the Valley of the Moon , Jack London sends a hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail , Joe Hillstrom or Joe Hill , waits , and fills his days answering his mail , and keeps his mouth shut . Salt Lake City Sept. 15 , 1914 Dear friend and fellow worker : Yours of Sept. 9 at hand . Glad to hear that you are still alive and kicking and back on the firing line again . So you tried to imitate Knowles , the Nature Freak , and live the simple life . It might be all right for a little while , as you say , but I am afraid a fellow would get simple getting too much of the simple life . Well , I guess the wholesale butchery going on in Europe is putting the kibosh on everything , even the organization work , to some extent . As a rule , a fellow do n't bother his head much about unions and the class struggle when his belly is flapping up against his spine . Getting the wrinkles out is then the main issue , and everything else side issues .. . Well , I guess Van has told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , because he has been around here and on the outside . I am feeling well under the circumstancesand I am fortunate enough to have the ability to entertain myself and look at everything from the bright side . So there is nothing you can do for me . I know you would if you could . With best wishes to the bunch , Yours for the OB U , JoE HILLp304Salt Lake City Dec. 2 , 1914 Dear friend and fellow worker : Received your letter and should have answered before , but have been busy working on some musical composition and whenever I get an " inspiration " I ca n't quit until it 's finished . I am glad to hear that you manage to make both ends meet , in spite of the industrial deal , but there is no use being pessimisticin this glorious land of plenty . Self-preservation is , or should be , the first law of nature . The animals , when in a natural state , are showing us the way . When they are hungry they will always try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the attempt . That 's natural ; to starve to death is unnatural . No , I have not heard that song about " Tipperary " but if you send it as you said you would I might try to dope something out about that Frisco fair . I am not familiar with the actual conditions of Frisco at present ; and when I make a song I always try to picture things as they really are . Of course a little pepper and salt is allowed in order to bring out the facts more clearly . If you send me that sheet music and give me some of the peculiarities and ridiculous points about the conditions in general on or about the fairground , I 'll try to do the best I can . Yours for the OB U , JOE HILLSalt Lake City Jan. 3 , 1915 Dear Gus : Jud Ricket was telling me the other day he had had two or three contributions from you for the defense fund . You know I never was very sold on the sky pilots , but you 're one preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending door . Ricket tells me funds keep coming in and there is going to be enough to finance the appeal clear to the supreme court . I 'm still pretty sure no man is worth that much , but if I get sore and tell them to give the money to strike relief somewhere they do n't pay any attention , so I have learned to keep still . Keep still and sit still . I 'd make a first class toadstool . I was thinking the other day , when the new year rolledp305around , that I 've been in this calaboose almost a full year , and that 's a long time to live on the kind of stew they serve here . The coffee is a little better than you used to make , but not enough to get excited about . Well , when we used to sit in the kitchen and drink that turpentine we never thought that pretty soon you 'd be hoeing corn and I 'd be where I am . I keep myself in good spirits by reminding myself that the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Once a month or so a missionary of some kind comes around with a basket of books , but they 're all full of moral uplift and angel food , and I 'd rather read old letters over again than waste my time on that .

Your friendJOESalt Lake City Feb. 13 , 1915 Dear friend and fellow worker : Should have answered your letter before but have been busy working on a song named " The Rebel Girl " ( words and music ) which I hope will help to line up the women workers in the OBU , and I hope you will excuse me . I see you made a big thing out of that Tipperary song . In fact , a whole lot more than I ever expected . I did n't suppose that it would sell very well outside of Frisco , though by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me that " Casey Jones " made quite a hit in London , and " Casey Jones , " he was an Angeleno , you know , and I never expected that he would leave Los Angeles at all . The other day the defense committee got ten bucks from a company of soldiers stationed on the Mexican line . How is that , old top ? Maybe they are remembering some of the cigars in glass bottles that they smoked at the expense of the Tierra y Libertad bunch . Do n't know much about my case . The Sup .

That 's the only life I know . Yes , that Tipperary song is spreading like the smallpox they say . Sec. 69 tells me that there is a steady stream of silver from Frisco on account of it . The unemployed all over the country have adopted it as a marching song in their parades , and in New York City they changed it to some extent so as to fit the brand of soup dished out in N.Y . They are doing great work in N.Y . this year . The unemployed have been organized and have big meetings every night . Gurley Flynn , George Swasey the human phonograph ) and other live ones are there , and Gurley F. tells me things are looking favorable for the OBU .

Well , I have about a dozen letters to answer . Yours as ever , JOE HILLSalt Lake City June 6 , 1915 Dear friend and fellow worker : Your welcome letter received , and am glad to note that you are still sticking to your " little cabin in the hills . " I would like to get a little of that close to nature stuff myself for a couple of months in order to regain a little vitality , and a little flesh on my rotting bones . My case was argued on the 28th ofp307May , and according to Judge Hilton the results were satisfactory . He says he is sure of securing a reversal , and if so , there will hardly be another trial , for the simple reason that there wo n't be anything to try .. . Your friend , JOEP.S.  --  I 've just found out that the Superior Court judges are getting ready to go on their vacation until next fall , so I guess there wo n't be anything decided on my case for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , and that 's the only consolation I got now . He had almost a month to sit and think it over between the time the Supreme Court denied his appeal and the time they came to take him back to the District Court for resentencing , but he found this waiting easier because by now he brought resignation to it . Ricket and Hilton tried to inject cheer into him day after day , but it leaked out as fast as they poured it in . He had no need for cheer . He watched them almost with pity as they wasted their time and strength in a stubborn , step-by-step retreat . His mail increased sharply after the Supreme Court decision , and all of it was meant as encouragement . ( Do n't give up . We 'll fight it to the highest court in the country . The dirty plutes do n't know what they started when they started trying to railroad you . We 'll fill Salt Lake so full of sab cats the bulls will crawl under the beds . ) It astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were old friends ; he was surprised that so many knew his songs . More than once , reading their letters , he found himself thinking with a remote pity of Joe Hill , held in the Salt Lake jail , Joe Hill the rebel song writer . He thought of himself not as himself but as an acquaintance , a name he had heard of . But he knew in his bones they would kill him . They came for him one day at midmorning , two deputies named Young and Raleigh , and behind them Sheriff Coues and Chief Barry of the Police Department.  | " Little walk in the park , " Raleigh said as he slipped the handcuff on Joe 's wrist . Joe glanced down ; his wrist was bare bone . He said to Raleigh , " Looks like a chicken 's neck in a horse collar . You 'd better tighten that up or I 'll slide right through . " " Well , if you insist , " Raleigh said . He was a beefy man who was a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple mat-burn on one cheekbone . Beyond the gate the sheriff was relaxed , wrinkle-necked , ministerial . The police chief was a short , dewlapped man with a mad , stubborn mouth . " Why all the escort ? " Joe said . The chief looked at him as if he were personally furious . Sheriff Coues said , " Some of your Wobbly friends have been making threats . " " Good for them , " Joe said . " What are they going to do ? " " Nothing ! " the chief said , short and sudden as an explosion . " Ca n't let you get away without a struggle , " the sheriff said mildly . " Have to make an effort to hang onto you . " They led him out and down the corridor and out past the office and into the alley . After the cool stone jail the heat of the sun-beaten pavement was shrivelling , and the light was so strong that Joe walked the first two hundred feet with his hand cupping his eyes . Objects swam in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not smelled in weeks : outside smells , asphalt and gasoline and horse manure and the moldy earthsmellof the gutter where a trickle of water ran . They hurried him across the street and along the sidewalk under the park trees . A squirrel shot across in front of them and up the trunk of a boxelder , and people passing stared at the manacled man . He walked with his face straight ahead , the swimming dazzle gone from his eyes now , his mind on the thing he was headed toward . There was a tightness in his chest ; he felt his wound . Into the cool , lofty , **29;5190;TOOLONG hall , then the five of them jamming shoulders in the elevator cage , staring at the back of the elevator operator'sbald head and hearing the sigh of the shaft , seeing thep309swaying snaky cables move downward past them . This was all as it had been many times before , and now this time the last : the cool sigh of the shaft and the bald head of the operator and the echoing tiles and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offices and the sign above the door on the left that said Third District Court , Judge M. L. Ritchie . Voices floated out the door . He heard the dry old voice of the judge and a heavy bass that replied . Then they were at the door , steel pulled at his wrist , the proceedings in the courtroommomentarily paused as they came in , and Joe , walking with his head up , met the bleak impersonal glance of the man who had condemned him once and would condemn him again . The judge nodded slightly to the party , indicating that they should sit down and wait . " The prisoners will stand forward , " he said . Two young men stood up below the high bench , a shockheadedfarm boy and another with a long bony jaw and a face humped and knobbed with some skin disease . The judge sentencedthem to indeterminate terms in the state prison for second-degreeburglary . Joe watched their heads , wondering what they were thinking , whether the indeterminate sentence was a relief or whether the uncertainty left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm boy sway , and then the two turned away , the old dry voice stopped , the fat bailiff left over from earlier acts of this repetitive dream stood up at his table and read in his goose-voice . Raleigh unlocked the handcuff . Without being told to do so , Joe stood up . A moment ago he had been hot , but now he felt like a fish frozen in a cake of ice . It seemed that no sound could penetrate into where he stood ; the room and the people were outside , in another element , and he looked up at the judge through a thick layer of almost solid air . He was surprised when the judge 's voice came through , crackly as paper , saying the words not his own , the words also left over , inherited from centuries of criminal courts , an echop310of what hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands had heard as they stood up for the next to the last time to face the society that hated and feared them . It was a ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once already . " Have you anything to say why the sentence of death should not be passed upon you at this time ? " Now his own voice , and he heard it too with surprise , strong and clear , saying words that were not his either , but formal law-court words that he had been coached in by Hilton . " I have this to say , your honor , " his distant voice said . " I want to know why jurymen were arbitrarily appointed by the court in my case , instead of being drawn as is the case in similar proceedings . And I want to know how such a proceeding can be called legal in my case . " He said the words , quibbling about a technicality , because it seemed proper to say them now and here . Something sharpenedin Judge Ritchie 's eyes , the impersonal mask perceptibly wizened . " The court is not here to answer questions , but to hear from you any statement you may care to make regarding why you should not be sentenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request to be informed why I was not given a chance in the impaneling of the jury like that given defendants in similar cases , " Joe said . The judge leaned forward , his face and voice still impassive but his eyes like hot little augurs boring into Joe 's . " That assertion , or intimation , is entirely false ! " he said . He drew back again , and it came : " According to the laws of the state of Utah the penalty for murder in the first degree may be death by hanging , death by shooting , or life imprisonment . You have been found guilty of murder in the first degree , and have once already had the death penalty imposed upon you . In conformitywith the law , a prisoner sentenced to death may choose the manner of his death , as between shooting and hanging . Which do you choose ? " There was a remote ringing in Joe 's ears . He hated the cold control and the utter implacable power of the man on the bench . His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told you before , I 've been shot a number of times lately and I 'm getting used to it . " In the silence Judge Ritchie brought his gavel down lightly , for emphasis . " Joseph Hillstrom , for the crime of first degree murder of which you have been adjudged guilty , I sentence you to death by shooting , the execution to take place on Octoberfirst of this year within the walls of the state penitentiary , and I call upon the sheriff of Salt Lake County to make such arrangements as are necessary for the carrying out of this sen-tence . " The judge turned his head stonily aside . A hand caught Joe 's elbow , and Hilton was there , Job 's comforter , the undiscouraged , the indefatigable . Other hands were at him , Raleigh 's and Young 's , and he went out into the corridor surrounded , with Chief Barry ahead and Sheriff Coues behind . Hilton crowded with them into the elevator . " That pious old hypocrite ! " Hilton said . The police chief looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the tiled hall Joe kept looking for Ricket , Carpenter , any of the boys from the hall , but there was no sign of any of them . Either the threats Coues had spoken about were all in the imagination of the law , or deputies and cops had scoured the place in advance . Otherwise some of the boys should have been in court today . On the cement steps of the jail he stopped and said to Hilton , " What 's the date ? " " You mean today ? " " Yes . " " August second . " " August second , " Joe repeated . Two months , less one day . One more month of summer and the first month of the fall . Like a parade they went in , waited for the unlocking of the steel door , marched through . " There are some things we should settle , " Hilton said . " You feel like talking them over now , Joe ? " " Sure . " The chief 's huffy , sputtering voice said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I-Won't-Works to stay out of it . You can tell ' em from me that blackhand notes and bomb threats and all the rest wo n't get you or them a god damn thing , see ? We 're ready for ' em and if they start anything somebody 's going to get hurt . " " I have n't any control over the IWW , " Hilton said . " If you want to calm them down , maybe you 'd better revise Utah justice a little . " " All I want to say to you , " Barry said , " is that there 's enough justice in Utah to take care of any Wobbly that wants to start anything . " He turned on his heel . " Or any workingman without the means to defend himself , " Hilton said after him . " He 's got it bad , " he said to the sheriff . The sheriff looked as if his stomach pained him . " The governor 's been getting these threatening letters , " he said . " He 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His hand went into his sagging coat pocket and rattled the handcuffs there . " I know he 's been building a fire under me , " he said almost plaintively . " I supposeyour guys have to make a noise and beat on the tubs , but if they do n't behave I 'll have to run the whole bunch out of town . " " I would n't try , " Hilton told him . " Did you ever sit in on a free-speech fight ? " Waving the guard ahead of them down the corridor toward the conference room , the sheriff said , " That 's what I ca n't figure out . What in hell do all these outsiders know about it ? " Hilton rapidly stroked the tip of his nose between thumb and finger , and blew twice to clear some tickling obstruction . He looked at the sheriff and a hint of his courtroom manner came over him . " They do n't have to know anything about it but the name of the man who 's been framed . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great man in your bastille . " " Well , " Coues said with his mild country-preacher air , " I 'm willing to take your word for it . That 's fair , is n't it ? How about it , Joe ? "  | " Fair enough . " The sheriff let them into the conference room and locked them in and went away . " Well , that 's that , " Joe said . " Two months to live . " " Forty years to live ! " Hilton said . " They ca n't do it to you . I honestly think that if they try to carry out this sentence there 'll be ten thousand Wobs in Salt Lake to prevent it . They 'd take down this town brick by brick . " He sat down and spread his briefcase open between his feet and stopped to look into it , and his easy , big-toothed smile invitedJoe to confidence . " Now listen , " he said . " The next step will have to be the Pardon Board . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are certain things you want to hammer on ... " Joe listened , and tried to think the strategy important , but all during the twenty minutes of their talk he was wishing for the quiet and security of his cell . Utah State Prison Aug. 12 , 1915 Dear friend and fellow worker : Yours of August 5th at hand , and as you see I 've been moved to the state prison . The appeal was denied and I was up in court the other day and sentenced to be shot on the first day of October . We were all very much surprised at the decision , because we thought that I would be granted a new trial anyway . But as Judge Hilton says , " The records of the lower court are so rotten they have to be covered up somehow . " I wanted to drop the case right there and then , but from reports received from all parts of the country , I think it will be carried to the U.S. Supreme Court . I did n't think I 'd be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of cheap-this year . But I guess the organization thinks otherwise , and majority rule goes with me . Well , I do n't know anything new . Hoping you are successful in snaring the elusive doughnut , I remain , Yours for the OBU , JOE HILLp314HE NOTICED how they all watched him : the other prisoners , trusties in the corridors and yard with their careful voices and their sheathed eyes , the guards whose bored watchfulness sharpened with speculation . A kind of urgency and importunitywalked with him and dignified the guards who walked with him , made contemptible and unnecessary the handcuffs on either wrist . They had him manacled like a madman , as if he were likely to spring at the Pardon Board and tear their throats out . Both Hilton and Soren Christensen were waiting in the outer office . One after the other , they shook his manacled hand and smiled hard and encouraging into his face ; they appeared to be looking for the Pardon Board 's answer in his eyes . One of the guards unlocked himself and went away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chairs and sat down beside him . Before them Hilton planted himself with a thumb and forefinger in the pocket of his vest . He looked like some school-history-book picture of Webster replying to Hayne . But a closer look showed that his eyes were darkly bagged , his eyeballs streaked and watery as if he had been up all night reading fine print . " Well , Joe . " " Ninth inning , " Joe said . " Many a game 's been won in the ninth . " " I suppose . " They fell silent ; if there had been anything for the condemnedand his defenders to talk about the presence of the guard would have inhibited it . With a sigh Hilton sat down and stretched his legs . After a moment he took the folded newspaper from his pocket and passed it across the guard towardJoe . The guard stirred , looked questioningly at the law/yer , and then sagged back , acquiescing in the fiction that he was n't there . The paper was rolled with the back page out . Hilton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPRY IS THREATENEDMore than 300 letters and telegrams , received today , protest against Hillstrom Execution . One from Hindustan . Warnings and ArgumentsMore than 300 more letters from different parts of this and other countries were received at the governor 's office yesterday demanding that Joseph Hillstrom be not put to death for the murder of J. G. Morrison . Some of the letters are threatening in character , and many of them bear resemblance in phraseologyand arguments . It appears that most of the letters were written .. . The second guard came back . His eyes jumped from the paper to Joe 's face . " Whose paper ? " " Mine , " Hilton said . The guard took it from Joe and tossed it in Hilton 's lap . The lawyer shrugged and busied himself working at something between his teeth . " They 're ready , " the guard said . He led them into the warden'soffice , where a group of men sat between desk and windows . Turning at the guard 's tug , Joe saw that Ricket and Carpenter were there too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxer 's gesture . And here , as he sat down and got a chance to look quietly , were the men upon whom he depended for his life . One by one he marked them down : a shaggy man with a senatorial haircut , a solid square one with his hair parted in the middle and a womanish red mouth , a thin old man , a much younger one who sat with his hands clasped on the desk and studied Joe directly and soberly . And the chairman , the governor , complete with gavel and briefcase . A man ready with pencil and paper  --  apparently a stenographer  --  who sat just behind the governor . Joe wondered what the governor was thinking.  |p316He  wondered what he thought about Joe Hill , for whom three hundred people every day wrote from countries as remote as Hindustan . When the-governor 's . eyes touched his he sat stiff and proud , a man more widely known and more fervently admiredthan any of the well-fed well-educated men who would judge him . The governor 's gavel tapped the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around defendant and attorneys and the board itself , and came back to Hilton . " Mr. Hilton , you have a plea to make before this board ? " Hilton rose , the indefatigable , the undiscourageable , as he had risen before other tribunals and other boards through all the steps of Joe Hill 's fight for life , and Joe felt how all the past failures rose with him , how Hilton this time was at bay and perhaps without hope . His voice was harsh and his words angry as he went through the arguments that Joe knew now by heart . The arguments sounded to Joe 's critically tuned ear like inconsequential graspings at straws , the lawyer 's anger seemed general and unimportant . He was apparently denouncingthe Pardon Board for the District Court 's errors in selecting jurymen . He was annoyed at the whole state of Utah because his client had been left for a time without counsel and had been forced by the court to accept the services of counsel who were not to his liking . Remote as a spectator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of counsel . Had n't Mr. Hilton 's client selected Attorneys Scott and McDougall himself , or at least had not his friends of the IWW defense committee selected them ? And as for his being without counsel at one time during the trial , was n't that by his own choice ? Hilton demanded a new trial . There were errors and decisionsof the District Court that stank to high heaven of prejudice , there were irregularities enough to warrant ten new trials . The evidence on which Joseph Hillstrom had been convicted was entirely circumstantial , as the court records showed . And capital punishment , especially capital punishment upon purely circumstantial evidence , was a barbarity unworthy a civilizedp317state . He tasked a commutation of the death penalty against Joseph Hillstrom on grounds of a reasonable doubt of his guilt . " Just a moment , Mr. Hilton , " the square board member said . " Are you asking for a new trial , or for commutation ? " " My client would prefer a new trial , " Hilton said . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be granted him . " He went on with his brief of the court errors , both in the District Court and in the Supreme Court , and Joe , watching the board members , most of whom were also members of the Supreme Court , saw their eyes wander , their hands cover their careful mouths . Hilton was getting nowhere . Finally he was interrupted again by the governor , who asked him why he had not filed a petition for a rehearing if he ' felt that the Supreme Court had committed errors of law . Hilton replied that the state of Utah would be forever blackened if it permitted the defendant to go to his death after a conviction on purely circumstantial evidence , and he cited a half-dozen cases in which the innocence of the accused had been established too late . The young jurist who watched Joe like someone trying torecognizea half-familiar face , turned his head to tell Hilton that in the opinion of the Supreme Court the evidence had been by no means all circumstantial , and that the identification of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store and as the man who ran from the store after the shooting was direct and explicit . It had begun to rain outside . Across Ricket 's bulk Joe saw the streaked air beyond the gray window . The governor 's mouth was impatient or irritated . It occurred to Joe that he might be scared , and the thought was delicious as a cold drink to a thirsty man . He might be thinking of his family at home right now , exposed to IWW retaliation if Joe Hill were not pardoned here this morning . He might be scared for his own hide , and so might the rest of them . Three hundred letters a day , thousands of them altogether  --  and in the scared little bourgeois minds of people like these the IWW was a nest of dynamiters and desperate bomb throwers . Every IWW had hisp318pockets full of blasting powder and home-made bombs . He knew from his mail that the accomplices of the McNamara boys were up for trial right now in L.A. , and that bombs , perhaps planted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York hall . No wonder the board members were sober . They were scared stiff . They had a tiger by the tail . A little reverie hooded him . He saw himself walking out of the Utah State Pen into the midst of an exulting crowd that marched with banners down Twenty-First South and jammed the streets of Sugarhouse and roared out the songs of Joe Hill as they hoisted him to their shoulders . He felt how their hands came grabbing for his own , and saw their faces by the hundredAnd came out of it to hear the governor snap at Hilton , " Mr. Hilton , you have spoken this morning in uncomplimentary terms of the courts and justice of the state of Utah , and you have spoken slightingly of the integrity of the gentlemen present here . For some reason , perhaps for lack of anything better , you have adopted your client 's contention that he is innocent until proved guilty and that his refusal to take the stand and testify in his own behalf should not be held against him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think was not . That is the conclusion of those of us who have carefully reviewed the transcripts of the District Court . But you are acquainted with the law , as your client is not , and you should know that once a conviction has been obtained in that court , then the presumption of innocence is no longer valid . If you have evidence to establish your client 's innocence we are prepared to hear it . The burden of proof is now upon the accused . And let me remind you again , the powers of this board are limited . It can not grant the accused a new trial . It can only commute his sentence or grant him a pardon , and it can do those only upon clear evidence . " Standing thoughtful , with bent head , Hilton delayed his answer , and Joe saw that he was silent because for the moment he was utterly stumped for something to say . He had never had anything to say to the pardon board . The tirade he hadp319read for a half-hour had been a last-ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched Hilton rally himself , raise his head , start all over again . " In view of the irregularities and errors of law ... " " Specifically what errors of law ? " a judge asked sharply . " The calling of jurors instead of impaneling them in theregular way . " " The records do not show that , Mr. Hilton . The Supreme Court considered that claim carefully in reviewing your appeal . " " Nevertheless if we are granted a new trial I am confident that we shall be able to show ... " " Let me remind you again , " the governor said icily . " You are pleading before the Board of Pardons . This board can not grant a new trial if it wanted to . It is here to hear evidence , if you have any . " " Your excellency , " Hilton said , " I think you have the good name of the state of Utah at heart . I think you would not want to see that good name blackened by a cold-blooded judicialmurder . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His cheeks tightened until an unexpected round knob of muscle bulged at the angle of his jaws . His mouth was small and hard . " Mr. Hilton , for the last time , we are here to listen to evidence , not vilification or threats . There has been altogethertoo much of both in this case already . If you have no real and actual evidence to offer , please sit down . " Jud Ricket was on his feet . " Mr. Governor ... " The governor slammed the gavel on the desk , his jaws clamped hard , and Ricket eased himself down into his chair again . The young jurist who had been watching Joe so intently leaned and said something in a whisper . The governor listened with his eyes cold . " Mr. McCarthy has the floor , " he said . Now it was no longer possible to be a remote and curious spectator . McCarthy 's gray eyes pulled Joe into alertness , forced him to attend and concentrate . Joe braced himselfp320against some weight of intelligence or power he felt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evading McCarthy 's glance , he had been aware of him all the time . Of all the board members he had been least upset by Hilton 's tirade ; he seemed to Joe more dangerous for that reason . And he compelledthe discussion back into personal channels . It was impossible to evade him any longer , or to dream while his fate was decided . " I want to ask a few questions directly of Mr. Hillstrom , " McCarthy said . " You understand that your case has become in the public eye something more than the trial of an individualon a murder charge . Your friends have represented you as being framed by certain industrial interests because of your activity as an IWW organizer . " Joe faced him , saying nothing . " I think I speak for the other members of the board as well as myself , " McCarthy said . " They will correct me if I do not . But I think the last thing any responsible official of the state of Utah wants is the death of an innocent man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the part in McCarthy 's curly dark hair . " But no official can be moved by threats , " the justice said . " Your friends are ill-advised in the campaign they have started . They have already done your cause harm . " Joe shrugged . He knew his part ; he knew how the lines must go . " I ca n't help what other people think of Utah jus-tice . " Something had been offered and refused . He felt in himself a kind of gathering such as he sometimes had felt before an intense physical effort . Straight as a stick , wooden-faced , he confronted the steady gray eyes . " I am aware of that , " McCarthy said , unmoved . " Despite what has been said about Utah justice , every member of this board is beyond thinking you guilty because your friends have made irresponsible threats . It is your guilt , or your innocence , that we are concerned with . " Just for an instant some obscure impatience seemed to flarep321in him . He drummed his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have refused to testify in your own defense . If you wanted to throw doubt upon the decision of the court , I presume you have succeeded . I think you have also succeeded in embarrassing your attorneys and your friends , by asking them to defend you without the materials to make a case . " " I did n't ask them to defend me , " Joe said through his teeth , holding McCarthy 's eyes . It was coming out in the open now . " Perhaps not , " the justice said . " That 's between you and them . What is at stake now is your life . If you are innocent , as you have persistently claimed , this is your last chance to prove it . " " I 've told you all it was up to you to prove I 'm guilty , " Joe said . " If your law and your justice is worth anything , why does n't it live up to its claims ? " He let his hate pour out through his eyes at this one lawyer-mouthed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he obscurely hoped to , force McCarthy to anger . The man looked at him coolly , with an intolerable quiet . " Your counsel has been corrected on that point . You have been convicted on evidence in a trial that the reviewing court found impartial . At this point you are guilty unless you prove your innocence . " His white finger tapped the desk , he held Joe to the duel of eyes . " You doubt the integrity of this board . Here is what the board will do . If you will , in strictest confidence , tell any two members of it the circumstances under which you were shot , and to their satisfaction prove what you say , the board is ready to pardon you instantly without making the evidence public . What you tell will never go any farther , even to the other members of the board . " Joe braced himself against a feeling like slipping in loose sand . His insides twisted ; with a suddenness as if something had been thrown in his face he felt himself go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him , and he saw that some of them hated and feared him and would be glad of his death , but that McCarthy did not hate him . McCarthy mightp322demand his death , but McCarthy did not hate him . But he knew his part ; he knew what words must be said . From a tight throat he said , " I do n't want a pardon . I want a complete vindication or nothing . I want a new trial . " " We 're past that stage , " McCarthy said . " The board is giving you a chance at life , Mr. Hillstrom . " The internal shaking had worked outward until it trembled in Joe 's hands and shoulders and knees ; his throat was clamped as if in paralysis . For a long time he stood before them and said nothing , while Hilton and Ricket went quickly to the desk and leaned over it and talked in quick sentences with McCarthyand the governor . But when their bodies moved aside again McCarthy 's eyes were on him as if nothing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that infuriated him ; they could not be made angry . If there was any expression in them now aside from McCarthy 's judicial calm it was pity , and the very thought that he was being pitied scalded Joe 's mind . He twisted his hard mouth . " I said I 'd get a new trial or die trying . I guess I 'll have to die trying . " Ricket and Hilton and Christensen pulled him aside . Their faces were anxious and he heard their anxious words : " .. . last chance . . . . could n't do her any harm . . . think they mean it . . . would n't get out . . . " But he pulled away from them and turned , seeking the eyes of McCarthy . All the rest of them he ignored . It was to McCarthy that he had to justify himself , McCarthy who had to be challenged and defied . " I wo n't tell you anything , " he said hotly . " It 's not up to me to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't have been convicted on such flimsy evidence . I wo n't take any offers and I do n't want a pardon . I want a new trial or nothing . " Hilton 's restraining hand dropped from his arm ; he saw the expressive weary lift of the lawyer 's shoulders as he turned away , but he saw them only from the corner of his eye . His glance was still leveled like a spear with McCarthy 's . He drew himself straighter until he was rigid.  | " I want to die a martyr , " he said . The words were like the striking of a light , for having said them he knew that they were true , and had been true from the beginning . So he stalemated them with his defiance , and though he was the pawn of forces , furiously defended by one side and stubbornlyand repeatedly condemned by the other , yet he imposedhis will on them . He imposed it even on Justice McCarthy , who was not like the others on that board . The Pardon Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desperate contentious confused brief , but it was Joe Hill who decided his own fate , and he left his lawyers pleading not with the board but with him . At a certain point they dismissed him ( but he knew that even their dismissal was an act of helplessness ) and manacled him like a maniac again , and stripped him and frisked his clothes and body for possible weapons , possible escape tools , that might have been slipped to him by his friends in the meeting . Just before noon , aggrandized by his company , two guards took him back to a new cell in the maximum-security section . He brought his defiance and pride back with him , and he sat with them all the rest of that day . Admiration for his own devious cunning moved him ; he felt an awed wonder at the way events had built toward this precise and inevitable end , all the while that he and his friends had been apparently trying to move them in quite another direction . In his thoughts he defied the Pardon Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to condemn or forgive . " I do n't want a commutation or pardon , I want a completevindication or nothing , " he had said to them . Playing the words over and over to himself now to test them for flaws and for anything that might ring false to the legendary resolutionof Joe Hill , he found them exactly right . " I said I would get a new trial or die trying , " he told them again , and rubbed his closely barbered head and smiled . Hep324thought of writing a song or poem to express the defiant excitement he felt , the wonderful exhilarated feeling of everything'sbeing settled , but he could not sit still to the job . The thought of Otto , ducking in flight from the law , filled him with contempt . He thought , That cheap yegg ! but he glanced sideways in memory at the times when he himself had run , all the times when he had convinced himself that he was more useful outside a jail , and working , than inside at the mercy of the bosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind were nights of doubling and slinking in streets and alleys and freight yards , the watchful progress up and down the coast on the S.P. , the panicked scattering in the sun and dust at Oatfield . He knew what Fuzzy Llewellyn had seen , standing on his unshaken soap box above the melee and baring his gopher teeth , staring into some vision more meaningful than the dead and the afraid . Duty and a grander opportunity lay where Fuzzy had been looking while Joe Hill fled . The shame of that flight , always with him and always repudiated , he recognized and accepted now , because here he stood where Fuzzy had stood , saying what Fuzzy had said . " I 'll stick here . " What a continent a man could cross with that one little step ! He wondered at it and at himself , feeling in his mind for combinations of steadfast words to say for himself and others how it felt . For supper , ignoring the meal they brought him , he ate his thoughts , and he took them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light : a year and a half in jail and prison had taught him that . But he was still unused to the iron , hollow , reverberant ring of this particular prison , the empty echo that steps made , and he felt the isolation of the empty cell block . He was all alone in this section . All that ever reached him from the other prisoners was a faint drumlike hum , or the clang of their feet on the steel floor as they marched out to work or exercise or meals . Now in the light of nighttime that he pretended was darkness , closing his eyes against the cell that was like each of the other cells they had moved him to , he heard only the soundsp325of his own imprisonment , the footsteps of guards , the clack of keys , the mutter of talk at the head of the stairs . In all the prison he was the only capital prisoner , the only one awaiting death . In his bed he felt his lonely distinction . This blaze of light was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates that grated and opened and closed again were measures against his escape . He was the man they feared and would kill , and outside thousands of people wrote angry letters in his defense , and in Australia stevedores were refusing to load American ships because of the trumped-up charges against Joe Hill . A letter to the people of Utah began to grow in his mind  --  to the people of Utah and through them to the world . Craftily he assembled all the contradictory last-ditch arguments that Hilton had had to use : the irregular jurymen , the period when he was left without counsel , the prejudice in the public mind and the public press because the defendant was an IWW organizer . These were evasions and he recognized them clearly as what they were , but they belonged , no matter how widely they avoided the essential problem of his guilt or innocence . He stressed the fact that his past life must have been clean or the prosecution would have brought it up against him . He emphasized his only other time in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike that police and courts had cooperatedto break . At some time during the night he got up and wrote for an hour , putting down thoughts that came to him . After he had lain down again he groped through a drowsy indeterminate time for some ringing conclusion , some line that would echo and be quoted and stir the admiration of people who read it . When he finally found it , it opened his eyes abruptly onto the lighted bare familiarity of the cell , and he lay on his back trying it out with an exultant certainty that it was exactly what he wanted . He added it to the bottom of his letter to the world : " I have lived like an artist ; I shall die like an artist . " Into his recollection like something seen from the corner ofp326the eye sneaked the image of the two clerks in the music store . He turned away from it in disgust , as he would have turned upwind to head a bad smell . Someone had to be seen , some move had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he could not tell what , though the knowledge lay just beyond sight or reach . Frantically , tied down by a hundred cords , he struggled to stand up . Furiously he pushed against the inert bodies of thousands who hemmed him in and shut him away from where he had to be . Madly he hurried ahead of something that whipped him with anxiety , and the farther he hurried the more those who now accompanied him fell away , dropping away one by one until he went alone . The wind was at him in gusts , so that he struggled with his eyes streaming and dim , straining to see . Until all at once the wind dropped , the road ended , the urgency behind him quietly vanished . In an enormous silence he stood all by himself , and saw a ladder he must climb . It rose above him higher than a skyscraper , higher than the overhangingiron rungs that went up the stacks at Anaconda or Great Falls , a runged ladder curving upward , belling out and up and out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going up beyond the clouds . The mere thought of starting up it brought his heart like a stone to the bottom of his chest cavity . He stared upward , appalled , and the longer he looked the more a still terror overcame him . He was dwarfed by the enormous thing he had to climb . As the terror settled over him he shrank , his throat grew tight and his breath difficult , his arms were frail sticks , as helpless as if no fingers were attached . He wondered in terror how he would take hold of the rungs without fingers , and how he would get a foothold with feet that now were pegs of wood . But the thing whose name he knew and could not say was at the top of the ladder , lost far up in the dome from which came a wind as cold as if off an icefield . He saw that he was naked ; the cold paralyzed his bones . And he knew that a shriek would set him free . But when he tried to scream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of houses ; his tongue could not move though he burst his heart in terror and strain . And now the thing whose name he knew but would not say was descending in even , untroubled spirals , the ladder weavinglike a flower on its stem , its top describing circles in the sky , at first tiny as dots , but growing and looping outward , descending and toppling upon him , and he fought madly for wind , for voiceAnd woke , panting , slippery with cold sweat , to look into the light in the corridor ceiling and hear the iron tick of silence . He lay breathing deeply through his mouth , telling his heart to slow down , but the empty brightness without a single sound was more terrible than the spiraling void of his dream , far more terrible than darkness . Gray-white steel , stark shadows , the stare of unrelieved and inescapable light , made a world as geometric and unarguable as the world of nightmare . Among enormous triangles and stretching rhomboidsand parallels reaching to infinity across the little box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of an insanely complex trap , and felt his little life thud thud thud against its cage . It was a long time  --  five minutes , a half-hour  --  before a guard moved along the outside corridor and sent the vibration of his steps through the steel floor . Joe sat up and rubbed with the blanket along his wet arms and wrists . He felt weak and nauseated , and he hated the skinniness of his arms . He said to himself in indignation and concern , They 've left me nothing but skin and bones . The guard 's steps died out , and the silence lay there , the terrible loneliness remained . More than he had ever wanted anything he wanted to talk to a friend , anyone who knew and trusted and understood him . He could talk for twenty-four hours straight ; there was enough to talk about to keep him going for a week . Just to sit with somebody and drink coffee and talk and talk and talk . When the guard 's regular inspection time came round andp328the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the guard 's face looked in through his bars , Joe was sitting up on the cot . Without hesitation he said , " Can I send a telegram ? " " In the morning . " " I want to send one now . " " You can give it to me now . I wo n't send it till I go off shift , though . " " Well , all right . " He grabbed up a piece of paper and a pencil and scribbled a wire to Lund in Weosha , Minnesota . It said , " If you can , I 'd like you to come . " Then for a long time after the guard went away he lay wondering if Lund would do it . It was a big thing to ask . Lund was a farmer now . He 'd be right in the middle of the harvest season . He would n't come . He 'd wire or write some excuse . But he had to come . They had to talk . Not many days were left . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one he had always been able to talk with most freely . But suppose he did come , how would they manage it ? They might not even permit visitors on regular visiting days when a man was as close to the end as he was . The way they were moving him to a different cell every day , they might keep him in close solitary the last week or ten days . Maybe a last request . He could ask for Lund as his spiritual adviser . A condemned man had a right to that . They would let some prison chaplain come in and irritate a man all his last night with prayers and exhortations , so they ought to let in some preacher that a man could really talk to . His mind went feverish with plans and sleights and arguments and pleas . If they would n't let Lund come in , or give them a decent chance to talk , they were . . . In his mind a squared calendar was posted , and he saw the clear solid week and the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic to think that possibly there would not be timep329for Lund to get there . Perhaps he would delay , not knowing the date was so close . Sweat like the flushing sweat of sicknessbroke out of him again . He caught himself on the very verge of whimpering aloud . JOE Hu , L had a week to live when Lund arrived in Salt Lake . It was a Friday afternoon , a golden , mellow day , the sort of day that would be like ripe summer until around four o'clock , and then would haze and blur as the sun dropped , the air bluing with afternoon , sharpening toward crispness , the smell of fires hanging in the air until by six o'clock it would be an autumn dusk , with street lamps yellow at the corners and sidewalksobscure under the still-dense shadows of trees and the smells now not the peaty , moist smells of sprinkled lawns and the summer smell of wetted dust , but the cured-leaf and smoke smells of fall . Even at midday , walking up from the station with his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat to his face , Lund saw that autumn had already come down the mountain slopes in scarlet and bronze and toned brown . He had a fancy that it lay there like a threat , though he had always held fall to be his favorite season . The sight of the slow fume of color at the city 's edges , like somethingfurtively creeping in upon the town , deepened his feeling of helplessness . He was a man come a full week early for a funeral , doomed to attend every clock tick until daybreak on October first . From his close following of newspaper accounts , he knew that visitors were permitted at the prison only on Sunday afternoons . As before , he was here in Salt Lake with time to kill before he could see Joe . He did not assume that there were any other steps that Joe 's lawyers could take , now that thep330Pardon Board had refused commutation . Joe was like a checker player , outnumbered and pursued by kings , who ducks and escapes into a double corner where he makes fruitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuers . The delaying moves were all over . There would be nothing to learn from the IWW hall this time , but he went there anyway . He found Jud Ricket in the office next door , an extra room rented to take care of the Defense Committee 's activities , heaved back in the chair and idly rolling his tremendous brasscappedpencil between his palms . The automatic nervous twitch had grown on him in the more than a year since Lund had last seen him . It moved the corner of his mouth twice as he sat abstractedly staring , and moved it again quickly when he looked up and saw Lund in the door . " Yes ? " " You do n't remember me , " Lund said " I 'm a friend of Joe 's . Lund . I was through here last year for a couple of days . " " Oh sure ! We 've got your contributions . " He reached and shook hands and pulled Lund inside so that he saw another man in the room , a graying man , frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of character with his sagging sedentary body . " You know judge Hilton ? " Ricket said . Hilton 's hand was narrow and fragile after Ricket 's big paw . He seemed withdrawn and thoughtful . In three minutes he looked twice at his watch . " On your way back to the coast ? " Ricket asked . " No , " Lund said . " Joe sent for me . " They both gave him their instant , speculative attention . " He did ? " " Four days ago . He wired me . " " The day he went before the Pardon Board , " Hilton said . " Did he say what he wanted ? Have you talked to him ? " " I have n't tried . I thought visiting hours were only on Sun-days . " " They are . He did n't say what he wanted ? " " Just that he 'd like me to come . "  | " I conferred with him yesterday , ' Hilton said . " It 's funny he did n't say anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He knew of no possible reason for Joe 's wire except desperation . It had sounded like a cry for help , and he did not like to think of Joe so borne down that he would bend his pride that far . He looked down at his swinging shoe , and up again when Hilton spoke . " Do you know something about Joe 's case ? " " I 've read the papers , that 's all . " " Because if you do , you 'd better tell it now . There is n't much time . " His eyes were pouched like a hound 's . From above sagging lower lids the hazel irises looked out with a remote and uninterestedair that matched the frowning thrust of the rest of his face no better than his face matched his body . " I do n't know anything , " Lund said . " I have n't even had a letter lately . " The lawyer looked at his watch again , his attention already turned away . " You know what he did to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something comes over him and he goes crazy . I do n't know . " " We had it all planned , " Ricket said . " The judge asked for everything , new trial , pardon , commutation , the whole works at once . They 've been getting letters by the thousand , they 're all excited and worried , and they know damn well if they execute Joe they 'll have some kind of an explosion . I think they 'd give anything to get out of it whole . So we asked for everything , and hoped to get a commutation because the evidence was all circumstantial . But right when Judge McCarthyis practically begging him to give them a good excuse to turn him loose , he gets on his high horse and wo n't take anything but a complete whitewash . So they turn him down . " Hilton grunted . " He wants to die a martyr , he says . " In the next office Lund heard the regular sound of the press . " Is there any chance ? Anything else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hound eyes staringp332at nothing out in the hall . " Pressure . More letters . Public indignation . Maybe we can scare ' em enough so he gets a lastminutepardon whether he wants it or not . " " I hoped the woman might speak up and clear him when she saw he would n't be freed otherwise . " They both moved their hands . Ricket said , " If there 's a woman , she wo n't show now . " " Nobody knows anything ! " Hilton said angrily . " He 's been at cross-purposes with his counsel ever since the trial began . " " Well , cheer up , " Ricket said . " Those letters are coming in twice as fast as ever . You never saw such a response . If we can get a big enough public protest , we can force Spry to grant a stay , at least . " " One thing , " Hilton said . " If they shoot Joe I would n't want to be Spry . " " Retaliation ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they are now and nobody 's going to keep them in bounds . " " I wonder if all these threats do n't do Joe harm , and harden the authorities against him ? " Lund said . But all he got was Ricket 's obsidian glance and phantasmal one-sided smile . " Got any other suggestions ? " They were silent . Lund heard feet clattering down the brassboundtreads of the stair . Other steps came up more slowly , came up the hall and hesitated . He looked over his shoulder to the doorway and saw Ingrid Olson standing there . A single question , an alert concentration of interest , pulled all three of them to their feet , Lund knew precisely how Ricket and Hilton had felt momentarily at the news of Joe 's wire . An answer might lie behind any out-of-the-way fact . The girl 's presence here now might mean something important . Her eyes were dark , her long white hands nervous . Without greeting , she recognized and acknowledged Lund , but her eyes went back immediately to the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do for you ? " " There did n't seem to be , anything more that could be done , " she said . " I thought . . . "  | " Come in , " Hilton said . " Sit down . " He held a chair for her at the cluttered table , and something in his face made her sit down quickly with her cheeks flaming . " My name is Ingrid Olson , " she said . " Yes , I know . " Watching her as keenly as the others , Lund saw enough in her face to be convinced that she was incapable of dishonesty and that she was unlikely to have anything important to tell . But he watched her face with the blush paling almost instantly under the transparent skin , and he wished with a hard quick brutality that she might be guiltily involved . " Well ? " Hilton said . Impassive as a rock except for the fleeting tic at the corner of his lips , Ricket put out a foot and shoved the hall door shut . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her purse . Massed tears glittered suddenly in her eyes . " It is n't what you hope it is , " she said almost sullenly . " It 's just . . . Joe and I grew up in the same town in Sweden . His mother was a friend of my mother 's . " With his finger and thumb deep in his vest pocket , Hilton stood before her . " Yes ? " " Joe 's father and mother were n't married , " she said . The lawyer moved his lips slightly . A shadowy frown had started to tighten between his eyes . " Yes ? " he said , more sharply . " Mother and I talked it over , " Ingrid said . She had better control of her voice now ; she spoke more plainly , less in a hurried breathless rush . " We thought maybe if it was known who Joe 's father is . His mother was just a seamstress in Gefle , but his father is important . He 's a politician now , a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something . " Hilton 's fingers tapped on the table . He looked out the window and a flatted , breathy whistle emerged from his puckered lips . Still looking out the window he said , " Is Joe still a Swedish citizen ? " " I think so , yes . "  | " Does he know who his father is ? " " Oh yes . " " That god damn clam ! " Ricket said . Hilton had a notebook out . " What 's his father 's name ? " " Hegglund . " That brought Lund leaning forward in surprise . " Sven Hegglund ? " " Yes . " " You know him ? " Hilton said . " I 've heard of him , " Lund said . " He 's well known . He 'd have weight . " Hilton was already back at Ingrid . " What 's the name of this town in Sweden ? " " Gefle . " " Who 'd be the head man there ? What 'd he be ? Mayor , burgermeister , what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That wo n't matter . We 'll find out and get a cable to him tonight . Who 's Sweden 's Minister to this country ? " " Ekengren , " Lund said . Excitement had touched them all . Both Hilton and Ricket were standing . The girl looked from one to the other and moistened her lips . " Do you think something can be done ? " " Not much , " Hilton said . His voice boomed and filled the office . " Not very much . This might just save Joe 's life , that 's all . " She went so pale that Lund was afraid she might faint , and then her skin burned a fiery red as she stood up among them . " What . . . how will you do it ? " " There 's a Swedish vice-consul here , " Ricket put in , but Hilton waved him impatiently down . " We wo n't fool with any flunkeys . Look . We cable the burgermeister , or whatever he is , that a boy from his town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him to do what he can . We wire the Minister , or better yet we wire Virginia to go see him in Washington . She 's in New York , shep335can run down . We get the Minister to intercede . Through him we work on Wilson ... " " The President ? " Ingrid said , with her eyes widening . " Exactly . The President . This thing has got international implications . Wilson ca n't afford to overlook a frame-up that involves organized labor , and he ca n't permit it if it might get us in bad with a friendly foreign state . He 's got to intervene . All the pressure we could apply up to now has been through working stiffs who could n't spell . Wait till Spry starts getting letters on White House stationery or with diplomatic franks ! " He took Ingrid by the shoulders and shook her with a kind of slow violence . " Thanks , many thanks ! My God , imagine if we had n't found this out till it was too late to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . We 'll have to break our necks . You go on home and if we need you we 'll let you know . All right ? " " All right . Only ... " " What ? " " What about Joe ? " she said . " He hates his father . He would n't take a favor from him even to save his life . " The lawyer looked at Ricket and rubbed at the thin gray hair on the back of his head . He said , suddenly soft in his manner , " You 're afraid he 'll be down on you for telling . " " Yes , " she said directly . Hilton walked to the window and back , moving the change in his vest pocket with thumb and finger . " What 's the alternative ? " he said at last . " That 's the only way you can look at it . I imagine I 've had as much experience with Joe 's pride as anybody . But if we submit to his pride in this he 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered her purse against her , nodded again in a motion that included not only the three of them but all the inevitabilities of the situation , and went out . Halfway down the stairs they heard her footsteps become a quick hurrying patter . Hilton had flung himself down and was already composingp336a cable . In the midst of an impatient scribble he looked up and said , " You 're going to see Joe Sunday . " " I expect so . " " He 'd better not be told what we 're doing . " " Can it be kept from him ? " " For a while , maybe altogether . I do n't want him throwing any tantrums and spoiling this . The best thing he can do right now is sit there in his cell and write poems . " " Well , " Lund said , " I suppose he must have something to say to me or he would n't have wired . I 'll limit myself to that . " " What about this Hegglund ? " Ricket said . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just deny he ever heard of Joe . " " He would if it came out publicly . My God , you would n't go at him with a meat axe . He 's going to hear this very confidentiallyas a whisper from the Minister or somebody , all very discreet . For all anybody needs to know , we 're taking it to the Swedes because Joe 's a Swedish citizen . " " We can line up the Swedish labor unions , too , " Ricket said . " And the Young Socialists . Joe used to be one , he still wears that gambler tie of theirs . I 'd better get off a cable to them too . " He clapped Lund across the back and came out in the hall with him , and as they walked toward the stairs he swung his mallet fist gently and knocked it on the wall at every other step . He was looking off beyond somewhere , a mile or two past the stairs , and he said , " Can you imagine this working out any better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a backwoods burg and bingo , they get a public uproar as if they 'd collared John D. He turns out to have friends , he turns out to be a name you can rally support around , he 's a poet , now he 's the son of a Swedish big-wig . " His knuckles rattled along the wainscot . " An international stage . It could n't have been planned prettier . " " Joe might not like it handled this way . " " He 's in no position to squawk . " No , Lund thought as he went back toward his hotel . Joe wasp337not in a position to squawk . If he did n't want the fact of his parentage used to save him , what could he do about it ? A dozen kinds of people wanted to save him for a dozen differentreasons , because they loved him , because they hated capitalpunishment , because they thought him unjustly accused , because he was a Swede , because he was a workingman , because he was an IWW , because he had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense committeeand Joe could be built up as a symbol and a martyr , and except when he was personally brought forward , as before the Pardon Board , he was helpless to approve or disapprove . The best thing he could do for the next week would be to sit in his cell and write poems . And what had been in his mind when he wired ? A wish to tell things that up to now he had kept hidden ? And would he tell them to a friend though he refused to tell them to the Pardon Board and save his life ? Or had he , simply and desperately , called for help when he knew his last hope was gone ? In his room after dinner he spent a long time over the eveningpaper . The IWW had practically taken over the front page , crowding out the war , crowding out everything . There were IWW-led strikes in Colorado and Montana . Railroad detectives had dispersed a march of disgruntled harvest workersin Aberdeen , South Dakota . In New York there had been a brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Rockefeller . An IWW speaker in Denver had said that the blood of the innocent victims of the Ludlow massacre would stain the name of Rockefeller forever . The national guard was still out in three Colorado camps and a mass meeting in sympathy for the strikers had been refused a permit by the Denver city authorities . And there were two items on the Joe Hill case . There was a release from the governor of the text of several of the letters he had received . One said that there would be ten thousand IWW marching on Salt Lake from all parts of the West if the state of Utah persisted in its bloody plan to murder Joe Hill . Another advised the governor to look to his own family ; there were men who would see to it thatp338two lives in his own immediate family would be taken if Joe Hill died . The other item was a long statement from Joe Hill himself to the Pardon Board . Lund read it , and read it again , ponderingevery paragraph , trying to extract from the text some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines , that would unequivocally reveal Joe 's state of mind . For this statementto the Pardon Board was the statement of an innocent man who wanted to live ; it contained no heroics about wanting to die a martyr . But there were too many statements that Lund could not verify , too many which contradicted the evidence of witnesses or the reports of the papers , and he had no way of telling which was the truth . He could not even tell whether Joe 's logic was honest or specious , and in the end he was left wondering whether the document was really designed to convince , or whether it was an elaborate and enigmatic hoax . Its whole burden was the demand for a new trial  --  a demand which Joe knew was hopeless . Though he seemed to plead for his life , he took the same position he had taken before the board . He was not interested in a commutation or a pardon . Since he had already assaulted the board with a demand that was out of its jurisdiction , and been refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it over again for the press and the public ? " I want to die a martyr , " he had said before the board . " The cause I represent means more than any individual 's life , includingmy own . " But what cause ? Labor 's ? If one could grant the premise of a frame-up , yes , but Lund had never been able to grant that premise . He had been too close to Ricket and the forces which had created the whole myth . There was not a thread of evidence that anyone had even known who Joe Hillstrom was until Ricket himself began to go to work . There was some deception , or self-deception , even in this final statement from the death house . Unhappily Lund bent his head and read the whole statement for the third time :  |p339When  I was up before the highest authorities of the State of Utah I stated that I wanted a new trial and nothing but a new trial , and I will now try to state some reasons why I am entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past record has nothing to do with the facts of this case , I will not dwell upon that subject beyond saying that I have worked all my life as a mechanic and at times as a musician . The mere fact that the prosecution never attempted to assail my reputation proves that it is clean . I will therefore commence at the time of my arrest . On the night of January 14 , 1914 , I was lying in a bed at the Erickson house in Murray , a town located seven miles from Salt Lake City , suffering from a bullet wound in my chest . Where or why I got that wound is nobody 's business but my own . I know that I was not shot in the Morrison store and all the so-called evidence that is supposed to show that I was is fabrication pure and simple . As I was lying there half asleep , I was aroused by a knock on the door . Somebody opened the door and in came four men with revolvers in their hands . A shot rang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder and penetrating my right hand through the knuckles , crippling me up for life . There was absolutely no need of shooting me at that time because I was helpless as a baby and had no weapons of any kind . The only thing that saved my life at that time was the officer 's inefficiencywith firearms . I was then brought up to the county jail where I was given a bunk and went to sleep immediately . The next morning I was pretty sore on account of being shot in three places . I asked to be taken to a hospital but was instead taken upstairs to a solitary cell and told that I was charged with murder and had better confess right away . I did not know anything about any murder and told them so . They still insisted that I confess , and told me they would take me to a hospital and " treat me white " if I did . I told them I knew nothing of any murder . They called me a liar , and after that I refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for three or four days I was hovering between life and death , and I **27;5221;TOOLONG purchased from the news agent , who maintained a place of business in one of the second-class coaches ahead . However , a Syrian family aboard had enormous baskets of cold meats , cheeses , bread and fruit . They insisted that all fellow-travelers in the Pullman share breakfast with them . I went forward to the news agent 's department and purchased a case of beer to go with the breakfast , although in locating the same I was compelled to traversethe lengths of the first- and second-class coaches , with their accompanying odor of orange pee , perspiration , sour urine and unwashed diapers . Returning to the Pullman , I found that a young Mexican couple had produced a shoe-box full of cold fried chicken . Someone else brought hot coffee for those who did not care for beer with their first meal of the day . All of the assets of the community being thus pooled were declared to be the commonproperty of all of the inhabitants of the Pullman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of repast as an innovationand nominated it " Community Brunch . " Few , if any , understood him , but all applauded politely . Some time during the middle of the morning , I deemed it advisable to visit the news agent again to get another little bottle of beer to settle my stomach . With some difficulty I made my way back to the Pullman . The aisles through the coaches were narrow and my progress was often impeded by bags , boxes or feet protruding from their respectiveproper places beneath the seats . Upon one occasion I fear that I stepped upon the foot of a rather elderly lady , and wishing to apologize , I murmured " Excusado , " which , as I remembered , was the Spanish word for " excuse me , " but which I later learned is the literal translation of the word " toilet . " She did not reply , and I continued on my way . Arriving at the Pullman , I discovered that Bill , one of the Syrian gentlemen , the train conductor and the Pullman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange game of cards called " perro Colorado . " I did not attempt to understand it . The way they threw cards and peso notes about and laughed and cursed one another , I would not imagine that it called for much mental concentration . From the stacks of notes in front ofp93each player it was evident that Bill was losing , the Syrian winning , and the two trainmen just about maintaining their status quo . The cards were different from any I had ever seen . Instead of hearts , diamonds , clubs and spades , they bore crowns , swords , axes , flaming torches , flintlock muskets , bulls , horses and mules . The Pullman conductor informed me that they had been manufacturedin Spain . The players intimated they would not appreciatefurther interruption . I decided to take a short walk along the right-of-way . Scarcely had I left the train and proceeded a few feet down the tracks than I observed a cloud of dust in the distance , indicating that a motor vehicle might be approaching along the desert road , which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , shining black Buick with white sidewall tires . It appeared almost new . With shrieking brakes and skidding tires , it stopped abruptly and discharged three villainous-appearing fellows , whom I apprehended might be bandits . They were neither washed nor shaved . They wore khaki trousers , tee-shirts and white sailor caps . One was tall , dark and handsome ; one was short , thin and dark , and resembled a Filipino ; and the third had no hair whatever upon his head . The Filipino bounced up to me , swinging an empty whiskey bottle , and demanded in a threatening manner , " Where is our friend Bill ? We have came to rescue him from off this mixto train that is stranded in this desierto desert . We will tolerate no goddam foolishment whatever ! " I was somewhat frightened but managed to inquire , " Could you possibly mean Mr. Wallace K. Wallace ? " " Who the hell else ? " asked the Filipino , and about that time Bill shouted from the train , " Where in hell did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " retorted the Filipino . " We are good , legitimate people and we got birth certificates to prove it . What for you ride that mixto train ? Why do n't you get a good car like Curly ? " " Where in hell did you get that new Buick ? " asked Bill of the bald bandit , as he approached us.  |p94The  bald-headed brigand , whose name was evidently " Curly , " put his hand to his jaw as though it were sore and answered , " I won it from that Lee Applewhite , our friendly undertaker . That son of a pup thinks he can shoot craps , but if I had had one more hour with him , I 'd have had the hearse and ambulance too . " I was presented to the bandits and learned that they were friends of Bill from the northern part of Arizona , on their way to Guaymas to fish . They had hired a driver to operate the car Curly had won from the undertaker , so that they might relax thoroughly . The tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipino-appearing gentleman was a court reporter , and the baldheadedperson was a district attorney . I heard their correct names but , from that point on , they were known , respectively , as Joe , Luigi and Curly . " How in the hell did you find us ? " inquired Bill . " I 'm smart , " announced the Filipino . " We stopped at the Espana for breakfast and I asked those caballero gentlemen if anybody from Tucson had been down in Hermosillo for purposes of starting an epidemic of pregnancy , and they told me that you and your friend had left on the mixto train this very manana morning . Later on , we put in at a little cantina about halfway from here to Hermosillo , and the old guy that ran it told us about the bridge washing out , and that you were stuck on this desierto desert . We decided it was our duty to rescue you , much as we would prefer to have you die of thirst , you bastard . " We left the train and climbed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , his five passengers and a miscellaneous lot of luggage and fishing equipment , to say nothing of a small tank containing ice and a very peculiar liquid . It was explained that at each place where ice had been obtainable it had been purchased and put into the tank , then each of the passengers , according to his individual taste , had poured his favorite liquor in upon the ice . The movement of the car served to mix the ingredients and to produce a rather startling mixture indeed . Joe 's contribution had been bacanora , a rather fiery type of native drink ; Luigi had put in straight American bourbon ; and Curly , habanero . At the first cantina after we left the train ,  |p95Bill  contributed a bottle of Scotch , and I poured in two small bottles of aguardiente , which is a product of Mexico and reputed to be a potent brew . Several tin cups were available and whenever one desired a drink one would simply lift the lid of the tank and scoop it up with a cup . Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really tasted good . The driver , a stern , middle-aged Mexican , with cold blue eyes and a white moustache , was a prohibitionist . Long before he had reached the train he had decided that his turistas were quite crazy , and the addition of Bill and me to the party had not improvedhis opinion . He drove very slowly and carefully along the desert road . Bill and Curly insisted upon singing , although the others seriously endeavored to discourage them . They sang " Borrachitame voy . . . " many times . They also sang a ballad concerning the romance of a minister of the gospel and a lady by the name of Clara , certain of the lyrics of which I still remember : " With presents he tempted and lured her to sin , Her innocent virtue to smirch , But her honor was strong and she only gave in When he gave her the deed to the church . " Luigi , the little , dark , quick-moving court reporter , whom I had thought was a Filipino , chattered constantly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whenever he used one he immediately followed it with the English equivalent . Occasionally he would add an " o " to some English word and insist that the result was pure Castilian Spanish . " This goddam camino road , she 's plenty rough-o , no ? " he asked me . " Yes , " I replied , " extremely rough-o . " " Thank God , there is one gentleman in this crowd that speaks the puro pure Castilian palabras words . Pete , you 're all right . You are an educated caballero gentleman , not a roughneck son of a bitch like Bill , that only knows Mexican and ca n't talk the real Spanish like I can . I speak the puro pure stuff-o , right fresh from Madrid . "  | " Pura cagada , " said Bill disgustedly , while Joe and Curly laughed . Joe , the tall , handsome Judge who , even though he was in need of a shave , looked more like a movie star than a jurist , and who was usually silent , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , as he took a drink from the tank , " tell Pete about the time you tied in with the virgin up at Winslow and she gave you the clap . " " It 's a lie , " screamed Luigi , " it 's a damnable lie-o ! She never was a virgin and I already had the clap . You slanderer , I 'll sue the hell out of you when we get back home-o . " I thoroughly enjoyed them all and wondered how they would appear in court , with Joe upon the bench , Curly prosecuting , Bill defending , and Luigi faithfully reporting the proceedings . Probably , I thought , they would be as dignified there as they were ribald here . So , with much laughter and banter , and an occasional drink from the tank , we drove across the desert until , toward evening , we could sense a change in the atmosphere . The clear , dry desert air , with its tang of mesquite and creosote , which we had been breathing all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nearing the sea . " Hell of a ocean , " said Luigi . " You can smell him but you ca n't see him . " " Just like you , Luigi , " cut in Curly . " I can sure smell you but I never could see you . " " Nother lie ! " yelled Luigi . " I smell like one rose-o , and you know it . You are so damn old and bald-headed , you could n't smell a privy if you fell in it . "  |p97Soon  our road turned sharply to the west and there , before our eyes , were the clear blue waters of the Mar de Cortes , under a cloudless sky now tinged with rose from the sun that was setting behind some misty mountains miles away , upon the opposite shore , in Baja California . We had reached Bachochibampo Bay , which is only a few miles from the town of Guaymas in the State of Sonora . Here the desert meets the sea and the sharp contrast is breath-taking . One moment we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , sandy beach , with the gulf on one side and the desert upon the other . Our road led past the beautiful Hotel Playa de Cortes ( where , as Bill said , wealthy Easterners as well as jaded movie stars , the latter escaping from the fog and rain of southern California , comep98to acquire a little sun tan ) , its red tile roof catching and tossing back the rays of the setting sun , and the crimson flowers of its bougainvillea vines actually rivaling the sunset . It was the most beautiful thing I had seen in Mexico , not excluding Alicia . We also passed the attractive Casitas de Miramar , with its little redbrickcottages dotting the white , sandy beach . Curly said that the cottages , while less luxurious than the Playa , were nevertheless comfortable , clean and well maintained . He had stayed there upon several occasions . However , our destination was neither the Playa nor Miramar . Joe had been given the use of a beach house , about a mile from the Playa , which belonged to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town some four or five miles the other side of Guaymas , and who came to his beach cabin only during the hot months of the summer . With the assistance of one of the house boys from Miramar , we found our home  --  and Pancho . Joe had not understood that when his friend had so generously offered the use of his beach cabin it included Pancho ; but Pancho was there , attired in a white suit and wearing clean white sandals on his little feet , awaiting our coming . He was perhaps sixteen , dark and slight , with eyes that Bill said reminded him of a Jersey calf . He had a very pleasantsmile , though he tried to give the impression that he was a very serious young person , charged with the great responsibility of seeing to the welfare of five helpless American tourists . He proved to be cook , waiter , guide , messenger , money changer , license obtainer , boat arranger , and true friend . Joe 's friend had loaned him a beach cabin which was old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with many doors and windows through which the ocean breeze entered . On the front porch there were two double beds . Each bedroom also had two beds . The living room , which Pancho had scrubbed , swept and dusted , contained only a few old broken chairs and a couch . Kitchen and dining room were combined in the rear , away from the beach . The kitchen had a fairly modern stove , fed from a butane tank at the back of the house . It also had an enormous icebox , well stocked with ice , liquors , beer , andp99some foodstuffs , all of which Pancho had purchased on our credit . Just how we had established credit at Guaymas , even before our arrival , was not disclosed . There was also a plain , unpainted , pine table and a half-dozen chairs . An old-fashioned " kitchen cabinet " completed the equipment . Toilet and shower were sandwiched in between two bedrooms . All rooms had floors of tile . There were no rugs . " You gentlemans go take your swim right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you little supper . You find swim trunks in shower room . I borrow for you from Mr. Canalizo at Miramar . I do n't know how many gentlemans comes so I borrows eight , all sizes , skeeny , fat , double-butted and all kinds . Hurry up now , you gentlemans , get your swim and then I feed you good , no ? " We distributed the assorted swimming trunks among us , doing our best to find the ones which fitted best , but we had too many thin men and too few fat ones . We would not have been hired as models by anyone who really wanted to sell swimming trunks . " Last one in 's a Republican , " yelled Bill , and we all made a dash for the beach . Because of my limp , I proved to be the Republican , but I did not mind at all . It 's a grand old party . How I enjoyed that dip in the cool waters of the bay , after the long , hot ride across the desert and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . The beach sloped so gently that one could wade out fully half a mile before the water was over one 's shoulders . We swam , splashed water and ducked one another . In fact , our conduct resembled the antics of a gang of schoolboys more than a group of dignified professional gentlemen . Soon , Pancho called from the porch , " Come and get eet . Soup 's on . Hurry up now , like good gentlemans . " Still wearing the wet bathing trunks , we trooped into the kitchen where we each had a cold , dry Martini , prepared and served by Pancho , followed by dinner , prepared and served by Pancho , and consisting of the inevitable shrimp cocktail , turtle soup , broiled sea bass , and sauterne , pickled dates , coffee and brandy.  |p100After  dinner we sat on the front porch , enjoying the cool sea breeze and watching the reflection of the moon , now rising from out the desert , in the clear , calm water . Away out in the gulf , we could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leap out of the water , leaving a trail of phosphorescent sparks behind him . Curly filled and puffed away at his pipe , while Joe and Luigi lighted some Mexican cigarettes called " Alas , " or Wings . Bill did not use tobacco in any form . I had not smoked in years , and never had made a habit of it , but I accepted Luigi 's offer of a cigarette and enjoyed it . Then Pancho and the driver must go into the town to arrange for a certain boat for the fishing expedition contemplated for the next day , while Curly must " work over " the fishing tackle , and Bill , Luigi , Joe and I must discuss our past experiences fairly far into the night . I had intended to tell the party about an old gentleman who had told me a big lie about the Indians , but Bill said it was too mild and decent for the others to appreciate . " Hell , Pete , " he remarked , " these guys from Navajo County can beat that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river in Arizona called the Hassayampa and whoever takes a drink out of it never tells the truth again as long as he lives . These fellows hardly ever drink water , but when they do , they lay right flat on their bellies and lap her up raw , right out of the ole Hassayampa . " " That 's the biggest lie yet ! " yelled Luigi . " I never drink no water-o . I am thirsty right now , but do you think 1 would touch that stuff ? " So saying , he jumped up , ran to the kitchen , and came bouncing back with a full bottle of Waterfil-Frazier , a Mexicanmadebourbon , which he proceeded to uncork and pass around . " Well , " said Bill , " lots of things that people think are lies , are really the gospel truth . There 's a feller in Phoenix looks more like Charlie Chan than ole Charlie himself ever did . One time , this feller has to take some depositions over in El Centro . He ca n't find no white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depositions all right , that is as good as Luigi ever does , then they go down to Mexicali and gets good and crocked . Luigi starts introducingthat feller around as Warner Oland , and the good peoplep101of Mexicali believe him . Right away he goes to giving out autographsand promising screen tests , and gettin ' free drinks and free gals and everything else . Then you know what happened ? Right there , while all that is going on , the Mexicali paper comes out and the headline on the very front page is Warner Oland , Charlie Chan of the Screen , Dies Today in Stockholm . ' Believe you me that feller and that Luigi has to leave town in a hurry , and neither one of them ever had the guts to go back there . " " That 's the damn truth , " said Luigi . " Let 's all have a little snort . " Curly , hard at work on the fishing tackle , spoke up : " Damnedestthing like that I ever had happen was one time back in prohibitiondays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a Negro lawyer , nice old boy , did n't know any law , but had plenty of native psychology . He showed up for trial with two women , they looked exactly alike and he had them dressed exactly alike . He would n't tell me and he would n't tell the judge which the defendant was . Of course , my dumb witness could n't pick the right one and I had to dismiss the case . Lemme have a little slug , Bill . " Thereupon , Curly said , " Joe , tell Pete about the time the car broke down on the road and the angel helped you drive it to Hermosillo . " Joe , who it appeared was usually the silent member of the party , hesitated with due modesty but was finally persuaded to detail the experience . I shall attempt to set it forth substantiallyas he told it , although I admit my inability to ascribe to it any natural or even plausible reason or explanation . " Pete , " he said , in all sincerity , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that has no counterpart in their respective personal experience . I do not know how you will receive this little bit of history . I may and do , however , assure you of the truth of which I speak . I leave the explanation , if any , to someone with more intelligence than I. Give me a drink ! " We each had a small drink of the very good whiskey that Luigi had brought from the icebox.  |p102Joe  continued : " The second trip I made down here was with Bill , in an old Essex , many years ago . Just after we left Cornelio , in mid-afternoon , the car stopped . We endeavored to start it , without success . We determined , after many experiments , that the fuel pump was incapable of delivering gasoline to the carburetor . The car was incapable of making progress under its own power . How about another little snort ? " We each had another small drink . " After trying in every way we knew to get that old car to run , we finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit , who agreed to drive one of us on to Hermosillo , to obtain the necessary parts with which to repair the Essex . Bill elected to go and I determined to stay with the derelict . " Several parties stopped and tried to assist me in the repair of the automobile , but without success . " As night approached , a Mexican wood-cutter , driving an old Model T pick-up , came from the north and agreed to push the Essex along the road to a camp he knew of some kilometers to the south . He did so and left me at the camp just after dark , so that he might continue his way over some side road . The camp was peopled with laborers who were working on the road . I had considerable money on me and was afraid some of them might rob me , although the wood-cutter assured me they were , as he expressed it , buen gente . ' " The night was cold , the wind was blowing across the desert from the mountains , and I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was also without a drink , as I am right now . " We supplied him and he went on : " A woman of about sixty came from a little shack and invitedme in to have some coffee . She , her husband , two sons and their wives , and some five or six children , all occupied the little building , which was constructed of wall-board , thatched with tin cans , and had a good , substantial dirt floor . In one corner of the combined living-dining-bedroom and kitchen , there was a clay oven , on top of which reposed a coffee pot and some other cooking utensils . " The woman served me with hot coffee , beans and tortillas.  |p103She  would not consider accepting payment , but I managed to give each of the children a few pennies . " During the hour or so that I stayed in their little home , I became well acquainted with the people and learned to like them . " I inquired about their economic situation and was told they worried about it not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , ' said the father . They all crossed themselves . " The little saint sent the rain when the camp well was drying up , ' said the mother . Each of them made the sign of the cross . " When my foot was caught under the roller , the little saint lifted it off , ' explained one of the sons . " The little saint brought me this pretty dolly , ' one of the children spoke forth , and showed me a little Indian doll that did n't appear any too wonderful . " Each time the words little saint ' were spoken it was with deep reverence and each member of the family made the sign of the cross . " It is a cold night , ' I said facetiously , could the little saint provide a bottle of mescal to warm a weary traveler ? ' " The little saint , ' said the father , severely , does not traffic in such things . However , there is a bootlegger in camp and a bottle can be procured for two pesos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the four of us men . Its contents were quickly consumed . " During the time I remained at the house , we had several more bottles . When I decided to return to the car , so that the household might sleep and I might await the return of Bill , I took an unopened bottle with me . As I have said , the night was very cold . " I sat in that old Essex and , every once in a while , took a small sip out of the bottle . I may have dropped off to sleep , I do not know . Suddenly , however , I noticed a young Mexican girl , clothed entirely in white , with long black braids hanging down her back . She had lifted the hood of the car and was examining something inside . Soon she closed it and came back to the door . The nextp104thing I knew she was seated in the driver 's place , and the car was moving almost noiselessly along the road . As I looked ahead I noticed that where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , shining cross of gold . " The girl was n't pretty  --  she was beautiful , but in a kind of a strange , unearthly way . Her skin was just about like a petal from a white rose . Her eyes were big and brown , wide open and staring straight ahead . She never said a word , never smiled or changed expression . Her eyes were glued to the road . I am not kidding you fellows when I say there was a sort of soft light about her head , and it really scared me . " I must have slept for a few minutes , because almost the next thing I knew it was daylight and the car was parked in front of the Sonora Motors Building in Hermosillo . The girl had left without ever speaking to me . I found that I was trembling as though I had the worst hangover a man could have . " Soon Bill appeared with a mechanic and took the car inside the building to repair it . " That 's all there is to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not all of the story , for Bill continued , " I can add my two-bits ' worth , Pete . After I had left that old bastard of an Essex , we had three flat tires , and only one spare . We had a hell of a time , patching and pumping and taking tires off and putting them on . We got to Hermosillo just about daylight , and the guy who brought me in from Cornelio went to the hotel , while I went over to the Sonora Motors . No one was on the job at that hour of the morning but I knew where the head mechanic lived . I went over there and roused him out . When we came back to the shop , there was Joe , sitting in the Essex and stinking like holy hell . " I know damn well that , when I left him , the diaphraghm on that fuel pump was completely gone and I know damn well that when we looked at it there at Hermosillo , it was still gone . The pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought somebody had come along and towed Joe into town and that his story about the little saint was just a goddamn lie , but two things puzzled the hell out of me , and they still do . The motorp105on that Essex was just as hot as if it had been driven all the way from Cornelio . The gas tank , which was over half-full when I left Joe , was damn near dry at Hermosillo . " While we were pondering Joe 's tale , Panel-to returned from town with the report that Captain Lopez and his boat , the Pez Vela , would be available for our use in the morning . " He tried to charge you gentlemans forty U. S. dollars for one day , and I get him down to thirty , and he still gives me fifteen pesos for bribe . Very dumb , no ? I keep the fifteen pesos , all right with you gentlemans , no ? " We assured him it was and retired . Bill and I had decided to sleep on the porch and permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant to lie in bed on the porch , feel the soft ocean breeze , and gaze out upon the starlit sea . I fell asleep while trying to remember if there was any fuel pump at all upon the old Essex my uncle had owned years ago , back in Berwynde . As I remembered it , the gas was fed by a gravity system , but I could not be sure . This caused me to be somewhat apprehensiveas to the veracity of my companions.  |p106In  the morning , I awakened much earlier than my companions . As I donned my swimming trunks , I could hear Bill snoring away in the other bed on the porch . The sun had risen and it was warm along the beach as I made my way to the bay for a dip in the cold salt water . Although it stung my eyes , it invigorated my skin and pepped me up all over . Notwithstanding the events of the night before , I did n't have a touch of hangover . I heard Pancho calling me : " Gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out in this sunshine without put oil on your body . You blister and peel and burn and ca n't have any fun , and hurt like hell . You come here right now ! " I obeyed my master 's voice and he rubbed my head , back and shoulders with coconut oil which , although it did n't havep107a very pleasing odor , seemed to be very effective against sunburn . I applied it to my feet and legs and then went for a little stroll along the waterfront . The beach was virtually deserted at this hour of the morning , although a few sea gulls flew overhead , and an occasional sand crab would scuttle out of my way as I approached . Out in the water I could see small fish jump clear of the blue for an instant and then sink again into the water . When I returned , I found everyone up and dressed , and breakfast on the table . It was a meal I shall never forget . Cold papayas , a small melon grown in these parts , served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melon , then chorisos y huevos revueltos  --  eggs scrambled with highly spiced sausage  --  and beans and cheese , toast and coffee royal . Breakfast completed , we awaited our boat , which must come from the harbor at Guaymas , a long way around the coast to our house at Bachochibampo Bay . Bill explained that it would have been much more convenient for all concerned had we driven the few miles into Guaymas and boarded the boat there . We decided that while we waited we should have a cold beer . So we sat or lay about the porch , beer in hand , thoroughly relaxed . Luigi decided to tell a story , but about that time Panel-10 yelled , " Look , gentlemans , there she comes , Pez Vela , right on time like I promisedyou . " We all looked seaward . At first I could not discern the boat , but presently I was able to make out a small craft which , from that distance , appeared almost the color of the water . Gradually it grew larger until I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , perhaps forty feet in length , with a cabin extending about three-quarters of the way back from the bow , and a stern deck equipped with two revolving chairs for the use of those who might desire to fish . The little boat grounded gently , about half a city block from the shore , the anchor was put over the bow , and she graduallyswung around until the stern was plainly visible , bearing the boat 's name and home berth , " Pez Vela  --  Guaymas , Son , " in red letters across the sternboard . Bill said " Pez Vela " was Spanishp108for " flying fish . " Pancho agreed with him . I did not particularly care . Over the stern dropped the Captain , who waded ashore to be presented to us , although it developed I was the only one whom he had not previously met . Johnnie Lopez was his name , and he wore a captain 's seagoing blue cap and blue shirt with gold sleeve stripes with the dignity equal to that of the skipper of an ocean liner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was barefoot . He was possibly sixty-five years of age , small of stature , and he moved with cat-like grace and speed . He had a very pleasant smile , and small , white , even teeth . His black hair was turning to gray . The wind and sun had tanned and toughened the skin of his face and arms to a rich , brown leather , with deep furrows around his eyes and at the corners of his mouth . " What 's running , Johnnie ? " asked Bill . " Marlin ? " " No marlin . " " Sailfish ? " " No sailfish , nothin ' but totuava at this season . By God , Bill , you know that ! What the hell , damn , y dos cagadas , you put on one show for your friend , huh ? You personally acquaint ' with every by-God fish in this gulf , and you ask for marlin now , when you know by-God well he ai n't here . To hell with you and your marlin . You catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn and by-God ! " Captain Johnnie grinned at Bill , and there appeared to be complete friendship and understanding between them , notwithstanding the captain 's outburst . " Look here , Captain Johnnie , " commanded Pancho , " you got everything aboard like I told you ? " " Yes , sir , " responded the Captain meekly , with a twinkle in his eye . Pancho produced a piece of paper and began checking off items as he further queried the Captain . " You got three cases cold beer ? " " Yes , sir . " " Four bottles tequila ? " " Si , senor . " " Papaya melons , limes and Garci-Crespo waters ? "  | " Si , senor . " " You got good , fresh olive oil for fry the fish ? " " Yes , Master Pancho . " " Don ' you Master Pancho ' me . These gentlemans is in my care and you don ' put nothing over on them . You got small bread , butter , ice and coffee ? " " Si , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet papers for the gentlemans ? " " Si ! " " Very good , I guess I train you very well , " said Pancho . " Now , remember , if a storm comes up , you put in first bay you see . Don ' you try to come round the point and make Guaymas and damn near drown everybody , like you did one time . Cornprende ? " " Yes , Senor Pancho , I understand most clearly , " murmured the Captain , but by now his grin was so broad that anyone could immediately understand he was enjoying the admonition that was being given him by a child who might have been his grandson . " Very well , then , " said Pancho with the utmost gravity . " I think it 's all right you gentlemans go with this Captain Johnnie ... I think he will mind me pretty good . Take off your shoes and wade aboard . When you come back tonight , I will have good dinner for you . " Although I experienced considerable difficulty in climbing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above by the Captain 's son and first mate , Juanito , a tall , dark , goodlookingboy in his early twenties , dressed exactly like his father except for a lack of gold braid on his cap and stripes upon his sleeves . The " crew " was named " Nacho , " a nondescript , middleagedMexican , who spoke no English . We weighed anchor and put out into the gulf . The boat was powered by a Gray marine engine that purred along as though it had always received the best of care and attention , which I believe it did , because Captain Johnnie appeared to be very competentand proud of the boat , its officers , crew and equipment . The Captain gave orders , Juanito steered , and the crew performed any and every service that was asked of him . By unanimous vote , Curly and I were elected as first par/ticipants in the fishing contest , and Bill and Joe began to arrange the tackle for us . " Here , " said Bill , handing me an extremely heavy rod and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll buy you a drink . " " What , " I inquired meekly , " are totuava ? " " The totuava , " explained Bill , " is a variety of sea bass . " " Well , surely , " I remonstrated , " this heavy tackle is not intended for use in bass-fishing . It 's all I can do to lift the rod and reel , much less cast a plug with it . " My remark did not provoke comment or explanation , althoughLuigi snickered audibly . I was placed in one of the chairs , a canvas harness was strapped around my shoulders and fastened to the rod , the butt of which was placed in a swivel protruding from the front of the chair . In this rather uncomfortable postion , I sat for more than an hour , while the Pez Vela chugged across the blue waters of the Mar de Cortes . The sky above was blue and cloudless , the waters of the gulf a deeper blue , the cliffs were of red sandstone with brilliant green cacti standing at attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks flew overhead . Pelicans stood upon the rocks near the shore , and leered at us , then took off into the air , to dive-bomb the sardines which swam just beneath the surface . We passed an island upon which tens of thousands of seals , from babies to grandfathers , frolicked , barked , and slid into the sea . A great school of porpoise played about our boat for perhaps twenty minutes , then disappeared as rapidly as they had come . Bill insisted that the expression on one of them was identical with that of the " honest farmer " we had encountered at Tucson . I could not appreciate the resemblance . Then the speed of the Pez Vela was greatly reduced , and Curly and I were informed that we might fish . We did not have any plugs ; we did not cast . Instead , we were each given a " number seven spinner " which is a metal contrivanceabout the size and shape of a shoehorn , with a vicious hook hanging from its center.  |p111U|p  and down the shore we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold bottle of beer to me . I quaffed it peacefully , half-asleep in the hard chair , wearing the uncomfortableharness . Suddenly , to use an expression coined by Bill , all hell broke loose ! The rod was almost jerked from my hands , the harness almost torn from my shoulders , the reel smoked , the line ran out at the speed of an express train ! I knew not what to do , but advice  --  and very conflicting advice  --  cameinstantly from my companions . " Let him run ! " " Pull him in ! " " Give him more line ! " " Tighten your star ! " " Send for Judge Leviton , you 'll never land him ! " " Oh , hell , let him go ! You 'll kill us all . " Through all the chatter Johnnie stood quietly at my side , telling me exactly what to do . " Steady , Pete , steady . Pump him up . Reel him in . Pump , reel , rest  --  pump , reel , rest . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing the boat . Look , Pete , you can see him now . Let him run a little . Show him you ai n't goin ' to work so hard as he is . Now , bring him in . Steady does her . . . There he is , all tired out  --  like Bill after a night at Chona 's . " Up to the side of the boat I " pumped and reeled " the largest fish I had ever seen , a brown and white monster , of the shape of a lake bass , but of a size that Gulliver , in all his travels , had never encountered . As Johnnie had said , he was " all tired out , " and turned on his back to rest , white belly flashing in the sunlight . Nacho , quickly and quietly , put his gaff under the gills and , lifting the head out of water , began beating it with a club the size of a baseball bat . " Bueno , " yelled Luigi . " Beat the hell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make a New York lawyer out of him ! " The " bass " weighed just under two hundred pounds . I was exhausted . I surrendered my chair to Luigi . Curly , who had courteouslyreeled in his line so that it would not interfere with me ,  |p112once  more dropped his spinner into the water . Luigi made some stupid remark about wanting to use the fish I had caught as bait for his hook , as he was really out after a big one . " Surely , " I remarked to Joe , " no one at home will ever believe that I caught such a fish . " " The hell they wo n't , " replied Joe . " I will take your picture , with that fish right now , and we will have it printed and underneathit we will have printed , Which is the fish ? ' " To celebrate my catch , we each had a drink of tequila and a bottle of cold beer . Etiquette demanded that each person aboard , officers and crew excepted , consume one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasion . The boat rolled ever so gently , the sun warmed my body , and the faintest of sea breezes fanned me . Overhead , not a cloud appeared in the sky . I fell asleep , completely at peace with the world . I was awakened by a tremendous racket . Curly had a strike , and was receiving advice on the proper way of bringing in the fish . He paid no attention , however , and in about half the time it had taken me , landed a totuava a little smaller than mine . We all had tequila and beer again . Luigi was disgusted because Curly had caught a sea bass before him . " Hell , " he said , " I live right , love the Lord , and keep my bowels open like the Book says , and I do n't even get a strike while you lewd persons get all the good totuava fish . " In the early afternoon , we put into some little nameless bay where Nacho dropped the anchor over and it plunged through the clear water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck . Overside , we could observe schools of small , brightly colored fish and , upon the sand below , gray-green crabs scuttled about for dear life . Along the rocks by the shore hundredsof pelicans were taking their siesta . Our coming had not disturbed them and , apparently , they thought more of their sleep than of consuming the fish . It then developed that aboard the Pez Vela the Captain was ex-officio cook , and a very excellent one he proved . Forward in the cabin , there had been installed a small gasoline stove which ,  |p113after  he had pumped and primed and cursed in Spanish , English and Yaqui dialect , Captain Johnnie succeeded in getting to " just the right by-God heat . " Soon the odor of sea bass frying in a mixture of olive oil and pepper sauce came to us , even above deck . I was so hungry I could have eaten the deck planking . Luncheon , in white porcelain soup plates , was served by Nacho . It consisted of cold papayas with limes , the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I would have called " French bread , " sliced tomatoes , goats ' milk cheese , and cold beer . The meal was followed by steaming cups of hot coffee , well laced with tequila . In the cabin , abaft the gasoline stove , were two long benches running lengthwise of the boat , each topped with a hard canvascoveredpad . I lay upon one of them and slept so soundly that I did not hear the commotion raised when Luigi got his strike and landed his fish . Shortly thereafter , however , I was rudely awakened by Luigi bearing a small glass of tequila in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other , which he insisted I drink in his honor . " Pete , " he said , " I know now that living a good , pure life pays off in dividends . I did n't only get the biggest fish , but the prettiest and the most intelligent . Not another one of these bastardscould have landed such a smart totuava fish like that one of mine ! "  |p114All  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn about , sang songs and drank tequila and beer , until the tequila supply was exhausted , and shortly after that we ran out of beer . Thereafter , our only refreshment was cold bottles of " Garci-Crespo , " a naturalcarbonated water without flavoring which , as Bill expressed it , " tasted like holy hell with pink ribbons . " However , it was wet and cold and did us no harm . Our catch was something over a ton of totuava . In spite of frequent applications of the coconut oil , we were sunburned , wind-tanned , tired , dirty and happy . As we cruised along the rocky shore , with the green bacanora cacti dotting each hillside , the sun , a great crimson ball the size of a hogshead , suddenly dropped from sight beyond the western horizon , and shortly thereafter night was upon us . By the timep115we had rounded the lighthouse , with its red and white beams alternating across the water , and entered the Guaymas harbor , all was black , for the moon had not yet risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being driven into the bay by the breeze . Ships riding at anchor appeared as gray indistinct shapes , their riding lights of green and red but faintly visible from the deck of the Pez Vela . The bright lights of the town , however , gleamed ahead and were reflected in distorted crazy shapes in the black waters of the bay . We landed at City Pier , a short structure of piling and planking , encrusted with green moss and barnacles , revealed by bright overhead lights . The Buick and the faithful driver awaited us , but Joe instructed the driver to return forthwith to the beach cabin and inform Pancho that , although we had returned safely from the fishing expedition , we would not be home for dinner , because , as we could readily observe , there was a fiesta in progress in the town . The populace , masked and costumed , swarmed upon the pier and along the adjacent street , yelling and singing and generally having a good time . Naturally , I wanted to see more of the fiesta , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . " Leave ' em be , " said Bill , " Ole Johnnie will take care of ' em . He gives ' em to the poor people of the city who need ' em for food . " I wondered whether Johnnie might not sell them for his own profit . " Hell , no , " said Luigi , " those are certified tourist fish ' and not for sale . There are a lot of poor folks in Guaymas and Johnnie will see that the deserving guys dine on totuava fish manna to-morrow . " We left the pier and made our way through the crowded , unpaved , dirty street along the waterfront . This thoroughfare was filled with revelers in costumes of the cheapest materials , but , with the exception of the skeletons , bright and gaudy . Vehicular traffic made its way through the crowd at the pace which the pedestrians dictated . The clash of auto horns , yells , songs and laughter , was anything but harmonious . Amid all the noisy press of folk , the skeleton costume predom/inated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe covering the entire body , and a black hood over the head , with white bones painted at the appropriate places . In the obscure light of the waterfront , it was very effective in creating the appearance of an animated , fleshless body , skipping about and chatteringor singing . All of the celebrants carried egg shells , filled with confetti , called " cascarones . " The why or wherefore of the name I never learned . They would tap a person on the head , break the shell and spill confetti upon him , and then run away laughing as though it were the funniest thing in the world . Poor Curly came in for more than his share of cascarones . Orchestras , generally clad as charros , played at every street corner . All rendered the same air , " Linda Mujer . " Bands did their best with the same composition in every cantina and dance hall . Upon rare occasions one would attempt " Viva Mexico , " but would soon abandon the effort and again commence " Linda Mujer . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nice Lady , " and I became convinced that the lady must be very nice , indeed . At least that was the unanimous opinion of all the musicians in Guaymas . Treading our way through the crowd , endeavoring to reach a certain cantina highly recommended by Bill , we came abreast of the post office , a dirty , unpainted , two-story structure that appeared to collapse from fatigue and old age . I was surprised to find that , at this early hour of the night , it was open for business . Lights blazed from every window . I went inside , found an ancient window labeled " Telegranas , " and dispatched a wire to Judge Leviton which read , " WON CASE GOT DRUNK CAUGHT FISH ENJOY YOURSELF IT IS LATER THAN YOU THINK . " It cost eighteen pesos . At that moment New York seemed very distant indeed . We found the cantina Bill had recommended . It was not very impressive and was crowded with gay folk in costumes and masks . An anemic three-piece orchestra , crowded into a corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way slowly through the crowd , Bill was thep117epitome of courtesy . His soft-spoken " Con su permiso " was the open sesame through many a temporary blockade . We located a table which , because of one short leg , rocked worse than the Pez Vela had ever done , covered with oilcloth that had once been white but was now a rich sepia . A tired waiter brought us tequila sours . Hardly had we begun our drinks , when two rather chubby young ladies approached our table , each attired in the familiar black costume with white bones painted upon it . It was a most ineffectual effort , considering the bright lights of the cantina . No skeleton , living or dead , was ever possessed of such curves . Each wore a death 's head mask , and each had a tag with a large white number pinned upon the front of her costume . No one , other than these two girls , was so ticketed . Although I had not been properly presented to either of these young ladies , I rather boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes returned my stare . A rosebud mouth smiled shyly at me . Clear olive skin and dainty , regular features completedthe picture . Luigi also raised a mask and , although the face beneath was pretty , it did not compare with that of the young lady who seemed willing to become acquainted with me . We bought beers for the girls . I inquired of Bill why those two girls , and no other person whomsoever , wore numbers upon their costumes . He explained that they had each won a drawing in the lottery that day and that each of them would receive ten thousand pesos , equivalent to about twelve hundred dollars in genuine money . Luigi whispered in my ears , " Let 's cut these two heifers out of the herd and beat it ! " His proposal met with my instant approval . Accompanied by the gay mascaritas , we shouldered our way through the crowded cantina and out onto the equally crowded street . Luigi 's method of getting through the massed humanity differed radically from that which had been employed by Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fairly steady , though slow gait , Luigi would push , shove and yell , " Beat it , you bastardos , out of way-o ! ' What the hell the matter , do n't you understand your own language ? One side-o ! Snap out of him-o ! " Sometimes ,  |p118in  spite of his yelling and pushing , we would come to a dead stop where we were forced to remain for several minutes until the jam was broken by someone with a sense of humor and a desire to please the crazy turista . Eventually we found and hired an old dilapidated taxi and drove , slowly and with many enforced stops , through the milling throng . During the taxi ride , I placed my arm boldly around the waist of the chubby little skeleton sitting next to me . She did not appear to resent such familiarity and snuggled against me . Throughout the evening our efforts to converse were flat failures . If she knew any English , she was too shy to attempt to use it . I am sure she understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a giggle . The taxi ride ended when we reached a large , open pavilion where , as Luigi explained , the municipal ball was in progress . It was a most peculiar place at which to hold a dance . Up until then , my idea of a pavilion was a building with a roof supported by pillars , but without solid exterior walls . Here , however , we found walls but no roof . The only light was supplied by the moon , now rising in the east and casting its light , broken by many shadows , over the assembled merry-makers at the ball . Imitation marble pillars , each as thick as a tenor drum , were placed around the edge of the cement dance floor . There were no seats of any kind except for the orchestra , which , seated in the center of the floor , was rendering " Linda Mujer " with great gusto as we paid our admission fee and entered . Instead of tickets , a small piece of red , green and white ribbon was pinned upon Luigi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These tricolors signified that we had duly contributed and that we and our ladies were entitled to dance until the gran baile should be concluded . The orchestra members , attired in natty white uniforms and wearing blue caps with a golden " G.M. " embossed upon the front , appeared quite up to the minute . Through Luigi I learned that the thirty-two musicians were all members of the local police force and that the " G.M. " signified " Gendarmes Municipales , " or city police.  |p119In  the soft moonlight , broken by the shadows of the pillars and of the assembled multitude , our partners ' skeleton costumes were much more effective than they had been in the frank light of the cantina . Their contours , before and behind , which the glare of the brightly lighted cantina had revealed and accentuated , were now hidden in the friendly shade and soft light of the municipalpavilion . Up to that point , I had found the Mexican people friendly , courteous and helpful . However , at the dance we felt more or less ostracized . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Paca , the young lady who accompanied me , and occasionally traded partners with Luigi . Between dances , all the couples promenaded around the pavilion . I smiled and tried to appear friendly . No one spoke to us . No one returned my smile . Several large and rather elderly ladies appeared to resent our presence . Some of the younger girls giggled whenever we passed . Certain of the gentlemen present glared at us in the most unfriendly fashion . There was some undercurrentpresent which we could not fathom . Apparently turistas were not particularly welcome at the gran baile municipal de Guaymas . We did not have a very good time . However , during one of the periods of intermission , we observed some professional dancing that appeared really worthwhile . The floor having been temporarily cleared of the townspeople , a young couple gave an exhibition of the jarabe tapatio , which I am sure must be one of the most beautiful of all of the folk dances of Mexico . The young gentleman was attired as a charro ; the girl appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt with red yoke , set off with literally thousands of sequins , a white blouse with red and green embroidered figures of the cactus and snake , and a red shawl over the shoulders , crossed and tied in front Indian-fashion . The music , which had dragged before , quickened its tempo as the couple moved around and around each other , dancing heel and toe , the audience keeping time by the clapping of hands.  |p120Near  the conclusion of the dance , the boy threw his sombrero to the floor and the girl danced around its brim , faster and faster , as the music surged and the onlookers clapped and whistled . Eventually they were both exhausted  --  but not so the audience . Handclapping and whistles demanded their return . The second performance was much the same as the first , except that instead of using the sombrero , two open bottles of tequila were placed upright on the floor , and the couple danced around , between and over them , with such spirit and dexterity as to keep us enchanted and , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidentally collide with one of the bottles . Again they were called back . In their last dance , upright , naked swords , called machetes , were substituted for the bottles . I way tempted to rush in and rescue the young lady , because I was certain that a misstep would result in her serious injury . The remaining formal dances seemed very boring , and we left the gran baffle without regret . Outside the pavilion , we found that the crowd on the street had thinned considerably and we experienced no difficulty in making our way to a sidewalk stand where an old Mexican sold fried shrimp and beer which his customers might take to little tables set along the sidewalk . Luigi ordered shrimp and beer for the four of us , but the old fellow demurred . " I weel gladly serve you gentlemens , " he said in fair English , " but the gorls must not stay here . You onderstan ' they have to be back to the deestrick by midnight . " " What ? " yelled Luigi and I simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirs , their nombers are only good until midnight tonight . " " What you mean-o ? " demanded Luigi . " Ah , I see you don ' onderstan ' who these pipples ees . They ees two of our bes ' - known professional gorls . During the fiesta , and because of eet , they ees permit to enter the city and join in the fun . They ees permit to wear masks and costumes , so long they register with the police and wear the nombers to identify theirselfs . " " You mean they are whore-os ? " demanded Luigi incredulously.  | " But certainly , sir , indeed , sir , deed you not onderstan ' ? " " Hell , no , " said Luigi , " a friend of ours told us the numbers meant they had won the lottery . Wait until I get my hands on that Bill . " " Very fine fren , " murmured the old Mexican . With great dignity , and with extremely slight courtesy , we gave each of the girls a ten-peso note , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find their way back to the " district " as best they might . " That 's one on us , " said Luigi , as we walked toward the waterfront in search of a taxi . " Anybody else , I would n't mind so much  --  but that he-whore-o of a Bill . I hate to have him one up on me . We 'll never hear the last of this if we live to be a thousand . " I felt the same apprehension . I could understand now why the people at the gran baile had not been enthusiastic with respect to our appearance , in the company of two apparently well-known prostitutes , each of whom displayed a number to identify herself as a member in good standing of her chosen profession . We found a taxi and then returned to our home at the beach , resolved in some way to even things with Bill . Arriving at the cottage , however , we found that neither Bill nor Curly had returned . Joe was asleep and snoring . Luigi and I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awakened by a fly . I hit at him several times , but it did no good . He was bound and determined to alight , either on my nose or my closed eyelids . I gave up and got up , stretching and yawning , still needing just a little more rest . From the bay I could hear the shouts and splashes of the others . I soon joined them , had a brief and refreshing swim , and after a small nip from the Waterfil-Frazier bottle , was ready for the morning meal . Pancho appeared rather sulky at breakfast . At first I thought it was because we had failed to appear for dinner the night before . Something was troubling the young gentleman and he soon let it be known . Placing himself directly behind the chair occupied by Luigi , so that the latter could not see the smile playing aboutp123the corner of his mouth , he announced , " Gentlemans , you have hurt me . Two of my gentlemans took bad girls to the dance last night and this has hurt me very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal , as he yelled , " It 's a lie ! They were Carranza 's grand-daughters and I can prove it ! " " No , gentlemans , they were bad girls and we are now all in disgrace among the people of Guaymas . " " They were good girls ! " yelled Luigi . " They were respectable girls . They were Carranza 's grand-daughters and they took us to his house for chocolate-o . " " Where is his house ? " demanded Bill . " Up on the hill , at the head of the bay , " replied Luigi , rather tentatively , I thought . " That 's Elena 's joint , the Chona 's of Guaymas , " said Bill , " and besides Carranza has been dead for thirty years and never was in Guaymas in his life . " Luigi threw down his napkin in disgust . " All right , " he said , " they were a couple of whore-os , so what ? " " Never do that again , gentlemans , " commanded Pancho sternly , controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go see bad girls , go to the bad-girl house ; do n't take them to the finest dance of the year at Guaymas , where everyone can see you and bring disgrace on me and my gentlemans . " " We sure wo n't , " said Luigi meekly , and I joined in the assurance . Nevertheless , I was resolved that in some way I would make Bill pay , not only for this mishap but also for placing the wildcat in bed with me back at Hermosillo . " Tell you what let 's do , " said Curly , holding his jaw to keep his new teeth in place , " let 's not fish today  --  it 's too late , anyway  --  but try to stay reasonably sober and go in and see that town of Guaymas by daylight , without any mascaritas or putitas , or anybodydisrespectable , except us . " " Bueno ! " yelled Luigi . " That 's what I like . Respectable Luigi , they calls me . I will be really pure-o and show you bastardos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide , " murmured the usuallyp124quiet Joe . Whereupon , Luigi threw a hot cake at him but missed . We piled into the Buick and left for the city . The road , though only six or seven kilometers in length , was rough and full of holes . Leaving the seacoast abruptly it traversed the desert straight into Guaymas , while its passengers bounced up and down and from side to side with every effort of the good driver to avoid the worst of the depressions in the roadway . We encountered few cars on the " highway " but did pass a number of small , twowheeledcarts , some carrying heavy loads of hay or wood or householdfurniture , each drawn by a poor , skinny horse , goaded into a half-trot by the lash . There was little conversation en route . However , having been very much interested in the costumes of the jarabe dancers of the previous evening , I inquired of Bill where and how the term " china poblana " had originated , and was informed that , early in the seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orient to Acapulco , a port in southern Mexico , taking among other loot a beautiful Oriental princess named Mina . She was sold at auction on the beach and purchased by a certain Captain Soza of Puebla , who lived with her in sin for many years . Of all the women then in Mexico , she had the most beautiful clothing and became known as " Mina , la China Poblana , " or " Mina , the Chinese girl of Puebla . " Her style of dress was copied and imitatedby many of the belles of that day and has since become somewhat of a national dancing costume . Joe said he thought that , in the main , Bill 's story was correct . However , the way he had heard it , Mina and Captain Soza had been married by a priest and lived , not in sin , but in strict decency , and that Mina had devoted the greatest portion of her life to alleviating the suffering of the poor people of Puebla . She was a saint , lacking only official recognition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was a whore-o , and I can prove it . " " She was n't any Carranza 's grand-daughter , " said Curly . That terminated the discussion . By that time we were bouncing down the main street of Guavmas , a broad , unpaved thoroughfare , with small , green treesp125set out and growing in the center of the roadway almost to the edge of the business district . As we rode through the town it was very evident that Guaymas , although less than a hundred American miles from Hermosillo , bore no resemblance whatever to the State capital . Whereas Hermosillo is clean and modern in every respect , Guaymas is dirty , ancient , picturesque and rotten . Its streets are of dirt , most of its buildings in disrepair , and such plumbing that exists is far from adequate . Consequently , it has a smell all its own , compounded of the salt air usual to any ocean harbor , dead fish , decaying oysters and stale sewage . Years before , as an old man on the mixto had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods coming into Sonora were brought into Guaymas by ship and then sent on by mule team to the various towns , ranches and mines requiring them . The building of the railroad into Empalme , only a short distance away , with a branch line to Guaymas , ruined the little city commercially . For years thereafter , until the tourists began coming to the Playa and to Miramar , it sat decaying in the sunshine . It was now beginning , however , to develop other industries than the tourist trade . There was an oyster and shrimp cannery in full operation , and hundreds of tons of fish were iced and packed and then shipped by truck over the rough desert road to satisfy the palates of the North American neighbors . The few people we saw on the street were not the simple country folk of Magdalena and Santa Ana , nor the modern urbanites of Hermosillo . Here the people were fisher-folk , the men wearing blue trousers and tee-shirts or short jackets , with marine caps on their heads . They were either barefoot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . All were deeplytanned by the sun and salt air . Most of the women wore dark clothing , with black mantillas over their heads . Now and then one would see a young man or woman dressed in the Hermosillo style , but they were the exception . Children , playing about the schoolyard , dressed , laughed , ran and jumped and yelled , exactly as American children were doing in thousands of schoolyards at that exact moment . Little , if any , new construction was in progress . The build/ings all appeared to be at least fifty years ' old . Some needed paint , although the majority had recently had their exteriors touched up , and their pink , blue , buff or green walls sparkled in the sunshine . We drove down to the waterfront and there , by a little pier extending perhaps a hundred feet into the harbor , we dismissed our faithful , solemn driver , and set out to see Guaymas afoot . Before us lay the Bay of Guaymas , the sun 's rays making pinpoints of bright light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore dotted with the light green of the bacanora cacti . Boats and ships of almost every description rested peacefullyand securely within the safe anchorage of the bay . " Look at her , " said Bill , " where everything is beautiful and only man is vile . There 's the finest ole harbor in Mexico . With the one exception of San Francisco Bay , in California , it 's the best natural harbor on the whole damn Pacific coast . If we had her in the States , this would be a hell of a big city and there would be subdivisions with little red flags and slick salesmen extending damn near to Hermosillo . But hell , if we had her , there would n't be no charm left in the ole place . The damn factory smoke would smother the beauty and kill the good ole-fashioned stink . Actually , whenever I go out to a ranch in Arizona and have to sit on a privy that ai n't been cleaned up for a long time , I get homesick for good ole Guaymas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luigi . " Oystiones , " corrected Bill . " Oystiones to you , you ignorant bastardo , but oysterinos to me and Pete , what have studied the beautiful Spanish language and do n't like to associate with ignorant people that calls ' em oystiones . " " What do you say we try some oysters ? " suggested Curly , still holding his jaw . " Just what I 've been yelling for , " explained Luigi , " oyste-rinos . " Along the little pier we walked , to a small , octagonal building , buff-colored and with bright red roof , containing within it a bar , a counter and a juke box , along with several small tables and chairs at irregular intervals . From almost every open window onep127had a good view of the bay . Everything within that building was painted white with dark red trim , save the juke box , which was every color . The place was immaculate . We sat at a table near an open window and were served by a barefoot Mexican lad . " Five cinco tequila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Si , senor , " replied the boy rapidly , " y que marca de tequila , Herradura o Jose Curevo ? " " Right-o ! " grinned Luigi , with all the assurance in the world that he was at last making himself understood in his own peculiar brand of Spanish . The waiter looked questioningly at Bill . " Herradura , " Bill spoke softly . " Y los oystiones , " asked the boy , " con salsa picante o suave ? " " Certainly-o , " said Luigi , " that 's absolutely right-o . " " Con salsa picante , " said Bill . The waiter looked long at Luigi and then inquired of Bill , " Es puro tonto Americano , no ? " " Si , " said Bill , " puro loco . " The boy went to prepare our orders . Luigi twiddled his thumbs for a moment and then inquired , " What did that son of a bitch say , Bill ? " " Well , first he wanted to know which brand of tequila you wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you wanted the oysters with or without hot sauce . Next he wondered why in hell I was traveling with an idiot like you that could n't speak English or Spanish , either one . " " Damn him ! " said Luigi good-naturedly . " I 'll whip his butt-o . " When the tequila sours appeared , the waiter grinned back at him . I was disappointed with the oysters . They were extremely small , black , and almost tasteless . The hot sauce helped to make them edible , but on the whole they were pretty poor imitations of the real thing . It was surprising that the waters around Guaymas , which produce the finest shrimp in the world , could offer nothingp128better in the way of bivalves . We each had a cold beer to wash them down . While we were finishing the beer , Captain Johnnie entered the building and approached our table . " Hi , amigo , " he greeted Luigi , " how were the girls-o ? " " Captain Lopez , sir , " responded Luigi with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this oysterino bar-o . " " Not only that-o , but I 'm the nicest guy here-o , " said Johnnie . " There speaks the pure Castilian , " said Luigi . " Bill , " said Johnnie , " you want the Pez Vela for tomorrow , no ? " " Yes , " answered Bill . " Bueno , how about right now I borrows the little motor boat from my fren Murillo and take you and your frens round the bay a little ? " " Bueno , " said I , endeavoring to imitate the speech of my old friend , Jesus . " Listo ! Let 's go ! " " There , " said Captain Johnnie , " speaks the puro Mexicano . Progress you have made , Pete , for once I understand you perfectly . " While he went to get the motor boat , we each had a tequila sour . Then we went down some mossy , slimy stairs from the pier to the waiting boat which was a small open job , with an asthmatic motor that required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to keep it in operation . As we chugged and coughed our way out from the pier and into the bay , I was interested in the number of fishing craft that were in the harbor . Some were nothing more or less than small dugouts , manned by two or three dark-skinned fishermen whose sole equipment was a rope about the size of a clothesline , to the end of which was attached a large iron hook . Johnnie said they used small fish for bait . Evidently they were quite successful , because those that were returning to shore were so loaded with totuava that they rode low in the water and a wave of any size wouldp129have filled them . Other fishing craft ranged all the way from small motor boats , such as that in which we were riding , to great trawlers , carrying seines wound upon huge spools at their stern , and equipped with donkey engines to haul the loaded nets aboard . The fishermen aboard all the various boats , whether great or small , waved and called a friendly greeting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very popular man in these waters . Soon we passed under the bow of a beautiful , white steam yacht , Old Glory proudly flying from her stern . She was owned , according to Captain Johnnie , by a wealthy movie producer from Los Angeles , who was spending a few weeks at the Playa to escape the California fog and the attention of numerous women who were reputedly in love with him . " He 's a nasty ole son of a bitch , " said the Captain . " Thinks ' cause he 's got money he can poosh folks around . Twice this week his anchor chain busts in two , most mysterious , and he loses a good anchor and has a hell of a time keeping off the ground . He ca n't poosh Mexican people around and not have that anchor chain bust or something else like that happen . Maybe next week some sand gets in the engine some way . I du n no . " Just beyond the yacht , there rode at anchor a motor ship of possibly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of paint . Her pumps were operating and she was pouring water into the bay at a great rate . " That 's the Amerika , " said Johnnie . " She belongs to the Danish East-Asiatic line . Used to be a very fine ship , before the war , but now she 's kind of gone to hell . " " What in the world is she doing here ? " I inquired , because I could see no reason for a Danish ship to be anchored in a Mexican port . " Comes for sardines , " said Johnnie . " Sardines ? Why , my goodness , there are surely plenty of sardines in Scandinavian waters ? " " Not so good over there any more , " said Johnnie , " too much disturbance during the war . Too many bombs and torpedoes and such-like . " " That 's right , " Bill put in , " and Mr. John Q. Public in thep130United States wo n't think of eating Mexican sardines . He has to have his imported from Scandinavia . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ole brother Garcia puts ' em in cans at his cannery , and the Danes tote ' em across the Atlantic , put labels on ' em and ship ' em back to the States , where good old John Q. Public buys ' em and likes ' em . Duty and all , he could probably get Mexican sardines for about six cents a can retail , but he would rather plunk out thirty-seven cents for ' em with a Danish label , and he does . It 's a great business . " " Look , " cried Johnnie , " there 's the Potosi and she 's getting up steam . You like to visit her before she leaves port ? " " Hell , yes ! " replied Bill . " Hell , no ! " spoke up Luigi . " I do n't go on board no Mexican gunboat . They love to shanghai Americans and make ' em pass coal all the way down to Acapulco . " " Luigi , " said Captain Johnnie reprovingly , " sometimes I think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to miss the opportunity of going aboard a ship of the Mexican Navy , and I hoped that Bill and not Luigi would prevail . However , there was no further argumentabout the matter . Captain Johnnie , ignoring Luigi 's protest , ran . alongside and hailed the Potosi , a trim cruiser , painted a dull gray and flying the Mexican tricolor at her stern . Smoke was pouring from her stacks , but her anchors were still fast in the bottom of the bay , and the chains taut . Johnnie 's hail was returned by a smart-looking young sentry , fully equipped with rifle and service belt , standing just atop a companionway that had not yet been raised and taken aboardship . Then there was a long exchange of fast and furious Spanish between them . I could not understand it , but I marveled at the carrying qualities of their voices . Those who live upon the sea learn to speak so that they may be heard despite wind or wave . The sentry blew upon a little silver whistle and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the second tar withdrew . Presently he returned , but this time there was a young naval officer with him , attired in the whitest of white uniforms.  | " Hi , Johnnie , " he called from the deck , in English , " bring your friends aboard and quit making so much racket . " Up the companionway we went , to be presented to Lieutenant Commander Estrada , the skipper of the Potosi , whom we found to be a most agreeable young man . He had received his education at Annapolis and spoke perfect English . He took great pride in showingus about the ship and we were impressed by its cleanliness , good order and modern equipment . The Potosi had anti-aircraft guns , cased in black rubber to keep off the salt spray , radar equipment , and , from her stern , could drop depth bombs upon any unlucky submarine that might be under the waters . The LieutenantCommander was justly proud of his command , but bewailed the smallness of his country 's Navy . " We have too few ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , if we just had one hundred more of these modern ships we would have exactly a hundred and two of them , and that would be more like a navy . " " Were you in the war ? " I inquired . " Sure , the Potosi darn near won the war all by herself . We patroled from Ensenada to Mazatlan , day after day , night after night . We never saw an enemy ship or heard an enemy plane . It got so boring that one day I turned the depth bombs loose on a whale . It ruined the poor fellow . That 's the only action the poor old Potosi ever saw . " I was very much interested in the uniforms worn by the enlisted men . They looked so much like those worn by the Americansailors that I wondered if Mexico had acquired them by the lend-lease route . " No , " said the skipper , when I inquired about them , " we have patterned our little Navy , even to uniforms and rank , to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same uniforms and their rank , whether they are enlisted , or hold warrants or commissions , corresponds exactly to that in the United States Navy . But , as I say , we do n't have enough men or enough ships . If we were ever attacked , we would have to rely upon you to defend us . " Viewed from the deck of the Potosi , the town of Guaymas , basking in the warm sunlight , appeared not unlike the picturesp132one sees of Casablanca in North Africa : low , square buildings of many hues , with the towers of the church rising behind them , and all completely overtopped by the red sandstone hills , reflected clearly in the blue waters of the bay . Then , too , one can not smell the city from that part of the harbor where the Potosi rode at anchor . Regretfully we said good-bye to the skipper and descended the companionway to our little motor boat . Chugging along past the fishing boats , and dodging under the bow of the movie magnate 's palatial yacht , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarked . " Put us ashore near the market , will you , Johnnie ? " askedBill . " I want Pete to see it and smell it . No trip to Guaymas is complete without a trip through that ole marketplace . " " Not me ! " yelled Luigi , " that 's where they take skunks to make ' em ashamed of themselves for not knowing how to really stink . " Nevertheless , when we landed at another little pier about half a mile from where we had left , Luigi was the first man ashoreand led the way down a dirty , unpaved street to the municipalmarket of Guaymas , an old , red-brick structure that covered an entire city block and created an odor that could have been noticed for at least the distance of a kilometer . Huge piles of tomatoes , papayas , onions , garlic , peppers , melons , and half-rotten bananas were everywhere about us . Customerswere loudly and angrily arguing with merchants ; children were crying ; flies buzzing ; and the place smelling to high heaven . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen enough . " No , sir , Pete , you have n't , " he replied , " wait until we get into the meat department . Then you 'll really see something . " But before we reached the meat department , we must walk through the pastry display . By actual count , there were exactly three times as many flies in the pastry department as we had encounteredaround the vegetable stalls . Also , there were twice as many children , most of them crying for a cookie , while their mothers argued about the high cost of living.  |p133Just  as we were leaving pastries and stepping into the meat market , where great strings of raw and bloody meats were hanging from iron hooks and where the flies congregated in greater density than anywhere else , Curly inquired : Bill , how is it you say can ' in this country ? " " Excusado , " said Bill . " Excusado ! " yelled Curly at the top of his voice . " Where in hell is the excusado ? " And away he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding his jaw with one hand and waving the other wildly about . While Curly was thus engaged in searching for the toilet , Bill found one in a corner of the vegetable department . It was presided over by an elderly lady clad entirely in black and wearing a mantilla . She charged one American cent for use of the equipment . Bill cautioned her to be sure to collect her money in advance from Curly because , as he said , " That guy is always going around copping a free crap , whenever he can . " The lady assured him she was in no mood to be cheated . Curly soon appeared on a dead run , his belt unfastened , holding up his trousers with one hand and his jaw with the other . He was met by the stern guardian of the privy , who demanded her pay in advance . He tendered her a peso while he jumped first on one foot and then on the other and yelled , " God-amighty , woman , get out of my way ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to walk away , after saying something to Bill . " What the hell ? " demanded Curly , now grabbing his pants with both hands and forgetting to hold his jaw . " Where in hell is she going ? Tell her this is important ! " " Be ye patient , " counseled Bill quietly , " she is merely going to the bank to get your change . " " Oh , Christ , " wailed the poor Curly . " Let her keep the whole damn peso . This is important ! In just about a second , I 'll need a change worse than she does ! " After Curly had emerged from the excusado , we left the market by way of the pottery and basket department . I had seen better in Woolworth 's basement.  | " Let 's go over to the Albin and have a nice steak , " said Bill as we walked along the dusty street . " They get their meat fresh from the market and it ought to be good . " I gagged . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small drink , just at this time , was more definitely indicated than a large meal . The aroma of the marketplace persistedfor several blocks . At my suggestion we stopped at the post office , where I received a collect wire from judge Leviton which read , " YouDRUNKARD YOU IRRESPONSIBLE NINCOMPOOP IT IS LATER THAN YOU THINK YOU WERE FIRED A WEEK AGO . " For some unknown reason , I was not particularly distressed by the contents of the telegram . Bill was elated . He insisted that we celebrate my " emancipation . " Bill , I believe , would always welcome an opportunity to celebrate something . We went from there to the Club Tropical , a little saloon surrounded by green lattice work , with red-flowered vines climbingall over the exterior . It was a low place , patronized chiefly by more or less drunken , though extremely friendly , fishermen and sailors . The bartender , however , was a fat little lady , whom I would guess to be about twenty years old . She wore red slacks and a green blouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , she reminded me of Miss Collins , the receptionist at the office back in New York . Her white teeth glistened as she smiled constantly at one and all of her customers . She was cute and she knew it . She also knew how best to get along with her loud and boisterous customers . Best of all , she knew how to prepare Wild Cows . We had several . Some of the Danish sailors from the Amerika came in wearingred sweaters and dirty tan pants . Though they spoke no Spanish , they seemed to get along well with the rowdies present and were soon buying mescal for the Mexicans , who reciprocated by purchasing beer for the Danes . I switched from Wild Cows to tequila sours . Later on I decided to try the beer . It made me very , very sleepy . The noise of the saloon seemed to recede and diminish ....  |p135I  awakened , late at night , safe in bed on the front porch of the cottage at the beach . The snores of my companions set every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bay might help me so , naked as I was , I staggered to the water 's edge . A considerable portion of the lovely bay was polluted with the refreshments I had taken earlier in the evening . For some time I lay on the sand , shivering and shaking , but finally I made my way back to the cottage porch . The gentle breeze from the sea was neither cooling nor refreshing . I decided to make my way to the kitchen , where I drank a fair-sized glass of the Waterfil-Frazier mixed with cold water . I felt somewhat better . Some time in the early morning , after twisting and tossing for hours , I must have fallen asleep.  |p136Pancho  was shaking me gently by the shoulder , and holding a steaming cup of some foul-smelling liquid under my nose . " Here , gentleman , " he pleaded , " drink this like good gentleman . Puts back the lining on your inner tubes you burned off with that old tequila yesterday . " I drank it . It tasted terrible , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Pancho ? " I inquired shakily . " Hot clams juice , fresh from out of the can . Best thing in the world when your insides are all raw like yours are . " He was right . I soon drank another cup and was then able to eat a little toast . Bill and the others , who had already had their breakfast , were clamoring to get started on the fishing trip that had been planned for the day . I thought they had better leave me to rest at the cottage , but they persuaded me otherwise.  |p137We  drove to town and met Johnnie at the pier , where he had brought the Pez Vela , which , according to Bill , gave us several more hours of fishing time than if we had waited for the boat to come all the way from Guaymas to the beach . Once aboard the good Pez Vela , I scrambled up atop the cabin , where I lay on my back in the warm sunshine , while the boat rocked so gently it seemed to quiet my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my back and knew instantly when the speed was reduced and Joe and Luigi started to fish . Luigi and Joe had no luck . No one seemed to be having good fortune that morning . Johnnie , from time to time , would hail a returning dugout and ask about their catch . " Nadal " was the inevitable reply , while the fisherman would hold his fingers in the form of a circle to indicate that the extent of their catch was zero . A trawler , riding high in the water , approached from the west . When we were abreast it , Bill called out , " Que suerte , amigos ? " " No bueno , " yelled back one of the crew . Then he and Bill conversed rapidly in Spanish . " He says , " announced Bill , " that the totuava have departed for parts unknown . Seems some drunken American feller puked in the bay last night and scared hell out of ' em . " I did not blush . I knew Bill was prevaricating . The Mexican sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , " spoke up Captain Johnnie . " Too short a season for totuava . Most generally they stay three or four weeks . This time six days only . Maybe means a change in the weather . Those damn totuava can smell a storm coming a hundred miles away . " " Let 's nigger fish for pinta , " suggested Bill . But we had no bait and the pinta will not strike at a number seven spinner . A long , bright green shrimp boat , carrying a heavy cargo and riding low in the water , was approaching from the west , and Johnnie hailed her . Immediately after her engines stopped , we came around the stern and alongside her port . A rope was dropped over her side , which Nacho grabbed and held onto , while Juanitop138put an old automobile casing between the craft to keep from scraping the brilliant paint on the side of the shrimper . The crew , burned black by the sun , and wearing nothing but shorts and sea caps , were in vast good humor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each of them would receive a substantial cash dividend when the cargo was unloaded at the cannery . Their captain was a tall , slender , well-proportioned young fellow . His sole mark of rank was a golden anchor upon the front of his cap . " Look , amigo , " called Johnnie , " how about selling us about a gallon of shrimp for pinta baits ? " " We loves to , " replied the shrimper , " but ca n't do ect . We belongs to the cooperativa . We signs contract . Do n't sell no shreemps except through heem . Ca n't do eet . Sorry like hell but we gets fined five thousan ' pesos we sells any shreemps to anybodybut them cooperativa . " " Well , give us a few for free , " suggested Johnnie . " Ca n't do eet , " yelled the shrimper , now almost in tears because he could not accommodate his friend , " the laws of the cooperativa do n't let us even geeve them shreemps away . Ca n't do nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them board from directors . " We were without further suggestion or remedy when a member of the crew , a very young , curly-headed boy , called out to us , in good English , " But look , friends , if you call us bad names , we can become very angry and throw the shrimp at you . " " Bueno ! " yelled the shrimper captain . " Good idea , cuss hell out of us , Johnnie , we get mad as hell and throw them shreemps all over you . " We let fly with such an outburst of profanity , in both English and Spanish , that instantly we were showered with large , wriggling , slick and slimy shrimp , which we quickly gathered into a box . Amid the laughter and curses of our friends , the shrimp fishers , we cast off and started down the coast . Soon I learned what Bill had meant by the term nigger fishing . ' Johnnie took the boat in just as close to the rocks as hep139possibly could with safety , then cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily weighted with lead . They were dropped overboard until they touched bottom , then reeled in five or six feet . We waited while the boat rocked gently and drifted slightly away from the shore . Soon Joe had a strike , his line ran out rapidly and he quickly reeled it in , a pinta well hooked and threshing around in the water with all the energy of which it was capable . The pinta is what I would have called a rock bass , although Bill said that on the Pacific coast they are known as black bass . The one Joe had brought in weighed possibly two pounds . It had a white belly and light brown sides and back , speckled with spots of darker brown . During the morning we caught many pinta , some red snappers , and a few cabrilla . They would weigh , according to my best estimate , from about a pound and a half to four pounds . Personally , I preferred to catch totuava . Johnnie cooked some of the smaller pinta for lunch and they were delicious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the market ! After luncheon , Luigi and I fished together for a little while . We had about equal luck until Luigi hooked and brought in a bright yellow fish , about the size of a dinner plate . I had never seen anything like it . " Look here-o , Johnnie , " he called , " what in hell have I done now-o ? " " It 's the King Cabrilla , " said Johnnie . " Only about one a year is ever caught in these waters . Whoever gets one will certainly have good fortune all the rest of his life . " That spoiled Luigi . For the next hour , he must take the fish around to each of the party and to the crew and explain how he knew just what he was doing when he caught it . In fact , according to him , the King Cabrilla was the only fish he was out after that day . It took an extra-smart man to find one and land it . His grandiose bragging grew very boring . I hoped that Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-placed verbal thrusts , but poor Bill , through some source or other , had contracted dysentery , and had to spend most of the afternoon in the littlep140toilet at the bow of the boat , swearing and otherwise relieving himself . Luigi then discovered a small , square hatch , immediately over the toilet , which could be removed with ease , permitting those upon deck to obtain an ample view of the sufferer within . Swiftly , then , Luigi went below , locked the toilet door from the outside , bounced out above deck again , removed the hatch , and proceeded to accuse Bill of fraud and deception in connection with the numbers that had been worn by the mascaritas the night of the gran baile municipal . " Now , Bill ! " exclaimed Luigi , dancing up and down in his excitement , " I have you at my mercy ! You shall pay for your sins on the night of the baile dance , when you told Pete and me those numbers was from the lottery-o . While I have you down there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urinate-o all over your goddam head-o ! " So saying , he proceeded to pour a bottle of warm beer upon the head and shoulders of the unfortunate Bill , who , being confined within the toilet by the very nature of his illness as well as by the lock upon the toilet door , was powerless to protect himself . Nor could he be certain just what liquid was drenching him . He employed language that was even more vigorous than that by which we had acquired the shrimp . Luigi was elated . " I told you I 'd get back at that son of a bitch-o , " he chortled . As much as I had wanted to revenge myself upon Bill for the tricks he had played upon me , I could not help but feel sorry for him at the present moment . We decided to return to Guaymas , although Curly and Joe left their lines in the water , trailing in the wake of the boat , in the hope that they might get a strike on the way in . I climbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relax . Johnnie guided the craft . Nacho and Juanito joined me on the cabin roof . While Juanito lay down beside me to rest , Nacho squatted on his haunches , puffing away at a cigarette . The day was perfect . The Pez Vela slipped through the clear , blue waters of the gulf , under a sapphire sky , and with just thep141faintest touch of a breeze from the east . I remarked to Juanito that never before , although I was somewhat familiar with small craft and fishing waters , had I observed such a perfect combination of air , sky and water . " Most generally , " he replied , " she is just like this , but once in a while comes up a by-God chabusco storm and she change pretty by-God fast . Do n't last no more as ten minutes , maybe , but raise more hell than wild bull in Sunday School . " Shortly thereafter , I observed what at first appeared to be a cloud of dust in the west . I paid little attention to it until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light breeze that had made the day so delightful . " Look , Juanito , " I remarked , " that peculiar cloud over there , near the other side , it looks like it is traveling against the wind . " Juanito rolled over and sprang to his feet , all in one movement , his hand pointing westward , " Chabusco , Papacito ! " he yelled at the top of his voice . " Jesus Cristo and all his kids ! " Johnnie yelled back . " Chabusco ! Reel in quick , Curly , reel in quick , Joe . Take the wheel , Juanito . Nacho , you . . . . " Here he broke into such rapid-fire Spanish I could not hope to follow him . The rolling of the Pez Vela , which had been so gentle , now was a little more pronounced , but there was still nothing to occasion such preparation for a storm as Johnnie was making . Presides , we were not over a mile from shore . The whole performanceappeared ridiculous . Suddenly the breeze dropped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnnie was busy lashing down the stern chairs , so that they could not turn in their sockets . The engine was purring along beautifully and we were making splendid progress toward the shore . Juanito , standing at the wheel , looked worried . I decided to go down from my perch atop the cabin and kid him out of it . Instantly , the sunlight was blotted out by the dust-colored cloud that had appeared so small and innocent when I had first observed it in the west . The wind whistled from every point on the compass . The little friendly waves that had lapped at ourp142sides all day were now the size of mountains . I almost fell from the cabin roof , but was grabbed by Johnnie and thrust through the cabin door . " Get below , Pete , into the cabin , " he yelled , and I could scarcely hear him because of the wind . I stumbled down the short stairway into the cabin , vainly trying to grab anything for support . The Pez Vela , like a little dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mercy , then , flap , down she went upon her belly . I fell flat upon the cabin floor . Johnnie locked the door from the outside . Luigi , Joe , Curly , and Nacho were being tossed about from side to side and end to end of the cabin , amid such of the movables as Nacho had not been able to secure . The gasoline stove smashed down from its perch in the galley and thereafter clanged about like it was mad at the whole proceeding . A thin stream of gasoline found its way into the cabin proper . Nacho was visibly frightened . Whenever he could hold still long enough , he crossed himself and prayed in Spanish . Bill , within the toilet at the bow , was cursing dreadfully . Luigi 's dark skin had turned green , and Curly was having great difficulty keeping his teeth in place . Joe , the quiet one , appeared quite happy . Somewhere he had picked up a pencil and paper . These he held onto , no matter how roughly he was being banged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling , he yelled , " Wills written here , five dollars American . Get your will drawn . Do n't drown intestate . Five dollars American will see that your estate is properly disposed of . " By this time the Pez Vela was gyrating , standing on her stern , and plunging into the trough , almost all at the same time . I was thrown against the side of the table and hurt my head quite badly . " Get your will drawn ! " yelled Joe . " Next time you get a knock like that it 'll kill you . Do n't die without a will . Five dollars American assures safe disposition of the estate . " " Shut up ! " screamed Luigi . " God damn it , we 're pretty nearly dead now and you carry on that way . I hope to God the sharks do n't eat me before I drown . "  |p143Bang  , shudder , crack  --  the Pez Vela , too , was voicing her protest . She rolled almost completely over . " Hell amighty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of the little glass-covered porthole , I could see the shore , a sandstone cliff almost covered with cacti . It did not appear to be more than twenty feet away . We were broadside to it , our engine racing , with the propeller out of the water most of the time , while the boat was being carried nearer and nearer the rocks . Luigi was down on his knees , holding to the table in an effort to maintain his balance . " I swear , " he screamed , " if I live through this , I will never whore any more or drink any more . I will be a good man and put five peso dollars in the plate every Sunday . This is no B. S. I mean it . " Just at that time , we climbed a mountainous wave , and smashed down into the trough with such force and violence that I thought surely the bottom of the boat would split . Then up on her stern she rose again , pawed the air a second , and then went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried , the boat seeming to be almost on its side half the time ; pots , pans , fishing tackle , furniture , passengers and crew all being thrown about without regard to dignity or destiny . I was too sick to be too frightened , but I certainly did not feel as happy and gay as Joe . Then once more we swung around . Now , however , the propellerwas biting into the water . We were moving away from the cliffs , the waves were subsiding , although the boat still rocked and plunged like a mad thing . But each roll was a little less drastic , each pitch a little less dramatic . Johnnie opened the cabin door and a great draught of fresh air rushed in . The chabusco had passed . Not a drop of rain had fallen . " Hooray , " yelled Luigi . " Where 's the tequila bottle ? " Withouta thought to his solemn pledge of only a few minutes ago , he went down under the bench where the bottles had rolled , retrieved one , jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long drag . We all followed his example . Even Johnnie had one . Both Johnnie and Juanito were wet to the skin from the waves that hadp144broken over them on deck . Both were shivering from cold and excitement . Bill emerged from the toilet , pale and shaken . His nose was bleeding from contact with the toilet door . Blood had dripped onto his shirt . He smelled terribly of the beer that Luigi had poured upon him and which had dried upon his clothes and person . In a pathetic effort to appear bold and gay , he suggested we should celebrate our deliverance from death by drowning , so we all had another drag from the tequila bottle . Bill could usually be counted upon to think of something to celebrate . We found our way out upon deck and breathed in the pure air . Soon our little boat rounded the lighthouse and rode into the harbor . The water was calm and clear . Fishing craft and ships rode quietly at anchor . We landed at the little pier near the oyster bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the boat had done . We were too tired and sick and beaten up by the storm to visit any of the night spots . We returned to our cottage at the beach , had a few tequila sours , and pecked away at a delicious chicken dinner Pancho had prepared for us . After dinner we had a few brandies , but we were all very quiet . No one wanted to sing , no one cared to talk . Even Luigi was silent . The bed on the porch felt very good to me.  |p145Although  completely exhausted , I could not sleep . The storm had done something to me , not only physically but psychologically . Not even the number of drinks I had taken that evening had served to restore the light-heartedness and carefree feeling I had experienced before the storm . Whereas only yesterday I had considered my telegraphic dismissal from judge Leviton 's employ as more or less of a joke , now it seemed a major disaster . Through my own misconduct I had thrown away my chance of ever becoming a junior partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of " irresponsible nincompoops , " as judge Leviton would have termed them . But were they irresponsible ? I could not be sure . They each held some office or practiced some profession , apparently with sufficient success to be able to take a trip south whenever theyp146were so minded . What about me ? I was about down to my last dollar , and without hope of employment . Good Lord ! What would my father say if he knew of my present predicament ? I felt somewhat like the chabusco . I had a few days of hell-raising and now I wanted to calm down too abruptly . What 's the matter with me , anyhow ? My head hurts . Guess I 'll get up and get a slug . No , only real drunkards get up at night to take a short shot for their nerves . I 'm no drunkard . I 'm just too damn tired to sleep , that 's all . Guess I 'll count the stars out over the bay . No , I 'm too tired for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway ? Guess I would do it again , if I had the chance . Hell , I 'm too confused to know what I am thinking about . I imagine I slept some during the night , but it was not the refreshing slumber that I really needed . It was worried , broken and restless . I could still feel the Pez Vela rolling and plunging . I could still sense that I should not have taken this trip . When I arose in the morning I was still tired , physically and mentally . Bill said as we were having breakfast that I had " butterfliesin the bowels , " and such a diagnosis seemed apt . But I was not the only one the storm had affected . It had taken the spirit out of the party . Bill announced that he must return to Tucson , because a vision had appeared to him in the night and announced that he had a cash client awaiting him at the office . The others , too , were ready and willing to return to their jobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination . " Cheer up , " said Bill , " you have a beautiful future behind you . " I then employed language of which I am now ashamed . Luigi and Curly went into town to purchase some gifts to give their families when returned to the States . I lay upon the porch bed and , although I did not weep , I could find no ray of sunshine in the entire cloudy aspect . Bill brought me a whiskey highball . I drank it and felt better . He prepared another , which I consumed and felt much better.  |p147The  third was composed of whiskey with just a dash of water , and I felt very good indeed . The butterflies departed . My hands were steady . I went in and had a warm shower while I sang , rather beautifully , " Singing in the Rain , " which I had learned many years before . I then shaved my face carefully and thoroughly . The mirror disclosed that I was really a nice-appearing , though somewhat tanned and bruised , gentleman . Soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . " The Hasta Mariana is in port , " he gasped . " Curly is bringing Maria over for lunch . " Joe , who had been asleep on the floor , came to life . " Damn ! " he said . " That 's fine . " Bill grinned , and began to stroke his stubble of a beard , a gesture I had learned was indicative of his intention to shave . " What , " I said in an inquiring voice , " is the Hasta Mariana , and who , may I make so bold as to ask , is Maria ? " " The Hasta Mariana , " said Bill , " is a shark-fishing boat . Her skipper is a lady by the name of Maria Ilena Martinez Quong . She holds a Master 's Certificate and can pilot any craft in these waters . She is half-Chinese , half-Hawaiian , half-Mexican , one hundred per cent American , half-angel and half-devil . The record may show that I reserve the right to worship her . " I had , by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so without further inquiry , I determined to await the coming of Maria and learn of her identity at firsthand . Soon the Buick appeared , and out stepped Curly . He strode around the hood , opened the right-hand door and assisted his passenger to alight . The girl was tiny and exquisite , attired in a frock of some soft , light , cream-colored cloth . She appeared about the age of a high school senior , or perhaps a college freshman . She had clear ivory skin , delicate features , coal-black hair , and slightly almond eyes . Her smile disclosed the reason Bill had said she was halfangel . It was plain that all of my companions reserved the right , as had Bill , to look upon her with something akin to awe.  |p148I  was presented . She placed her little hand in mine and spoke softly , in English , her eyes holding mine steadily . " Hi , Pete , " she said . I made a mental reservation of my right , too , to worship at her shrine . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no point to the conversation , until Pancho announced lunch . In honor of Maria , no doubt , he first served some sort of cold , orange-colored drink . We toasted Maria , who did not touch her drink , but spoke rapidly in Spanish to Pancho , who repaired immediately to the kitchen and returned with a bottle of WaterfilFrazierwhiskey . Maria took the bottle neck in her dainty , doll-like hands , threw back her head , and the raw whiskey gurgled down her lovely throat . " I am sorry , gentlemen , " she apologized , " I can not appreciate those namby-pamby drinks . If I am going to relax in your hospitality , I must have a drink that has some authority . " We all laughed politely and the bottle was passed around to each of us . Pancho slyly opened another and handed it to Maria . We each had a few sips and then were ready for luncheon . I do not remember of what the meal consisted . My entire being was drawn to the beautiful child who ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity , and charm personified . Occasionally , in telling of some of her experiences , she would lapse into sealanguagethat was picturesque and pretty forceful . Luncheon finished , we spent the afternoon talking and taking an occasional drink out of the Waterfil-Frazier bottle . During the course of the conversation I remarked , quite sincerely I thought , that I was glad to have had the opportunity of visiting Mexico . Instantly Bill , who was feeling his drinks somewhat , launched forth upon a tirade : " Visited Mexico ! Why , you poor , ignorant  --  uto , you ai n't visited nuthin ! You 've seen a little part of three or four towns in this most underdeveloped frontier state of Sonora , and that 's all . You came down here for siesta and fiesta , and you 've been getting just that . " Lemme tell you , I know the progress these people have madep149and I know it has n't been caused by fellers like you and me , who spend their time and energy and money supporting the slums instead of viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit the Yaqui Valley , and drive on up to Alamos , and some time go across on that Godawfulroad from Santa Ana to Penasco and visit the old , authentic missions at Caborca and Altar . When you have spent six months in Sonora , and stayed reasonably sober part of the time , and have done your best to see the sights that are here to see , then you can say you have visited it ; and , when you have actually been to the Valley of Mexico , climbed Orizaba , Popocateptl and Ixtacihuatl , and looked at the pyramids , and have gone over west and watched Paracutin spouting fire and lava , and have gone down through the jungle country , and have come back to Taxco and Acapulco , and across the lake region around Guadalajara , and spent three or four years living with the people and have tried to understand their hunger for education and recognition  --  then , you can say you have visited Mexico . " I do n't often get strung out this way , Pete , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ten years , in spite of bastards like you and me , this country has made more progress than it made in the three hundred years before then , and the reason why the people have progressed so much is because they have wanted to , and wanted to so damn earnestly that they have accomplished miracles . " Do you know that in this whole damn desert state there is no town , no pueblo , no village or settlement , so small or so poor that it does not have the advantage of a modern , free public school , and that the kids are taught English from the first grade on up ? Gim me that bottle ! " " Well , " I remarked , somewhat apologetically because I had observed that Bill had perhaps imbibed a little too freely and was not in his usual friendly mood , " I would like to see more of the country than I have been able to thus far . " I remembered , naturally , that the idea of the victory trip had originated with Bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I pleading for judge Leviton . Then the little Maria spoke forth . " Look here , Pete , you ship with me for the return voyage to San Pedro . The trip will do you good and you can really learn what a shark-fisher is like . Maybe you can see a little more of Mexico , too . " I was so astonished , pleased and confused by the offer that I could feel the blood rushing to my face as I attempted to make some suitable reply . " But , Miss Quong .... " I stammered . " You do that very thing , gentleman , " interrupted Pancho , very seriously . " Best thing you can do . And you , Miss Maria , you take good care of my gentleman . He is nice and he needs good care . You find he 's a little crazy , but very nice . Fish work do him good . " " That 's right , " chimed in Curly . " You 're feeling sorry for yourself right now , Pete , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous guy . You get in some good hard work on the fishing boat and you 'll feel like a new man . " " What do you think , Bill ? " I inquired . " I do n't want to be a burden to Miss Quong . " " Hell , you take her up , " replied Bill . " Ole Captain , she 'll work hell out of you and pay you damn little for it besides . " Maria smiled broadly at Bill 's remark , and it was the prettiest smile I had ever seen . " Lemme talk to you in private , " suggested Luigi , so we made our excuses and stepped into one of the bedrooms . " How you fixed for dinero money , Pete ? " asked Luigi , almost shyly , when we were alone . " I 'm just about broke now , " I confessed . " Of course , I have some small savings back in New York , but my ready cash is about used . " " I thought so , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You take this hundred and you send it back to me whenever you can . You 'll need a little dough for a tip to Pancho and to buy a few drinks in town before you leave . You do n't wantp151to sail away from good old Guaymas without a few peso dollars in your pocket . " " But , Luigi , " I protested , " let me give you a note or a check or something . " " To hell with you , you bastardo ! " he returned , and darted out of the bedroom . He was as embarrassed as I was . I remained to open the envelope , which I had assumed contained a hundred pesos , or about twelve dollars . Instead , it containedthree twenty-dollar bills and four hundred pesos in notes of various denominations . When Luigi had said " a hundred " he was speaking in terms of American dollars . I went into the bathroom to wash my face and get a little under control . I had always considered Luigi as the most irresponsibleof " nincompoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stumbled back onto the porch and rejoined the party , where I accepted Maria 's offer and agreed to become an ordinary seaman aboard the Hasta Mariana , under the command of Captain Quong , that Linda Mujer , who appeared at first glance a shy little girl , but whose vocation was the catching of sharks and the tearing out of their livers for vitamins . I said good-bye to Pancho and slipped him a little of the money Luigi had loaned me . He grinned as he thanked me . " You 'll be back , gentleman , " he said . " Everybody always come back to Guaymas . Stinks like hell , like you say , but always people come back . I see you next year , I bet you . " We all piled into the Buick and drove to the office of the United States Consul , which was contained in a faded yellow frame building that looked very much as does a railroad station in a small town . The good old Stars and Stripes flew from a staff just in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined office and living room , furnished after the fashion of the late nineteenth century , sat the Consul , behind a well-worn rolltop desk strewn with papers of all kinds and dimensions . He was as bald as Curly and he wore a white shirt with a linen collar and black shoestring tie . I am sure it was the same collar that was worn by the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he was a candidate for Vicep152President back in 1920 . The learned representative of our State Department said he was charmed , but his manner indicated how bored he was at my introduction . He looked at me with very evident disapproval , while Captain Quong paid him some small fee and he placed some official stamps upon a paper , signed it with a great flourish , and handed it to her . His expression seemed to indicate that he hoped I would drown while a member of the shark-fishing expedition . Then , we went to a big , brown stone building near the waterfrontto visit two other offices . I signed additional papers and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affixed stamps to documents and collected some money from the Captain . At the second of such offices , that of the Jefe del Departmento de Hacienda , some difficulty arose between the Captain and the Mexican officer , a young , pompous and overbearing fellow , clad in a white uniform and smoking a cigarette through a foot-long , carved-ivory holder . He sat at his desk  --  in fact he had not even risen when Maria entered  --  and delivered some ultimatum in Spanish . Maria attempted to remonstrate and he endeavored to dismiss her with a wave of his cigarette holder . I did not understandany of their conversation but apparently the official 's gesture provoked her for she suddenly changed from a sweet , smiling schoolgirl into a hundred and two pounds of atomic energy . She did not argue . She cursed in rapid Spanish and demanded ! The official wilted before my astonished eyes , spread his hands , shrugged his shoulders and endeavored to apologize . Still the torrent of vituperative abuse gushed forth . He dropped his cigarette , seized a pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instantly she was all graciousness and charm . " What , " I later inquired of her , " was the argument about ? " " There was no argument , " she told me calmly . " That gentlemanthought I could not sign you on unless you had a birth certificate . I explained to him that such a document was un-necessary . " Then , over a rou , uh road , we must drive to the lower end of town , where the Hasta Mariana , a long , low , black ship , with wide stern and narrow bow , lay alongside a small wharf , pumpingp153oil into her tanks under the supervision of her first officer , one Einar Thude , as handsome a Dane as ever sailed the sea . Although of at least middle age , he was slender and straight as an arrow . His blond curly hair was unconfined , and his only clothing appeared to be a pair of old blue trousers . The wind and sun had not burned his skin but rather turned it to a rich , light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of tiny wrinkles , peered at our party as we clopped up the wharf and climbed aboardship . He reached down a long arm and helped each of us aboard . Puffing away at a short black pipe , he nodded pleasantlyas we were introduced . He spoke very little but seemed very happy to have visitors aboard . When he learned that I was to be signed on as a member of the crew , his smile widened . " We 'll make a sailor out of this fellow before we reach La Paz , " he assured the party . " You make anything at all out of him and you get the grand prize , " asserted Luigi . " You come along with us , " responded Mr. Thude , " we need shark bait pretty bad . " " You need a first mate more bad-o , " was apparently the only reply Luigi could think of . Maria and I left the others chatting by the rail , while we went forward to the cabin , where I inscribed my name in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . In the next column after my name , Captain Ouong wrote " deck hand . " It was not a very high-sounding title . The cabin on a fisher , as distinguished from other ships , is placed well forward , because the afterdeck is needed for the fishermen and for the hatches leading to the huge tanks that hold the catch . The Hasta Mariana , being a shark-fisher , did not require such large tanks , as only the livers were saved , the rest of the carcass being returned to the deep whence it came . Our ship , I noticed , was about a hundred ten feet in length , with a beam of perhaps fifteen , and draft of about eight . She was Diesel-powered , which permitted her operation by a very small crew . The cabin contained , at the bow end , the wheelhouse , abaft which were the quarters for officers and crew , followed by the galley and messp154hall , the latter being somewhat of a misnomer because not more than four people could possibly be fed there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had signed the book , consisted of two small rooms with a light bulkhead between . I assumed one of them was her bedroom , the other more or less of a business office , equipped with a highly varnished , though otherwise plain , table , two small chairs , a bookcase filled with works upon navigation , some best-sellers and a few classics , a filing case and a small radio . The charts and log , I imagined , were kept in the wheelhouse forward . Mr. Thude , I learned , had a room to himself ; each of the others shared one with a shipmate . There was no common room or forecastle , for the crew was so small that such quarters were unnecessary . I remarked to the Captain that Mr. Thude had appeared to me to be a real sailor . " He certainly is , " she replied . " I would trust Einar to pilot me through a storm on a black night along a wholly unknown coast and with his eyes blindfolded and one hand tied behind him , sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Guaymas to the lighthouse on a bright , sunny day . " " I am a little surprised to see such a competent man on a little ship like this , " I observed . " Why , Pete ? He likes this kind of life , and so he does it . I believe he is happier on my little sharker than he would be in command of a liner . " I could not quite understand such an attitude , but I resolved to say no more about it . Coming from the cabin to rejoin my friends at the rail , we met the engineer , Jose Astiazaran , a bright , intelligent young Mexican , brown as old leather , and wearing only a pair of shorts and a sea cap . He carried an oil can and a handful of waste . Apparently he had just come up from an inspection of his engines . He was a rather sober , dignified boy , almost shy , but welcomed me by a very firm and friendly handshake . The two expert shark-fishermen , Pedro Gonzales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably gettingp155pie-eyed , " said Captain Quong . " I do n't mind . They 'll sober up before we sail very far , and they have nothing whatever to do with operating the ship . " The cook was asleep , so we did not disturb hiin . At the rail , Captain Quong said good-bye to my companions , each of whom held her hand a little longer than I thought necessary . Luigi looked at her like a moonstruck calf . " You go with them , Pete , " she said to me , " but be back here before three in the morning , Mexican time . I am going to get under way right on the dot and if you are late you wo n't sail  --  the Mexicans will know you have jumped ship and they will keep you in jail until I get back here next year . " Although she smiled sweetly as she spoke , her tone was such that I was firmly resolved to be aboard well in advance of the appointed hour.  |p156Down  the wharf we walked , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " asked Curly , seating himself behind the wheel . " We 'll have to celebrate Pete 's good luck , " spoke up Bill . " Let 's go back to the Tropical and have a few Wild Cows . " " No Wild Cows , Bill , " I protested . " I never throw one that does n't get up later and throw me . I get to taste them coming and going , and they sure wreck me . " " Say , now , " said Joe , " that Mr. Thude says you can get some wonderful broiled lobsters and avocado salad at that little oyster bar we went to the other day . How does that sound ? " Luigi smacked his lips . " Sounds fine-o to me , but takes too long to cook those lobsterinos . " " Hell , " said Bill , " we can have a few tequila sours while we are waiting for ' em . O.K. , Pete ? "  | " O.K. Bill . Bueno ! Listo ! Let 's gol " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again it was devoid of customers . Bill explained our wants to the waiter . Golly , how good those tequila sours tasted . The very first one warmed my interior and I began to live again . By the time the lobsters and salad were ready , we all felt good . The food was delicious and there was a nice white wine to go with it . I prolonged the meal as much as I could . This would be the last of the good times with my friends and I wanted to enjoy it to the very fullest . No one could know what sort of time I might expect aboard the shark-fisher . We refused to eat sliced pineapple for dessert , but accepted the coffee and brandy the waiter brought . Then down the pier we walked , a little unsteady but happy as a group could possibly be . Bill began to sing a song : " My sweetheart 's a mule in a mine , I drive her without rein or line . On the dashboard I sit , and tobacco I spitAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ought to keep still , because he might be disturbingthe peace of the municipality of Guaymas . He immediatelysubsided , remarking , however , that I was " too dumb to appreciate good , classical music . " Near the shore end of the pier , where the water was quite shallow , some benches had been placed back to back , lengthwise of the pier , so that whoever sat upon them had a good view either up or down the bay . We decided to sit down and rest . " This , " I said , " will probably be my last view of the harbor of Guaymas . " " Take a good sniff-o , " said Luigi , " it may be your last smell of it , too . " " Hell , no ! " scoffed Bill . " Remember what Pancho told you . We 'll all meet here again next spring and you 'll catch the biggest totuava of the bunch . " " But not the most intelligent , " insisted Luigi , " it takes me to catch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " suggested Curly ; but beforep158we could carry his idea into operation there appeared upon the shore , and coming our way along the pier , a very strange-appearing couple indeed , at least for these parts . The man was probably in his late forties , broad-shouldered , big and powerful . He wore a white linen suit , with double-breasted coat , and dark blue tie . Upon his head was a pith helmet , such as lion-hunters wear in Africa . His shoes were of white suede and , in spite of the dirt and dust of Guaymas , appeared spotless . His features were heavy and coarse ; a coal black , closely-clipped moustache adorned the space beneath a tremendous nose . His black eyes were placed closely together ; his lips were thin and tightly compressed . The girl with him was tall and thin and appeared about half the age of her companion . She wore a long pink and gold dress , of the " new look " variety , and carried a pink and gold parasol . Little of her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hair , however , was of a beautiful auburn shade and appeared to be natural . She clung to her companion 's arm as though apprehending that someone might abduct him in broad daylight . As they drew near I said , as softly as possible , " I 'll bet it 's the movie magnate who pooshes ' people around . " " Right ! " murmured Bill . Neither of them heard us , but they soon observed us and stopped directly in front of our bench . " See , Mickey deah , " said the man to his companion in a loud , arrogant voice , and without regard to our feelings , " there are your typical beachcombers . I told you , if you made this voyage with me , you would get more material than if you went with Sam to Hawaii . " " Oh , Dahling , are n't they wonderful ! Could you get them to say something for me , deah ? " " Certainly , " he replied , very self-assured , then walked over to within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's your name , fellow ? " " Bill , sir , " replied my companion , softly and meekly . " What do you do , hey ? " " I 'm an escaped convict , " said Bill , seriously and softly  | " Oh , Dahling , how perfectly thrilling , " gurgled the girl . " Make him say some more , Precious . " " Is that true ? " demanded " Dahling " of Bill . " Yes , sir , I broke out of Folsom last year and came down here . Guaymas do n't have no extradition treaty with the U.S. , and as long as I 'm here , I 'm safe from the bulls . " " Oh , how exquisite , " cooed the redhead . " What was he in for , Dahling ? " " What were you in for ? " " Oh , sir , I was innocent , " replied Bill . " I was framed . They never had a thing on me , but they convicted me of cuttin ' my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea lions at the zoo . " " Dahling " wheeled abruptly on me . " And you , fellow , what do you do ? " " Sir , " I replied , with all the dignity I could muster , " I am a minister of the gospel . Do not address me as fellow , ' but as Doctor . ' I am the Reverend Dr. Hotchkiss of Littlefield , Arizona . Since I assume you desire to interrogate me as you have my friend Bill , I may as well inform you that when we had collected enough money with which to construct a new church edifice , I appropriatedthe same and came to Guaymas with it , where I intend to spend my declining years . " " Golly ! " said the redhead . " And if you want to know what I do , " spoke up Luigi , " I 'm a pimp-o . I have four whore-os and they make a good living for me . " While Bill and I had been talking , Curly had slipped around behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head protruding upon one side of " Dahling 's " fat legs , and his feet on the other , his back just behind the bend of the magnate 's knees . As soon as he was in that position , Joe jumped from the bench . " You want to know what I do ? " he yelled like a madman . " I push sons of bitches like you in the drink ! " and with a flying leap , the palms of his hand caught " Dahling " on the chest , and back the great man went , over Curly 's broad back , off the pier and into the shallow water below . Immediately thereupon Bill ,  |p160gently  but firmly , lifted the redhead , who by then was screaming like a lost soul , and dropped her into the water beside her companion . We then skipped merrily along the pier , laughing and shoutinglike schoolboys , jumped into the Buick and drove away as fast as the car would move . My friends delivered me at the shore end of the wharf where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go like hell to the beach , get our stuff and cut out for Hermosillo , " said Bill . " That Dahling ' will have the gendarmes after us in a little while , but they wo n't leave the city limits , so we 'll be O.K. Lay low , Pete , and do n't go back into town tonight . Good luck to you , kid , see you next spring . " Amid the hurried good-byes of my friends , I promised to communicate with each of them , when and if I should reach San Pedro . They drove rapidly away , waving their hands and yelling until the car was beyond my view . I hurried , as fast as my lame foot would let me , along the wharf , and climbed aboard the good ship . The Captain , clad now in levis , gray pullover sweater , tennis shoes and white yachtingcap , and looking more like a child than ever , was sitting in a canvas deck chair , knitting something that seemed to require all colors of yarn , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a couple of long needles and some very dexterous fingers . " What have you devils been up to now , Pete , " she demanded , " that you have to make a pier-head jump like that ? " I told her about " Dahling " and Mickey , and her girlish laughter rang out across the water like the tinkling of a dozen little bells . Suddenly the laughter ceased , her expression became serious and she looked me squarely in the eye , deep concern registered in the intentness of her scrutiny . " Pete , " she said , " you 're so tired you do n't know whether you 're standing up or lying down . You 're dead on your feet . You better take a little siesta , because there wo n't be a thing for you to do until we sail in the morning . Go back to your cabin and take a nap . " Although I had not been conscious of it before , I was exhausted . My eyes were heavy , my legs ached , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , listening to Maria . " Those are the only sensible words I have heard today , " I replied . " But where is my cabin ? " " It 's the last one on the port side , " she said . " You 'll have to bunk in with Ong , the cook , and for God 's sake , be sure and take the upper . If anybody appropriated that old heathen 's lower bunk , he 'd kill all of us . " " Thanks a lot , Captain , " was all that I could bring myself to say , because I was really so tired that the thought of any sort of a bunk appealed to me . " Good night . " " Good night , Pete . " She smiled sweetly as I left her and sought the cabin she had indicated . I found it easily . It was about as small a cabin as was ever constructed on any ship , and completely unfurnished , except for a wide lower bunk and a considerably narrower upper . Between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of space . A sea-chest had been shoved in underneath the lower , and I assumed it belonged to the absent cook . I removed my shoes , climbed into the upper and fell asleep almost instantly . It seemed that I had slept only a minute when I felt sharp claws digging into my arm and I awakened , frightened and tense . Black night had fallen outside , but the cabin was lighted by a single bulb , set almost flush with the ceiling . Through sleepheavyeyes , I managed to ascertain that the claws that had hold of my arm were actually the skinny fingers of the homeliest Chinese I had ever beheld . He must have been at least eighty years ' old , and I would estimate his weight at about ninety pounds . He was standing on tiptoe , while his fingers dug into the flesh of my lower arm . His head was devoid of hair , his little old face a maze of wrinkles . Possibly two dozen long gray hairs drooped from his upper lip , and two of his front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watery , and the lids inflamed . " Damn neah thlee o'clock , " he yelled . " Gettum up , you dlunk sailah ! Wattsah mattah you , anyhow ? Gettum the hell up . I flix you hot coffee , sobah you up , you bastah ! " " Who in the hell are you ? " I inquired , still half-asleep , and not quite realizing I was aboard the Hasta Mariana . " I you flen , you stinkah , I Ong Fung Wing , bes ' goddam cookp162in the wull . Gettum up befoah I cut you goddam thloat ! " As he thus commanded me , he grinned , exposing the void where his front teeth should have been . A more ugly individual could not have been imagined , yet the grin was genuine and friendly . " O.K. , Ong , " I managed to reply , " thanks for waking me . I 'll be right along . " " You bettah , else I pullem you out . I go galley fixum you coffee . " His bare feet pattered away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself from the bunk , find my shoes and put them on , and then stumbled to the " mess hall , " where I sat alone at a little oilcloth-covered table , while I could hear Ong puttering about in the adjoining galley . Soon he came in , bearing a pot of steaming coffee and two heavy , white china mugs . He seated himself opposite me , filled the cups and said , " Dlink em down , you feel more bettah . " The coffee was excellent , but so hot I had to drink it in small sips and , while I consumed two mugfuls , Ong put away at least six . " You go lepolt to Captain now , Pete , " he commanded . " Whenevah you lunt coffee oah sumpin to eat , you come back heah . I fixem foah you , light now . Bes ' goddam cook you nevah slaw , thas ' me . " I thanked him and made my way forward . The Hasta Mariana still lay alongside the wharf , but was now quivering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full operation . Captain Ong , still clad in her levis and pullover sweater , stood at the wheel , looking out the port window . Mr. Thude , wearing dark pants and tight sea-jacket , lounged at the port rail . None of the other members of the crew appeared on deck . The engines purred , and the ship gave ever so slightly to the vibration . The Captain waved her hand in acknowledgment of my salute and spoke softly , while a little smile played about her lips and lighted up her strange dark eyes . " Pete , " she said , " go ashore and cast off the head line . " Fortunately , in my youth , I had had some experience with small craft , and so I understood the command . The head line was slack and I had no difficulty with it . Then her quiet voice came again . " Cast off the stern line and come aboard quickly . " I did as directed . " Stow the head and stern lines . "  |p163I  knew enough to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells in both fore and aft decks , topped by easilyremovableround iron hatch covers , into which the lines could be coiled with ease and still be ready for use at a moment 's notice . Again the voice of Captain Quong was heard . " I 'll take her out , Mr. Thude , and I 'll call you for your watch . " Mr. Thude disappeared into his cabin . I stood at the port rail , in the reflection of the lights from the wheelhouse , as she eased the little ship off into the harbor , out through the gate , past the lighthouse , into the gulf . Then she called me to the wheelhouse . It was wide and spacious , compass and engine control levers forward , the logbook on a stand to port , and chart cases underneath the berth . A wire ran crosswise above the berth , upon which were hung dark brown curtains that could be pulled together so that the occupant would not be disturbed by the activities of the helmsman . " Look , Pete , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you how to operate this ship , although , except to steer , you wo n't have to do a thing about it . You see , we do n't have any engine room telegraph . ' In fact , there is no one down there with the Diesels at all , now . Jose has them working perfectly and he has turned in and gone to sleep . See these three levers ? Well , it 's not a whole lot different from an old Model T Ford . The port is forward , starboardis reverse , and the center one regulates our speed . We 're now full speed ahead ' and although that does n't mean very much , we travel quite a way in the course of a watch . You can just leave the levers alone , but take the wheel while I get some sleep . " So saying , she stepped down from a little wooden box she had been standing on , to enable her to handle the wheel with ease , kicked the box out of the way , and surrendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you make La Luz de Piedra , " she commanded . " It 's two reds at fifteen-second intervals and one white at thirty . Wake me when we are just abreast of it . It 'll show on the starboard bow in about an hour and forty-five minutes . The sun will be coming up in the east and it 'll be hard to see until you are nearly on it . Do n't bother me until then . " So saying , she left me grasping the wheel , turned out thep164lights in the wheelhouse ( except the little one over the compass , by which I might see how to " hold her at sixty-four " ) , climbed on the leather-upholstered berth and drew the curtains . No matter how sleepy I had been when Ong awakened me , I was wide awake now , every nerve taut because of my new responsibility . I grasped the helm as though I must crush it to hold our course . No breath of air stirred , the sea was calm as glass ; although there were stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night was black as ebony as I tried to peer ahead to see where we were going . Other than the purr of the engines and the soft lap-lap of the water against the bow , all was silent . If the little ship swung a half-point off the sixty-four mark , I jerked the wheel over until it was three or four points on the other side , then tried to bring it back gently . Finally , I began to relax a little and hold the wheel lightly . There was no difficulty in keeping it on the mark . Away off port side , I could see the lights of a town , faint and uncertain . I wondered if I should enter it in the log book , but did not have the courage . I doubted if a deck hand really had the authority to make any permanent entry in that record , particularly when he had no idea what town it might be . Later I learned it was Empalme . I kept my eyes glued to the compass . Someone had left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I tried smoking one to quiet my nerves . It worked so well , that I soon lit another . No ship passed , no light appeared , except that , in the east , the false dawn brightened the sky momentarily , then faded . I became easier in mind and spirit and actually hummed Bill 's little tune about the mule in the mine , as I kept the Hasta Mariana very closely on the mark . ( Probably the helm could have been lashed and she would have steered herself , but at the time I considered myself responsible for all the lives and cargo aboard . ) Somewhere , off the port bow , I thought I could discern a light . It seemed to flash red , then dark , then red again . I began top165count the intervals as I had been taught long ago , " One thousand and one , one thousand and two , one thousand and three .... " Seven seconds . I would try it again , " One thousand and one , one thousand and two . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and made a pencil notation ( so that it might be corrected if in error ) in the log : " 0352 , sighted light off port bow , red at seven-second inter-vals . " We drew abreast of the light and passed it . Dawn was breaking in the east , but it did little to relieve the blackness ahead of us . Far off to starboard , I thought I could discern the outline and riding lights of a large ship , bound northerly up the gulf . Soon I was certain . Again I made a note in the log : " 0407 , sighted to starboard , unidentified ship , bound north . " What had become of the Luz de Piedra ? It certainly should be in sight by now . In the east the sun appeared , blood red , climbingout from behind a bare rock mountain , its rays reflected at the base of the few clouds that were in the eastern sky . Ahead there was nothing . How could there be a light to starboard , when all that could be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far in the distance , a dim white light , instantly extinguished  --  then , a red , another red , a pause , white again . I counted the intervals and became convinced I had indeed sighted the long-awaited light . I was as elated then as I would have been had I prevailed in litigation before the highest judicial tribunal in the nation . Steadily , I held her at the sixty-four mark , until the flashing light was close and almost abreast of us , then called out " Luz de Piedra , to starboard ! " The Captain , wide awake and fully clothed , her hair in gorgeous disarray and looking more lovely than ever , was at my side in an instant . I believe , now , she had not been asleep at all , but had merely waited behind the curtain to see how I would handle the job of steering the ship . She looked long at the flashing light , then " Bueno , Pete , " she said calmly enough . " Call Mr. Thude and then go aft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bueno " merely means " good . " To me it meant cum laude , with highest distinction , and " Well done , thou good and faithful servant . " I went down the narrow port deck to Mr. Thude 's cabin and banged on the door , calling , " Your watch , Mr. Thude . " From within came his deep voice , " Aye , I 'm a-comin ' , be on deck in a minute . " Then I re-entered the little mess hall , where Ong greeted me with his monstrously ugly grin . " Hi , Petah , you not so dlunk like I thought . You moah bettah as Lenaldo and Pedlo . Them sons muh bitches still asleep . " I had not as yet laid eyes upon the two expert fishermen , and so assumed from Ong 's remark that they must have come aboard in fairly bad condition . " What you got for breakfast , Ong ? " I asked . " Anything you lunt . But fuss I go take this pot coffee to Mr. Thu and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time moahning , but dlink plenty coffee . I puttem pot in wheelhouse . Sometime he eat little cleam wheat but mos time jus dlink coffee . Cappum , she eat like hell foah lil gull . Lookee tlay , oin jus , blan flakes and cleam , poach egg , toas , two glass flesh milk . Maybe she yell foah moah pletty soon . Eat like hell but don get fat , how come ? " I could not enlighten him . Instead I inquired where he got the fresh milk . " Kling em along flum San Pledo in lil papah box bottlegottemdeep fleeze in galley . Fleeze hell out milk , nen thawem out and dlink em . Velly fine . Deep fleeze keepum anything you lunt , flesh milk , flesh egg , good U.S. meat . Anything . Fines damn deep fleeze you nevah slaw . You sit down wait while I takeum this tlay and this pot , then I come back fix you any kind bleakfas you lunt . " With that he padded away , carrying his tray and coffee pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his return . When he came back , he was still grinning . " Whaffo you like foah bleakfas , Petah ? " he demanded . " What do you suggest , Ong ? " I inquired  | " Dlink oin jus , hamman egg , toas and milk . No dlink coffee cause you got sleep some moah . Coffee no good foah sleep , dlink milk bettah . " So , I waited while he prepared for me the " bes damn bleakfas you nevah slaw . " He was right . The ham and eggs just could not have been improved upon . I consumed every bit , then went back to our joint cabin and turned in to get a little rest . It was surprising , after all the sleep I had had the night before , how quickly I dropped off again , there in my upper berth , just a little after daylight had come . I think the vibration of the ship helped to lull me to slumber.  |p168I  do not know exactly how long I slept . I was awakened when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come upon deck and I did so immediately . We were at anchor in a small bay , into which a river flowed from the hills , bringing its dirty brown , silt-laden waters to join the clear azure of the gulf . The scene was strange indeed . Heretofore , the country I had observed was either desert , bare mountains or deep blue sea , but the shore near where we rode at anchor was thick with vegetation . It appeared almost as a jungle . Cane and bamboo grass grew in profusion ; twisted trees , with black bark and dark green leaves , bearing white flowers somewhat similar to our dogwood blossoms at home , cast shadows over the cane and grass . Upon some of the trees , rank vines , with lavender flowers not unlike orchids , were entwined . The sickening , sweet odor of the swamp mingled with the salt-laden breeze from the gulf.  |p169Ca|ptain  Quong , now wearing a gray and white checked shirt , white yachting cap , and white bell-bottom trousers , was standing upon the foredeck . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was presented to the two fishermen , Reynaldo and Pedro who , except for red-rimmed eyes , gave little indication of their intoxication the night before . Reynaldo was a young , cleanlookingboy , about my size and build . Pedro was short and thick of body , about fifteen years older and at least sixty pounds heavier than his companion . He had not shaved while on the voyage and in consequence his face was largely hidden by a heavy , black , untrimmed beard . Both of them wore blue pants and blue tee-shirts . Each sported a dark blue sea cap . Neither wore shoes . The day was hot , the sky cloudless . The ship rocked gently . To seaward there appeared quite a swell , and I gathered that we had crossed a bar as we had entered the bay . Soon there appeared from the tangled growth along the bank a dugout canoe , manned by three Indians , each attired in a shapeless straw hat , a dirty red sweater and , as I later learned , nothing else . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern . The third stood motionless in the center of the narrow little craft , his arms folded across his chest . They approached the ship slowly . Mr. Thude looked at them with disgust , the Captain with pity . I asked her to what tribe they belonged and was somewhat amazed at the bitterness of her reply . " No tribe , Pete , they are the lost ones , like me . They are neither Seri , Yaqui nor Papago , but maybe a mixture of all three . God help ' em , they do n't fit in anywhere . You ought to thank God every night , Pete , that you have no mixed blood in you . Sometimes it 's hard to take . However , it helps here , because I am about the only one these people will trade with , and the reason , I guess , is because I can understand them . Some of the words of their language are almost identical with the Cantonese I learned as a child . We get along fine . " While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beautiful child because of her racial misfortune , Reynaldo dropped a line over the forward port rail , and the Indians made their canoe fast and climbed aboard like monkeys , the sweaters hanging down to their knees , but not appearing top170impede their action . They shook hands gravely with the Captain and with Mr. Thude , ignoring the rest of us . Their hair was matted and lousy , their eyes swollen and festering . The Captain and the three Indians repaired to the afterdeckwhere , at Ong 's suggestion , because he wanted me to have a good opportunity to observe our visitors , I served the guests rnescal out of Ong 's heavy china mugs . As I presented it to them , I must have looked at it longingly . The little Captain caught the look and her sweet smile reappearedas she winked and said , " Go into the cabin , Pete , and sneak a quick one . It 'll quiet your nerves ; but then forget it at once . I allow no drinking aboardship . " I really did not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair-sized drink . It tasted terrible . ' When I returned to the deck , a small scale had been set upon a bench and the Captain was weighing some gold dust that the Indians had brought aboard . It looked pitifully small and light and I was rather surprised at the amount of goods she gave them in exchange for it  --  blankets , levis , sweaters , yellow mercury ointment , salt , canned food , mescal and cigarettes . The guests shook hands gravely and departed with the goods , tossing the merchandise into the waiting dugout and then clambering down the rope . When they had gone , I inquired of Maria if she might not get into trouble in thus bartering trade goods for gold dust . " I du n no , Pete , " she replied . " I have an import license from the United States , but no paper at all from the Mexican Government . Several times the Mexican Treasury Department has sent an inspector to this place , but each one drowned in the river , or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up trying to control these Indians in any way at all . " " Look , " called Mr. Thude , " here comes another batch . They 'll keep at it all day . Wish I had a cold so I would n't have to smell ' em . " Another dugout , this time with four aboard , was approaching from the jungle . Again they came on deck , to be served mescal and to trade gold dust for goods.  |p171Reynaldo  and I left the party and went into the mess hall , where Ong had fixed a cold lunch for anyone aboard , excluding our guests , who might care for it . There were stacks of sliced roast beef , ham , corned beef and chicken , plenty of bread for sandwiches , tomatoes , potato salad , red beans , pickles and papayas . Also there was plenty of milk and , if a person desired hot coffee , he had only to step into the galley and pour it from a pot that rested upon the stove . During trading days whenever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess hall and helped himself . Between mouthfuls of chicken sandwich , I asked Reynaldo the name of the place where we were at the time . " Captain Quong , she calls eet Lost Bay . ' The chart say , Bahia Santa Ynez , ' and the feeshermen from Guaymas all call it Bahia de los Negritos '  --  ' Bay of the Little Black Peoples . ' I do n't know wheech name ees right . I call eet Lousy Bay ' and let eet go at that . " " But where do these Indians live ? I have n't seen a house or a tent or anything else along the shore . " " They got leetle town , veelage you call heem , down some place near by . Name some crazee name . Sounds like Lobos Muertos '  --  ' dead wolves . ' That 's not eet , but eet 's close as I can come to say heem . That leetle reever you see , breeng all that brown mud , hees name Rio Sangre '  --  ' Bloody Reever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed the hell out of a bonch of Indians here , so they name the reever Bloody Reever ' for honor themselves for keel so many poor Indios . " Pedro and Jose came in to get their lunch , and Reynaldo and I , who had finished ours , made room for them by stepping out on deck . A group of Perdidos was just coming aboard and Ong was bringing out the mescal bottle and mugs . It was a faithful repetition of the earlier performance . In fact , throughout all that day , trade was carried on with little groups of these people , and all were dirty , all stinking , all had mattery eyes , yet each had some gold dust to exchange for merchandise . They appeared to value the cigarettes and mescal particularly , yet each took a small tube of the ointment for his eyes.  |p172When  the last group had departed , and the sun was sinking in the west , tinting the whole sky with brilliant orange , gold and pink , everybody aboardship , except Ong , went over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible , the contact with the aborigines . Reynaldo provided me with a pair of blue trunks , similar to those worn by the other male members of the party . Maria wore a somewhat old-fashioned one-piece blue suit , a white rubber cap protecting her hair . She looked like a little angel and swam like a little fish . The dip and subsequent rubdown made us all feel good and we were ready for the evening meal Ong had prepared for us , which consisted largely of a stew composedof lobsters , crabs , shrimp , oysters , rice and beans , thickened with some sort of powder known only to Ong , and very highly spiced . We sat around the deck , eating the stew from big white soup plates . " Jesus Cristo , " muttered Pedro , " all we need is a bottle of cold beer and we feel like million pesos . " Maria smiled and nodded to the cook . " Break it out , Ong , " she commanded , " I think everybody earned it today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of ice-cold beer for each of us . It was the final touch to a perfect meal . Night fell as we finished our supper . I was too tired to play cards with the men , and besides , I really wanted to sit and talk with Maria , but she , too , was exhausted and soon repaired to her cabin . I went into the apartment shared jointly by cook and deck hand , and climbed into the upper bunk . Ong was still busy with his pots , pans and dishes in the galley . Although I left the door open , it was hot and stuffy within that little cabin , and I could not sleep . Three or four very determined mosquitoes insisted that the Lord had provided my nose and ears for their special benefit . When I turned on the light in order to seek them out and work their destruction , thousands of little black and white bugs sailed in and tried to see how close they could come to the bulb without burning their wings . Soon Ong put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lower bunk and was almost instantly asleep . Within a few minutes the cabin was filled with his snoring . I cursed the day I was born , the day I left New York for Tucson , the day I left Tucson for Mexico , and particularly and especially the day I joined the crew of the Hasta Mariana . Soon I heard Reynaldo 's voice at the door , saying softly , " Pete , breeng your mattress and come out on deck . You ca n't sleep in that leetle hell-box when she ees at anchor een hot place like thees . More nicer on deck . " I did as suggested , placing the thin mattress next to that of Reynaldo on the forward deck . He gave me a bottle of some sticky oil and told me to rub my hands , face and feet with it . After I had done so my friends , the mosquitoes , who up to that time had been most intimate and attentive , abandoned me completely . I lay on my back looking up at the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon I slept . Next morning we resumed trade with the Indians , but it did not last long . When the last group of men had left , Maria hurried into her cabin and soon reappeared , dressed in heavy , dark red brocaded satin pajamas . I must have shown my astonishmentat her transformation , for she said to me in a very low voice , " I know , Pete , I look like a two-bit whore in these , and I feel like one , too ; but the women will come aboard soon and if I 'm not dolled up like this , they wo n't like it . " She did not look like any sort of a whore to me , but rather like a little Chinese girl who had just stepped from a picture on a paper fan . Soon the dugouts bearing the women approached . Pedro and Reynaldo had rigged a ladder of ropes and staves , and this was put over the side for the accommodation of our feminine visitors . Up they came , and over the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty red cotton , and blouses of what I imagined had once been green sateen . Their hair was caught up in the back and tied in a knot on the forehead . Their headdress was a straw hat something like that affected by the well-known character " B. O. Plenty . " Their stench also entitled them to that appellation.  |p174Their  faces were utterly devoid of expression until their eyes alighted upon the Captain ; then reverence , awe and near-worship were clearly apparent upon their dark countenances . The Captain gave each woman a mug of mescal , a package of cigarettes , a can of D.D.T. powder , a square bottle of some medicine , the nature of which she did not disclose to us , a box of round , hard candies  --  jaw-breakers we called them when I was a boy  --  and about a half-yard of narrow red ribbon . The women gave nothing but awe in return . One of our guests brought a little girl about five years of age , naked as the day of her birth , skinny and frail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekbones almost protrudingthrough her dark and dirty skin . She was suffering from a vicious infection of her upper lip , which was terribly swollen and festering . I was amazed at the dexterity , gentleness and efficiencywith which Mr. Thude picked her up and held her , quieted her whimpering , washed her face , and then , with a surgeon 's lance , opened the lip and drained the pus . He carefully painted the lip with some brown antiseptic , gently pressed some adhesive tape over it and released her . " God ! " he said , heaving a great sigh , " I hope the poor kid lives . " " Waffo ? " demanded Ong , who had been standing near by during the operation . " Wattsadiff one less Indian oah Chinaman . To hell will ' em , me , I killem quick , gettum ovah with . " " Ong , " I inquired , innocently enough , " did you ever kill anyone ? " " Hell , no , " he replied instantly . " Only one time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I was aghast . " Whatever for ? " " On account clop failuah . " He half-closed his eyes , Oriental fashion , as though in deep thought . " Crop failure ? " I could scarcely believe I was hearing correctly . " Suah , " replied the celestial , " I killem for clop failuah . I plant coahn , coahn come up ; I plan lice , lice come up ; I plant Chinaman , niggah baby come up . I killem wife pletty damn click . " He grinned horribly.  | " As nearly as I can now determine , Ong , " I said somewhat severely , " you are more or less of a damned old fraud . " His grin broadened , as though he were delighted at receiving a sincere compliment . I thought I might taunt him a little , so I inquired , " Ong , is it true what they say about Chinese women ? " He grinned horribly and I abandoned the discussion . Not long after that , the three men who had visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Captain . Apparently the subject of the talk was the deck hand , Pete , because they pointed my way from time to time and waved their arms violently in an apparent endeavor to drive home some point concerning me . In a few minutes , Maria indicated that I should join the group and I did so with some misgiving . I could not imagine what the Indians had to say that would concern me . " Pete , " said the Captain , " you are probably the first norteamericanowho has ever come to this place . The chief here , whose name is Angel , insists that you visit his village . He wants you to become better acquainted with his people . I really think you should go . " I then recalled , with considerable apprehension , what had happened to the inspector from the Mexican Treasury Department , and endeavored to decline the invitation . At first I suggested that Mr. Thude should go in my place . An objection was sustained upon the ground that he was a Dane and not a citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a futile journey for me because I could not understand the Indians , nor could they understand me . Ong , the heathen , then came forward and put a stop to the line of reasoning I had employed . " Hell , Petah , you take me ' long flo intah-petah . I the best goddam intah-petah you nevah slaw . I intah-pete from Chinese to Amelican to Mexican to Indian , I speakum five language and nobody undahstand any of ' em . " So it was determined that I , in company with the faithful Ong for an interpreter and the three Indians , should go to thep176village of Lobos Muertos , or whatever its correct name might be , and " meet the people . " The Indians and Ong slid down the line to the canoe with the greatest of ease . I followed clumsily and would have capsized the dugout but for its skillful handling by the natives . Ong and I were seated in the center of the craft , the chief , Angel , standing directly behind us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their flat paddles propelled us toward the shore . Although there was no wind , and the bay was as smooth as an egg , the crazy little craft rolled and pitched with every movement of its occupants , and I felt anything but secure so long as there was even a foot of water between us and the shore . Soon we were among the tangled growth along the shore . Trees , stumps , vines , cane and grass , all intermingled in the shallow water and formed a barrier that to me seemed impossible to penetrate . Nevertheless , in some way , the Indians forced the dugout into the maze . The swampy , sweet odor I had noticed when first we anchored in the bay , I now discovered came from the white blossoms on the trees that looked so much like our dogwood . The lavender flowers hanging from the creeping vines gave forth no scent at all . Once into the midst of the tangle , it was evident that there was a sort of " inside passage " up the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dense vegetation which surroundedit . Into the passage we went , although we were forced to bend far forward to avoid the overhanging tree limbs and creepers which virtually shut out the light of the sun , causing our passagewayto appear as a narrow tunnel , festooned with green moss and tangled vines . Black gnats and mosquitoes met and convoyed us through the tunnel , up the stream , perhaps a mile , then the canoe was grounded in the muck and we climbed the slippery bank and set off along a wet and muddy path through the jungle and leadingdirectly away from the river . We had not gone very far when the trees and vines deserted us and our way led through the tall bamboo , which seemed to shut out all air and make us unbearably hot . Then , suddenly , wep177emerged from that and stood upon the desert . There were the rocks , the sand , the mesquite and the cacti . I did not care to get too close to any of the chollas although , at that time , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too amazed at the rapid transition from jungle to desert . It is doubtful if the strip that separates the bamboo brake from the arid land is more than a yard in width . Across the hot sand and broken rock , through the cacti we went , single file , with Ong and me in the center of the squad , perhaps for our own protection or perhaps so that we could not escape . No word was spoken . We probably walked three or four miles under the blazing sun , the Indians moving forward with easy , long strides , the hot sand having no effect whatever upon their bare soles ; Ong hopping and skipping as though he were a child ; and me , limping and plodding and perspiring and longing for a cold beer . No brass band advanced to meet us . Nevertheless , our approach to the village was heralded by the barking and howling of countless dogs and the crying of numerous children . Lobos Muertos ( if that is its name ) was about as I had anticipated  --  some twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doors , no windows . There were no flowers , no grass , not even a string of red pepper pods to lend color to the drab village . One building appeared to be a church . It had no walls whatever , consisting merely of a thatched roof supported by tall poles . A crude wooden cross surmounted the edifice . There was not a privy in the town . Observing such conditions , and being forced to take notice of the stench coming from its pollution , I wondered if such foul odor might perhaps be caused by chronic dysentery of each of the inhabitants . I could not be sure . My best estimate of the population would be one hundred Indians , three hundred dogs , twelve million flies , and other insects too numerous to mention . Surrounded by the sweating , mattery-eyed populace , we were seated upon long benches within the shade of the church roof , and served a milky-looking drink called , as nearly as I am able to pronounce it , tits-guin . I hesitated to partake of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient courage to follow his example . It was musty , milky and foul . I have never tasted distilled skunk juice , but I know it would be an improvement upon the tits-guin served by the good people of Lobos Muertos . Then the chief , Angel , must indulge in speech-making . He stood at the front of the church and spoke long , loud and earnestly , waving his hands and beating upon his chest at convenient intervals . I thought it would never end , but eventually , pointing his finger directly at me , he screamed something terrible , quit abruptly , and sat down . I turned to my interpreter for enlightenment . " He say , " quoth Ong , " his people need new life in this tlibe . He blings them a white man foah bleeding pluposes . This white man he will bleed each young woman in tuahn . This white man he stlong like bull . He bleed evely woman and evely woman have maybe one , maybe two lil white babies . " Ong paused . Consternation must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a stud bull for these Indian females . Then Ong continued : " Hell , no , Petah , I just kiddy you . He say he blings heah one white man flum the United States so that this man can see how poo his people live and maybe gettum some money for this tlibe . He say one Mexican man tellum United States people allatimeglad give money away flo help anybody that don ' live in United States . I think he meanum lend-lease business oah some-thing . " Greatly relieved by such information , and no longer dreading the ordeal of impregnating the female population of Lobos Muertos , I arose and very gravely recited Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address , which I had learned in school many years before . What Ong said to the good people , by way of interpretation , he would never tell me . However , whatever it was , it pleased them very much and they grinned and slapped their dirty hands against their dirty thighs with great gusto . We were forced to take another good stiff swig of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their shoulders , from the center of which was suspended a live javalina ,  |p179or  Mexican wild pig , about the size of a full-grown bull terrier , humpedbacked and bristling , his little red eyes flashing wickedness , foam dripping from his savage jaws from which his long white tusks protruded , and his tiny hooves tied tightly to the pole . He was making the desert air quiver with the intensity of his protestingand infuriated squeals . I shook hands with every dirty Perdido in the place ; then the two carriers , the javalina , Ong and I returned to the canoe , and were ferried to the ship , where , with simple ceremony , the javalina was presented , not to the honored guest speaker , Pete , of lend-lease fame , but to the Captain of the ship  --  the little Maria . By the time Ong had safely stowed away the javalina , in one of the empty shark-liver tanks , and the two Indians had dropped into their dugout , Pedro and Reynaldo had the anchor up , washed and stowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing out of the little bay.  |p180Three  days then we sailed , in comparative idleness , in quiet water , and in perfect weather . Sometimes we could see the rugged mountains on the peninsula of Bahia California , to our west , or the bare desert of Sonora or Sinaloa on the east , relieved occasionallyby heavy , green jungle , where some stream of fresh water reached the gulf ; and , as we progressed southerly , I noticed that the strips of dark green became larger and occurred more and more frequently . My duties consisted of washing down the deck occasionally , standing a watch at the wheel , with the course previously set by Maria or Mr. Thude , helping Ong with the dishes , and painting the lockers and fish tanks . The only really disagreeable job that was forced upon me was the assisting of Ong in slaughtering , scalding and butchering the javalina ; but , after we had gone to all of the work of preparing him for food , Captain Quong decidedp181he was unfit for human consumption , so his meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hope that it would prove attractive to the sharks , when and if we should encounter them . At night I slept on the deck beside Reynaldo , the other freshairfiend . For some unknown reason I would fall asleep almost as soon as I lay down upon the little thin mattress that I brought from the cabin . I was a long way from New York , but it worried me none . In fact , I scarcely ever thought of my life or work back there and , strangely enough , I concerned myself very little with thoughts of Bill and my other fishing companions . I was at peace with the world and , for once in my life , as nearly content as a human can possibly be . But one thing bothered me . I wanted to understand the Spanish spoken by my shipmates , and I had hoped that I could make them understand me when I endeavored to converse in that language . My efforts along those lines , however , were almost uniformlyfutile . I would speak to Reynaldo or Jose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they would smile politely and , in English , ask me what I had said . Not so Pedro , however . He was openly contemptuous of my efforts . When I asked him something concerning the town of La Paz , which I understood we were approaching , and which I correctly pronounced " La Pahth , " he laughed loudly and discourteouslyand then growled from behind his black beard , " La Pahth , la tooth , la thayna , el tohtheeno  --  you lisping thun of a bitch , talk English or talk Mexican . " I was somewhat angry and hurt by his outburst , and so left him for the company of our Captain , who was sitting in her deck chair on the forward deck , wearing her gray and white shirt and bell-bottomed trousers , and knitting away for dear life , the needles flying in her hands and the bobbins bobbing from the ends of the many strands of yarn that were being made into some sort of long , brightly colored scarf . " What 's the matter , Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lovely little face . " You look like somebody has been pooshing you around . ' "  | " Why , " I asked her , " ca n't I understand these Mexicans , and why ca n't they understand me when I speak to them in their own language ? " " You have the same trouble with your Spanish that Jose has with his English , " she said . " He studied English with a native of Mexico , who had never been north of Jalisco . He reads and writes beautifully , yet you ca n't understand him when he talks . " She wrote something upon a piece of paper , then called Jose to her . " Jose , " she said slowly and distinctly , in English , " read to Pete what I have written here . " Jose looked at the paper and said , " High leave eena quite cows . " Silently she took the paper from him and handed it to me for inspection . She had written " I live in a white house . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite to say this , but you have attempted to learn the Castilian pronunciation , which is used in a small province in Spain and nowhere else . What would you think if , in addition to Jose 's trouble with his pronunciation , he tried to affect an Oxford accent ? You would laugh a lot more than any Mexican has ever laughed at you . " There is only one way to learn to speak so that people will understand you , " she continued . " Get a sleeping dictionary , ' a nice , young Mexican girl , with whom you can crawl into bed and learn the language horizontally . No , do n't look at me , Pete ! I am twenty-eight , though I may not look it ; a half-caste , and a virgin . Mentally , I have slept with every male movie star that was ever popular . I never married and the reason is that I do n't want to bring any more mixed-bloods into the world . There is not a Chinese who will admit that I am Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in Los Angeles and have a certificate to prove it , but you do n't regard me as an American . " I get along all right , I guess . I own this ship , without a maritimemortgage on it , and it 's worth about a hundred thousand American dollars . I make plenty of money out of the sharks ' livers , a little out of the gold , I pay my income tax , and I take care of a few unfortunates . I really have n't any kick coming . "  |p183We  agreed that , for the space of half an hour , I would try to converse with her in Spanish and that she would correct my pronunciation . We got along wonderfully , it seemed to me , until suddenly she laughed and said , " Pete , viaje and vieja are two differentwords . I asked you if you often went to Washington . You intended to tell me that you made one trip there three years ago , but what you actually said was , I made one old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she told me about a Mexican professor who confused " interview " with " intercourse " and while addressing a parent-teacher convention in Los Angeles had stated , " Within the past week I have had an intercourse with each of the members of the board of directors of this great organization . " This recalled to my mind one of Bill 's stories about a young Mexican girl visiting in Tucson , who went forth to buy a camera , but had to settle for a box of sanitary napkins because she could not distinguish between Kodaks ' and Kotex . ' Maria then countered with what she asserted was an old story concerning an American who , proud of his knowledge of Spanish , endeavored to inform a Mexican lady that the weather was cool , using the words " mucho culo " which really signify a big behind . " But , " she assured me , " it is not always the turistas who make such mistakes . Even Bill , who usually speaks like a native , will confuse caliente with calor , and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will assure me that he is passionate . " And so we talked until Mr. Thude called me from the wheelhouseto take the helm for a little , while he " shot the sun . " He returned in a few minutes , made some notation in the log book , and announced , " We 'll cross the Tropic of Cancer in just eleven minutes . I 'll bet we get sharks this afternoon sure . " I had no reason to dispute him . As far as I could see there was calm blue water all around us as far as the dim horizon on the west and a patch of green jungle on the east . Mr. Thude relieved me at the wheel and I again sought the company of the Captain , but she had retired to her cabin . Ong ,  |p184sitting  in the Captain 's desk chair and doing absolutely nothing , grinned at me , " Cappum go change clothes , puttem on levis , gettum leddy clatch shak , makum lottsa monee . " Reynaldo , who had been scanning the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now called out excitedly , " One fin , starboard , tin kilometro ! " Mr. Thude spun the wheel , the little ship described a great arc , the motor was silenced , and we drifted in the calm water , without using an anchor or tie line . Reynaldo and Pedro then busied themselves at the bait tank . Great pieces of white pork meat were broken out , dipped into some evil-smelling oil and impaled upon large iron hooks , attached to lines about the size of sash cords . Chunks of rancid fish were thrown overboard to attract the prey . Mr. Thude and Ong took turns in explaining to me just how to perform a " liverectomy " upon a shark , when and if we should capture one . Maria , Thude , Jose and Ong and I sharpened and resharpenedthe knives with which we had been supplied , while Pedro and Reynaldo fished and watched for the fins that should appear above the surface of the calm water . Several such fins appeared , cruising lazily about , apparently untempted by the bait that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-bearded Pedro and , hand over hand , brought in a shark weighing about sixty pounds . The little Captain hit the catch on the head with a mesquite club . Ong turned the sea-devil over on its back , squatted down over it , slit the belly , quickly removed the liver which he tossed into the tank , then dumped the body into the waste box . " No thlow dead shak ovahbload , " said Ong sagely . " Otha shaks eatum up , do n't eat bait . Velly bad . Thlow ovahbload when we the fish . Hollay fo hell ! Catchem lots ! " All that day we removed livers . Some of the sharks were quite large , and all were evil-looking with their great pointed teeth gnashing in pain and rage , and their little cold eyes staring at us . Pedro teased one of the larger ones by slipping a mesquite club into its mouth . It was snapped in two so quickly and cleanly thatp185I could well imagine what would happen to a human limb caught within those cruel jaws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became bloody and smelled terribly . We , too , became bloody and stinking . The waste box filled and the liver tanks were filled . Toward evening , Ong served coffee on deck . It tasted of blood and shark intestines . We improvised an additional waste box from canvas stretched on deck in the form of a square . Still Reynaldo and Pedro pulled in sharks and more sharks . We worked under the deck lights all that night and under the hot sun all the next day , and when the liver tanks and the drums and boxes we had pressed into service could finally hold no more , the fishermen pulled in their lines and quit . Everybody rested but me , whose duty it was to throw the dead sharks overboard , hose down the deck and generally police the ship . How many potential bags , pocketbooks and pairs of sharkskin gloves I pushed over the side , I shall never know . It seemed very wasteful , but I was too exhausted to care . There was a dull pain in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no clear recollection of finding my way to the cabin or of climbing into the upper bunk . I must have been too tired to even think of carrying the mattress to the deck . In the morning I was feverish , and there were sharp pains in my stomach and my arms and legs ached . I could not get up for breakfast when Ong called me . Some time during the morning , Maria came into the cabin , stood on tiptoe and put her cool little hand against my hot forehead . " I 'm sorry , Pete , " she said softly , " thirty-two hours of that back-breaking work , without rest and without being used to it , can put anybody out of commission . " I tried to tell her that it was all right and that I would soon be up and around , but I am afraid my tongue was as thick as if I had consumed a dozen tequila sours . She smiled , stroked my hair and said , " Just take it easy , Pete , and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of sleep before she left , because I have no recollection of her going . Some time during the day I woke enough to realize that wep186were running through fog . I could scarcely see out of the open door . Our speed was greatly reduced , and the " blat-blat " of the Diesel-driven foghorn could be heard almost constantly . Ong came in with an ice-pack for my head and a cup of warm chicken broth for my stomach . I could keep the ice-pack in place , but not the broth . The remainder of the day was very confused . At almost the same time I realized that I was alone in the cabin , I became consciousthat our engines had stopped and that the ship was bumpinggently against some sort of wharf . From outside I could hear Maria 's voice calling , " Make the stern line fast  --  take up the slack . " I heard the engine started briefly , then , " Make the head line fast .... " Lights were shining down upon the wharf . We had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p187e  local longshoremen carrying the shark livers ashore and trundlingdrums of oil aboard , I still felt in no mood to arise . Ong brought me some hot milk toast , well spiced with black pepper . Mr. Thude called to express his sympathy and to tell me that there were one or two good doctors in town and he would have one come aboard if I wanted . " But , " he added , after feeling my forehead and counting my pulse , " I do n't think you need him . I think all you need is a couple of days ' rest . You worked too hard in the hot sun and it got you . We 're going to be here about four days and there wo n't be a thing for you to do . The Captain and I will have to inspect the rendering , check the tests , get the analysissheets and a few things like that , but the rest of the crew will probably get drunk and stay that way until we sail for home . "  |p188I  thanked Mr. Thude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my system required . However , the man who really cured me was Pedro , whom I had theretofore regarded as an enemy . He appeared in the doorwayjust before noon , looking his usual belligerent self , but his breath indicating that he had been ashore for one or two drinks . " I sorry you feel bad , Pete , " he growled , " but do n't you worry . I got little medicine for you . " Whereupon he produced a halffilledbottle of Waterfil-Frazier , a pitcher of ice water , and two glasses . He poured a little of the whiskey into each of the glasses , filled them with water from the pitcher , and handed one up to me . " Salud y pesetas , " he toasted , gruffly . We drained the glasses and I immediately felt better . He poured another brace , using a little more whiskey and a little less water , and I was practically well . " Damn near forgot , " he barked , " been to post office for Captain . Got letter for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , official-looking envelope , bearing air mail stamps , and ad-dressed : Mr. Donald Van Duesen III ( Better known as Pete ) c/o M. S. Hasta Mariana , La Paz , Baja California , Mexico . In the left-hand corner postal officials were admonished to return it to " Law Offices of Wallace K. Wallace , P.O. Box 1910 , Tucson , Ariz. , U.S.A. " I turned it over and over , looking at it with wonder . For some reason , I did not want to open it . " Pedro , amigo mio , " I asked , " will you do for me one big favor ? " " Sure , Pete , what it is ? " " Pour me another slug of that good whiskey , so I 'll have the courage to see what Bill has written me . " For once in his life , Pedro smiled , and it was almost as terrible as one of Ong 's extra-special grins . However , he divided the remainingcontents of the bottle equally between us , added water ,  |p189and  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed down from the bunk , opened the letter , and read : " DEAR PETE : I am taking a chance on this reaching you . I am sending one copy by air mail to La Paz and another copy to Mazatlan . I hope you get at least one of them . You will find enclosed an application blank for admission to practice at the Arizona bar . Fill it in and send it to me , so I can endorse it and file it with the committee . They got a new bunch on that committee now and they are trying to keep city slickers like you out . They would be very happy to exclude you . Howes r , if your application gets back right away , I think I can pull a string or two and see that it gets by .

That was n't Dahling 's ' doings either , but was caused by Curly getting into a fight with a fellow he thought was a pimp but who turned out to be a detective . However , it only cost us a few pesos to regain our liberty . Luigi has a bad case of mental gonorrhea . Fortunately , it has only two more days to run before it develops into the real thing or leaves him entirely . All of the gang were more than pleased to have had you on the trip with us , and we all know that you will enjoy the fishing expedition with Maria , God bless her !

" But I think I 'll go into town and see if I ca n't borrow a typewriter for a little while . I have some papers to fill out and I think they 'll look better if they are typed . " " Hell , Pete , you stay right here and rest . I go steal one typewriterfor you somewhere . " " Steal it ? " " Sure , you know one time I steal even a piano and I get away with it . Pretty good thief , no ? " After he left I went on deck and seated myself in the Captain'sdeck chair . The day was warm and bright . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinery wharf , but could commanda fair view of the harbor . It did not compare with that of Guaymas in size , depth or security . It held a number of fishing boats of the various classes we had seen at Guaymas , some riding at anchor , some made fast to the cannery wharf , and two to the same dock where we lay , at the end of which I could observe the refinery itself , a small corrugated-iron building , with steam coming out of a series of pipes protruding through the roof . To the south was the cannery , large , white and of frame construction , with a bright red composition roof . I could observe no sign of life anywhereabout it . Along the shore , on the far side of the cannery , there were a number of tall palm trees , and beyond those some building which was rather indistinct and which I could not identify when I viewed it from the ship . I had thought that I was the only one remaining aboardship , but I soon heard Ong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cabin where she had been reading the mail that Pedro had brought her from the post office . " My God , Pete ! " she exclaimed , " What are you doing up and around ? I just sent for the undertaker. "  | " I feel fine , Captain , " I replied . " Pedro brought me some medicine and now he has gone to steal a typewriter for me . " " That cabron ! You smell like you had been drinking his medicine . I 'll cut his liver out and feed it to the sharks if he gets you drunk and makes you sick again . What do you need a typewriterfor , anyway ? " I showed her Bill 's letter and she was as pleased as I. " Sure , Pete , you fill out the application and send it back . Maybe you wo n't decide to open an office at Tucson after all , but it certainly ca n't hurt you to get a license so you can practice there if you want to ; and if you do decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to hurt a bit either . I received a . letter that 's quite different from yours . It 's from a very old and dear friend of mine in Los Angeles . She needs my help , Pete , and I need yours . Do you suppose that by tomorrow you 'll feel well enough to do a small job of kidnaping for me ? " It developed that her friend , a Mexican lady living in Los Angeles , had a young and beautiful daughter . The daughter had eloped with a handsome Mexican , whose sideburns and dancing ability had won her heart . The gentleman had deposited the lady gently , but firmly , in a house of prostitution , and then left her . Because she was not too proficient , she failed to earn her living expenses , and consequently , she was greatly in debt to the madam of the house . Inasmuch as her income never equaled her expenses , it appeared that , even if she stayed there for a lifetime , she would still be hopelessly in debt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Maria had already formulated a plan in which I was to rescue the girl from a fierce madam . " You just follow the instructions I 'll give you , Pete , and everythingwill go fine . You can go across the gulf , steal Beatriz , who by the way has changed her name to Juanita , and get back here without any difficulty whatever . " I was not too sure about that , but I was willing to take a chance . Just then we observed Pedro coming up the wharf . His walk was not exactly steady and he experienced some difficulty climbing aboardship , but under one massive arm he carried a typewriter.  | " Put that thing down , Pedro , " commanded the Captain , " and listen to me . We have important work to do and you 'll have to help . You go up to that cantina , where you 've already been , and tell Reynaldo to come on back here and dig out his China silk suit for Pete to wear on a little mission I 'm sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacted Reynaldo , you go to the Tienda Nueva York and buy the finest Panama hat you can find that will fit Pete 's head , and a pair of white shoes and socks for him . I think one of Reynaldo 's shirts will fit him , so you need n't bother with that , but get him a new , dark blue silk tie . I 'm going to doll that boy up to look like a wealthy tourist if it kills him . Now , tell me what you 're to do , you drunken idiot ! " Pedro grinned behind his beard . " Measure Pete 's head , measure his foot . Find Reynaldo , tell him to get his butt back here very pronto . Go store , buy Pete hat , shoes , socks and tie . Get back here myself . O.K ? " " O.K. , and on your way , you lout . " " O.K. , am on my way , lady beautiful . " " Damn you ! Do n't you call me that again ! " " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to carry out his instructions . " Well , Captain , " I asked , " what plan of operation am I to follow in rescuing Beatriz ? " " I 'll tell you all about it in the morning , Pete . Meanwhile , Mr. Thude will go to the Aeronaves office to get you a ticket on the plane and find out what time it will leave here tomorrow . I 'll do all the thinking for you , and you just follow my instructions when I give them to you in the morning . " " O.K. , Captain . I would have liked to have seen this town of La Paz though , before shoving off for Mazatlan . " " You wait , Pete . I think you 'll have plenty of time when you get back from Mazatlan with Beatriz , or Juanita , or whatever she calls her nasty little self . There is n't a whole lot to see here , anyway ; but , before the war , this was quite a town . The pearl industry was in full operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Paz than any other place on the North American continent ; but the damn Japs , who used to come here with theirp193tuna boats , fishing as innocently as could be , poisoned all the oyster beds just before Pearl Harbor , and that finished the pearl industry . You 'll notice even the cannery is shut down . Outside of the shark-fishing , and some shrimp business and the shipping of early tomatoes and vegetables that are grown just a little way from here , there is n't much business carried on here any more . I have always liked the place , though . The people are friendly and courteous and they understand sailors . If Pedro and Jose and Reynaldo get drunk in town and start to raise hell , the police do n't throw ' em in the jug , but they load ' em in the paddy wagon and bring ' em right here to the ship , where they can sleep it off without bothering anybody . I think that 's pretty nice , do n't you ? " I agreed with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only Maria , Mr. Thude and I showed up for it . Ong had baked a cabrilla in white wine sauce as the principal dish . I ate so much that I felt miserable afterward . Just before I retired for the night , Maria insisted that I have a big drink of the same medicine Pedro had provided that morning . I put my mattress on the foredeck and lay there , at peace with the world . It was strange that I worried none about the expedition to Mazatlan in the morning . I fell asleep thinking about how , on the train from New York , I had not wanted to meet the people in the club car for fear they might offer me a drink , and how my personality and instincts had changed so considerably in the space of time I had been in Mexico.  |p194By  morning , I had obtained sufficient sleep and felt good and strong again . The pain had left the back of my head , and my hands were steady . I enjoyed sitting in a straight-backed chair in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with great efficiency , scraped away at my incipient beard while he went through all of the pantomine of a professional barber , futilely endeavoring to sell me a shampoo , hair tonic and a manicure . " Feel stlong nuff foah do some damn fool thing foah cappum , huh ? That goddam lil cappum gull , she get you in Mex jail one hundled yeah , I bettum you . She clazee as hell . I shave you good . I bes goddam bahba you nevah slaw ! " " You do , Pete , " he announced after he had treated me to an extra application of hot towels , followed by an ice-cold one and a heavy application of talc , " you look damn neah almos human . "  |p195Strangely  enough , the Panama hat and white shoes fitted perfectly , and the suit might have been made to measure . Glancinginto a mirror , I was surprised at the coat of tan I had acquired , more noticeable because of the white shirt and white China silk suit . I felt I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I was eating Ong 's delicious " bleakfas , " Maria appeared , clad in a checked gingham dress , her hair drawn straight back from her forehead and tied with a little piece of green ribbon . Her eyes were shining and her white teeth glistened through a rather nervous smile . This was the first time I had seen her when she appeared at all excited . " God , Pete , " she said , " you look terrific . That damn little tart of a Beatriz will go for you like a million pesos . I 'm half-afraid to send you on this junket . You 'll probably wind up opening the first air-cooled whorehouse in Mazatlan . " " Cappum ! " yelled Ong . " You clit talkee like that . I otto splank you good . You be nice lady oah I laise hell with you . God-dam ! " Maria smiled sheepishly and replied quietly , " O.K. , Ong , viejo amigo mio , I 'll be good . " Then turning to me she said , " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pesos , and a letter I 've written you . It 's got all the instructions you need . Read it on the plane and then tear it up . Here 's my best Swiss camera . Do n't get drunk and lose it . With that suit and hat and camera , there is n't a soul in Mazatlan that wo n't think you 're a millionaire . Do just what the letter says and we 'll see you and Beatriz here tomorrow , sure . " Thude stuck his head into the little mess hall . " Pete 's taxi 's here , " he announced sourly . I wondered what was the matter with him . I guessed perhaps he disapproved of the whole expedition . I left the mess hall and stepped out on deck . " Hoolay foah hell , " yelled Ong , who , with Maria and Thude , had accompanied me . " Lookee taxi  --  Andlew H. Blown , flesh air . Goddam ! " The taxi , which had come up the wharf as close to the ship as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model A Ford ,  |p196with  the entire top removed , the body painted a brilliant yellow , and the whole affair presided over by a fat , middle-aged Mexican woman , wearing a bright red blouse and a blue sea cap from beneath which her short gray hair bristled like the quills of a porcupine . " Andale , senor , " she squeaked at me , in the lightest voice imaginable , " tenemos solamente diet minutos  --  vamanos at aero-piano ! " " Bueno ! " was all that I could think to say in reply , as I hurriedlyleft the ship and entered the rear seat of the " open-air taxi . " I did not get a very good view of the town of La Paz as we rushed down its almost deserted streets . From what I could observe , it appeared to be a delightful little place , with its square , squat white buildings hiding behind bright green shutters . There were rows of royal palms along the waterfront and purple-flowered jacquiranda trees along the side streets . The few business houses had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed with heavy iron shutters . I noticed that the little plaza in the center of town was green and well kept and contained a marble statue , probably of some Mexican hero . The streets were unpaved , but appeared to have been sprinkled and swept during the night . We eventually reached the airport where my plane , a Boeing twelve-passenger , already had its propeller lazily turning over . On each side of the aisle there were six single seats . Half of them were occupied ; one contained a fat Mexican in a brown businesssuit and soft felt hat , who clutched a brief case as though it were the most precious object in the world ; another , a Mexican air officer ; a pair of newlyweds , I am sure , occupied the two foremost seats , holding hands across the aisle ; and right across from me , there was an American lady , severely dressed in a dark brown traveling suit , and a big , black , straw sailor hat , and whom I figured was either a missionary or an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dreadful glare from her cold gray eyes . " To hell with her ! " I thought . We were soon roaring low over the town , across the roof of the cannery and not too far above the deck of the little Hasta Mariana . A figure in white  --  Ong , I am sure  --  waved a tablecloth ,  |p197but  I had no way of returning the salute . Then into the morning sun we flew , with the gulf a deep blue beneath us and not a cloud in the sky . I unfastened my seat belt , relaxed and opened my sealed orders from Captain Quong . Though the envelope was large and bulky , it contained mostly blank paper . However , upon the last sheet was scrawled in schoolgirl handwriting , if I ever saw it : " Muy amigo mio , The best instructions I can give you are to use your own judgment , no matter what situations you get into . Bill tells me that you eat and sleep in houses of prostitution , so I am very sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the proprietor and inmates of the place that is holding Beatriz . I have only a few suggestions as to how to go about abducting the little tart and returning with her. 1 . Register at one of the better hotels , the Belmar , Centralor Jardin. 2 . Spend considerable time at the bar and let it be known that you are a lone tourist looking for a good time. 3 . Get out to the Salon de Hollywood ( where the little puta is employed ) , preferably alone , but if necessary in company with some other lonesome American touristlooking for a lark. 4 . Once there , insist that you have a girl that speaks English . Probably this Beatriz , or Juanita , will be the only one in the place. 5 . When you have made her acquaintance , and are sure she is the right gal , tell her about the letter I received from her mother . Fix it up some way so that you can go for a ride about the city , and then steal her away. 6 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the train north to Empalme , and then catch the Aeronavesback across the Gulf to Santa Rosalia and La Paz . In that way , if anybody notices you leaving Mazatlan , they will think you are on your way backp198to the border and never will think of looking for you here at La Paz. 7 . Keep the name of our ship out of the deal . We are shark-fishers and Indian traders . This will be the first time we have had a joy gal aboard . Good luck , Pete , I am counting on you to do the job . Su amiga feel , MARIA ILENA MARTINEZ QUONG . P.S. Be a little careful how you speak and act . The people in Sinaloa are not as friendly as those in Sonora . These folks have quick tempers and love to fight . M.Q. " " So , " I thought , " they have quick tempers and love to fight . If I ever get back to the States , it will probably be in a packing case , marked Damaged Goods . Maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will wind up in a Mexican jail . I wonder what penalty is prescribed in Sinaloa for the theft of a whore . Oh , well , to hell with it . If they throw me in jail , I 'll probably get to meet some interesting folk that I would never meet on the outside . " I tore the letter into bits and shoved them into the vomit receptacle that hung from the back of the chair just in front of me . The American lady across the aisle scowled her disapproval . I grinned back at her politely . We were rapidly approaching Mazatlan . From the air I could see the white buildings , with their brilliant red-tiled roofs , occupyinga narrow peninsula where the clear cobalt waters of the gulf , straits and bay provided a fitting frame for the view . Just outside the city , both to the south and across the bay to the north , the tropical jungle faded in a haze at the horizon . Nearby , surrounded by the waters of the bay , I could identify Coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tall coco-palms bending in the breeze . Eastward there appeared some bare and rugged mountains , but I could not determine how far away . The steward blew upon a little silver whistle , which meant " fasten seat belts . " The plane circled so closely over the town that I wondered if the pilot intended to try landing upon one ofp199the flat tiled roofs , but instead he swooped down to a patch of white sandy beach , landed roughly and taxied to a little yellow building that proved to be the airport office . The American lady with the black straw hat was at the door ahead of anyone , and was quite angry because it was not immediatelyopened for her . The rest of us took our time and it was well we did so . The door could not be opened until an immigrationofficer arrived . Probably we awaited his coming only a few minutes , but , cooped up in the grounded plane , it did seem unduly long . Finally , the cabin door was opened from the outside and we descended a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time since leaving the little inspection station just outside Nogales , I was asked to exhibit my tourist card . It was in order , and the tall , good-looking immigration official saluted and said smilingly , " We hope you have a good time in Mazatlan , meester . " " Gracias , senor , " I replied , believing firmly that he had exhaustedhis supply of English , as I was just as sure he thought I had employed the only two words of Spanish I knew . The newlyweds scampered across the sand where a Model A Ford sedan awaited them ; they were greeted affectionately and vigorously by a flock of brothers , sisters , , and in-laws and outlaws of every possible description . The rest of us plowed our way slowly to a shining black Cadillacsedan with white-sidewall tires . The driver was a big , broad young man , dark as a wild Indian , with a thatch of curly hair showing under his cap , and strong , white teeth . He wore a neat blue uniform and opened the car doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour-faced American lady was determined to occupy the front seat but was quickly outmaneuvered by the fat Mexican with the brief case , who climbed aboard and slammed the front door before she could reach the car step . The fat fellow grinned sweetly . The lady , from the expression upon her very plain face , was silently condemning him to the depths of the hottest of hells . The air officer took the left rear seat , Miss Sourpuss the middle , and I sat in the right rear . Just where and how our handsome chauffeur had obtained a driver 's license I have never learned . However , he had been taughtp200that " time is of the essence " and that a speedy delivery of his passengers was a requisite of his job . Across the sandy beach we tore ; then , entering the city , we plunged through a narrow canyonlikestreet , unevenly paved with cobblestones , and flanked on each side by one-story adobe buildings . With the horn shrieking its warning , the children and chickens scattering out of our way , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my utter amazement , the Ford that contained the newlyweds and their party passed us on the left , the blasts of its horn rivaling if not equaling ours . The street was very narrow at this point and our car was forced to within a few inches of the buildings on our right . " You idiot ! " yelled the American lady to the driver . " Slow down ! You 'll kill us all ! " The driver , who did not understand English , apparently thought she was reprimanding him for having permitted the Ford to pass . His foot hit the gas pedal , his hand the horn , and we gave chase to the Ford with a greater burst of speed than before . From side to side and up and down we bounced over those cobblestones , the rear seat passengers grasping at anything they could in a futile endeavor to maintain their upright positions . The Ford , which we were rapidly overtaking , slowed down suddenly because of some pavement repairs in progress . Not so the Cadillac . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a small ditch across the road , and swung into a broad , smooth boulevard , separated from the gulf by a seawall extending some three or four feet above the roadway . The wall flew by one side us , the line of rapidly moving low buildings on the other , until , with a screech of brakes , we arrived at the front entrance of the Hotel Belmar . There it stood , of light brown stucco , arched portico entwined with dark green vines , and with a broad low porch for the accommodationof guests who might want to sit outside and enjoy the view of the sea . I was , however , too shaken up to appreciate it at the moment , but my condition was extremely good compared to that of our lady passenger , who looked for all the world as though she had been on an all-night drunk , culminating in some physical encounter in the morning . Her straw hat was broken across thep201brim and her nose had been cut by some contact with either the ceiling of the car or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining quite audibly . " I shall report you , you idiot of a driver ! " she screamed through her tears . " I shall have your license revoked  --  your company will pay for my damages . I am killed ! That 's what I am ! I am dead ! I will sue every one of you , and the hotel and the air line , and you , you idiot ! " She grabbed her bag and staggered off into the hotel , ignoring the bellboy who sought to assist her . The driver , who thought he had been doing the very thing the lady wanted , was honestly perplexed . I gave him a ten-peso tip and observed , with satisfaction , that both the brief-case-clutching fat man and the officer were more than generous to him . The fat fellow winked at me slyly as he received his bag and walked away down the broad avenue . The officer and I slowly entered the hotel , behind a parade of white-uniformed Mexican bellhops who had come out for our luggage . I waited while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the desk , wondering how I would get along in a strange town with such limited knowledge of the local customs and language . " I should like one of your rooms for a day or two , " I said . " Certainly , sir . I believe we have just what your excellency requires , a spacious apartment on the second floor overlooking the gulf . The view is beautiful and the room very comfortable . " Here my early American training came to the fore . " How much ? " I inquired , rather sharply , I am afraid . He smiled broadly . " Twenty-five pesos a day for single occupancyat this season . In the winter it is a hundred pesos . " " Sold ! " I said . He grinned and so did I. From a rack behind the counter he produced a key with an enormous brass star attached to it and handed it to one of the bellhops . I was surprised to note , as I followed the boy , that the hotel contained neither elevator nor stairway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first to the second floor . The first glance at my quarters proved that the clerk had not praised them too extravagantly . The principal room was , as he had said ,  | " spacious , " about the size of three ordinary bedrooms , and with a very high ceiling . The floor was of dark brown tile , the walls and ceiling of light blue , and bright pictures of Mexican matadors hung on the walls . The room contained two double beds , two dressers , several leather rockers and easy chairs . Off one end of the bedroom was a clean , white-tiled bath , at the other end a little " oficina " with several straight-backed chairs and a writing table . Great door-like windows , extending from floor to ceiling , overlooked the Avenida de Olas Altas ( the avenue of high waves ) , the seawall , and a narrow beach , beyond which stretched the blue waters of the gulf . Evidently the tide was out , because the water did not reach the seawall , and several children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so charmed by the whole arrangement that I gave the bellboy a five-peso tip . " In what other way may I serve your excellency ? " he asked , slowly and distinctly , and in Spanish that I was able to comprehend . " Una botilla de whiskey Waterfil y agua simple con hielo . " I tried my Spanish , using the pronunciation that Maria had endeavoredto teach me . " Si , si , inmediatamente , senor . " He flashed a smile and disappearedrapidly . I relaxed in one of the huge leather chairs and in a few moments the boy was back with a quart of the good WaterfilFrazier , a tinkling pitcher of ice water , and four thin , highly polished glasses , all reposing upon one big , silver tray . Why there were four glasses for the use of only one guest I could not comprehend . Nevertheless , I signed the check he presented me , gave him an extra peso and decided to relax a little more . Scarcely had I mixed a light drink and reseated myself to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pealed forth , causing me to jump as though a pistol had been fired close by . I answered it , again trying to make use of my Spanish . " Quien habla ? " I inquired of the conical mouthpiece . " It is Senor Orabuena who speaks , " the receiver shrilled into my ear , " the manager of the hotel . Would it inconvenience yourp203excellency too greatly to call at my office as promptly as possible ? " " But certainly not . I shall be there at once , " I replied , although I could not help wondering what the manager could want of me at this hour of the morning . Possibly he had heard of my mission to Mazatlan and desired to eject me at the earliest moment . I finished my drink hurriedly and then descended the ramp to the lobby , where I was met by my friend , the bellboy , who conducted me to the office of the manager , swung open the great glass door , and bowed as though my rank was at least equal to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , the manager , a dark little fellow who was nattily dressed in a gleaming white suit , was seated at an enormous carved mahogany desk . At his right sat the sour-faced woman I had encountered upon the plane , and at his left the fat Mexican who had guarded his brief case so diligently . Immediately behind the manager stood a tall fierce-visaged Mexican officer , in bright blue uniform with heavy gold braid around his left shoulder and across his broad chest , and , in front of the desk , facing the assembly diagonally , and appearing quite shamefaced and perplexed , stood the driver of the Cadillac , twisting his cap nervously in his trembling hands and shuffling his feet upon the hard tiled floor . The manager arose at my entrance . " Senor Van Duesen , " he shrilled , " you may be of great service to us in the matter at hand . This gentleman he turned and bowed toward the blue-clad officer is the Chief of Police of Mazatlan . This lady he bowed in the direction of Miss Sourpuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this cab driver he bowed toward the poor trembling chauffeur and your testimony is desired . Senor LicenciadoAlberto Garcia here he bowed toward the fat Mexican with the brief case whose English , so he states , is imperfect , is unable to tell us exactly what the lady said which caused the driver to hasten his car so violently as to injure her person and apparel . " Again bowing toward the Chief of Police he inquired , in Spanish that I could understand , " Is it your wish , sir , that I serve as interpreterin this matter ? " " Si , senor , " said the Chief softly  | " Muy bien , " replied the manager , and turned upon me almost fiercely . " What did the lady say to the driver ? Use her exact words , if you can ! " he questioned and challenged . " Certainly , " I replied , endeavoring to make my voice as soft as that of the Police Chief . " She said , You idiot , why in hell did you let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel or I will wring your neck . ' " Sourpuss screamed , jumped from her chair , her face deathly white , her lips blue , heat waves rising from the purple cut upon her nose , and fire flashing from her mean little eyes . " You  --  you person ! " she sputtered , heaving a telephone book at my head  --  which , fortunately for me , missed its mark  --  and ran from the room in tears . The manager , remaining calmly seated at his desk , translated in rapid Spanish the information I had given him in English . The driver gave a great sigh of relief , placed his cap upon his curly head and leaned against the wall . The Police Chief bowed coldly to everyone and stalked out of the room . Fatty , however , jumped up and embraced me with the gran abrazo . " God damn ! " he screamed in his imperfect English , " you ees gentlemans ! O.K ! You ees simpatico ! You lie like hell for our fren , thees poor driver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreenk ! God damn ! " We shook hands all around and departed from the office of the manager , our arms across each other 's shoulders . Through the lobby we rocked , arms still resting upon one another 's shoulders , out through the beautiful patio with its palms , giant ferns , great vines , pitcher plants and gardenias , the whole affair giving a heavy , sweet , indescribable odor . At the far corner of the patio we entered the door to the cantina , and found it to be a delightful place indeed , although not very large . Over each table hung an oil painting of some Mexican scene , all apparently by the same artist , and a very good one , too . Surmounting the little table at which Mr. Garcia , the fat gentleman , insisted that I sit , was a beautiful reproduction of the floating gardens of Xochimilco . " God damn , you make me feel good all day . You bes ' liar Ip205don ' see for long time , " and he paddled over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sallow-faced bartender . I seated myself at the table , wondering just what sort of a party I might be letting myself in for , and soon Mr. Garcia returned , bearing glasses containing purple drinks which he called " Francos , " which tasted like Castoria , but nevertheless had considerableauthority . " Salud y pesetas , " he toasted . " Y tiempo Para gastarlos , " I replied , and it seemed to please him greatly . " Look , Meester Van Chusen , " he said as he sipped his Franco , " I owe to you the honor to get exceedingly damn dronk weeth you , but I got ta wait for thees afternoon , cause I got ta go court thees morning . I be through pretty damn queek , though , then you and me get dronk , esta bueno ? " " It certainly is bueno with me , " I replied , " but tell me , are you a lawyer ? " " Si , senor , Licenciado Alberto Garcia , a sus ordenes , the bes ' goddam lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the table and again shook his hand . " Bueno , " I said , " meet Donald Van Deusen , the best damn lawyer ever kicked out of New York . " He was overjoyed to meet a brother practitioner . " Meester Van Chusen , " he said , shaking hands again in farewell and grinningfrom ear to ear , " I weel have myself the honor to call at your apartment at four of the clock thees afternoon , and then we get dronk een honor of your great lie thees morning , Pero ahora adiosito , hasta las cuatro . I am bad for leave thees way , but I got ta go , you onderstan ? " " Hasta luego , " I replied , as he , clutching his brief case to his belly , tore out the door . I had one more Franco and then found my way to the broad front porch of the hotel , where I sat in a large rocking chair and read the day 's issue of the Los Angeles Times , flown in by PanAmerican . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the gulf.  |p206Small  , white crests appeared upon the little waves that rose and fell along the broad expanse of blue water . Few people strolled along the Avenida Olas Altas , and they appeared well dressed and quite citified . Occasionally a new automobiletore by , or an old two-wheeled cart , pulled by an undernourishedhorse , would lumber along . A few of the hotel guests , clad in swimming suits and bath towels draped across their shoulders , descended to the beach by means of concrete stairs set into the far side of the seawall . My favorite bellboy came out and smiled shyly and I had him go to the bar and bring me another Franco . If Maria had wanted me to give the impression of a wealthy tourist , I was following her instructions to the letter . I finished my drink in solitude , but had scarcely finished when a half-dozen white-uniformed bellboys appeared on the porch and lined up in anticipation of the arrival of guests . Even the clerk came out and stood rubbing his hands together . " Who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just arrived from Mexico City , " he answered . " We will have some more guests very promptly now . " Just then the Cadillac with its happy chauffeur appeared and discharged four American tourists . The first two were the typical small-town retired merchant and his wife . One of the other two , however , looked enough like Judge Leviton to be him , but , unlike the clothing usually affected by my former employer , the man was attired in a white sharkskin suit , and a wide floppy Panama hat with a blue and white polka-dot band . His tie , too , was of the polka-dot variety , and his shoes were white and tan leather . He was accompanied by a large , blonde lady , expensively attired in a peach-colored silk dress and a large Leghorn hat adorned with artificial cherries . She minced daintily along beside the man who so closely resembled the Judge , holding his arm as though she feared he might run away from her . She bore no resemblance whatever to Mrs. Leviton , whom I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at least twenty years the senior of the lady stepping upon the porch . I must have stared at them most impolitely , because the ladyp207cast a glance my way and then looked quickly away as though annoyed by my close scrutiny . As the man 's eyes encountered mine , however , I knew without any question that I was looking at the Honorable Samuel Quincy Leviton who , like me , was a long way from home , but who , unlike me , was at that moment visibly startled . The couple entered the hotel and , while I did not dismiss them from my mind , I was not greatly interested in either the Judge or his legal problems in Mexico . I recalled only too vividly his rather caustic reply to my friendly telegram from Guaymas . Finishing my paper , I folded it neatly and returned it to the lad who had sold it to me , so that he might resell it to some other tourist for a double profit . He thanked me with a broad smile and murmured something about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped he was right . Returning to my room to get my camera , I decided to have a fair shot of Waterfil-Frazier . As I descended the ramp , with the camera slung over my shoulder , my footing was not nearly so certain as it might have been . Nevertheless , I crossed the broad avenue , managed to straddle the seawall and made my way to the beach by means of the stairs on the gulf side . Once upon the hard sand I seemed better able to keep my balance , and took a delightful walk , perhaps half a mile up the beach . At one point , from the top of a great rock protruding from the sand , I obtained a very good view of the beautiful Hotel Belmar with its vine-covered arches , and took a picture of it which I was sure , when developed , would prove to be very artistic indeed . I also got a few shots of some young people who were trying to learn surfboard riding , although there was not a great deal of surf on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand and wearing bright red trunks , were glad to pose for their photograph , and soon I had exhausted the entire roll . I retraced my steps , intending to return to my room for a refreshing shower before luncheon . As I neared the stairway leading to the top of the seawall , I noticed Judge Leviton and his " client " relaxing on the sand . She wore a white silk French-style bathing costume that revealed a great deal more than it concealed ,  |p208while  the old goat sported purple and gold trunks , his skinny , hairy legs sticking out like toothpicks from a rotten plum . They ignored me , even though I was close enough for the Judge to recognizeme . Some perverse imp within me caused me to stop in front of them and aim and click the camera as though I was getting their picture . " Beauty and the Beast " I murmured fairly audibly , as I twisted the handle in an effort to create the impression that I was changing the film for another shot somewhere else . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairway to the street above , pulled myself over the parapet and returned to the hotel . I was very tired after climbing the long ramp to the second floor , and making my way to my commodious quarters I treated myself to a fairly heavy slug of the Waterfil , stripped to my shorts and stretched out upon one of the large double beds . Before I had quite dropped off to sleep the telephone rang long and loud . " What now ? " I thought . " To hell with it ! " but after the bell had pealed out the second time I realized the only way to stop the din was to answer it . " Quien habla ? " I inquired of the transmitter . " This is Judge Leviton , " the earpiece squeaked . " May I come to your room and see you for a few minutes ? " " Hell , yes , Sam , " I invited cordially . " Come on up and I 'll buy you a drink . " While waiting for the Judge , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coming interview . I stretched out on the bed again , hands folded under my head , eyes fixed upon the ceiling , and wondered what in the name of all the evil spirits Judge Leviton wanted to see me about . There was a rap on the bedroom door . I did not rise to open it but called out , " Come on in , Sammy , and make yourself at home . " He fumbled with the knob and entered . He was pale and excited , though he maintained a sort of silly smile which I understoodwas an attempt on his part to be agreeable . " Good morning , Van Duesen , " he said politely , as he stoodp209just inside the room , not knowing exactly what to do with himself . " Good morning , Sam , " I replied from my position on the bed . " Put your little gimlet ass down on one of my deep leather chairs , and I 'll mix you a drink . " " Oh , no , Van Duesen , " he protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one foot to the other , like a schoolboy caught cheating in exams , " I never indulge so early in the day . " " The hell you do n't , " I exploded . " In this country , you drink when you 're invited , otherwise you get your throat cut . Sit down , you old goat , and I 'll show you what real hospitality is . " He wilted into one of the large chairs , a bewildered-looking little old man if I ever saw one . I prepared two fairly stout water highballs with plenty of ice . His hand trembled as he accepted his . " Salud y pesetas , " I toasted . " Yes , yes , indeed , " he agreed absently . " I just wanted you to know , my boy , that your position with the firm is safe and waiting for you when you return , " he stuttered . Then , without conscious effort on my part , the WaterfilFrazierspoke through my vocal chords , " The hell it is ! " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was my little joke , you understand that , do n't you ? Ha-ha . " He cackled like a hen that had just recently presented the world with a nice white egg . " Yeah , ha-ha , " I intoned mirthlessly , although I could scarcely recognize my own voice because it was really the Waterfil that spoke . " Well , now , my boy , " he oozed , " just what is it that I can do for you ? " " Finish your drink , you old goat , and then go into my private office there and write a letter of recommendation to the State Bar of Arizona . I am applying for admission there . " " Certainly , certainly , yes indeed . " He consumed his Waterfil at one gulp and almost staggered into my little oficina , where , seated at the table , he composed a most beautiful epistle to the Committee on Examinations and Admissions of the Arizona Statep210Bar . No one could possibly be as nearly perfect as that letter solemnly certified I had been while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , indeed , my character and professional standing were one hundred per cent plus . He signed the firm name and handed it to me . I read it carefully , thanked him very much and offered him another drink , which he accepted and consumed immediately . " You 're a pretty good old coot , after all , Sam , " I told him . " But I want to give you some good advice . You 're working too damn hard . You 're pale as a sheet , your hands tremble , and you look like hell generally . Better lay off for a while and take a rest . Enjoy yourself , it 's later than you think . ' Let that old gal manage her own Mexican interests , or send one of the boys from the office to her . No use killing yourself for a client . " " You are right , my boy , " he agreed , and started to say something else , but then his eyes fell on Maria 's camera , and I thought he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " he gasped . " The film . . . what I came to see you about . . . what I came to buy . . . you understand ? " " You want to buy the film in that camera ? " I could scarcely believe my ears . " Yes . . . any price . . . any price , within reason that is .. . you know , my boy , I will pay whatever you want . . . within reason . . . . " His voice sank so low and he looked so pitiful and dejected that I felt sorry for the old boy . " O.K. , " I said . " Name your figure , Sam . " A crafty look appeared in his weak blue eyes . He was going to get a chance to bargain after all . This he loved . He touched his fingertips together and almost grinned naturally . " A thousand dollars . . . " he commenced tentatively . " Sold ! " I interrupted firmly . " Eight thousand Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film with the wonderful portraitis yours . " " You will take travelers ' checks ? " he asked , relief putting strength into his voice , and the color beginning to return to his cheeks . " Hell , no , you wiggle your skinny fanny down the ramp top211the desk and bring me back currency . Take the cash and let the credit go , ' says the poet , and it 's damn good advice , too , Sam , old kid . " I was enjoying myself immensely and could scarcely keep the laughter out of my voice . He backed through the doorway , and I relaxed in one of the deep chairs and indulged in the laugh that I had been restraining during the last few minutes of the interview . Christ ! The great Judge Leviton paying a thousand dollars for an undeveloped film of the hotel , the surfboard riders and the little kids playing on the beach . I wished Bill were present so he could enjoy the joke , too . The old devil soon came back with the cash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that we would both be sure of the amount . In his presence , then , I removed the film from Maria 's camera , licked and applied the " exposed " sticker and handed him the roll . " One more drink , Sam old kid , " I suggested , " then we 'll part friends , huh ? " " Yes , yes , indeed . " He smiled naturally now , the innocent film safely stowed within his pocket . These last drinks we consumed leisurely . He was relieved because he had the film , and I was happy because I had a thousand dollars toward the cost of opening my office in Tucson . As he left , we shook hands at the door . I was tempted to give him the gran abrazo , but restrained myself , thinking he might feel it was an attempt to regain the film.  |p212It  was nearly noon . I realized that I had spent quite a morning and perhaps should get a little rest . However , I felt the need of a little food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discovered was Arturo , and asked for a chicken sandwich , green salad and iced tea . After I had eaten I relaxed and waited until Mr. Garcia called me as he had promised . Meanwhile , Arturo returned for the plates and silverware , and I , noticing that Sam Leviton and I had almost consumed the entire bottle of Waterfil , sent the boy for another . I squandered Maria 's money in a rather extraordinary tip . I was asleep when Mr. Garcia knocked at the door . Quickly jumping up , I donned my trousers and admitted him , making a very polite bow and holding the door open for his entry . " Entre , amigo mio . " I tried my Spanish . " Con su permiso , Senor Van Chusen , " he replied , his facep213wreathed in smiles and his dark eyes shining as he bounced into the room . " Call me Pete , " I demanded , taking his hat and tossing it onto one of the dressers . " Por que ? " " Cause it 's not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God damn , you sound joost lak fren frum mine in Areesona ; that Beel Gualace , you know heem , huh , maybe , es abogado tambien ? " " Hell , yes , " I replied , delighted that we had a mutual friend . " Sit down and relax while I fix you a drink , and then I 'll show you a letter I just received from good old Bill . " He sat easily in one of the big chairs , lighted the smallest cigarette I had ever seen , and tossed the burned match carelessly upon the floor . I prepared a couple of well-fortified highballs , and gave one to my guest . " Salud y pesetas , " he said , lifting his glass on high . " Y cosas nuevas , " I replied promptly . " Where you see that goddam Beel , anyway ? " Alberto demanded . " In Tucson , we tried a case together and then went on a little celebration to Guaymas . " " God damn , you don ' look hockey null for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up weeth heem . One time I play leetle joke on heem here , have heem put in cartel , yalecouse you call heem , for leetle while . He laugh like hell when I get heem out , but when he get back to Tookshon , you know what he do ? He sheep me , by express , collect on thees end you know , one crate live mountain lion . Cost me five hondred seexty pesos for express charge and I du n no what to do weeth son of a beech after I get heem . I have to geeve heem to park for zoo , huh ? That crazee son of beech , he fool me good ! " Alberto laughed heartily . He seemed a " right guy . " I showed him Bill 's letter and told him my whole story , interrupting for only a drink or a laugh at something that Alberto thought was funny . When I told him the purpose of my visit to Mazatlan , he was quite shocked.  | " Pete , " he said , " thees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine , very fine lady , very reech , owns about half thees town , geeves more money to poor folks than all the res ' of the population together . Everybody calls her Tia Sara , ' Aunt Sarah , you know . She runs fine whorehouse , thas correct , but she never keep no whore that don ' want to stay . Thas all horse manure . We go see her . We get thees gorl , right away , you bet you , eef she wan na come . Something fonny about thees beesness , we fine out queek , God damn ! " While I showered and dressed , Alberto had a free hand with the Waterfil-Frazier bottle and , when I was ready to go , he had caught up with me in his drinking and maybe was a little ahead . It was quite difficult for me to get down the ramp , and not a great deal easier for Alberto . I held firmly to the side rail and finally succeeded in reaching the lobby without falling or rolling any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cantina for a Franco , but I discouraged him . I wanted a clear head for the interview with Aunt Sarah . The sun had almost set and the sky was a brilliant crimson , reflected and intensified in the waters of the gulf . Nothing moved along the Avenida Olas Altas . The fronds of the tall palm trees swayed gently in the evening breeze , and here and there a sea gull flew high above the water , or stalked along the narrow beach . Our friend with the Cadillac was nowhere to be seen . We could not locate a taxi , so we walked down the avenue , somewhat unsteadily , and eventually located an ancient open carriage , known , I believe , as a carromata , drawn by a little ancient brown horse and driven by a little ancient brown man wearing an enormouswhite straw hat . " Step in , " suggested Alberto , bowing low , and I did so . He seated himself at my side and addressed the driver . " Salon de Hollywood , " he ordered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse , cracked his whip , yelled something in Spanish , clucked again , and finally the animal decided to move ; but no amount of clucking or yelling or whip-cracking could get him to proceed at faster than a walk . Down the avenue we went , at least two miles per hour.  |p215A  light fog swept in from the gulf , which , along with the gathering dusk , made it difficult for us to see the buildings or other objects we were passing . " You know what that Beel he calls me ? " inquired Alberto , and without waiting for my reply , answered his own question , " Fatso , he calls me . Ees good name , no ? " " Es buen nombre , " I agreed , as the little horse turned into a cobblestoned street which led to the center of town . On either side of us were stores , gleaming with yellow light against the gathering dusk ; only an occasional wisp of fog from the sea seemed to catch and overtake us as we continued our slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding mist was fairly heavy , and the yellow lights in the store windows and doorways showed very indistinctly through a moist curtain . Pedestrians walkingalong the narrow sidewalks kept appearing through the mist and then rapidly disappearing . A band was playing in the plaza , but even the music seemed muted by the fog . Only the clop-clop of the horse 's hooves upon the cobblestones , and the dull grind of the narrow iron tires , seemed genuine and distinct . Cars passed us at a rapid rate , the blare of their horns breaking through the humid atmosphere with more success than their lights could pierce the fog . Nothing disturbed our old driver and his old horse . They realized that eventually they would reach their destination . " She 's goddam cold , thees fog , Pete , and she 's a long way to Aunt Sarah 's . Les ' stop and get a leetle bottle for warm us up , no ? " suggested Brother Fatso . " Si , " I replied , already chilled by the cold of the mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the cobblestoned street , and the horse , without any display of reluctance , stopped stone cold . Beyond the narrow , high sidewalk , swinging doors intervened between us and a dully lighted barroom , in front of which lounged a few half-drunken sailors . Alberto climbed out and up the terrifically high curb , a door swung open , flashing the light full upon him for a moment , then he disappeared within and the returning swing of the door shut out the lightp216entirely . From where I sat in the carromata some loud rough voices and the blare of a juke box playing " Now is the Hour " came quite clearly through the fog . Alberto returned with a bottle of American Straight bourbon , which , although made in Mexico , has some of the qualities of raw American whiskey , including plenty of fire . He also brought a greasy paper bag , full of some little crispy , crunchy things , each about the size of a dime . They tasted somewhat like fried shrimp , although lighter and sweeter and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink of the American Straight , and several mouthfuls of what was in the bag . Alberto offered the bottle to our driver . " One thousand thanks , " said the old man , as he put away about a fourth of it , " but you will have to buy a beer for Baby , or she wo n't go no further . Whenever we stops at a cantina , we have to buy heem one bottle beer for that leetle horse . That ees the law of thees carriage . " " O.K. , " said Alberto to the driver , " but you have to go een and get eet . I wo n't be no waiter for no horse . " Nothing loathe , the old fellow held out his hand and Alberto gave him some change . Like a monkey he dropped out of the carriage and disappeared behind the swinging doors . We continuedeating and drinking . The weather was now very , very cold and damp , and the whiskey felt good inside , while the crispies were delicious . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shivering a little in the damp fog . " They ees magueyes , fried cactus worms , very good , no ? " I was speechless . For a moment I was almost sickened at the thought of having eaten fried worms , when it occurred to me that I had just been enjoying them . I took another mouthful . " Muy bueno , " I managed to sputter , and , as long as I could forget about white worms crawling through cactus plants , they were really good . The old driver came out and lovingly and deliberately removed the bit from the mouth of the poor , old horse , held its head back , and poured the contents of a bottle of beer down its throat . Then he replaced the bit , buckled some straps , broke thep217bottle against the sidewalk , climbed aboard , clucked to the horse , and we were once more on our way to the Salon de Hollywood . We soon left the street , and the road became quite sandy and heavy . The horse 's hooves could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discern water on either side of us . Somewhere ahead a steam whistle sounded , Baby stopped , and a freight train backed slowly across our path and then came abruptly to rest , effectively blocking any immediate attempt on our part to continue our journey . The lights of the brakemen 's lanterns could barely be seen through the mist , as they waved and signaled their messages . The train was in no hurry . We shivered in the cold , had a nip from the bottle , and resigned ourselves to wait until we might continue our trip . " Weesh we had ' nother bottle , " said Fatso . " Sometimes we have to wait long times thees place , while train backs up , goes ahead , backs up some more . Very bad crossing . Them poor guys what ees een hurry to get to gorls , they sure hates thees place . " " What causes it ? " I questioned . " Surely there is nothing away out here that requires such train movements . " " Overtimes ees what does eet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get een some overtimes for make beeg money , so they ron train out thees sand spur , what you call heem , and switches and backs and goes ahead teel they gets een their over-times . " " Hell of a racket , " I murmured and took another small drink . Baby was content , the driver was content , Alberto was unhurried , but I was a little nervous . I wanted to get on with the business of rescuing Juanita . No one could imagine what indignitiesshe might be subjected to , even while we waited for the trainmen to accumulate their overtime . Now , with a great waving of red and yellow lanterns and tootingof the engine whistle , the train pulled ahead a few car-lengths , only to grind to a sharp stop . A conference of trainmen was convenedaround the engine cab , and many valuable minutes passed before it was recessed , and the train again pulled ahead . This time it cleared our road and Baby took us safely across the track . We had no more than reached the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guessed the boys really needed the overtime . We ascended a long grade leading to a little mesa above the bay and Baby 's deliberate gait became even slower . The fog becamelighter and , off to the right , I could observe a large welllightedbuilding with numerous cars and saddle horses standing in front . From within came the sounds of an extra-loud juke box , and the noisy confusion of many voices . " Esta Campo Siete , " Alberto informed me , " a very extremely goddam low place , what you call heem ? They got gorls in that place do eet three ways for four pesos . We don ' stop there at all , bueno ? " " Bueno ! " I replied most heartily . The Salon advertised itself by a huge blue neon sign , reading " Hollywood . " The building appeared almost as large as the Belmar . Lights pierced the thin fog from every downstairs window and doorway . There was no other structure anywhere around . After instructing the driver to wait for us , we entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch and then going through tremendous double doors , just inside of which , within a sort of entry hall , was seated a policeman , in full blue uniform , writing something in a book at a little desk . He was , of course , acquainted with Alberto , and approved us as customers without formality . " Fes good idea , Tia Sara keep that policemans there , " explainedAlberto . " Low-class pipples try to come een , he throw ' em out ; high-class pipples try to come een dronk , he send ' em home in taxi . High-class pipples weeth guns or knives , he takes ' em away from ' em and geeves ' em back when they ees ready to leave . Le 's go on een . " We were met and escorted to a table along the wall by a hostess , a dark , statuesque young lady , in wine-colored dress with a narrow band of cream-colored lace around the modestly cut neck . Alberto told her we should like to see Tia Sara and she smiled pleasantly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , large enough to accommodate comfortably three or four hundred couples , although there were not over two dozen people dancing at the time . Thep219entire room was lighted by a soft , diffused blue light . At one end there was a small orchestra and at the other a bar . A second-floor gallery ran around the entire enclosure , reached by broad steps leading from the opposite side of the room . Doors opened from the gallery directly into upstairs rooms . Along both sides of the huge ballroom were small tables similar to that at which we rested , and quiet Indian boys in white uniforms served drinks from the bar . The orchestra wore dark trousers and white shirts , open at the throat . They played softly but well . The male dancers , mostly young fellows , were dressed very much as American boys of their age would have . Their partners wore soft colorful party dresses . They might well have been a group of college students attending a school party . Occasionally , however , a couple would leave the dance floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full view of all . Before we could order a drink , the hostess returned with the information that Aunt Sarah would see us in her office , so we marched away to a little door at the side of the bar , which led directly into the offices of the executive department of the Salon de Hollywood . There , in a very small room furnished with an old desk and some decrepit chairs , and a new and modern steel safe , we found Tia Sara seated behind the desk waiting for us . I think I must have displayed visible surprise at her appearance . She was not at all as I had pictured her , but rather a very kindly-appearing little old lady in a rusty brown suit , her white hair drawn severely back over her ears and her old-fashioned steelrimmedspectacles giving her the appearance of some good-natured great-grandmother about to gather her family about her for evening prayers . She smiled sweetly and naturally as she shook hands with Alberto , looked rather puzzled when I was presented . When she spoke , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen , " she said , her faded brown eyes magnifiedby the lenses of her antique glasses , " while I order a little drink for you . What will be your pleasure ? " " Francos , " said Alberto before I had a chance to express a preference . She said something very softly into an old-fashioned speakingp220tube that protruded from the wall on her left , the only words I was able to distinguish being " dos Francos , " which was really all that I was interested in . " Now , Senor Licenciado , " said she , addressing Alberto directly , " to what happy circumstance am I indebted for the honor that is bestowed by this call of yourself and your American friend ? " Alberto shifted and squirmed in his chair , being reluctant to come right out and say what it was I had informed him . " Tia Sara . . . " he began rather confusedly , but before he could really commence his explanation of our visit , an Indian lad appeared bearing Francos for Alberto and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Alberto and I consumed our drink , and Aunt Sarah mixed her tea , hot water and lemon juice and sipped the mixture daintily , no word concerning our business was spoken , but I determined in my own mind that I would take over the burden of explaining our mission to our good hostess . When the appropriate time came , I launched forth , glancing at my fat friend as I did so , and reading the relief that was in his eyes . " Tia Sara , " I said , " I hope that I am not being too forward in so addressing you , but this is the only name I have heard from my good friend , Senor Garcia . " " Be entirely at ease , Mr. Van Duesen , no one has called me anything else for over fifty years . " " Thank you very much . The truth respecting our visit is that a very good friend of mine has received a communication from a very dear friend of hers concerning a young person in your employ . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to read the letter . " I handed her the note that Maria had received from the mother of Beatriz . " Thank you , sir , " said Aunt Sarah , as she pushed the glasses up on her nose and commenced to read . Before she had finished a little smile was playing about the corners of her mouth , although there was perplexity and perhaps a little pain showing in her tired old eyes . She refolded the letter , returned it to me , heaved a deep sigh , took another sip of tea , wiped her lips daintily upon an old lacep221handkerchief and said , smiling gently , " Mr. Van Duesen , some of the things that Juanita has told her mother are true . The girl is in debt to me to some extent , but of course she is perfectly free to leave here whenever she wishes . She may go with you tonight if she cares to , and there will be no hard feelings on my part . " Alberto offered the old lady one of his midget cigarettes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It tasted like hay . " It is very difficult for me to explain to you the problem that child faces , " continued the old lady . " Unless she can be made to realize that her profession should be a paying one , she will never be out of debt . She enjoys her work and she applies herself very diligently to it , but her earnings are only a fraction of the others . " She speaks very good English and I was glad to employ her , thinking that she would appeal to the tourist trade , which is really the best-paying part of the business . It is true that she does appeal to the American tourists , because they can speak with her in their own language , but she is rarely available to them . I think I can best express her trouble in this way  --  she has no head for business . She enjoys her work too much to let the financial end of it worry her . For example , if a Mexican ship 's officer engages her at twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutesat the most ; yet she gets so interested in performing her duties faithfully that she will keep him with her for hours , while perhaps an American visitor who would pay a hundred pesos and an additionaltwenty-peso tip , frets and fumes while he is waiting for her , and then accepts a non-English-speaking girl as a substitute . " " But , " I suggested , " if she really enjoys her work , as you say , why does she write her mother that you are holding her against her will ? That is what I ca n't understand . " " Nor can I , " murmured Tia Sara sadly . " However , I have been in this business so long that nothing surprises me . I propose we learn the truth of the matter immediately . If Juanita is not engaged , we will call her in here and then Licenciado Garcia and I will leave you here alone with her so that there may be no suspicionthat I have coached her , and you may interrogate the young lady to your entire satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I heard the name " Juanita " several times repeated . She returned to her tea , while Alberto and I stirred nervously in our chairs . A light tap was heard at the door and , in response to Tia Sara 's invitation , Juanita entered . I was disappointed . She was not particularly pretty , being a fairly heavy-featured youngster , with masses of black hair , spit curls on her cheeks , heavily mascara-edeyelids and brightly tinted cheeks and lips . She was about medium height , slender and straight , carrying herself nicely . Her bare brown shoulders protruded from a soft pink dress , and a string of imitation pearls hung around her neck . She wore a half-sullen expression , as though she were angry about some matter but did not care to discuss it . " You sent for me , tia mia ? " she inquired politely . " Yes , Juanita , " said the old lady , almost sadly . " This gentlemanwishes to talk with you a few moments . Licenciado Garcia and I , with your permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , " will leave you . " She rose and , resting her hand upon Alberto 's arm , walked out of the office . I was somewhat embarrassed , but Juanita stood and grinned at me as though contemplating how much I could pay and how long I might last in her bedroom . If ever there was a girl whose whole being spelled " sex "  --  she was the individual . " Sit down , Juanita , " I said as softly as I could . " I have something I want you to read . " She seated herself in the chair that Alberto had occupied , cocked one knee over the other , and proceeded to read her mother 's letter which I handed to her . When she had finished it , she laughed harshly . " Poor old Moms , " she said , " I guess my fundraisingcampaign letter was too damn good . " " What do you mean ? " I asked , puzzled by her remark . " Look , mister , I needed some dough . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara . The only way I could think of getting it was to write a sob story to my ma , and tell her I was being held in this whorehouse because of the dough I owed . I thought she would send some folding money to me , but instead she gets Maria top223have you pay me out and bring me home . It 's a laugh , that 's what it is , a hell of a good laugh on me ! " " Do n't you want to go back to your mother 's ? " I inquired doubtfully . " No , I do n't , Mister , whatever your name is , and what 's more , I ai n't going to . Put that in your clay pipe and puff hell out of it . " " But , Juanita , " I protested , " this is no life for a nice young girl like you . " " And what the hell do you know about it ? " she retorted quickly . " This is the only job I ever had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . " " But what will I tell Maria ? You know , I work for her , and if I go back to the ship without you , she is n't going to like it a bit . " " Tell her to keep her nose out of my business , the bitch . I ai n't going to go home and go to business college like my mother wants me to , and then put this little money-making thing on a chair and sit on it all day while I pound a typewriter for some old geezer in a dirty office . Not Juanita , boy ! " " Probably you are right , Juanita , " I temporized , " but there is something you can do for me . Write Maria a little note I can take to her , to prove that I have really contacted you and that you really want to stay here . " " Sure , " she grinned and , seating herself at Aunt Sarah 's desk , she picked up a pencil and dashed off the following , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " DEAR MARIA , How about minding your own business for a change , while I tend to mine ? I love my work here and I do n't need any half-breed chink or any limpy-looey lawyer to tell me otherwise . You might just as well try to argue with a stud horse that he do n't have a pleasant job as to talk to me about it . No matter what my Ma wrote you , I 'm staying here with Tia Sara , just as long as she 'll have me , though she says if she had six girls like me for six weeks she 's flat busted and bankrupt.  |p224I  'll get the fine points of this business down soon and make a lot of money while I enjoy myself . Go catch a shark liver , Chinkee , and enjoy yourself . Your faithful friend , JUANITA ( BEATRIZ ) GONZALES . " I read it over , anger rising steadily within me . " Get out of here and call Tia Sara and Alberto ! " I demanded . " If I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat hell out of you ! " " You ai n't big enough , Limpy , " she grinned , but nevertheless slipped sideways out of the door just as rapidly as she could . By the time Aunt Sarah and Alberto returned , my anger had cooled somewhat , but I still resented the smug and nasty Juanita 's reference to Maria as " chink . " I managed to control myself , while I apologized to Aunt Sarah for having come on such a fool 's errand . When I told Alberto and the old lady what had happened , they both broke into laughter . Aunt Sarah ordered some more Francos for us , and we parted good friends . Driving back in the carromata , although tired and sleepy , I could not help but try to get Alberto 's views upon the character , or lack of it , of Juanita . " Skeep her , Pete , " was the only reaction I could get from him . " Theenk good thoughts about somebody else , but forget that little putita . Takes all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as remembered . " When we reached the hotel , I invited him in for another drink , but , pleading exhaustion , he suggested we omit it and meet at his office in the morning . " I got good , new electric Underwoods typewriter , what you call eet , and cute twitchy-butt steno . We make out your applications for Areezona and send eet air-mails to Beel , no ? " " Si , " I replied , " and thanks a million for everything , Alberto . You 've been more than kind and thoughtful . I 'll see you some time in the morning . " It was a long climb up the ramp to my room , but I finally made it . I had a good drink of the Waterfil-Frazier and water ,  |p225o|pened  the French windows , undressed and retired . Although still very angry at Juanita , I wasted little time in reviewing the night 's proceedings , and fell asleep very quickly . It was quite late in the morning before I awakened . The fog had gone and the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as I showered , shaved , dressed , and found my way down the long ramp to the " Comedor " where I had a delicious American breakfast of ham and eggs , toast and coffee . I set out after breakfast to find Alberto 's office , which was on Calle Sinaloa , just off the Avenida Olas Altas . While strolling along the Avenida , I was amazed at the number of curio stores , their windows filled with Mexican silverware , leather goods , serapes and baskets . As this was the off-season , none of them seemed to be doing any business . Few of the townsfolk were abroad . Those I encountered spoke to me pleasantly and each man raised his hat . I learned to do likewise ; an odd custom for an American but a courteous one at that . I bought ten pesos ' worth of lottery tickets from an old crone dressed in black . I had no hope of ever winning , but it could do no harm to invest some of Maria 's money in lottery chances , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well paved , but the Calle Sinaloa boasted only cobblestones in the center and narrow cement walks at the side . Alberto 's office was in a long , low , one-story adobe building , plastered on the outside and painted a dull blue . The windows were protected by iron bars that gave it the appearance of a jail . A copper plate , set flush in the wall , announced that " Lie . A. Garcia " had his office within and that his office hours were from ten in the morning until noon , and from five in the evening until eight . Alberto 's office was the first door on the left . I passed into his reception room , where the girl he had described as his " twitchybuttsteno " was seated at a modern , metal desk , typing busily away on her new electric Underwood , of which Alberto had been so proud . The room was small , carpeted in dark red , the walls ofp226faded blue paper , and the chairs for clients were old and well worn . The modern touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stenographer . On my entrance the young lady ceased her rapid typing and smiled at me . I knew nothing about the " twitchy butt " business , but she was most certainly a beautiful and intelligent-appearing youngster , with clear olive skin , blue-black hair , and large brown eyes . She had a warm smile which she employed to good advantage in displaying perfect white teeth . Although dressed simply in a brown business skirt and white shirtwaist , she knew enough to have the latter tight enough at the right places . She appeared justly proud of the picture she presented . " You are Mr. Van Duesen , " she said , arising politely . " Please go into Mr. Garcia 's office and sit down . He will be in in only a moment , I am sure . " Although I would rather have remained in the outer office and watched the young lady type , I smiled , bowed , and did as I was bidden . Alberto 's private office , a fairly large room , was hung with sepia-tinted photographs of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but comfortable . No law books were anywhere in evidence . While I waited I heard someone enter the reception room and converse briefly with the stenographer . Then the visitor departed . The girl came into the office where I was , carrying a tray with two cold Francos . " I am sure Mr. Garcia will be here presently , " she smiled , " because he has sent these on ahead . " Before she had even finished her observation , the fat man bounced in , seized the tray , and held a glass to me . " Salud y pesetas , " he cried . " Y stenographers hermosas , " I replied . " Both totally insane , " observed the young lady , as she returned to the outer office to resume her work . Nevertheless , she smiled over her shoulder as she went out the door . Alberto and I discussed legal problems and procedure in our respective countries . He explained the absence of law books by saying that , so far , only three official reports of decisions had beenp227published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy any of them until the judges decided to pay some attention to what they contained . " As eet ees now , each case rests on eets own merits . We do n't bother weeth no precedents . So long as substantialjustice ees accomplish , what difference eet makes whether some other judge rule some other way een some other case ? " I thought that was a very nice way to practice law . " Twitchy , " whose name I learned was Senorita Viola Munoz , and who had been educated in English and in business subjects at the Commercial College at Hermosillo , quickly typed the answers to the questions appearing upon the application blank , and I signed it . Alberto and I each penned a brief note to Bill , and Viola enclosed the whole business , together with Judge Leviton 's recommendation , in an airmail envelope . I wondered how Bill would reconcile old Sam Leviton 's telegram with the splendid letter he had written in my behalf . In my little note to Bill , I was careful to make no mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucson , I would tell him about it and enjoy his reaction to how I had obtained the pesos for the films . If , on the other hand , I eventually determined to seek my fortune elsewhere , there was no reason for Bill to know how I had come by either the funds or the recommendation . At my request , Viola telephoned the airport and made the necessary reservations . Alberto declared a holiday , kissed Viola lightly on the forehead , and went with me to the hotel for my bag . We stopped at the hotel cantina for a few more Francos , and after strenuous abrazos , indicating good-bye and good luck , I went aboard the plane and returned to La Paz , where my old friend with the open-air taxi was glad to transport me to the wharf where our ship still lay . As I climbed over the rail , the little skipper was seated in her favorite deck chair , wearing gray slacks and a light orchid sweater , her little smile giving every indication of her pleasure at my safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juanita with me . I quickly delivered a full report and surrendered the note that Juanita had written her.  |p228I  had thought that Maria would be very angry but the messageonly amused her . When she had finished reading it , she threw back her lovely head and laughed as though it were the funniest thing in the world . " That 's one on us , Pete , " she said through her laughter . " But I still feel sorry for the poor little dumbbell . I 'll have to think up something pretty good to tell her mother . " She was interested and amused , too , at my encounter with Judge Leviton . " One thing the trip proves , Pete , " she said laughing , " you 're a damn sight better blackmailer than kidnaper . " At that we sat and giggled like a pair of silly school kids.  |p229Heavily  laden with the oil from the sharks caught before the ship had reached Guaymas , together with that rendered from those we had caught , and some additional purchases made by Maria at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port on a bright , clear morning . Down the gulf and out into the blue Pacific we went , and there were lazy days aboardship as we cruised up the coast of Baja California toward the United States . Although ours was a coastal run , we stood fairly well out to sea , in the channel reserved for fishing ships of our size , and the coast line appeared , even upon our brightest days , only a misty , indistinct range of bare mountains . To the west nothing but the calm blue water was visible . The weather remained perfect throughout the voyage , with only a light fog in the evenings and , sometimes , in the early morning.  |p230I  washed down the deck each day , stood an occasional watch at the wheel , used a paintbrush to some extent , but had more than ample leisure , during a portion of which Pedro insisted upon instructing me in his brand of Spanish . While I am sure I learned under his tutorship , he was never satisfied with my progress . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking like we was in Mazatlan , no ? How deed you say matches ' ? Damn to hell , you say fosforos ' wheech ees O.K. een Sonora but don ' mean a theeng een Sinaloa . When you talks like een Mazatlan , you calls ' em cerillos , ' onderstand ? " " No , " I would wail , " I do n't understand . Do you mean to tell me I have to learn a different language for every State in the whole damn Republic ? " " No , by God , but some places in the United States you calls potatoes spuds ' and some places you calls ' em potatoes . ' Some places you say tote , ' some places carry ' and some places fetch . ' Ees same theeng een Mexico . " " To hell with it ! " I retorted . " No , by God . I learn you right or I feeds you to sharks . How you say cigarette ' een Guaymas ? " " Cigarro , " I replied meekly . " Correcto ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say cigarette ' en Guadalajara ? " " Cigarrillo . " " Bueno . How you say cigar ' een Nogales ? " " Puro . " " Correcto , y Como se llama en Mazatlan ? " " Cigarro . " " Tha 's right , you see eet ees jus ' as seemple as you ees . " And so it would go , but in spite of his bossing and his naggingI enjoyed my lessons , and Pedro and I became fast friends . For that matter , everyone aboard was happy and good-natured , because the run had been successful . Maria estimated that my " lay , " which was only one sixty-fourth , would run about seven hundred American dollars . The others had , of course , earned much more . Ong kept fairly busy with his cooking , and his meals whichp231I had previously decided were as nearly perfect as ship 's cooking could be , became better and more tasty as we sailed north . It is possible the invigorating salt air and the warm sunshine had something to do with maintaining my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ong 's cooking . I am sure , however , that never before in my life had I consumed such enormous ( plant It ics of delicious food . Reynaldo and Pedro , the fishermen , had little or nothing to do , although from time to time one or the other would stand a watch at the wheel , principally to relieve the monotony . Jose , oil can in hand , visited the motors once in a while , but even he seemed not overburdened . Maria and Mr. Thude stood watch about , but , except for their responsibility , they might have been crew members . At times we would sight a school of porpoise or flying fish , and now and again a giant turtle . We passed so close to one of these creatures , who was apparently sleeping on top of the water , that Reynaldo was able to harpoon it and bring it aboard . ( ) nee on deck and turned on its back , it was completely helpless and about the silliest-looking object I had ever seen . Ong dispatched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat with green beans , onions , bacon cubes , almonds , mushrooms and slices of sweet red pepper . I have never eaten anything that tasted better . Sometimes I would sleep upon deck , next to Reynaldo , but when the nights became cold and misty I was glad to seek the warmth of the cabin , even though Ong snored violently enough to wake the dead . One morning we arrived opposite a break in the rugged coast line and Maria said we were near the bay and town of Ensenada , but , at the distance we sailed from the shore , we were unable to see anything of it . Shortly after that I noticed what appeared to be puffs of steam coming from the ocean , probably a half-mile away . Borrowing Mr. Thude 's marine glasses , I was able to see that the puffs came from two large whales and a smaller one , their huge tails flashing in the sunlight as they dove under the water , and their great , flat heads breaking clear of the waves as they emerged.  |p232At  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon rising from behind the misty coastal mountains , Maria and Reynaldo would sing duets , songs of Mexico or America , shifting the melody from one voice to the other , and harmonizing with such natural ease that I could only marvel at their performance . I wished fervently that Bill and Curly could have heard them and learned what a duet was really like . But the greatest musical treat we had was the night that Maria prevailed upon Mr. Thude to bring his violin to the deck and play for us . Somewhere and some time in his life , the man must have devoted long hours and great energy to mastering the instrument . He played only the music that had been written for the violin , and , to my mind at least , he should have been a professionalmusician rather than first mate on a shark-fisher . I know nothing about the intricacies and technicalities of music . I do know , however , that I have never heard anyone render " Souvenir " as he did . For perhaps an hour he played without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . Then , as he rested , Pedro reached forth and took the instrument and tucked it under his chin . Slowly and tenderly he drew the bow across the strings . Here , instead of the trained musician , we had the natural musicmaker , who probably knew not one string from the others  --  all the plaintive love songs of Mexico , and the laments of its people who were far from home . When he had finished we were quiet and thoughtful . Maria had Ong bring out a can of cold beer apiece for us , and that broke the spell . During the days , in our spare time , Maria and I argued religion , politics and economic theories . Neither convinced the other upon any point . One morning just as I had completed washing down the deck and Maria had completed her watch at the wheel , we went at it hot and heavy , upon the subject of Russia . I believed that we should settle the matter by simply dropping enough atomic bombs upon that country to obliterate it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anyone else , and the idea of mass killing and destruction was so terrible and sop233senseless to her that she had little regard for those leaders whom I had been taught to revere . " Any one of those lousy Perdido Indians we traded with is a damn sight better man than the greatest general who ever won a battle , " was the ending of one of her arguments . " But , Captain , " I remonstrated , " the Russians are savages at heart , intent only upon our destruction and the conversion of the world to communism . " " Maybe so , Pete , " she replied with a firm tone , " but I never heard of a war that accomplished anything . The Spaniards , soldiers and priests alike , tried to whip Christianity into the bare backs of the Indians , but all they accomplished can be poured out of a tequila bottle . The early settlers in the States did the same thing , and while they stole a lot of valuable land from poor Lo ' they never really were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " Well , " I said , somewhat heatedly , " I think the only way we can convert the Russians is to kill them . " " Yes , and I 'll bet that when you were a little boy you were taught that every Mexican was a greaser ' lurking behind a doorway , ready to stick a knife into your back . " Inwardly I damned the little Maria because , as it appeared to me , she was stubborn and illogical . At that moment , smoke near the horizon indicated the presence of a ship coming toward us at a rapid rate . I directed Maria 's attention to it and soon we were able to see the vessel clearly , a great , white steam yacht , about three times the size of the one that Dahling ' had occupied at Guaymas . It was bearing down upon us as though intent upon destruction . Mr. Thude , at the wheel , handed his glasses to our Captain and she looked at the approaching ship long and intently . " I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Thunderbird  --  belongs to old Thomas Patrick O'Riordan , the airplane manufacturer . If he does n't change course pretty soon it 's good-bye Hasta Mariana . " The yacht came on , heading directly for our port side , blackp234smoke pouring from her three stacks and traveling at a speed that the Hasta Mariana could never hope to equal . When perhaps a half-dozen ships ' lengths from us , she turned broadside and broke out a string of signal flags from her halyard . Maria rushed to the cabin , grabbed her signal code and went to work on the message . Then from the locker she pulled five brightly colored flags , snapped them onto a wire and yelled at me , " Run ' em up on the halyard , Pete , that fellow has something to say to us . " I did so as rapidly as I could . We could see a number of people upon her deck , men and women , in very abbreviated clothing , holding highball glasses in their hands and waving to us excitedly . As Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stand By . We have an important message for delivery . " Her answer had been " Holding north at quarter speed . Come as close as safety permits . " Although there was very little wind , there were some rather choppy waves at the moment and neither skipper relished too close contact with the other . When the Thunderbird came round us the second time , she was less than fifty yards away . Someone aboard called to us through a radio loudspeaker : " Good morning , Hasta Mariana , can you hear us all right ? " We waved and shouted that we could . " We have an important message for you , " their loudspeaker boomed again . " Is Jose Astiazaran aboard ? " We yelled and pointed to Jose , to assure them that he was with us . Apparently it was good news because everyone was very gay . " Radio news from Mexico City announced this morning that Jose Astiazaran , engineer on the American motor ship Hasta Mariana , won the second prize at the lottery drawing , amounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Hawaii . Coast Guard told us about where you would be . We put back to tell you the good news . Congratulations , Jose ! "  |p235Poor  Jose , pale as death , staggered as he held onto the rail . Maria ran forward , grabbed his hand and held it over his head . " The Winnah ! " blared the voice from the Thunderbird , and all of its passengers held up their drinks and cheered mightily . " Thanks ! Thanks a million , " yelled Maria , although we all realized that no one could hear aboard the yacht , which increased her speed , headed north a little , and then swung around into the west again , going at top speed towards Hawaii . Then we all rushed to Jose to shake his hand . The poor fellow was actually ill from the shock , but tried his best to grin and be gay . " What you going to do with all that money ? " asked Maria , smiling and wiping tears of happiness from her eyes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess Oncle Sam , she takes most of eet for them incomes tax , but what she les me keep , I geeve some to church and keep the res ' for educate my keeds . Make ' em doctors or lawyers or some other kine good citizens . " " Hoolay foah Jose , " yelled Ong , " me , now , if I haddum , I spend urn in whoah-house ! " After the excitement caused by the Thunderbird 's visit had died down , Maria and I returned to our places on deck , where she resumed her knitting and I continued to lounge at the rail . " Gosh , " I said , " that was a beautiful thing for the owner of the Thunderbird to do  --  go away off his course in order to tell Jose he had won the prize . I wonder how much it cost him to do that . " " Hell , Pete , a good old fellow like that does n't count dollars when he wants to do something nice and friendly . That 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has certainly made me revise my ideas about yachtowners , " I conceded . " Why ? Just because the one you encountered at Guaymas was a bastard ? Old man O'Riordan actually got more joy out of bringing us that message than Jose got in receiving it . " " Just a little while ago you were giving the big shots hell . Now you say some of them are all right . "  | " Pete , I meant a louse that has money or power and , instead of using it to help people , uses it to cause misery . That 's different from the way old man O'Riordan uses his . I 'll bet you a thousand pesos some of those swell-looking gals we saw aboard the yacht are some little tramps that he and his old lady picked up to take on a trip to Honolulu for a little vacation . He 's just a regular guy , even though he has money . " " Yes , " I said , having some doubt about the whole matter , " but did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was mixed up in some sort of airplane graft and might be indicted ? " " Maybe so , I du n no . I doubt if he did anything wrong , by my standard anyway , and even if he stole a couple of million , he 'll make a lot of people happy with it . " " Captain , " I remonstrated , " I do n't see how you can possibly defend a man like that , if he actually was dishonest . " And so we talked and we argued . One thing that Maria said , however , surprised and pleased me greatly . I had made some remark to the effect that I must have proved pretty boring to the Mexicans with whom I had come in contact on our trip . " Why , Pete , you damn fool , they love you ! Say , do you think for a minute your nickname Pete ' would have stuck all the way from Nogales to La Paz if they had not felt in their hearts that you were a regular fellow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy . ' God , no , otherwise you would have been Mr. Van Duesen , ' and damn formal at that . A Mexican never bestows a nickname upon a stranger unless he feels he is a brother at heart . I heard Pedro call you compadre ' a while ago . My God , that 's the greatest compliment a norteamericano can receive . " Never had I felt so complimented . Rough , tough old Pedro , with his black beard and his perpetual odor of perspiration and onions , had decided I was entitled to be called ' cornpadre . ' Old Pedro , who had damned and God damned me into learning to speak a little Spanish according to his idea as to how it should be spoken , thought I was worthy of his trust and confidence . I felt good all over . I guess I felt even better than Jose who had just won the lottery . " Just keep on being yourself and you 'll get along all right , "  |p237she  said . " But tell me , are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill wants you to do ? " " What do you think I should do ? Sometimes I think it would be a good thing , and , at other times , I really think I ought to go back to New York where I know the practice . " " Pete , it all depends upon your notion of your profession . I do n't know what the science of the law is . I have heard your theories and I have listened to Bill 's and I am all confused . If it is an exact science , imperfectly administered , as you say , stick to your books . But if it is the foundation of all human rights and relationships ' as Bill says , get out and mix into it . " Ong , however , who had come upon deck a few moments before , felt differently . " You clit that damn law business , Petah . No good foah nuthin ! Gettum some honest business like pimp oah he-whoah oah sumpin like that . One time , long time aglow , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distlict attoney . I makem deal with him . I pay him one thousan dollah evely  --  month he leeme alone , lemme lun little lottely game . He takum my thousan dollah . I lun two day , get allested , cost me nuthah thousan dollah fine . Hellova law ! Nosuh , pimp mo bettah , or maybe he-whoah , stayum hones . " That night , as I lay in my bunk , I determined that , if I could , I would follow Bill 's advice and open an office at Tucson . It was strange that I could think of no one in New York that I just had to encounter once more , but I longed for my old fishing companions.  |p238We  made port , passed the customs , immigration and public health service , and procured our landing cards . Maria paid us off . We all had money in our pockets . We parted on the dirty , slimy dock at which the Hasta Mariana is moored at San Pedro . I felt like hell . None of them felt too good either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisecracks . Maria , I noticed , was particularly gay , but even her laughter held a touch of sadness . She went on to her home in Wilmington . Mr. Thude disappeared , no one knows exactly where . Jose , bearing the good news of his winnings , went to report it to his wife and " keeds . " Reynaldoand Pedro found some cantina , probably called a " cocktail bar , " where they celebrated Jose 's good fortune . Only Ong remainedaboardship , watchman now instead of cook . I rode a train of old , red , electric cars into the heart of Los Angeles and , fortunately , I was able to find a room at a very nice hotel . From my window -I could look down into Pershing Square . If it were in Mexico , I would call it a plaza , but here it is a square ,  |p239although  I am informed there is a genuine plaza down in the old part of town , some distance from the square . Night was approaching . The street lights were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs flashing from the buildings surrounding the square . Thousands of people were rushing up and down the streets , and across the square . Autos were honking and crowding one another , policemen 's whistles were blowing . I decided that I should be honest with the members of the Bar in Arizona , to which I hoped to be admitted . I reduced my experiences in Mexico to writing , and sent the written memorandumto the Committee on Admissions , accompanied by the followingletter : " The Secretary , Committee on Admissions , The State Bar of Arizona , 810 Security Building , a Phoenix , Arizona . SIR : Heretofore , my application for admission to practice in Arizona , accompanied by a certificate of good moral character from my former employers , was duly forwarded to you through the good offices of Wallace K. Wallace , Esq. , of Tucson , Arizona . Apprehending that the circumstances under which such certificate was executed might be such as to suggest some revision thereof by the member of the firm who signed it , I have prepared , and enclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my somewhat unusual experiences in the State of Arizona , as well as the States of Sonora and Sinaloa , Mexico . Trusting that , with such explanation , my application may receive favorable consideration , I am , Very respectfully , DONALD VAN DUESEN III . " By golly , before I could stop my pen , I had almost signed it " Pete . "
