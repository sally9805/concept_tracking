Prime Minister Nehru last week again came out firmly against India 's alignment with the Western democracies. * He was against it , he told the Indian Parliament , on moral grounds : " Alignment means that you do what you think is not right , but what others think is right for you to do . " <P> Same day , Moralist Nehru got an answer . In Bombay with other Western and Indian intellectuals attending a Congress of Cultural Freedom , Swiss Moralist Denis de Rougemont ( The Devil 's Share ) drew applause from his Indian audience as he developed a parable on neutrality . Said Calvinist De Rougemont : <P> " Imagine a wolf , a lamb and a shepherd . The lamb decides to remain neutral between the wolf , which threatens him , and the shepherd , who protects him . He hopes that by doing this the wolf , instead of eating him , will busy himself first of all with the shepherd , or perhaps the shepherd will attack the wolf . By this means the lamb , who still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will gain time . It is a defensible policy . <P> " What would not be defensible , but a transparent piece of trickery , would be if the lamb attempted to justify his politics by moral or doctrinal reasoning . " <P> <P> * In a busy week , Nehru also found time for a trip to Kashmir , the province bitterly contested by India and Pakistan , where he conferred with local government leaders and rejected as " extraordinarily objectionable " a U.S.-British move for U.N . arbitration of the Kashmir dispute ( TIME , March 12 ) . Nehru was accompanied by his daughter Indira , and by Countess Mountbatten , wife of India 's last British viceroy .
