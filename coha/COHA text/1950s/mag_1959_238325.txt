Once upon a time ( i.e. , four years ago ) professionally sentimental , consistently profitmaking Hollywoodsman Walt Disney built the zingiest , zowiest toy his fertile mind could imagine-and then invited others to come play with it . So far , some 16 million have taken up the offer . Last week 24,000 , including Vice President Nixon and his family , were on hand to help Walt celebrate the fourth anniversary of the toy . Crooned M.C. Art ( People Are Funny ) Linkletter : " Disneyland - its only purpose . . . the pursuit of happiness for all . " <P> Maybe for the customers ; but canny Producer Disney has been reaping more tangible rewards . Since the opening , his dazzling , 61.2-acre carnival has taken in $48 million . Says one associate proudly : " We keep plussing things . " This year 's plusses : a $1,500,000 miniature Matterhorn , 146 ft. tall , complete with bobsleds and " glacier grottoes " ; eight " authentic , air-conditioned submarines " ( cost : $65,000 each ) to carry passengers past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a miniature polar icecap ; the first operable monorail system in the U.S. , built at a cost of $1,300,000 . The investment seems well worthwhile : in fiscal 1959 , Disneyland expects some 4,600,000 customers , a net of $600.000 . <P> Such coin counting has spawned sincere flattery : imitation Disneylands are shooting up across the country . The best are the brainchildren of drawling , blunt-talking Texan C. V. Wood , 38 , a onetime industrial engineer whose survey on Disneyland 's prospects so impressed the master that he was invited in to build the park . At present , Wood is supervising construction of five others ( including Denver 's Magic Mountain , Great Southwest Park near Dallas , Montana Magica in Caracas ) , has half a dozen more in the planning stage . This week , his latest is open : $4,000,000 Pleasure Island , 14 miles north of Boston in Wakefield , Mass . Most spectacular feature : a 19th century New England fishing village , from which the kiddies can slosh off in whale boats to stalk a 7O-ft. replica of Moby-Dick. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
