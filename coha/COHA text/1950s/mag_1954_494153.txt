WHEN the United States created the newest and most hopeful agency of government in all the world , the Atomic Energy Commission , it was natural that it should choose for its leadership David Lilienthal of the Tennessee Valley Authority . His nomination was sent to the Senate early in 1947 . There an old enemy of TVA , Kenneth McKellar , lay in wait for him . From the Valley that had achieved a new life under TVA a score of men came as character witnesses on Lilienthal 's behalf . Barrett Shelton , editor and publisher of the Decatur Daily , was one ; Louis Eckl , editor of the Florence Times and Tri-Cities Daily , was another . They were followed by a farmer , a dairyman , two busi nessmen , the president of a Chamber of Commerce and a hardware merchant . Each witness was subjected to hostile examination as McKellar tried to pin upon them the hated labels of radical and carpetbagger . Toward the end of the list of witnesses the clerk called the name of S. R. Finley . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience to the witness chair . " State your name , your residence and your business , " growled McKellar . In a soft voice the witness " answered : My name is States ' Rights Finley . I live in Chattanooga . I am general superintendent of the Chattanooga Power Board and a native of South Carolina . McKellar sputtered ; Finley waited patiently until the laughter in the room died down . He was named for General States ' Rights Gist , a great uncle and Confederate hero , killed at the battle of Franklin , Tennessee . His father was elected to Congress on the day he was born and served there 23 years . He was an engineer who had worked most of his life as manager of a private utility in Ohio . He had returned to Tennessee to be the first employee of the Chattanooga Power Board , and he had negotiated its purchase of the private utility run by a friend , Wendell Willkie . Now before a Senate committee Finley read from a letter he had written to David Lilienthal . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of any type which would be worthy of the great contribution which you have made to its welfare . . . . " He ended and waited for questions . When McKellar 's turn came the old spokesman for the utilities muttered , " I pass .. . " Seven years later the utilities have found new spokesmen ; the Atomic Energy Commission that Lilienthal built has been made their instrument , while Lilienthal , an outsider , protests in the letter columns of newspapers . But in the newest struggle over TVA old voices still ring . Down in Chattanooga , the location of TVA 's Power Division , I asked Charles Puckette , General Manager of the Chattanooga Times , who in the seven states that make the region could best judge the status and future of TVA . " States ' Finley is one of the few great men of the valley , " said Puckette , " You 'd better see him . " * * ' * " What do we owe you , Squib ? " he said , when lunch was over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't owe but $1.85 Mr. Finley , " said the man in chef 's cap , and apron : " I do n't aim to make no profit like Dixon and Yates . " We walked up the long hall between rows of new Llectric washers , heaters and refrigerators . Each one bore a tag with the price and the address of the store where it could be bought . Two thousand people come here every day to pay their bills , explained Finley . And this way we help our businessmen sell $12 million worth of appliances each year , " Six of his customers , white and colored , shared the small elevator with us . Finley knew them all In his office a messenger was waiting . " You Fred 's boy ? " he ? asked : Your name Fred , too ? .. . well , you take this envelope now and you tell your dad it 's a long time since , In 1952 , residential electric rates were lowest in the TVA area In the East and the Bonneville area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher as the distance from TVA and Bonneville increases . we went fishing for bass , too long ! " On Finley 's desk lay the 1954 Annual Report of Chattanooga 's Electric Power Board . The Board has doubled the number of electricity users in the Chattanooga area in the 15 years of its existence . It has raised their annual consumption to 8.1099 kilo-Watt hours as against the national average of 2.175 kilowatt hours . It charges then an average rate of one cent a kilowatt hour which is just half the national rate . It saves them $15 million a year in electricity bills on the basis of the rates charged in 1939 by the Tennessee Electric Power Company . In 1954 the Board was the largest payer of property taxes in the city and the county . The payments of $290,000 to Chattanooga and $332,000 to Hamilton County were four times the annual payments of the private utility it succeeded . Yet net earnings of the Board after taxes were still $2 million in 1954 and that followed the allocation of $11 million to depreciation and amortization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system was valued at $13,380,386 and the Board had outstanding $13,300,000 in bonds . Fifteen years later the city owns a system worth $21 million after depreciation and the Board has $9 million outstanding in bonds . Its total net worth is more than $13 million . " When I came to Chattanooga , " said Finley , " I went to the biggest banker in town to get the system started . ' Why Finley ' , he said Your system would n't be worth a cent if you gave it away ' . He 's perfectly happy with our deposits now ! " " We 're proud of what we 've done here , " said Finley . " But we 're not empire builders . We have no intention of forcing our opinions on the rest of the nation . We Want to be left alone . " " And yet , " he added , " you can see why the utilities are out to destroy us. electricity . They eat in two-by-four joints and see that they 're , air conditioned . ' How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the owners ' answer TVA ! ' ' Is n't it awful expensive ' , they want to know and the owners say hell no ! ' They bring out their power bills and when the visitors get home they start asking questions about why they pay so much more . " The effect on rates diminishes of course the farther you go from the valley but it is still plain enough . Here it is in black and white , " said Finley handing me three charts prepared by TVA experts and reproduced here . " Now look at the fourth chart , " ( see page 14 ) said Finley , " and you see the results of it all . The TVA yardstick forced down the rates of the utilities that border this region . And the demand for power expanded so greatly that their profits have multiplied . " " The Dixon-Yates plant , " said Finley , " is nothing by itself . It 's the pattern that counts and the pattern is plain . First they block all expansion of capacity for TVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixon-Yates is moving in on Memphis . ? Georgia Power has bought a site on TVA territory below Guntersville . It 's the same all around us . The pressure is on . Already the prospect of a power shortage is discouraging new industry . Within three years the rate structure can be broken by starving TVA . You see we can sell power cheaply because we buy it cheaply from an integrated system . If each municipality has to buy private utility power through TVA or build its own plants to take care of rising demand their efficiency is destroyed . A powerful city like Chattanooga would n't give in to the utilities . We 'd build our own plant first . But just to take care of breakdowns and repairs we 'd have to install 600,000 kilowatts of capacity for every 400,000 kilowatts we needed . That would break our rate structure and yet we 're 10 times better off than the little towns of the valley . " All this I knew to be true . In Decatur where I had gone first Quince Ettens , the manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . " Up to now , " he said , " when prospects for new industries have asked me about power supplies I 've had a simple answer : ' A 's much as you want , whenever and wherever you want it ! ' Now I 'm not sure . And beyond that a rise of just one mill in TVA power would wipe out my net of $200,000 a year at my present rates . " In Nashville , Dr. George Whitlatch , executive director of the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Development Commission , told me of the increasing difficulties in bringing new industries into the TVA region . And Coleman Harwell , editor of the Nashville Tennessean , handed me a map that he had printed in his paper which shows how the manufacturers of electrical appliances have boycotted a region that has bought $1.3 billion worth of their products since the war . Their initial reason was collusion with the utilities in their war on TVA . Their present justification for the boycott is the uncertainty over power supplies in the valley created by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence I learned further what the effect might be if the utilities regained their domination cover power supplies and rates in the valley . " TVA has raised rural electrification , from 3 percent to 93 percent in the valley in the past 20 years . " Well , " said Louis Eckl of the Florence Times , remember when it was 3 percent , . There was n't a light bulb outside the city limits around here except where some rich rancher had rigged up a Delco machine . I used to watch delegations of farmers coming to plead with the Alabama Power Company to run lines out to their farms . ? The company officials laughed at them ! Wilson Dam , here at Muscle Shoals CHART IV : Trend of Power Company Common Stock Earnings The low rates charged by the privately owned utilities adjacent to the WA area , whether they are low by WA example or by TVA , competition , have not retarded the growth in the companies ' common stock earnings . From 1937 , the earliest year for which Federal Power Commission data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings available to the common stockholders of the larger privately owned power companies in the United States a littler : more than doubled and similar earnings of the companies adjacent to TVA increased fivefold . had plenty of power and sold it to the company for two mills a kilowatt hour .. The company retailed the same power for 10 cents , within sight of the dam ! They said no one needed it . And believe me , they have n't changed . " In Florence , too , I learned what cheap power meant to farmers and what higher rate 's would mean for the family farm . I asked Andy Barnett , the ruddy-faced county agent of Lauderdale County , what TVA power meant for his people and he became almost mystical . " Why , " he said , " You 're asking me what made old Columbus come to America and the rest of us follow him . " " Electricity , " said Barrett , " developed with man in these parts , and man developed electricity . Man got electricity because he wanted something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better he , could be . " " Electricity , " Barnett continued , " was the first step hete in modernizing rural life . Before TVA the farmers knew they could never have what city folks had and they did n't want it . When TVA brought electricity to them it was the great awakening . They hung lamps in their ramshackle homes and then they tore down their homes and built new ones around the electric light sockets . " Electricity , " said Barnett , " taught the farmers they could live in this century . Before TVA came the farmers were moving into the cities ; now the city people are moving out to the farms . Land that sold for $40 here not long ago is $200 now . " HAT would a ' power shortage do to us ? You figger out when every farm has electric milking machines . What would increased rates do ? It would bring the mules back , and the old days . Our farms are built around electric power , and cheap power is the margin they live by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head right now in Lauderdale , like they were when I was a boy . " " The irony of our situation , " said Finley , " is that what threatens the farmers threatens our businessmen as well . They come up to me with guilty grins today and they say , ' States ' , what are they going to do to your TVA ' . I tell them , ' They 're not going to do anything , w my TVA . They 're doing it to your TVA and to you . You used to pay $60,000 a year more in power bills and you will again if this drive succeeds . I 'll be ' around to you for an increase just as soon as your crowd forces TVA rates up . ' ' THE HELL YOU WILL ! ' they cry . " You know , ' said Finley . " The Dupont CompanY was n't worried about putting a $20 million plant in the midst of this socialist paradise . The manufacturers that saved a'hundred million a year in power bills did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , they 're silent today when the basis for their own well ' being is threatened . ' We ca n't afford to speak up States , they say , and besides , States ' , the boys at the club would n't understand ' .
