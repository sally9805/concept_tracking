txt LOS ANGELES , May 10 ? Within a few weeks crews of workmen will travel far into the Nevada desert to drill a series of 500-foot-deep shafts into the sagebrush-dotted sand . The shaft , will not be for the extraction of oil or other minerals , but of an intangible  --  the safety of countless millions of people over whose heads may hang , at any hour of the day or night , the Damoclean sword of the atomic age : nuclear weapons borne aloft by planes that may come accidentally crashing to earth . Several have crashed ? the latest at Florence , S. C. , March 11 . The detonation of the nonfissionable explosive constituent of the plane 's nuclear weap'on blew a crater fifty feet across and injured six persons . That thousands of people were not subjected to grisly radiation injuries may be attributed to the fact that two and a half years ago the first of a series of task forces trudged out onto the wasteland of the Nevada Proving Ground to inaugurate one of the Atomic Energy Commission 's least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect techniques for safety in the handling arid storage of atomic weapons . Laconic official announcements have appeared from time to time of the conducting of " safety tests " in Nevada . But they have actually remained more of a mystery than the " full-scale " atomic detonations there , The full-scale detonations // have been regularly seen by observers here on or off the 640-square-mile test site near Las Vegas . Virtually all the publishable data about these experiments  --  detonations techniques , power , and even on one occasion the nature of the weapon  --  have been disclosed . No outsider has ever seen a safety test , and virtually no details about them have been published . A notion has persisted that they have involved only the discharge of conventional high explosives  --  although in reality some have involved atomic explosions and the diffusion of radiation perceptible , as far away as San Francisco , , a distance of 400 miles . While the nuclear explosions have been fairly small ? the A. E. C. says the biggest was " considerably less " than 1,000 tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power range of the much-discussed underground shot of last Sept. 19 . This was of 1,700-ton force , and was detected by seismographs thousands of miles away It is probable that some of the unpublicized safety tests have involved fission " triggering " components of hydrogen bombs , although no hydrogentype fusion explosions have occurred . Program Is Detailed Official sources have just made available to The New York Times as comprehensive an account of the nuclear safety test program as is considered publishable within present security limitations . Many of the details are set forth here for the first time . One of the interesting points of the record is that the averting of the catastrophe at Florence last March hinged to some extent on a comparable explosion in a Nevada safety test nearly a year before . In that test burros , sheep , dogs , and rats were arrayed on the desert as " stand-ins " for hypothetical human victims . Nuclear weapons are composed of two or more masses of material . When brought together they constitute a " critical " mass  --  one big enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an explosive rate . The " critical " mass is created by jamming the sub-masses together through the explosion of a conventional substance like TNT . The problem is to design the assemblies so that until intentional " arming " adjustments are effected  --  which presumably would be done only when the weapon was approaching a real target  --  accidental detonation of the conventional explosive will not create a critical mass . Accordingly , safety tests in essence consist in subjecting nuclear devices to concussions worse than they could conceivably incur in actual use . This is done primarily by deliberately touching off explosions close to them . The crux of this work is the fact that man 's knowledge of atomic behavior is far from complete . Under some conditions . a mass of fission material may be " critical " and under other conditions not . In developing a " family " of nuclear weapons of many sizes and functions , scientists have tried a multitude of possibilities in constituents and arrangements . With a given combination . even its performance under intended conditions may not tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stripped-Down Versions In the safety tests , as in the development tests , the A. E. C. scientists generally work not with " stockpile " weapons , but with stripped-down experimental design versions of prospective weapons . These may be presumed to embody , in exaggerated form , the vulnerable points of prospective weapons ' catastrophic " insides . " Accordingly , the safety tests have to be surrounded with all the precautions invoked in regular atomic tests , such as shielding , radiation monitoring , and use of weather conditions that will not scatter radioactive substances in appreciable quantities outside the test site . Several safety tests have been held up from one to four days for this reason . and in one case there was a two-week delay . The much-discussed new technique of using a tunnel to prevent the escape of radioactive substances ? supposedly first essayed in the historic underground detonation of Sept. 19 ? was employed more than a month before in a safety test . The blast , which may either have touched off a nuclear explosion or released fission substances. was detonated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking Yuc- , ca ? lat in which the 1.900-foot ' tunnel of the Sept. 19 " Ranier ' test was bored . There have been fourteen safety tests up to now . The last was on March 14 . About a halfdozen more are scheduled for this year . A Five-Year Lapse The first one took place on Nov. 1 , 1955 . This was nearly five years after the commencement of experimental atomic explosions in Nevada . Why five years elapsed before saftey tests were started  --  whether we did not have enough atomic weapons to make handling an appreciable hazard , whether accidental detonation was not considered a problem , or whether there were previous safety tests elsewhere  --  the A. E. C. does not care to say . It is possible that too much detail about the safety test schedule could , with other information , give significant clues to the weapons development program . The dates of the tests were : 1955 ? Nov. 1 , 3 and 5 ; 1956 ? Jan. 18 ; ** 24 , June 1 and 26 , Aug. 9 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ** 22 and March 14 . Of the fourteen safety test explosions to date , eight have been on the surface of the ground , three in shafts bored vertically into the ground , and three in tunnels . In addition to the 325-foot tunnel , one 110 feet long , also on the " Ranier " mountain , has been used . Like the " Ranier " tunnel , both the shorter ones were six feet wide and eight feet high . One of the vertical shafts was 300 feet deep . The two others were 500 feet deep . The shafts tapered in diameter from thirty inches at the top to twenty-four inches at the bottom . The engineering facilities and other special work for a surface explosion cost about $100,000 , apart from the expense of the nuclear " device " used ; those for tunnel and shaft shots about $200,000 apiece . To date the cost of the special facilities has amounted to some 0,000,000 . The cost of drilling five 500-foot shafts for forthcoming tests -- :on which bids were received this week  --  will run about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced nuclear explosions  --  in other words , in which ones the devices tested proved vulnerable to the shocks they received ? the A.E.C. is not saying , except that there were " a few . " The commission is specific , however , in stating that only two tests  --  those of Sept. 6 and Dec. 9 , 1957 ? spread any ordinary gamma radiation outside the test site . This is the category of radioactive chemicals that can lodge in living things and , in sufficient intensity , cause long-term injury . In both these instances , the A.E.C. reports , such radiation was detected no farther away than Beatty , Tonopah and Lathrop Wells , in the vicinity of the test site , and in no more than negligible . amounts  --  the maximum being .05 Roentgens , " effective lifetime dose , " meaning the exposure a person would incur if he stayed in the area permanently . This is less than he would receive from natural " background " radiation . After " several " of the tests , the A.E.C. says , " minute amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were detected off the test site , but this was the far milder alpha type of radiation . These are particles that are neutralized by as thin a shield as tissue paper , and are harmless unless , in quantity , they are inhaled or eaten . The A.E.C. says that as far as is known , this is the only radiation that caused brief increases in the radioactivity readings in some West Coast cities , and was " a very small fraction " of levels covered by accepted safety standards . Large Crews Involved The safety tests involve technical crews of 200 to 300 people and from fifty to 100 additional scientific and administrative personnel from the A.E.C. laboratories concerned with the devices . The tests where possible are dovetailed in with the developmental atomic blasts in Nevada to take advantage of the corps of several thousand persons assembled at Mercury , the test base sixty-five miles north of Las Vegas . But the importance of the safety program is indicated in the fact that these tests have been staged at other times as well , as in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests were observed by scientists from a distance of only a few hundred yards , behind sand- , bag barricades . Tunnel and shaft explosions , it is now known , can be safely observed from vantage points in the open , with such minor precautions as dark goggles . Radiation monitors in " men ea a Mars " uniforms with gas masks stand by to move into the explosion area immediately afterward to check contamination . The results of the tests are assessed through a maze of instrumentation like that used in regular atomic detonations . Ten of the tests have been conducted by scientists of the Los Alamos ( N. M. ) laboratory , known as the birthplace of the atomic bomb . Three of the tests were conducted by the Livermore , ( Calif. ) laboratory , which is commonly associated with the development of the hydrogen bomb . On the question of to what extent the tests relate to hydrogen bombs as well as to ordinary fission weapons , the A.E.C. states : " The safety experiments In Nevada result in findings which are fully applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nuclear weapons . " A ' Dress Rehearsal ' One test was conducted by personnel of the Sandia laboratory at Albuquerque , N. M. , where nuclear devices are incorporated into working weapons . This was the test of April 24 , 1957 , which was virtually a " dress rehearsal " of the accident that occurred at Florence . In this test , an actual " stockpile " weapon was subjected to an explosion designed deliberately to scatter its fissionable constituents , without any fission explosion occurring . The assortment of animals was deployed downwind at various distances . Concrete " pads " were arrayed likewise for decontamination studies . " Fallout trays , " with a sticky coating , were arranged in a grid to reveal the intensity and pattern in which the unfissioned radioactive materials , in the form of dust , fell . What injuries animals receive in any atomic tests customarily are not detailed . But the results in this experiment are understood to have been one of the bases for a joint A. E. C.-Department of Defense statement of last Feb. 14 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aircraft or a severe wreck of a train carrying a nuclear weapon may cause some conventional explosive to detonate by impact or fire * * * ( this ) might cause local scattering of nuclear material in the form of dust " * such materials would lbe hazardous only if taken internally as by breathing . Even then , under strict safety measures adopted by the Defense Department and the A. E. C. restricing the quantity that may be carried , it is unlikely any person inadvertently exposed would inhale dangerous amounts of unfissioned materials . "
