Once upon a time , in the palm-fringed squares of Zanzibar , off Africa 's east coast , where Arabs gather each evening to chat over tiny cups of syrupy black coffee , the talk was all of pleasant things , of rich crops of clove and cinnamon , of the fleets of slant-sailed dhows which each January drifted over to the island on the northeast winds and in April , when the winds changed , drifted back , heavy-laden , toward India and the Arabian coast . Zanzibar , in the words of one of its political leaders , was " a happy island " - its climate fine , its people content , its crime rate low , and even its clocks willing to jog along a full six hours behind those in the rest of East Africa . But that was before democracy raised its enlightened head . Last week as Zanzibaris , dressed in their Sunday best , trooped to the polls to cast the first votes of their lives , the world caught up with Zanzibar . <P> <P> Mixed Lot . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed lot . At the bottom are the 200,000 black Africans , " God 's Poor . " Then come the 45,000 better educated and land-rich Arabs , descendants of Arab conquerors who hailed originally from Muscat and Oman . The tiny European colony at last count numbered 296 , mostly British officials . Most everybody on the island speaks Kiswahili and practices Mohammedanism ( including the blacks ) . Overseeing everything is an aged ( 77 ) and beloved Sultan , His Highness Seyyid Sir Khalifa bin Harub , G.C.B. , G.C.M.G. , G.B.E . ( whom God Preserve ) . * The old Sultan owns three palaces , three pet peacocks and three bright red automobiles . <P> But despite Zanzibar 's isolation and contentment , the cry for independence began to be heard . It was the Arabs who did the stirring . Last year Britain agreed that six of the twelve " unofficial " members of the Sultanate 's 25-man legislative council should be elected by popular vote from an election roll open to all , regardless of race . The newly formed , Arab-led Nationalist Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barwani , 38 , a well-educated Zanzibar Arab , boldly filed for office not in a " safe " constituency of Arabs but for Ngambo ( literally , the Other Side ) , the heavily African poor section of Zanzibar city . He counted on the fact that two-thirds of his party 's membership is African . <P> Zanzibar Ernie . But in the sudden awareness of the fact that they had been given equal rights with the Arabs , and harking to the racial winds blowing over from Kenya , Zanzibar 's black majority awoke to a new sense of its own importance . Once they had been divided-the Africans from the mainland , and the other blacks , who call themselves Shirazis and claim descent from Persian conquerors . The two factions came together under the leadership of 52-year-old Abeid Annane Karume , described by one local Briton as " the Ernie Bevin of the Zanzibar workingmen 's movement . " The son of a slave woman from Ruanda-Urandi , a longtime merchant seaman whose 22 years at sea carried him to most of the world 's ports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then settled down to run a syndicate of motorboats in Zanzibar harbor .
