How the most powerful lobby in Washington is bleeding every taxpayer to subsidize veterans who neither need the money nor deserve it ? while the seriously disabled who do need it get short-changed . wHEN are we going to face the fact that our veterans programs are becoming one of the most flagrant wastes of public money in American history ? Unless we do something about it , veterans of World War II are going to receive billions of dollars in benefits for which they have not shown real need and which they do n't deserve . And if the professional veterans lobbies have their way , they are going to be paid a lot more . I am a veteran who was awarded a " 10 per cent disability " for a minor ailment . I have for years refused to collect the disability payments 1 am entitled to because my ability to earn a living has not been in any way impaired . The veterans organizations which are trying to lobby more and more money through Congress do n't speak forme and I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful citizen would want to begrudge adequate benefits to veterans who were seriously disabled during military service . And no one would want to deny generous compensation to the widows and children of those veterans who died during the war . It would be a national disgrace if we did . But one of the striking paradoxes of our veterans programs is that the seriously disabled veterans who do need generous help the must are being short-changed -- they should be getting more attention and more money . Meanwhile millions are being poured out to hundreds of thousands of veterans with so-called " disabilities " who were not handicapped by their service and who are better off economically than many of their fellow citizens who must support them . There are , in addition , thousands of veterans getting free hospitalization for disabilities which occurred after their military service . And under our archaic pension system there are hundreds of thousands of men who will be drawing veterans pensions in addition to social security , despite the fact that they had no injuries in service . Most disturbing of all is the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensions for veterans who were not disabled during their service . For example , one 20 VETERANS : OUR BIGGEST PRIVILEGED CLASS recent bill backed by a major veterans organization called for a $105-a-month pension for all low-income veterans . The New York Times reported that it would cost more than one billion dollars in its first year and $148 billion before the program ran out . That bill was finally defeated but Congressmen concerned with veterans affairs warn that the same groups will certainly be back demanding the same thing next year . MONEY WELL SPENT F E W people realize how much we are now spending for veterans benefits , let alone the costs which will result if the veterans lobby has its way in the future . There are now some twenty-three million veterans of past wars in America of which fifteen million served in the second world war . Since I 'm one of them , it is these fifteen million which concern me primarily . Expenditures on behalf of veterans last year totaled over $5 billion ? the third most expensive item in the federal budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $95 . Since about halt the population of the country is made up of veterans and their relatives , the veterans themselves must bear much of the cost of the benefit programs . An awesome machinery has been erected to funnel out this great sum of money . Until a recent codification there were literally hundreds of laws which dealt with veterans affairs and practically every government agency is involved with them in some way . The Veterans Administration , which has chief responsibility , carries some 174,000 employees on its payroll . No other group of civilians comes in for anything like this special attention from the government and it seems pertinent to ask how well or how badly the veterans of the second world war fare in relation to the rest of the population . An authoritative answer to this , as well as a good many other questions about veterans problems , was provided by the President 's Commission on Veterans Benefits headed by General Omar N. Bradley in 1956. * Veterans , the Commission concluded , arc on the whole better off than non-veterans . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is three years above that of non-veterans ; * Copies of the Report of this Commission , on which many of the facts and conclusions in this article are based , can be obtained for $1.25 from the U.S. Superintendent of Documents , Government Printing Office , Washington 25 , D.C.they own more houses . And in general veterans hold jobs at a higher level than they did before entering the service . A good many more work at professional , managerial , and skilled jobs than before the war ; fewer work as factory laborers or in service occupations . Of course it is n't an accident that we veterans enjoy advantages of this kind . We owe a lot of them to the GI Bill of Rights and the other laws which made up the historic program of readjustment benefits , mustering-out payments , job preferences , loans , and subsidized education after the war . The premise of the program was that veterans would need help in returning to productive civilian life and it was correct . In the decade after V-J day nearly all of the fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over half took advantage of the opportunity to obtain education and training at government expense . By now , more than $24 billion have been spent on postwar readjustment benefits for American veterans ? and nearly $34 billion in loans for homes , businesses , and farms have been guaranteed by the Veterans Administration . Most Americans would agree , I think , that this money was well spent ? that it benefited the nation as well as fulfilled an obligation to those who had returned from the wars well in mind and body . But what about those who were discharged from the service with " disabilities " ? how well have we done by them ? THE ABLE DISABLED T H E answer , as I 've suggested , is that for the most part we have done much too well by many of them : tens of thousands do n't need compensation and should n't get it . Of course any veteran who is so disabled that he is in pain or his earning capacity is really impaired should be fully and generously provided for . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every temporary hurt or minor indisposition resulting from military service should have a cash value for life . However , this is precisely what has happened . Of the 1,785,496 veterans of the Korean War and World War II now receiving compensation for disabilities incurred in the service , well over a million suffer from no more than minor indispositions . These are the so-called " 10 and 20 per cent disability boys " who receive from $19 to $38 a month . Few of their disabilities were sustained in combat . Most result from minor injuries and illness . According to doctors who have studied many of their cases , a high proportion of them have suffered no loss of earning capacity . And according to actuarial studies , they have on the average the same prospects for a natural life span as do normal people . Their general physical condition , in brief , is on the average as good as that of other veterans and probably somewhat better than the average among the population as a whole . If any of the low-disability veterans do have medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veterans Administration pays for them in addition to the monthly disability check . So disability benefits for these men are nothing less than gifts pure and simple ; as such they are undoubtedly a welcome help toward purchasing a car , a television set , and the other things that the rest of us must pay for out of what we earn . The grotesque waste of money in needless payments points up , it seems to me , the slapdash superficiality of the way in which the entire disability program is conceived and administered . Most disinterested veterans experts I 've talked with agree that at least five changes should be made : ( 1 ) Compensation should stop as soon as possible for the majority of the 10 and 20 per cent disability boys . Some of course should stay on the rolls and some should be getting more benefits . But for most , the pointless giveaway should come to an end at once . Unfortunately , for political reasons , it probably will be necessary to settle a lump sum on those whose accounts are closed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government acts ? is that veterans receiving 10 and 20 per cent disability compensation voluntarily make the money they receive available to those who are very badly disabled , or to the children of their comrades who died during the war . ( It seems worth noting that only one-quarter of all veterans receiving compensation fell ill or were injured in a combat zone ? not to mention combat itself . For many of them , surely , their struggles to win , raise , and hold onto their disability payments are a lot more intense than anything they underwent during the war. ) ( 2 ) The present scale of payments should be completely reconsidered . There are some disgraceful inequities , even among those who are considered to be 80 to 100 per cent disabled . Some of these men are able to make some money despite their handicap , and more power to them . Others are lying flat on their back at home , unable to work , a burden to their family , and 22 VETERANS : OUR BIGGEST they 'll be in that condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 per cent disability category , the top compensation rate of $225 a month ? in special cases it can go higher ? seems , to me at least , inadequate . It should be sharply increased ? doubled in some cases in my opinion ? and I can think of no way in which the funds saved from cutting down on low-disability payments could be put to better use . ( 3 ) The standards by which disability payments are determined should be thoroughly revised . Supposedly the present schedule of payments was based on an estimate of the average impairment of earning capacity which a given disability would cause . But when General Bradley 's commission looked into the question it found that scarcely any information had been collected on the relation between disabilities , earning capacity , and current income . The disability schedule reflected neither modern medical knowledge nor the changes in the character of present-day jobs , which are increasingly " white collar . " Veterans applying for aid were not even asked ? and still are not asked ? to indicate their economic situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special statutes covering veterans who had lost a limb or suffered other incapacities were not sufficiently taken into account . Certainly such factors as the loss of physical integrity , social inadaptability , and shortened life expectancy must be taken into account when awarding disability payments . And it can be argued that in certain cases the ability to overcome a handicap should not result in loss of compensation . But what is needed , above all , is a single comprehensive rating system based primarily ? and realistically ? on earning capacity . ( 4 ) Adequate provision should be made for the recovery of veterans from their disability and their rehabilitation . This is one of the chief defects of the present system . In theory , disability payments ought to cease when the veteran recovers ; in practice a large proportion of them are for life . Medical experts suggest that a reexamination of disabled veterans take place each year ; as things stand now they may or may not take place and often do n't . Equally serious is the lack of co-ordination between the government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rusk , one of the nation 's leading experts on veterans rehabilitation , feels that if disability payments are not carefully supervised they may act to stifle the veteran 's initiative to stand on his own feet as a self-sufficient and productive PRIVILEGED CLASS citizen : nothing , obviously , could he more disj couraging for the operation of an effective rehabilitation program for the disabled . Who is going to protest against changes of this kind being made in the compensation system ? You can wager that the loudest complaints will come from those who need disability compensation the least . When I discussed changes in the disability program with veterans groups I found that the most violent opposition came from the American Legion , an organization which is made up for the most part of able-bodied men . The nearest agreement came from the spokesman for an organization of paralyzed veterans . He was understandably concerned that cuts made in some disability payments might extend too far and affect his group . But if that could be avoided , he was all for getting a revision of the clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOSPITAL BEDS j U S T as scandalous as the deficiencies of the compensation program are the abuses of the veterans hospitals . The Veterans Administration runs some 173 hospitals which admit over half a million patients a year . Originally these hospitals were set up only to take care of men who were disabled ? either mentally or physically ? in the service . However an exception was soon made to admit men who were n't ? if extra beds were available . What happened was that most who applied were admitted and the beds were soon filled ; pressure then mounted to construct more hospitals , providing more beds for those with disabilities received outside the service , and again the beds filled up . The cycle kept repeating itself . According to a recent report of the Veterans Administration only one of the " eligible " 22,000 veterans on its hospital waiting list had been disabled during military service ? and he was merely waiting to get into a hospital in the area he preferred. * Theoretically , a situation of this kind was supposed to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during military service to sign an affidavit swearing that they could n't afford to pay for treatment . It seems that this affidavit has now become something of a joke . And understandably . The * It should be noted that some of the pressure on these hospitals results from the inadequacy of state and local facilities to care for thousands of neuropsychiatric cases who are forced to turn to the veterans hospitals for treatment . law forbids the Veterans Administration even to check up on it ? The wastage involved in the compensation program can be counted merely in hundreds of millions of dollars . Compared with the multi-billion dollar pension grab which is now in the offing ? and will reach astronomical heights if the veterans organizations have their way ? it really seems quite modest . THE PERILS OF PENSIONS F E W people seem aware that , as the Jaw stands , at least half of all living veterans and their dependents ? possibly more ? will qualify for a veterans pension in addition to social security before they die . Pensions , of course , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general , to be eligible for a pension ranging from $66.15 to $135.45 a month ( for a veteran requiring care and attendance ) , a veteran must be ( a ) at least sixty-five years old ; ( b ) 10 per cent disabled from any cause ; ( c ) unemployable ; ( d ) with a yearly income of less than $1,400 if single and $2,700 if married . ( Younger veterans can qualify by showing a higher degree of disability . ) Obviously only a small proportion of the veterans of World War II and the Korean War are now disabled enough or old enough to qualify for pensions under these terms . Just how many will receive pensions toward the end of the century depends a lot on how the laws are interpreted and administered . At present anyone who is sixty-five and out of a job is considered ? in practice , if not in regulations ? unemployable . And if the standards of disability are construed in the future as they are now , we can expect that many veterans will have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even at present , the pension laws and standards are extremely liberal . If they remain unchanged , it is estimated that some four million World War II and Korean veterans and their dependents will be on the pension rolls at the end of the century . This program will cost billions of dollars each year but will be no more than a thin shadow of the pension system the big veterans organizations are now driving hard to put on the books in Washington . The American Legion , for example , wanted last year both to raise the maximum income a veteran can receive and still be eligible for a pension and to establish in law the principle that a veteran would be automatically considered both unemployable and disBY abled when he 's sixty-live . This proposal is only one of several advanced by veterans organizations which could extend pensions to virtually all veterans . It is estimated that another of the plans ? for an unqualified , all-embracing service pension ? would , at its peak , cost as much as   billion a year . Veterans would thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more favored than any large group has ever been in the history of our country . A heavy share of the burden of paying them would fall on the rising younger generation which , from the look of things , will have quite enough troubles on its hands as it is . THE REVOLUTION AND THE THUMPED CHEST true that after the Revolutionary War , the Congress voted pensions for veterans ? and for excellent reasons , The typical Revolutionary soldier , a volunteer who was miserably paid during his service , returned to a chaotic and broken economy . There was no medical assistance if he had been hurt , no help toward getting a start in civilian life , and no government program to assist civilians in their old age . He needed , in fact , a pension . All those conditions have now changed . We were relatively well-paid during the war . Those who need medical care are getting it . Readjustment benefits such as the GI Bill gave us an important push forward when we had to make our way again in civilian life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance as civilians at very low rates . Most important of all , a national system of Social Security has been put into operation . True , it is not fully adequate for the needs of most of our population ; but it is a pretty safe bet that by the time most veterans of World War II are sixty-five it will be vastly improved , along with the other forms of social insurance . Veterans who arc now better off as a group than the rest of the population will also be better off in their old age ; they 'll acquire more savings , private pension-pIan payments , and other benefits than non-veterans . Thcy have then , as a group , no special need fur a general service pension or for a loosely administered pension for those " disabled " after military service which would , as the Bradley Commission pointed out , amount to the same thing . It is probably for this reason that lobbyists for veterans organizations tend to talk a good deal less about future needs than about past sacrifices . Certainly there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was as much of it inside the services as out of them ? If we must assess different degrees of sacrifice , surely it is absurd to lump together the Army blackmarketeer , the stateside military clerk , and the combat soldier who risked his life every day . There were of course some men who , to their discredit , managed to evade the military service and comfortably sat out the war . But in general , the burdens and sacrifices of military service were shared through the selective-service system about as fairly and as democratically as humans have ever done it . The final case against pensions depends not on weighing relative sacrifices between soldiers and civilians but on the simple principle that people who are lucky enough to be citizens of this country have a fundamental duty to protect it when it is in danger . Franklin D. Roosevelt , a President who could not be called hostile to social legislation , summed it up in these terms : The government has a responsibility for and toward all those who suffered injury or contracted disease serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform must therefore be placed in a special class of beneficiaries over and above all other citizens . The fact of wearing a uniform does not mean that he can demand and receive from his government a benefit which no other citizen receives . It does not mean that because a person served in defense of his country , he should receive a pension from his government because of a disability incurred after his service terminated . SOUND AND FURY AND PRESSURE H OW would the majority of veterans feel about this principle ? Are they lined up behind the drive for pensions ? No one can know the answer with great precision , but there issolid evidence that they are n't . According to a Roper poll , most veterans felt entitled to some help immediately after discharge and they were strongly in favor of generous assistance to those disabled in service . But only a small proportion ? less than l0 per cent ? thought that all veterans should be awarded pensions . When another survey asked veterans if their military service had been a handicap to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest said either that it had helped them or that it had made no significant difference . Practically all the sound , the fury , and the political pressure over pensions springs not from the rank-and-file but from the leadership and lobbyists of the great veterans groups ? the American Legion , the Veterans of Foreign Wars , and the Disabled Veterans of America , among others . ( About the only group opposed is the very small American Veterans Committee . ) The power of these groups in Washington today is staggering . The American Legion , for instance , is rated by political experts as one of the smartest and most effective lobbies operating in the country today . Working its way through the Congressional committee rooms and corridors it seems able to change its tune at will from a throbbing emotional appeal for our noble heroes to a shrewdly timed threat to swing support to a Congressman 's political opponent . It can back up its campaigns with a large supply of money , with such tactics as organized letter writing , and simply with its membership figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tangle with the Legion or with the other veterans groups who work along the same lines , if less elaborately . Some have been known to propose ambitious bills for veterans benefits which they make sure will die before they reach the committee stage . Pension hills have been passed in the House and then killed in the Senate ? with , it was suspected , a sigh of relief from the House . But many Congressmen wonder how long a showdown with the veterans groups over pensions can be avoided . " The pressure for veterans pensions , " according to one Congressman , " is like a cloud hanging over Washington . " Since the total membership of the pro-pension groups numbers over four million , the timidity of the legislators who deal with them is comprehensible . But many experts on veterans politics seriously doubt if the top-level leadership of the organizations and the professional lobbyists they hire really speak for their members , many of whom , they suggest , are more interested in the clubhouse camaraderie of the organizations than in legislative policy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been compared to old-line union bosses who feel that they must get a raise each year for their members or lose office . This may be so , but if you talk with top officials of the American Legion , you will find no hint of uncertainty , no self-questioning about Legion policy or the degree of support for it . The men who lead the Legion are supremely confident that they speak for the veteran ; any suggestions that they might be wrong , that an alternative policy might have merit , that they are advancing a minority position , are treated as if they verge on the unpatriotic . These men seem perfectly sincere in their demands for special status for the veteran . They were genuinely shocked , for example , when I told them that I had refused to collect my disability compensation . I was , they told me , committing a disservice to all veterans by doing so . This kind of fervor , it must he said , did , in its day , produce some excellent and badly needed legislation for veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwar GI Bill of Rights is an example . It is unfortunate that the veterans groups are now so unswervingly committed to the quest for more and more money . It will be an extremely tough job to stop them from getting what they want . The large mass of veterans who are not actively seeking pensions and special privileges are the ones whose voices are seldom , if ever , heard . There is , in short , no lobby for the public interest . What is most needed , it seems to me , is a Citizens Group on Veterans Affairs which would be composed of well-known leaders who hold high prestige in the public eye . Such a committee could carry on a vigorous campaign to expose the dangerous consequences which so many proposals for veterans pose to the country as a whole . One important function of such a group would be to re-emphasize the principle on which all discussions of the veteran must turn and with which , I believe , most Americans would agree : that military service is an indispensable and honored obligation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the basis of special privilege . If we veterans are to be a special group apart , let us be apart only in the sense that we are less self-seeking and more dedicated to the broad national welfare than others . We can do our country a much-needed service by taking a bold stand against those who would impose great burdens on the public in our name .
