Behind every psychoanalyst stands the man with the syringe , said Freud . Last week , at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in Chicago , the syringe-wielders held the spotlight . The momentous goal toward which they were advancing : chemical treatment of schizophrenia and other mental disorders . <P> Attention centered first on Dr. Stig Akerfeldt , a boyish ( 27 ) , blond biochemist from Stockholm 's famed Nobel Institute , who had reported that when a certain chemical is added to a sample of blood serum , it will turn a bright red if the subject has schizophrenia or other severe mental illness . Akerfeldt 's method has been touted as a " test " for schizophrenia . It is far from being that , since it also gives a red reaction with patients suffering from various infections , cancer , disorders of the liver , or even with women in the later months of pregnancy . But Akerfeldt 's work may be a step forward . <P> Red Reaction . It has been known for more than 20 years that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal people , and some of these elusive differences show up in the blood . The trouble has been that when one group of researchers has reported a detectable difference , other groups have not been able to confirm it . <P> Researcher Akerfeldt is clearly over that hurdle : in a jampacked meeting last week U.S. researchers said that they had duplicated his method with minor variations , adding a chemical called DPP ( for N , N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine ) to serum specimens and getting the red reaction from patients with serious mental illnesses and some other diseases . ( One notable exception : patients who have had schizophrenia a long time . ) Most promising positive use : the reaction seems to be clearest in children , whose emotional disorders are especially hard to diagnose-and who are not likely to have such misleading conditions as malaria or pregnancy . In any patient , old or young , other techniques must be used for diagnosis . <P> More important than whether the reaction can be used as a test is the question of why it occurs at all . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akerfeldt 's DPP reacts to is a copper-containing enzyme , ceruloplasmin , present in the blood . It had been assumed that there must be more of this enzyme in schizophrenic than in normal blood . Not so , said Akerfeldt : the reaction measures not the amount but the activity of ceruloplasmin , and this activity depends at least to some extent on the presence of a second substance which he has not identified and calls simply " K.2 . " There seems to be a lot of K2 in schizophrenics ' blood .
