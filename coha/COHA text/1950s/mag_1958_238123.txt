ONE of TIME 'S biggest beats is Latin-America , a reach of 6,000 miles from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego . Reporters fan out from four TIME bureaus ; experienced part-time correspondents cover every major city . Copies of the Latin American edition are flown to most of the area the same day that TIME goes on sale in the U.S. <P> The reception to TIME 'S reports of Latin America-whether ardent endorsement or furious disagreement-is always emphatic . TIME is apt to be denounced for printing a scandal of the reader 's own country and praised by the same reader for exposing the unlovely truth in a neighboring land . TIME is eagerly sought as a window on the world , and denounced as an unwanted interventionist in foreign affairs . A story of impressive accomplishment in Brazil recently inspired President Juscelino Kubitschek to pull out his Portuguese-English dictionary and translate it personally for the local press . Another story of the drought that is starving thousands in northeast Brazil moved Rio 's Diario Carioca to comment : " How sad ! How true ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all knew about and tried to forget , should be reported to the whole world in TIME ! " <P> The intense reaction comes partly from the different perspective on events as seen by Latin Americans . What to a U.S. citizen might seem a quixotic , comic , futile or irrelevant revolution can be brave , idealistic , tragic or admirable to its courageous participants . The army that is a means of national defense in the U.S. and Europe can be policeman and intermittent government in much of Latin America . To the U.S. reporter , born to a heritage of liberty and democracy , the Latin American , in his political fight for liberty , democracy and economic sufficiency , can seem mercurial , sometimes misguided . To the Latin American , with his rich Latin culture , the North American can seem peremptory , didactic , impatient . <P> TIME 'S reporters and writers strive mightily , within the framework of their U.S. upbringing , to understand and report accurately on the newsmaking Latin Americans . This week , for an exhaustively reported story on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eight pages of color photographs , see THE HEMISPHERE , The Paycheck Revolution . <P> For the portrait of Mexico 's President Adolfo Lpez Mateos , TIME turned to one of Mexico 's leading artists , Rufino Tamayo . A stout antiCommunist , Tamayo has long been frozen out of the bread-and-butter work of decorating the public buildings of his native land by the Communist clique of muralists headed by David Siqueiros and the late Diego Rivera . As a result , he leads the life of a wandering expatriate , painted this week 's cover in Paris . He recently finished another Paris commission-a mural depicting Prometheus bringing heavenly fire to men , in the newly opened UNESCO headquarters-and reproduced this week in color in ART .
