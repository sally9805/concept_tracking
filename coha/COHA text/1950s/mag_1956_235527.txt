Until last week the political heirs of Turkey 's late great Kemal Ataturk-Republicans and Democrats alike-have maintained a tacit agreement to stick by their leader 's founding dictum : in modern Turkey " state and religion must be separate . " Then dapper , driving Premier Adnan Menderes , trying to whip up popular support to offset rising big-city discontent with his extravagant inflationary policies ( TIME , Oct. 24 ) , took off on a speech-making swing through his Anatolian farm-country strongholds . At Konya , in the wheat-growing heart of what Istanbul calls the Koran belt , he blurted out the most direct pitch yet for the prayer-rug vote by a leader of modern Turkey : " If there are no courses on religion in our schools , " he said , " citizens who want their children to learn religion are deprived ... It would be suitable to have courses on religion in our secondary schools . " <P> To " emancipated " Turks , who honor Ataturk for liberating them from the hold of the mullahs , this was democratic heresy . Turkey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press law . <P> <P> Said Vatan 's Editor Ahmet Emin Yalman , Menderes ' powerful press backer in two elections : " Laicism is one of the principal cornerstones of modern Turkey . To make concessions on this subject for political reasons is an action not befitting a head of government . " Istanbul 's Cumhuriyet , another past supporter of Menderes , denounced any plan to " touch the foundation pillar of the Ataturk era . " The opposition Republicans and the new Freedom Party blasted Menderes ' pronouncement as " unconstitutional " and conceived in failure . Though only last month the government had shut up two newspapers for saying less . Menderes made no reply to last week 's attack . In the villages of Anatolia , the mullahs went on with their teaching in many elementary schools .
