How big was Jesus Christ ? Was He a strongly built man 5 feet 10 inches tall , with long , delicate hands &; feet , a right shoulder slightly lower than the left ? Did He have a brain weighing approximately 1,492 grams ? These questions were debated for three days last week by 200 learned scientists and black-robed scholars of the Roman Catholic Church in the huge , frescoed Hall of the Papal Chancellery in Rome . It was the first International Congress of Studies of the Holy Shroud . <P> During the 7th Century two early churchmen , Saints Braulionis and Adamnan of lona , referred to the existence of a cloth venerated as the shroud in which the body of Christ was wrapped when it was laid in the tomb . In 1171 William , Archbishop of Tyre , mentioned such a shroud in Constantinople . In 1204 a member of the Fourth Crusade , which sacked the city , sent the shroud to his father in France . But in 1349 the Church of St. Stephen in Besanon , where it was kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished . <P> The following year , King Philippe de Valois of France presented to one of his lords a cloth purporting to be the same shroud . Two bishops forbade veneration of it , presumably because it was a fraud ; and in 1390 Pope Clement VII issued a special bull ordering that it should be treated only as " a painted representation of the original , authentic Holy Shroud , whose whereabouts are unknown . " Since 1452 the cloth has been the property of the Italian House of Savoy . On special occasions it was exhibited to the faithful , but in the 19th Century , at least , it seems to have appeared not as a painting but as a soiled and damaged piece of white linen . <P> 65 &; 90 Degrees . In 1898 , Italy 's King Umberto I agreed to have the relic photographed . Secondo Pia , a photographer of Turin , was given the job . While developing the plate , he reported : " Suddenly I was so filled with fear that I almost fainted . For there grew plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose head was covered with blood , whose wrists carried stigmata , whose expression was one of untold majesty . " <P> Ever since , the argument has raged : Does the 14 ft. 3 in. - long cloth really bear the front &; back imprint of Christ 's naked body , as though it had enveloped Him lengthwise , or is it the work of a clever forger ? Points mentioned in favor of the shroud 's authenticity : <P> The figure on the shroud is like a photographic negative ( light areas appear dark ) , which would seem to indicate that it is the result of an impression rather than a painting ( though an impression might still be a forgery ) . According to a letter read at the Congress by Roman Catholic Professor Rudolf Kynek of Czechoslovakia , " We have treated corpses with myrrh and aloes , and when we placed them in linen an impression of the corpse could afterwards be plainly seen on the linen when we exposed it to light . As time went by ... when humidity covered it with invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . "
