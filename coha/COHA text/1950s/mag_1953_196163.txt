In Washington last week , John Moors Cabot , President Eisenhower 's top Latin America hand , outlined an important new U.S. policy toward the other American republics . " No regime which is openly playing the Communist game can expect from us the positive cooperation we normally seek to extend to all of our sister republics . " the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs told a meeting of the General Federation of Women 's Clubs . <P> Although Cabot did not state it quite so explicitly , the converse was evident : the U.S. is prepared to cooperate with and aid any established non-Red government , regardless of its nature . Said Cabot : " We can not take the attitude that ... it is wrong for Soviet Russia to impose Communism on foreign nations but permissible for us to impose democracy on them , that ... we can afford to feud with every government whose internal politics do not altogether meet our approval . " <P> By implication , Cabot applied the overriding test for a government-is it Red ? - to three nations much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " made it clear he wished for good relations with the United States , " said Cabot . " In today 's world . Argentine and United States interests coincide far more than they clash . . . Peron has told us that Argentine friendship has no price tag on it . " <P> The U.S. has tried friendship with Peron before-only to have him attack U.S. policy or outrage U.S. opinion by wrecking the great newspaper La Prensa . Peron has even played footie. off &; on . with one faction or another of Argentina 's Communists . But this week , in a filmed interview for U.S. television , he said : " It would be a most dangerous problem for any of our countries if a government in Latin America . . became Communistic . " In that mood , Peron clearly passes the test . <P> Guatemala . " We find it difficult , " Cabot said , " to be patient , after all the blood and treasure we have poured out in Korea to safeguard the free world , when the official Guatemalan newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteriological warfare . " Guatemala fails the test , and can expect no help . <P> Bolivia . The U.S. had to make " strong representations " protesting the seizure of tin mines , partly owned in the U.S .. by the revolutionary government of President Paz Estenssoro . But , said Cabot , " we believe it is sincere in desiring social progress and in opposing Communist imperialism . " Bolivia passes , and will soon get $5 , .000,000 in Foreign Operations Administration " famine relief " food and $4,000,000 from other FOA funds . <P> Argentina received Cabot 's speech with rejoicing . At the annual Loyalty Day demonstration in Buenos Aires ' Plaza de Mayo , often a blow-off of anti-U.S . oratory , Peron said last week : " I should like to exalt the great personality of General Eisenhower , who with a magnificent gesture of friendship sent his brother* to unify and solidify the bonds of our peoples . I am the happiest of men at this result . " In a front-page editorial entitled <P> THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR . CABOT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handshake after a prolonged misunderstanding ... is often worth as much as a good liver treatment . " In Guatemala , the Communist Tribnna Popular snarled : " Insolent intervention . " <P>
