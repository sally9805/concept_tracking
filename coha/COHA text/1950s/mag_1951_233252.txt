HILAIRE BELLOC : AN ANTHOLOGY OF HIS PROSE &; VERSE ( 283 pp. ) - Selected by W. N. Roughead-Lippincoft ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> One pleasant Edwardian day , that paragon of propriety , Henry James , went down to Sussex to pay a call on G. K. Chesterton . " It was a very stately call , " wrote Chesterton , with James all buttoned-up in a frock coat . Suddenly , a terrible bellowing broke out and two unshaven hoboes in workers ' " reach-me-downs " burst in . They had walked all the way from Dover after spending their last penny in France , but they had enough strength left to quarrel furiously- " accusing each other of having secretly washed , in violation of an implied contract between tramps . " Henry James is said to have shuddered like a giant oak on finding that one of the bums was an official of the Foreign Office , the other , Chesterton 's bosom friend and distinguished literary colleague , Mr. Hilaire Belloc . <P> Oldtimers insist that this anecdote has symbolic significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rough &; ready young Belloc , " fully armed and uttering war cries like Athena " ( in the words of the London Times ) invade " the startled , insular world of late Victorian Oxford . " While he laid about him , buffeting the dons , intoning ballads and drinking songs , dominating political and religious debate , Britons soothed themselves by reflecting that he was , after all , a bit of a foreigner . For every true Briton believes at heart that whenever his peace is disturbed by uncompromising passion and brilliance , foreign blood is bound to be at the bottom of it . In Belloc 's case , the tag goes : " Of course , his father was a Frenchman . " <P> The Sussex Garden . Hilaire Belloc , now 81 , has spent a long and distinguished career living up to his countrymen 's expectations about hyphenated Englishmen . Though he has lived in Sussex for 46 years , he insists that he always feels like a Frenchman there , and that it is only by crossing over to France that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic , he has treated the Church of England not as a holy keystone of British tradition but as a disastrous heresy . And finally , while he has pleased the British by insisting that he is a mere " hack , " he has shocked them by describing literature as a " stinking trade " and declaring : <P> I 'm tired of Love ; I 'm still more tired of Rhyme , <P> But Money gives me pleasure all the time . <P> Yet few writers have given more for less money . Of Belloc 's 100-odd volumes of prose and poetry ( the first , Verses and Sonnets , was published in 1895 ) only two or three have been bestsellers . Such books as The Path to Rome , Richelieu , Marie Antoinette , and Cautionary Verses still sell well enough for Belloc to be able to drink good French wine . But the slight look of shabbiness about his 15th Century Sussex house , King 's Land , shows the slimness of the owner 's purse . The furnishings of the old house have been neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1914 . His children and grandchildren ( one of whom is a monk , another a nun ) are often there with him , but Chesterton is dead and few other friends survive to fulfill his youthful vision of old age-a time , he had hoped , when <P> . . . the men who were boys when I was a boy <P> Shall sit and drink with me.
