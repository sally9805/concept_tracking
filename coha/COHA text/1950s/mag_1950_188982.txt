Some days it was the little , everyday things that crept up and overwhelmed a man with thoughts of life 's swift pace and inexorable end . Harry Truman had one day like that last week . <P> It began with a perfunctory White House morning schedule , including a check to see whether flowers had been dispatched to the funeral of his good friend , Roger Sermon , mayor of Independence , Mo . Then it shifted to Washington 's Episcopal Cathedral of St. Peter &; St. Paul . There , on an unseasonably balmy afternoon , bareheaded Harry Truman and Bess , too warm in a mink cape and navy blue taffeta , tried in vain not to steal the show . They wanted to be as inconspicuous as any of the other 1,100 guests at the wedding of Treasury Secretary John Snyder 's hearty , handsome daughter Edith ( " Drucie " ) to John Ernest Horton , a personable former White House social aide , soon to be a movie pressagent . Drucie 's best friend , Margaret Truman , was maid of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five-stream fountain at the wedding reception in the rambling Chevy Chase ( Md . ) Club . The President bypassed the fountain during his twelve-minute appearance , but he did take time , after nudging Bess , to buss the bride . <P> Then Harry Truman dropped by at the Statler Hotel to speak a few words to the ladies of the Women 's Patriotic Conference on National Defense , gathered in annual convention . Usually such extemporaneous appearances find the President at his relaxed and good-natured best . This time " he spoke solemnly and earnestly : <P> " One of my closest friends , the mayor of Independence , Missouri , passed away on Monday night very suddenly , from a heart attack . He and I were raised togther in our home town . He is five or six years younger than I am-or was ... I was most anxious to be present to pay my respects to his passing , but conditions were such in Washington that I had to stay here . . . <P> " And then this afternoon , the daughter of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was present at that ceremony . That young lady I remember when she was like this-along with my daughter . . . That brings home to me that here are the young people ready to take up for the country , and here are those of us who have passed the three-score mark , passing on to the next world , leaving it to the younger people . I have but one ambition as President of the United States , and that is to see peace in the world , and a working , efficient United Nations to keep the peace in the world . Then I shall be willing to do what my mayor did , pass on happily so that some able , younger man may carry on the work necessary to keep this Government going . "
