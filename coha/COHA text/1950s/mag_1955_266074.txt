When Al Capone was public enemy No. 1 , an estimated 4,000 Chicagoans died in gang wars in the 15 years from 1920 to 1935 . Such niceties as the bulletproof car , the sawed-off shotgun , and the one-way ride* were either inaugurated or raised to their ultimate refinement in Chicago . Such blood-spattered tableaux as the St. Valentine 's Day Massacre and the killing of Gangster Dion O'Banion in a fern bank in his florist shop , glamoured up in Chicago 's Front Page newspaper tradition , shocked and thrilled a generation of Americans and Europeans . <P> Chicago still has an active criminal record , but times have changed . Last week , just a block from the alley where , on a memorable night in 1934 , John Dillinger , was shot to death , two detectives quietly arrested the city 's most-wanted fugitive . <P> Their quarry was no blue-chinned hood in a bulletproof vest , but a woman of 29 with dyed black hair and five telltale moles on her face . She was Mrs. Margaret O'Connor , and she was wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Life . Margaret was born in Georgia , and when she was a little girl her family moved to Chicago 's Near North Side . At 13 Maggie stole a car . She liked nice , big , dangle earrings and convertibles . Draft beer was n't good enough for her : Maggie 's taste demanded Miller High Life by the chilled case . <P> In 1943 , when she was 17 , Maggie married Benny Tomasello , whose greatest virtue ( in Maggie 's eyes ) was his modest record as a petty criminal . In 1944 , after she had a baby girl , Maggie divorced Benny . Four years later she married Bobby O'Connor . While hanging out the wash , she used to boast to neighbors about what a good provider Bobby was . Bobby hardly ever had to work more than a couple of nights a month . For her part , Maggie was as dutiful a wife as a man could ask for : she usually drove the getaway car for Bobby and his gang . But Bobby was often violently jealous of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than tranquil . Once , after he saw Maggie talking to a man in a bar , Bobby rushed home , grabbed a pair of scissors , and cut all Maggie 's and the children 's clothes to shreds . In retaliation , the kids took the scissors and cut all the sleeves from Bobby 's snappy ( and stolen ) wardrobe of 20 suits . Not to be outdone , Bobby heaved the children 's TV set out of a second-story window . When Bobby went off to the Illinois State Penitentiary last June to serve a stretch for armed robbery , Maggie and her three children - two girls by Bob by - moved out . <P> A Tongue-Tied Date . Since Bobby would not be coming home for a long , long time ( on top of his five-to-1 5-year sentence at Stateville , he was extradited to Milwaukee last week to stand trial on charges of robbery and murder ) . Maggie had to go back to work . <P> Unlike her husband , Maggie O'Connor went in for petty capers . Whenever the cupboard was bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cronies to a garage owned by her brother-in-law ( who also has a record ) , and they would go off to rob a drugstore or some small , out-of-the-way shop . Since last June , according to Chicago police , Maggie has probably had a hand in some 100 holdups , has been positively linked to 30 . Her working clothes usually included a babushka and , oftentimes , adhesive tape over the five moles.
