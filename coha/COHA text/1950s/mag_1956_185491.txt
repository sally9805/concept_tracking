Of all the pleasure domes built along Florida 's Gold Coast in the late 1920s , none was more ornate than the Boca Raton Hotel &; Club , 42 miles north of Miami . Put up by Utilitycoon Clarence H. Geist as the world 's flossiest private resort , it cost $10 million , had 450 rooms , indoor and outdoor swimming pools , two 18-hole golf courses , dozens of fountain-filled gardens and a beach-front cabana that is bigger than most hotels . During the Depression , Geist ran Boca Raton as his private hobby , happily paid its staggering deficits . But when he died in 1938 , the club fell on hard times . The Army Air Forces used it for a training center in World War II , and in postwar years it was owned and operated as a public hotel by Schine Hotels ; Boca Raton 's white-jacketed staff often outnumbered the paying guests . <P> Last week Boca Raton got a new lease on luxury . In the biggest deal in recent Florida history , Arthur Vining Davis , one of Alcoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schine for the hotel and 1,000 acres of land . Davis , who owns 1,336,824 shares ( 6.5% ) of Alcoa common stock and ranks among the world 's richest men ( one estimate : well over $350 million ) , plans to revamp the club into a resort for millionaires , cut up the land into estates . Said Davis : " While Florida will always offer ideal home sites for the middle income group , we must provide also for the group whose accomplishments enable them to enjoy the finest . " <P> Tomatoes &; Orchids . At 88 , Davis is still Alcoa board chairman , although he spends most of his time in Florida , where since 1948 , he has become one of the state 's biggest landowners . Gruff and publicity-shy , he keeps most of his deals a tight secret . Once when a reporter managed to get him on the phone , and ask what his aims were in Florida , Davis snapped : " Making money . What else ? Now go away and let me get on with it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami Herald 's Nixon Smiley , who came away goggle-eyed . " Arthur Vining Davis , " he wrote , " is a large body of money surrounded by Dade County . " <P> Estimates are that Davis already owns close to 75,000 acres or 12% of Dade County , has another 50,000 acres spread around the rest of the state . He has bought so much land so fast that land selling at $300 an acre six years ago now costs $2,000 or more . Davis has spent at least $2,000,000 on a tomato farm , millions more on four plant nurseries , including the world 's largest orchid and house plant producer . He operates the biggest ice cream plant in the Southeast , runs three dairies , owns a big slice of a freight airline ( Riddle ) . <P> Ships &; Sweat . Davis launches new businesses as easily as turning out an aluminum pan . Once he bought a 1,000-ton war-surplus Canadian minesweeper for a yacht , then decided to turn it into a banana boat . Result : Davis ' Three Bay Lines now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports . Everywhere around Miami , Davis draglines , Davis bulldozers , Davis dredges are filling in swampy land , cutting yacht canals to prepare the way for $35,000 to $100,000 homes .
