txt PARIS , Jan. ** intends to ask the United States to make an official declaration committing itself to a " forward strategy " in Europe . What is meant by a " forward strategy " " is a United States pledge to defend its European Allies ; if they are attacked , at the ' scene of aggression ; in , other words , to reaffirm all commitments that Europe would be protected against aggression . . and pot merely liberated after a destructive occupation . Allied , diplomats in London said the Western powers had agreed it would be unwise to go beyond the present treaties in giving the Soviet Union additional security guarantees . They listed the British-Soviet treaty of 1942 , the French-So , viet treaty of 1944 and the United Nations Charter as sufficient guarantees for the Soviet Union at present . The French desire a United States pledge when the longdelayed debate on ratification of the European Defense Community reaches the National Assembly in order to help gain votes approving that project . Premier Joseph Laniel hopes the debate will start soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic thinking is already implicit in many agreements accepted by Washington . When the European Defense Community Treaty was signed in Paris on May 27 , 1952 , the United State , Britain and France issued a joint statement that : " Expressed their resolve to station such forces on the Continent of Europe , including the Federal Republic of Germany , as they deem necessary and appropriate to contribute to the joint defense of the North Atlantic , Treaty area , having regard to their obligations under the North Atlantic treaty , their interest in the European Defense Community , and their special responsibilities in Germany . " What the French Government supporters of the European Defense Community now desire is a reaffirmation in the form of a new public declaration of United States intentions to maintain enough ground forces in Europe to defend this Continent in case of war . This reaffirmation is desired not only because the " new look " of American military strategy has led to fears that United States troops may be withdrawn from Europe but to remove the doubts of some Fionch Deputies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted , American contingents may be reduced as German contingents become operative . It is recognized by French officials from Premier Laniel down that the debate on ratification of the defense community can not be started until after the four-power meeting- in Berlin . However , it is not expected that there will be any East-West agreement removing the need for a European Defense Community . Therefore , steps are being taken to prepare for a ratification debate and to improve the project 's chances by gaining certain commitments from the United States and Britain . Consultive Means Sought Neither Washington nor London has made any long-term promise fixing the number of troops it will maintain on the Continent . Each year this contribution is fixed in the annual review approved by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council . Until next Jan. 1 , therefore , the United States is pledged to keep its approximately six divisions in Germany and Britain her four-plus divisions . The numbers set for each year depend upon the requests of Gen. Alfred M. Gruenthetr , Commander of Supreme Headquarters , Allied Powers in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like , in addition to a promise concerning a " forward strategy " some form of **27;1696;TOOLONG arrangement for consultation if any member wished at some date to reduca its continental troop strength . Finally the French are preparing t crystalize their requests ? first made rather vaguely at the Big Three Bermuda conference last month  --  to harmonize the duration terms of the proposed European Defense Community , scheduled to endure fift- , years , and NATO , a twenty-year pact . They would like to obtain a promise from all NATO members  --  but above all the United States ? never to avail themselves of the privilege each ally has to denounce the North Atlantic pact after its first twenty years . Preparations are now being made by diplomatic negotiation for a swift series of actions to press for ratification of the European Defense Community if and when the Berlin conference breaks up in failure . A draft protocol has been negotiated between France and the United Kingdom , pledging Britain 's close association with an E. D. C. The terms of cooperation between the E. D. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be attached to the Cornmissariat with advisory powers .
