Bushmen Hunting A Story by JACK COPE Drawings by Gil Miret T HE WIND had died down in the night and a red sunrise flared from below the dolcrite mountain jags away toward Bushman-land . The air seemed full of the finest particles of desert sand settling and sifting down after the dust storm . For nearly an hour , since before dawn , the camp had been astir and the three overloaded jeeps were packed and ready to move , but the team were arguing . Three colored. men , servants and drivers to the geologists , stood against one of the motor vehicles talking quietly , mostly in single syllables ; their heads and faces were wrapped in towels and only their eyes showed , placid , dark-brown , shaded by thick lashes . The team members had patches round . their eyes protected by sunglasses and the rest of their skin was scorched . Their lips were painfully cracked but they went on talking hoarsely and angrily . Two were South Africans and the third an American . The American kept his temper . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The others wanted to head back for O'Okiep but he was going on ; he would go on all the way , he said ; what the hell kind of expedition was it that left the job unfinished ? The other two , stung by his easy , deliberate way of putting it , turned savage weatherbeaten faces on him . Then they referred for support to a fourth man , small , thin , and wizened . From the shapeless roof of his hat to the soft , handmade velschoens he was the human counterpart of the desert . The blinding sun , the winds witha rasp-edge of sand , the frosts in the dry , cracking winter nights when the scene was like the lace of the moon  --  these had turned him into something that had a touch of awe and wonder and pity . Nationality or race or color were nonexistent in his appearance ; they had been overlaid by a harder reality . Time had battered against him so mercilessly that it had left a face ageless as his surroundings and there was no telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own daughter did not know but she thought him nearer to a hundred . Anxiously she watched him dealing with the strangers . She saw him lower his head and contemplate the ground and then turn slowly toward the American . " No good , " he said . " I will go with you , Mr. Sebright , but you waste petrol . Nothing is new there  --  all the same over again . " " Well , anyway , let 's start , Waterboer . " Her father 's name was Klaas Waterboer and knowing Bushinanland and the Namaqua highlands as well as he knew his own fingers he had come to act as guide for the expedition . He was a trekker and the territory he roamed was about ten . thousand square miles which gave a man a living , if he knew his way around , and yet waited subtly to destroy him . He had left his camp and trek-wagons and little bunches of hardy desert sheep and karakuls in the trekveld far south and come np with the geologists . He showed them spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaled the great mesas and looked down from the table-tops at the dun-colored jeeps and tents and the three-cornered signal-sheet set out to guide the light De Havilland plane that flew from O'Okiep every second day to drop supplies . Giant valleys were carved in the mesa , range behind range in the glittering mirage , sometimes looking blue like ice or green with forest and the shimmer of waterfalls . But there were no trees , no water , hardly a blade of living grass or a leaf on the stunted Karroo-bush . The valleys flowed with sand ; here a flat bed lay between deep furnace walls of rock , but in other gorges the sand of millions of years dashed and heaved its tide up until it flowed over the shoulder of the mountains . From the midst of the sand-seas black rocks rose like islands T HE GEOLOGISTS studied rocks pointed out by Waterboer , often with a shrug of impatience . But they had found crystals of pinkish scheelite indicating tungsten beds , gray stibnite antimony , and promising outcrops of copper and cobalt deposits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , and kept the tent tidy . Most of the time they were not traveling she sat inside the tent opening and gazed between the slits of her eyelids at the brilliant desert . In the daylight she kept her face covered with cotton stuff , forehead and nose and cheeks , so that her dark eves alone were visible down the shady tunnel of her kappie . She usually had her kappics lined with green and kept the hoods neat and stiff with starch . Home-made mittens covered her hands and she had long dresses almost to the ground and black cotton stockings tucked into flat-heeled oeischoens . She was the last of the trekker 's daughters . Sara Waterboer became aware , without actually owning it or putting it into a precise form , that her father for some days had been heading off the prospectors . He did not want them to go any further , he did not want them to find anything valuable here . Above all , he did not want to see a mine spring up where nothing had ever been except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert , once a year or once in two years if it rained , and the men following them . As long as the mines kept out , Maas Waterboer remained free in a country as large as a state . Few would ever want to come here . The Bushmen had gone ; the Hottentots had gone : and the trekkers were receding back into the villages and settled areas . That morning , hearing the three men argue and snap heatedly , Waterboer felt he had almost succeeded . The sandstorm of the day before had done it and now they were on the point of turning back . One of the South African geologists was speaking , frequently pausing to cough and clear his throat . " A/I right , Sebright , go ahead , but we take no responsibility , none whatsoever , that 's un-derstood . ' " It 's on my head . " The American sounded cheerful and even smiled . " We 've seen a lot of this country and Waterboer knows every stone in it . He says it 's no go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming with me . You head back with the samples and be out another few days at the most . " " Why , damn it , why ? " " A sort of hunch . Anything I find will go in on our joint report . You 've got nothing to ? " he began saying " bellyache " but checked himself and said " ? to complain about . " " So you 're going to find something rich off your own bat and be big about it ? As likely as hell . We are all beaten this round and you know what we are up against  --  the pay limit . Ore reserves for a dozen mines but none rich enough by itself to carry out a railway line or power or a water-pipe . And without them the ore could be at the bottom of the ocean . What in God 's name are you going to find out there  --  blister copper , gold bars ? " " Maybe , " Sebright said . " Uranium ? " the other man croaked . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him to it .. . En jy , Waterboer , " he said in Afrikaans , " jy 's gek ! " ( You 're crazy . ) Waterboer 's tiny creased-up eyes darted for a moment and he stared again at the sand and crystalline pebbles at his feet . Al three colored men were on the two jeeps as the engines were started . " Are you going back too , Martens ? " Sebright said to his driver . " Jo my boas . " He did not raise his eyes . A winch could not have dragged him from his place . " Well .... And you , Sara , are you going too ? " She shook her head . " Sara stays along with me , " Waterboer said . T H E Y watched the two returning jeeps pick their way slowly round the foot of the sand-drifts , coming out on old level beds lying like a mist between sides of the great rift . Trailed by little puffs of white , the jeeps looked as they receded in the distance like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain lake . Then the drone of the engines faded and nothing more could be seen . The desert was silent and dead . Shadows of the mountains streaked back across the sand levels and the sun came into full possession . A blue-headed koggeimander lizard wriggled out on a rock near the camp and blinked at Sara . Sebright drove and Waterboer sat at his side giving indications with a turn of his wrist . Seldom a word passed between them . The old man might say " Slow " or " Higher up , " but the American had almost an instinct for the desert and he sensed just when to rush a sand-drift or when to back out of danger and try another track . By midday they had reached a place where the rock walls closed in and the valley floor was not half a mile wide . It was hot , but Sara took no notice of the sweat running down her back . She sat hunched up in the back seat and stared . A half profile of the driver 's face took in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , and an outline of his stubbly jaw and chin . It was a strong , set jaw and the neck was smooth , young , and muscular though burned bright red . " 0 my arme hart ! " she said to herself simply but with a fervent and tragic feeling. ? Oh my poor heart ! She was fifteen , or not quite fifteen . In the evenings when the sun had gone and if the wind was not blowing she would untie the strings of her kappie and take the cloths from her face ; she combed. out the black curly hair over her shoulders and unbuttoned her blouse from the throat down to the swell of her bosom . Then people could see she was young and had a smooth skin free from wrinkles , not quite white , creamy rather , but so smooth and so young . She also had pure white teeth and a straight nose and pink lips but there was no color in her cheeks . The color would go out of her lips and the wrinkles creep round her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time she was twenty she would look middle-aged , and in another five years shewould be ageless and aged . The desert might not change her much after that because she belonged to it . Once you belonged to the desert you stopped counting time and a strange compassion grew in your heart . The old trekkers wanted nothing but the endless slow drift of the donkey-wagons ; sheep bleating ; the camp shelters made of frames and grass matting as the nomads and hunters had made them for maybe millions of years . But the young people revolted . Like the lights of a copper-mine twinkling over the sand-drifts and rocks , the new life beckoned them . Unless they escaped young they would never escape . Sara knew it . She loved and dreaded Bushmanland and the Namaqua mountains as she loved and feared her father . Watching the stranger so intently , she was sure he must know her eyes were fixed on him and how her heartbeats made her dizzy and light-headed . He was twice her age ; he might be married and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when he was fifty he would have open , soft eyes and a sleek face ; cropped hair , perhaps gray , and a fat smooth neck . She had once seen an American tourist like that on the road to O'Okiep when the desert was flowering after rain and the sand-beds flowed away to the horizon under a flood of gold and white and red . S EBRIGHT stopped the motor and got down . He unloaded an instrument case and soon he was stepping out in a tine toward the rock outcrops . He carried a small box wired to earphones and the clumsy way he walked , glancing often at the dials on the box , showed his intense concentration . " Get out some food , girl , " Waterboer said . For a minute he busied himself and then he burst out . " The devil ! What are we coming to ? See that thing again now  --  who in the name of the Lord looks for copper with a  --  a telephone ? Ca n't he see with his eyes ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes snapped in the folded creases . " Mines ? verdom ! Nobody ever came this far before , not even to look . They left us alone . Now if a mine conies here where will it stop ? It will break open the heart of the desert . . . finished , the old good life finished . " " They have n't found a mine , Papa . Mr. Sebright has n't seen what he 's looking for , and that 's why he is still searching . " " Still searching , fooi ! Has n't he gone too far as it is ? " " Why then , Papa , did you come with them ? " " Never mind . " He was shading his eyes , watching the American . His lips again framed the words silently . W H E N Sebright came back to eat they both noticed a change in him . He said nothing unusual and made familiar remarks they had heard before from him in the camp . They had a sense of hidden things as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The geologist could keep his thoughts to himself but he did not deceive them . Sara glanced from one to the other and felt disturbed . " Have you been up here often ? " Sebright asked . Waterboer nodded . The last time he had come up was only a month ago with a party of trekkers and some Hottentots to clear out a sand trap . It was an old , infallible trap in the narrowest neck of the poort where the rock walls came close . Men had used it far back before memory . The wind scoured and scratched up the valley at that point and kept the sand clear . The upper side of the trap was a rock lip , perhaps of a prehistoric waterfall . You dug out the drift below it and the new sand sifting in made a treacherous glide into the deep end . Hide the rock lip with bunches of brittle Karroo-bush and the trap was set . After rains turned the desert overnight into a blossoming garden , springbok wandered up from the Bushmanland plains and they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to leap free . Most got away , but a lot were always caught . Sara had seen the stampede and once camped a few days with the hunters while they cut the meat in strips , salted it , and dried it in the sun to make biltong . " Can we get through the pass ? " Sebright asked . Again Waterhoer nodded . The wind was rising and they watched a small , dry bush roll past ona sudden gust . The geologist did not like it but he said , " Let 's go on . " Every half-mile , about , they stopped and Sebright put on the earphones and took his machine for a walk . He seemed to be utterly indifferent to fatigue , to the rising gale and the darkening of the sky . At the wheel , he drove the jeep as if he himself were a machine . And on his walks he stamped his boots with a heavy but tireless stride ; sometimes he stumbled but was too agile to fall . " Now we go back , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a test walk and was stowing the machine . " I 'm going through the pass , Waterboer . " " No ! " Sebright raised his face and looked straight at Waterboer for a time and all one could see was a faint twitch at the corners of his lips . But Sara felt his eyes would not be smiling . He was seeing something for the first time in her father , something she had watched growing up to bursting point for days . " Well now , " Sebright began a shade uncertainly , " we can get through that pass  --  you said so . " Waterboer stared back and his whole gnarled figure and withered face said NO . " Come along now , Mr. Waterboer , get in . The wind 's getting up and I admit it may be dangerous  --  but we wo n't waste any time . " Waterboer opened the rear door and Sara climbed out . She stood with her back to the wind and her skirts rustled round her legs . " We will definitely be back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass is all I want to see . " " No then , by yourself , " Waterboer said . " So ? " " Mr. Sebright , you will find nothing there : all rock , bare , no breaks . i know . Nothing , absoloot nothing ! " " That 's just what I would expect . Just ex-actly . " He started the engine and waited as if they might change their minds . " Okay , an hour  --  not more than an hour , and I 'll be back , " he shouted . Waterboer had begun moving up toward the rock shelters scooped by sand erosion or faulting in the base of the cliff face . Sara knew the shelters too from the time they had camped there . Down below them Sebright was nosing the truck forward . He missed the wagon track and took the path along the lower bed of hard-packed sands covered with ripples of the ever-moving drift . He was going the way the buck went . Sara had paused , but Waterboer went on at his light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash-gray tufts of Karroo bush . He did not look back and it was uncanny the way he went on as if nothing were happening beyond the sad moan of the wind and the infinitely slow movement of the desert , slower than time . Sebright came to the sudden fall of the slope and was over before he could stop . There was a clash and roar of the engine going into reverse with all four wheels against the moving sand . The jeep slewed half round and lurched on one front wheel , slowly rolling toward the bottom . Sebright tried to jump clear , and then the dust covered everything and there was a crash , but not a heavy one  --  like a metal tray being dropped . At the same moment Sara shrieked . She wanted to run for the trapped jeep , but she stood clutching her mittened hands together , breathless , incapable of movement , while the wind tugged at her kappie and cleared away the dust from the pit . Waterboer passed her , moving quickly though not at a run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him run . " Mir ? Gek ! " he was muttering , almost spitting out the words . ' They found Sebright pinned by one leg under the mudguard . His glasses had come off and he lay back in the sand , half buried . He was pale as death . They dug him free and the lower part of his leg came out at a queer angle . Sebright did not say much ; he kept looking at Waterboer in a venomous way and his lips were compressed . Sara thought of a wounded leopard with its bitter , panting bravery and she felt he would shoot her father if he could get his hand on a gun . The old man deserved it . He had sent the American deliberately into the buck trap . They pulled Sebright by a rope up the slope of moving sand and the jeep fay lurched at the bottom on its side leaking petrol gradually from the rear tank . B Y T H E time they had got the wounded man into the deepest of the rock shelters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a fire and brought up food and a water can from the jeep . Sara prepared the meal . She had her black wavy hair spread wide across her shoulders and her collar open and the firelight shone on her pale forehead and glistening eyes . Outside , the wind madeintermittent noises , hisses and a deep bellowing note , and sharp-scented smoke revolved in the big rock hollow . Sara tried not to stare at the injured man . She had helped him prop up his shoulders and he lay there , blinking at long intervals and his thoughts seemed turned in on himself . He hardly saw her . The firelight ironed out the blemishes of the  --  sun and desert on his face and he appeared young but stern and remote like her own visions of an angel . ro " I guess you beat me , " he said at last and tried to smile . Sara 's eyes filled and she stooped busily over the cooking pot . Pouring him a tin mug of coffee , her hands trembled and the spilled drops hissed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started to groan . But he must have been asleep or unconscious because he made no sound when he lay awake . His breath then came steady but hard , only caught up if he tried to move . Sara did not sleep at all : she heard her father go dut before dawn . In the early light she looked out and saw the jeep had been almost covered by the sand-drift . The sky was a calm violet and above the mountains were paling shades of red . Her father was sitting on a rock and beckoned to her . " What has that man found with his machine ? " " Papa , I . " " No , you do n't know . I went up beyond the poort ; it 's as I said , bare , unbroken , there 's no copper , none of the things the prospectors look for . Find out from him . " " How can I , Papa , if he does not wish to tell ? " The old man pondered . She noticed under him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her eye and looked past her into the distance . " Tell him there will never be a mine here . Do you hear ? Tell him that . There will never be a mine , no kind of mine . The others do n't want a mine here . Yes , they went back yesterday because they knew it was useless . He will not have a mine either . " It was not so easy for her to tell Sebright . Her English was meager and all the time she wanted to cry . She hated her father and she had never known such hatred before in her heart . He was not a father but a hard , merciless thing , a stone like all the other stones in the desert . Sehright helped her get out what her father had told her , and then he said , " Cut off the leg from my trousers . " She did it carefully and was shocked at the big swelling below the knee spreading up the whole leg . The skin was not broken but was bluish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't tell if there 'll be a mine or not . You see , have to come back here to prove the find . " That was all he would say . She was busy in the shelter stacking brushwood and twisted little stumps of Karroo-bush for the night 's fire . He seemed slightly easier after she had put a folded blanket under his leg and cooled it with a damp cloth . The air blew in with the heat of an open oven . " Who did these paintings on the rock ? " he asked . She glanced round at the hundreds of small , lively figures painted on every clear face of stone ? men with bows running in full career , gemsbok and springbok , ostriches , dotted spoors , a pit-trap ( perhaps the same pit-trap below them in the poort ) . " They were done long ago , " she said . " Do n't you know who painted them ? " " No  --  who knows ? " " Nobody talks about them , I guess ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She straightened her back and stood , thinking . She wanted to say more , to tell him there were no Bushmen /eft and no one cared , so cruel was the desert . She called it the wildernts . But she found it hard to frame the words and then it dawned on her that he was talking merely to tryand forget his pain  --  he with his pain , and she with her fear of the wildernis . " Bushmen hunting , " he said in a soft voice sounding calm . and pleasant . " The cave 's a treasure-house , priceless . I guess I 'm the first stranger to have seen it . " It gave her a pang to hear him , his voice so homely . He was already thinking of himself hack in his own land surrounded by his family and by his friends . To him , she was not a stranger in the cave but one with the desert , the loneliness , the trekkers , and even the Bushmen . " Bushmen hunting , " he repeated . T H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar and friendly . He heard even before she did and his head rose and he began lifting himself on his elbows . " The De Havillandl " he said , and his eyes gleamed moist and wild with relief . She went to the mouth of the shelter and looked up into the glaring , shimmering sky . The little silver airplane was coming up the contour of the sand-bedded valley . Her father would have the white air-signal stretched out , reversed , with a red ring upwards for a distress sign . The plane was coming nearer : any minute it must begin to circle . She looked up and down for her father , still a little dazzled and screwing up her dark eyes against the glare . She felt suddenly faint when she saw him . He was sitting on the air-signal in its canvas bag . The plane went past with a gentle purr and in a minute she saw the speck disappear in the dancing blue-white of the sky . She rushed to his side and grabbed his arm . " Papal " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa , what are you doing ? You ca n't stop him coming back . He has to come , it 's his job . He has to prove his find . " " What has he found ? " " 1 do n't know Papa . It makes no difference . He is in pain , agony . He may die . " " It is easy , Sara . Let him say he will not come back , like the others . Let him say it 's useless to come back . " She went and stood in the entrance of the shelter and leaned one hand against the rock for support . Sebright was half raised and slowly his drawn , Fevered face emerged to her eyes out of the gloom . " They have gone . They did n't find us , " she said . " But the airplane sounded less than five hundred feet up , much less , it sounded just outside . " " Mr. Sebright , you must not think of coming here again . Papa will bring help but you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put out the signal ? " She said " Ja " in a whisper . He sank back and closed his eyes , and his lips trembled . It seemed to be a terrible , almost killing blow and to have snuffed out his hope . Sara sat at his side , hugging her knees . Later they heard the engine of the De Havilland returning but it was far away below the rim of the valley . Again and again that day she thought she heard the engine and he must have heard something too because he opened his eyes and glowered at her . Each time she went to the entrance to listen . There was nothing . The sun sank and the shadows climbed up the mountain face . The light turned red and suddenly the dolerite pinnacles were dark against the sky . Waterboer brought food and another water can from the covered jeep . He ate his meal outside and waited where Sebright could not see him . Sara went on her knees to him . " Oh Papa , would you have his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . " He looked at her like an old lizard with two needles of light in his eyes . " He will not speak , Papa . He can not . He will die first . " The old man chewed in silence and then got up and moved away noiselessly into the gathering dusk . Sebright could not eat anything . He kept calling for water and sipped a little and lay back . Sara had the fire burning just high enough to throw up a few flickering tongues of flame . She sat close to him , touching him sometimes as if that absolved her in an unspoken way from the terrible crime of her father . Sebright 's pain seemed to have got past torturing him but he muttered and rocked his shoulders and she thought he was getting delirious . When she went to build up the fire he noticed and called out to her . After that he would not let her leave him . She sat with his head on her lap and stroked his forehead ; his eyes went round the faintly lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are lovely , " he said . Her heart contracted with a flutter of pain and tears welled in her eyes . Only now did he say such a beautiful thing . In a minute he wasflooding out a stream of incomprehensible words . He raised his voice and shouted hoarsely ; he yelled and swore against her father until she trembled indignantly at what she heard . He was raving , but she understood the fierceness of spirit and the long agony that gave birth to his words . She moved away and he was soon groping for her and staring gloomily around the cave after her . H E SIPPED water she held up to his lips and was calm now . He talked softly ; it was about his own land . She could not understand it all but he seemed to think he was there and a tenderness came into his voice like a song . She cried and sobbed unashamedly . He said , " Do n't cry , my darling . " But it was as if he were trying to comfort somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die , " she sobbed . " You must let my father go for help . He too , he do n't want you to die . Why do you want to come back here , so far , so far ? " " Why ? ? It 's just like that . " " Have you found something so very rich ? " " Uhu . " " No then , it 's a shame to come all this way and break open the heart of the wildernis . Way over there the mountain is full of copper . " " Copper ! " " And down by the sea at Orange River Mouth you can pick up diamonds in your hand . " " Sure , you can . " " Here nobody else will come , never . You can see , no trench was ever dug here , no hole for a wind pump . Nobody ever come so far but the hunting folk and us trekkers . " " You 're right , Sara , I 'm first . " " Let it stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's to stop me coming back in any case ? " " Make a vow . " He lay back against her , breathing quickly through his nose . When he had spoken about his own laud she had seen the horizon open and the distance beckon to her , a distance of green hills and trees and waterfalls playing . This man could help her escape while she was still young and attractive . Both were menaced by Waterboer , her father , both of them could end their thirst and suffering and unhappiness in the land whose memory made him gentle with longing . Now he was asleep . He slept deeply and did not stir . When he woke at last he stared round and seemed alarmed by the darkness until he caught the glow of the fire . He groped about and took her wrist in his dry , burning hand . He licked his lips and she raised the water mug but the water spilled down his chest . Peering into his face , she saw he did not know what he was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's to stop me coining back  --  a vow , " he half whispered and lay panting . " The assassins . . . I 'm sure to come , this side of hell . Let it go , let them blast the world to dust , and see me come back here ; the wildernis , the Bushmen hunting you . . . " He went on repeating himself again and again and sometimes his voice was pitched in a husky shout . Every word pierced her and she rocked her body over him , unable even to moan . The terrible injustice of it , against her , the wrong that her mind shrank from . " Sara  --  where 's Sara ? " She tried to loosen her wrist from his painful grip . " Where 's Sara ? Ah . Sara , I want to say good-by . I 'm not coming back , not this side of . . . " " Is that your vow ? " she forced herself to say . " I 'm going back now . Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay either Sara  --  they 'll murder you . . . your wildernis and Waterboer . . " At last he fell silent and his eyes closed . The fire burned brighter and she saw her , father piling up sticks on it . He had been there all the time , merged dimly into the wall like a stone . " I am going now , " he said . The rescue party in a single jeep reached them in the heat of the next day . Waterboer was sitting in the front seat beside the colored driver , indicating the track by a silent flick of his wrist . They carried Sebright down and he stared at Sara , his pupils drawn small with suffering . His mouth opened , maybe to say good-by , or to say something affectionate and grateful to her . She drew a deep breath and waited . No , he had n't really seen her . They took out one front seat and laid the injured man at full length . Near his head was sitting one of the South African geologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for poor old Sebright . " The man looked paler under the sun-scorch and his face was headed with sweat . " God , he looks far gone . Picking us up Like that was your best day 's work , Waterboer . There 's still time ; we 'll have him flown to Cape Town by tonight . ' Sara was bareheaded and did not care about the heat . She rearranged the wet rag on Sebright 's forehead . " He 'll be looked after , Sara . Thank you for helping . We 'll send a relief for you , Waterboer . " As the engine revved up he shouted " Tot siensyou 'll be all right ? " Waterboer nodded . They watched the vehicle skim down the level river of sand that filled the great valley . The air-signal , in reverse , with a red ring indicating distress , was lying stretched out on a flat space . Her father went to it and began folding it up . Sara wiped her eyes . In twelve hours Mr. Sebright would be safe in Cape Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be . It was all closing round her again ? the heat and barrenness , the withering glare , the wildernis .
