The carpet industry , said James D. Wise , president of Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Co. , Inc. , last week , " has been shackled to a sheep for too long . " And the sheep has given the industry a rough ride ; in six months carpet wool prices jumped from 85 a lb. to as high as $2.30 . In an attempt to keep up with soaring raw-wool prices , U.S. manufacturers priced their carpets right out of the market . As sales dropped and inventories piled up , three big price cuts in carpets failed to pull the industry out of its worst slump in years ; production was headed for a 20% fall . Last week Bigelow-Sanford , biggest U.S. carpetmaker , took a major step to free itself from wool . <P> In its spring line , more than 75% of Bigelow 's carpets will use synthetics ( carpet rayon ) , compared to only 27% a year ago . Other carpet companies , e.g. , James Lees &; Sons , are doing the same . To many a carpetmaker , the switch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the carpet power loom more than 100 years ago . <P> This year consumption of carpet rayon will top 30 million lbs . v. 12.5 million in 1950 . The synthetics , say carpetmakers , wear as well as wool , are easier to dye , and stay clean as long . They hope that the shift to synthetics will stabilize prices and put the harassed carpet industry back on its feet .
