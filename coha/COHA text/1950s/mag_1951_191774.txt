Premi , 20-year-old daughter of Jairamdas Doulatram , governor of Assam province , was lazily floating in a boat on Ward lake at Shillong , hill-station capital of Assam , feeding fish from her slight , delicate hand . As she dabbled her fingers in the water , a diamond ring , a family heirloom , slipped from her finger , went twinkling down through the clear blue water . <P> Governor Doulatram , 59-year-old former journalist and orator , was a notable bungler as India 's food minister in 1948-49 , but in Assam he is , after all , the governor . Divers were sent down to recover Premi 's ring , and when they failed , the governor ordered the L-shaped , quarter-mile-long lake to be drained . Assam has one of the highest rainfalls in the world , and everybody knew that Ward lake would soon fill up again . Thousands of Assamese came to see the act . As the water went down &; down they began to feel a grave concern , as Hindus should , for the welfare of the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to kill millions of fish merely to recover a piece of jewelry ? Was it not possible that a fish may have swallowed the ring ? Would it not be simpler and kinder to catch the fish , subject them to an X-ray examination , and then free them ? These scruples spread to Assam 's legislative assembly . Assembly members plied the Chief Minister with questions . Said one : " There will be repercussions on a huge number of fishes in the lake . " The minister promised to prepare a formal answer . The press was mildly indignant . " A modern governor 's household is expected to be less imperious than that of a medieval potentate , " said Calcutta 's Hindustan Standard . The episode , said the newspaper , reminded one of " the lover who promised the whole of Samarkand and Bokhara for a mole on the cheek of his beloved . " <P> At week 's end the emptying of Ward lake had become a political issue for Governor Doulatram , but Premi 's ring had not been found .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
