INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES , <P> AS every airman knows , there are too many airlines . To every nation , big or little , a " flag carrier " is a matter of national prestige . Since landing rights are awarded on a reciprocal basis , even the smallest nation can get into the business merely by awarding landing rights to other countries . At last count , no fewer than 200 so-called international airlines were in the air-when possibly half that number could do the job . <P> In some cases , small nations have a real need for an international line , or fly so efficiently that they can compete on even terms with bigger nations . The Netherlands ' 38-year-old K.L.M. and Belgium 's Sabena , both with far-flung routes and big , modern fleets , rank among the world 's finest airlines , earn valuable foreign exchange and promote much tourism for their mother nations . Flying to the U.S. and South America , Japan Air Lines serves a booming nation of 90 million people , not only generates most of its own international traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without subsidy . Australia 's globe-circling Qantas gets heavy traffic from an area in the midst of rapid economic development , performs a real economic service as a lifeline to the rest of the wold . <P> But many other small nations are as out of place in international skies as pigeons among peregrines . More often than not they can not operate except by turning themselves into cut-rate , fly-by-night carriers along the lines of the first postwar U.S. nonsked airlines . Usually , they do not pose a competitive threat to well-established lines , but in Latin America they have made flying a cutthroat business ( TIME , May 5 ) . <P> The small lines around the world also pose serious questions of efficiency . While many of the lines were set up-and fly-with the help of established carriers , most nations insist , for nationalistic reasons , on filling at least 50% of all air-crew jobs with their own men . Many of the native flyers do not yet have the training for the job . One U.S. captain for Saudi Arabian Airlines reports that his invariable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " Indonesia 's ambitious ( 39 planes ) Garuda airline is in serious trouble since it fired all Dutch pilots and technicians ; also facing trouble is Union of Burma Airways , with few experts-and with three Viscount turboprops on order . <P> Overambition spells heavy losses for many a small airline that once did well . For years , Thai Airways flew two DC-48 along a neat little system spreading out from Bangkok to Tokyo and Calcutta ; then after crashes in 1953 , the line tried to break into the big time by ordering three big Lockheed Super-G Constellations . In service last year , the planes promptly started losing $350,000 a month for Thai . Now the planes are grounded because the airline does not have enough money to operate them . Philippine Air Lines almost came a cropper by pushing too hard on international flights to the U.S. , Japan and Europe , lost so heavily that the late Philippine President Magsaysay finally called a halt .                   @ @
