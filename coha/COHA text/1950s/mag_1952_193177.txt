I LED THREE LIVES ( 323 pp. ) - Herbert Phil brick-McGraw-Hill ( $3.50 ) . <P> The Communists never really had a chance against Herb Philbrick . They tried to make a fool of a man who was not only a born salesman but an active and dedicated Baptist too , and they paid a high price for the blunder . Three years ago , at the trial of the eleven top U.S. Reds , Philbrick took the stand as a surprise Government witness . His testimony , compiled during nine years as an FBI counterspy , helped to show the workings of the U.S. Communist Party . <P> Counterspy Philbrick tells the story of those nine years in I Led Three Lives . It is the story of a sane man who subjected himself to " a manufactured schizophrenia , " who postponed indefinitely his own life , liberty , and pursuit of happiness , to get to the bottom of the great Communist conspiracy in the U.S. <P> First Assignments . Philbrick 's nine-year adventure began innocently , even comically , on a fine spring day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he was following his nose around Boston , sniffing for new business . At a door marked " Massachusetts Youth Council " he dropped in to run off his spiel . The comrade-in-charge , a pleasant-faced young woman , must have been amused at the spectacle of a man trying to sell direct-mail advertising to a front organization of the Communist Party . <P> Instead , she sold Philbrick on the need for a Youth Council in his neighborhood . She played up to his obvious interest in young people 's organizations , to his starry-eyed belief that such groups could help keep the U.S. out of war , reduce unemployment and build " character , confidence and stability . " With the help of some new-found friends and members of the Massachusetts Youth Council , Philbrick set up a Cambridge branch and was elected chairman-and then began to have the uneasy sensation of a man who is having the rug pulled slowly from under his feet . Gradually it came to him that the friends , who were quietly taking over the organization , were Communists . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was told to go along with the friends , if he felt able to , and to see what would happen . Slowly , point by point , Philbrick let himself be argued over to the Communist way . In 1942 he was invited to join the Young Communist League . After two more years of grubbing at preparatory assignments - circulating petitions , raising funds for front organizations , attending interminable discussion groups-he was invited to join the Communist Party itself . <P> The decision was a hard one . For four years , Philbrick had given at least three nights a week to Communist work . In addition , he was carrying a full-time public-relations job with Paramount Pictures . On top of that , by his own inclination ( and with party approval ) he was busy in neighborhood church work . And finally , late at night , after everything else was attended to , Philbrick had his reports to write for the FBI . There was not much time for home life with his wife and three children .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
