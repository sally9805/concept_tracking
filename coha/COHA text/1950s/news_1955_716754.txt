txt 0 . Continued technical cooperation with underdeveloped countries , both through the United Nations and bilaterally , for which he will ask funds in Its budget message ; 1 . Encouragement of international travel by increasing the Present duty-free allowances for tourists from $500 to $1,000 within any six-month period ; 2 . Fuller . American participation in world trade fairs and funds with which to present the American economic picture abroad . In two other fields , the President pressed for continued progress as an aid to healthier international trade , without making specific recommendations to Congress : He urged continued effort to achieve currency convertibility . He emphasized the great stake American farmers had in an expanding trade program , with a fourth to a third of some major crops being exported . Approval Forecast In many ways this presidential message was a rewrite of his March , 1954 , special message on the subject . The important difference is not in the contents of these two messages , but the contrast in expected reception of this and last year 's efforts . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate . This year it is expected to be approved largely as the President has asked . One difference is that the Democrats , who look on much of this program as their program , are in control of Congress . The other is that a year 's study has clarified . and spotlighted the necessity'Of some long-range economic program to help strengthen and unite the free world . The general consensus here is that the President will get most of his trade-program requests , thanks to Democratic support ; that this part of his program presented to Congress in the State of the Union Message and spelled out in this special message has greater prospect of approval than any other . Nine-Point Plan The President 's message is a nine-section tract on the facts of world economics ? with an introduction and a conclusion . He explains that " enlightened self-interest " and America 's role as " leader among the free nations " require such a foreign economic program . He repeats the postwar theme of all foreign aid and trade pro ' grams  --  that the security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the security of each nation , however , depends on its economic strength and that of the whole free world . To any reluctant congressmen he advances the choice of freeing trade or continuing grants in aid to Washington 's allies . Knowing that a certain ele : : ment in his party is suspicious of any further tariff reductions , the President presses the point that anything done must be " moderate , " " gradual , " and " reciprocal . " Triple Formula His request for a three-year extension of . , the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act calls for three things : Authority to reduce tariff rates on selected commodities by not more than 5 per cent a year for three years : Right to reduce tariff rates in excess of 50 per cent to that level over a three-year period ; Permission to reduce over a three-year period by not more than one-half tariff rates in effect Jan. 1 , 1945 , on articles not now being imported or imported only in negligible quantities . An extension of the trade act would not touch in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Geneva to revise the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade through which the United States and 33 other trading countries have been working to develop a sound system of world trade . One trouble is that whatever should come out of these talks may be so watered down in search for the lowest common denominator that much of its value will be dissipated . Soviet Role Stressed The President in proposing more active American participation in world trade fairs emphasized the use Moscow was making of these gatherings to-impress the rest of the world with its economic progress and its claim that the U.S.S.R. actually is a workers ' paradise . As a result , the President has authorized American participation in 11 fairs up to the end of June this year , and another 16 later in the year if Congress will provide funds , This special message promises to be the least controversial of the seven or eight the President is sending to Congress . Already a bill drafted by the administration and introduced under Democratic sponsorship has been designated H.
