RECREATION Gnus Nix Zax &shy; Tut In the dusk of many summer evenings , for the quiet time when television cloys and the children scuttle in chase of the Good Humor man , an ever-growing slice of the U.S. public has found a new diversion . Its name : Scrabble . Its components : a board with 225 squares , 100 small wooden counters bearing letters of the alphabet , two to four players , ability to spell ( or a handy dictionary ) and a few ounces of competitive spirit . <P> The emergence of Scrabble has been volcanic and unexplained . The game began to grow into a national institution last year , when shipments shot from 1,436 sets in the first quarter to 37,000 during the last . Devotees quickly carried their word-of-mouth advertising through the U.S. , from the first coteries in New York and the North Side of Chicago . Scrabble clubs have convened all over the country , and potential buyers of sets ( cost : $3 apiece ) solemnly put their names on long waiting lists .

It is a game , its defenders say , that combines the cerebrations of anagrams and crosswords with the competitive joys of such older indoor sports as Monopoly and Parcheesi . A player gets seven counters in the draw , each with a letter and a number . The numbers relate to the letters ' frequency of use . The five vowels count only one point each , while " Z " counts ten . A player moves by spelling out a word on the board , and his score is the numerical value of the counters plus the value of any premium squares on the board , e.g. , hitting a blue square can double or triple the value of the letter used . <P> The next player must build another word on the original , but only in such a way that every combinaton of adjoining letters which he makes forms some word .

Scrabble was invented in 1933 by a New York architect named Alfred M. Butts , a man who has never enjoyed the game as fully as others because he is an indifferent speller . Butts and his wife played the game through the ' 30s and ' 40s , and made some 500 sets for their friends and the odd purchaser , but they never put it on the market . In 1948 a social worker named James Brunot took it over and invented the name " Scrabble " ( dictionary meaning : " to scrape , paw or scratch with the hands or feet " ) . He and his wife started making the games themselves in a small workshop at Newtown , Conn .
