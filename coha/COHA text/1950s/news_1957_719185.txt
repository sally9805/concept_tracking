txt ? Gov . Orval E. Faubus stood firm today against President Eisenhower . He said he would proceed in his own fashion to enforce court orders on school integration once Federal troops were removed .. He said that under no circumstances would he order National Guardsmen to enter Central High School and patrol the corridors to protect the nine Negro students that recently enrolled there . Today those corridors were scenes of minor disturbances as a group of white students chased and mauled two Negro students and jostled and insulted the others . Parents of the Negro students , worried by radio reports of violence , were thinking of keeping their children home tomorrow . This would support Governor Faubus ' contention that law and order could be maintained only if the Negroes stayed out of Central High . Apparently Mrs. L. C. Bates , chairman of the Arkansas Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , was able late today to dissuade the parents from withdrawing their children .
