 | Our Cruel Problem wtih Old Folks at Home The dilemma : Today 's housing and today 's living just are n't designed for the three-generation household . Yet no one wants aging parents to become a Legion of the Unwanted . What can be done ? In hundreds of thousands of American homes today , husbands and wives are struggling to find ways to help aged parents achieve happiness during the years that remain ? without sacrificing their own families ' happiness . The questions they must ask themselves are cruel : ? " We do n't have room for Dad , but where can he go ? " ? " It 's up to me to help support the folks , but does that mean college is out for our kids ? " ? " Even though Mother needs nursing care , how can I put her away in an insti-tution ? " For many , the dilemma seems beyond solution . No matter what decision they may make , they are likely to be haunted by doubts and persistent feelings of guilt . Each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-fifth birthday and are arbitrarily assigned to the ranks of the nation 's eldest generation , which now numbers almost fifteen million . Accordingly , ever greater numbers of adult children find themselves involved to some degree with the well-being of their retired parents . The fundamental needs of these senior citizens , five million of whom are seventyfive or older , have been summed up as " something to do , someplace to live , and someone to care . " Such goals would seem within reasonable reach . Yet a substantial proportion of the nation 's elders might agree with a seventy-year-old retired engineer , who said ironically , " The truth is that I have nothing worthwhile to do , and I have no decent place to live , and I know of no one who really cares . " Aging parents , sensitive to the feeling of being rejected , tend to place the major responsibility on their offspring . " If you have to wait for your own children to give you pleasure , " remarked an elderly woman in St. Louis , " you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children today turning their backs on their parents ? Or are they simply not able to hold out a helping hand when it 's needed ? This issue was discussed recently by a group of senior citizens . One peppery , white-haired woman said it was a pity that young folks had lost the spirit of selfsacrifice , and she made the point that she herself had cared for her father until his death . Then she stopped and shook her head . " Maybe I 'm not being fair , " she remarked . " Come to think of it , I was n't married at the time , and I was living in my father 's house . But when my husband passed away , our daughter had already been married for seven years , and she had a family and a home of her own . So it 's not really the same , is it ? " Indeed , it is not the same . Family life in America today is dramatically different from what it was a generation or two ago . There are ample statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one parent was likely to die two years or so before the last of the children had married . At present , the first death of a parent is likely to occur more than fourteen years after the last child has married , and the surviving parent can be expected to live another seven years or more . The causes of this tremendous change are not difficult to pinpoint . Sixty years ago , families were larger , and the last child was usually born later in his parents ' lifetime . Today 's ( Continued on page 118 ) @# @#  | ) parents , however , married earlier and had children earlier than their own parents . Moreover , the elders ' span of life has been extended because of advances in medical science . In 1959 , therefore , the relationship between adult child and aging parent ought not be judged by 1890 standards . It is one thing for an unmarried child to continue living at home and accept responsibility for a widowed mother ; it is something else for a married son or daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other important family obligations . THE difficulties inherent in the latter case can be illustrated by the experiences of Dick and Shirley Green ( these are not their real names ) . This couple had been married for sixteen years when the senior Mr. Green died . The thought of living alone upset the elder Mrs. Green very much , and she made no attempt to conceal this from her two sons and one daughter , all of whom were married . Dick reluctantly asked his mother whether she would live with his family in their three-bedroom home . and she accepted the offer . With the particular combination of personalities involved , the result was a near breakup of Shirley 's and Dick 's marriage . Yet neither the young husband nor the young wife could give a substantial reason why . True , to give his mother a room of her own , Dick got bunk beds to put his twelve- and nine-year-old sons in one room , but this scarcely was an unbearable hardship . And the elder Mrs. Green was guilty of little more objectionable than occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rained , or advising him , over and over , " to be more ambitious than your father ever was , " or making more suggestions than were welcome about the care of the children . The trouble was simply that the younger . Greens , in common with the majority of adult children in the United States today , had neither a house nor a pattern of living suitable for a threegeneration household . When circumstances compelled them to adapt such a household to a two-generation home , tension between husband and wife mounted almost by the day . Several times , Dick tried to persuade his brother and sister to cooperate in supporting their mother in a proper home for the aged . Invariably , they concluded that it would be too cruel to " push her out of the house . " Aware that his marriage was souring . Dick Green finally turned for help to the community family-service agency . A caseworker interviewed him and his wife , as well as his mother , sister , and brother . By mutual consent of all concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trial period in a foster home ? that is , as a paying  | guest ( one hundred and thirty dollars s month ) with a private family ? in the neighborhood where she and her hushand had spent most of their years . Some weeks later , she phoned the family-service counselor to say she was pleased with her new home , had become involved with old friends , and had rediscovered the joy of spending time with her son and his family " just because we want to be together . " The counselor also received a note , from Shirley Green , which simply said , " Thank you for giving back to me the man I married nineteen years ago . " What happened with the Greens is one result of a marked social transformation , which has seen young people asserting their independence by setting up their own households immediately after marriage and has also seen them moving from small towns and large houses to large cities and small apartments . It is no one 's fault , therefore , if insufficient space in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly parents . This is a fact of family life in America today . Three generations can , and sometimes must , squeeze into living quarters meant for two generations . But , as the Greens ' case makes clear , this places an enormous strain on all concerned . Social observer Lewis Mumford has pointed out that it can even lead to elders ' becoming unloved in fact , because they actually are unwanted in the living situations in which their children find themselves . People over sixty-five are realistically aware of this . In one poll , nine out of ten preferred not to live with their children . A survey made of three hundred men and women who supported themselves on very small monthly pensions found two hundred living in their own houses or apartments and only thirty-seven living with relatives . Additional evidence comes from government statistics , which reveal a steady decline over the years in the number of aged widows and widowers residing with relatives . EVEN if the decision is made , by mutual consent , to have aging parents maintain their own households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older folk , be helped to live safely , happily , and within their limited budgets ? Unfortunately , the choice is limited . For adult children whose parents have difficulty handling normal household chores or are incapacitated by chronic illness , yet want to live at home by themselves , the answer may lie in a homemaker service . Although religious groups have long practiced this work among their own members , a network of such facilities for the general public has been slowly spreading across the country in recent years , chiefly under the impetus of the Family Service Association of America and its affiliated organizations . The cost of homemaker service varies from about fifty cents @# @# @# @#  | to a dollar and sixty-five cents an hour . the family pays as much of this as the agency estimates it can afford . In Detroit , a homemaker spends three mornings a week with the Stones , couple in their late seventies . She markets , does personal laundry and light housework , goes to the library for Mr. Stone when the weather is foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkers with him ? best two out of three . She never goes into the kitchen , for although Mrs. Stone is crippled by arthritis , she insists on preparing the meals , including lunch for the homemaker . Mr. Stone once said of this woman , @# We can do without food , but we ca n't do without Sarah . " A tremendous number of elderly people like the Stones must , of course , " do without Sarah . " Where homemaker services do exist , they are swamped by demands . As a result , only a comparatively small proportion of the nation 's senior citizens can benefit from such a program . For most of the others , there is no choice . They must leave their own homes . But they and their children ? having agreed not to live together ? now face the thorny question : where can they go ? The demoralizing truth is that there are few good places for them to go . The United States is not properly prepared to house its senior citizens , a failure perhaps resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresight . " Probably at no period and in no culture have the old ever been so completely rejected as in our own country ,  | during the last generation , " critic Lewis Mumford has commented . " We shall not be able to care for the aged , on the scale their needs and our national wealth demand , until we are ready to put into the rebuilding of human communities something like the zeal , the energy , the skill , the dedication we give to the monomaniac production of motor cars and super-highways . " Most adult children who have to search for living quarters for parents who can no longer live alone find the going grim . Authorities talk of " retirement villages , " apartment houses for the aged , rest homes , boarding homes . foster homes , nursing homes , and " geriatric hospitals , " and it is true that promising experiments in group living for senior citizens have been undertaken . with current emphasis on integration . rather than segregation , of the eldest generation . But few modern , moderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists stretch into the years . ONE of the most direct attacks on the problem , however , is the fosterfamily approach , mentioned earlier in connection with the Green case . It is used in Detroit , for example , by the Jewish Family and Children 's Service . Private Family Care , as the program is called , places persons over sixty years of age with families other than their own . The purpose is to provide a comfortable substitute home for older people who become emotionally or physically handicapped and can not remain in their own homes or in the homes of adult children , yet want the feeling of belonging to a family that can accept them for what they are . The cost ranges from a low of about a hundred and thirty dollars a month ( or thirty dollars a week ) to a hundred and sixty dollars a month or more in some areas of the country . A private family-care program possesses several distinct advantages . An important one is the fact that , in any community , such a plan can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of buildings . An intelligent placement service can see to it that the elderly " adopted member " is introduced into a compatible family , and since no hidden emotional conflicts lie between them ? as happens so often with children and parents ? the relationship is likely to be more relaxed and accepting . Finally , each benefits materially from the association , a factor not to be underestimated . But foster homes , like homemaker services , are not yet established in most communities , and so , with all too few exceptions , adult children must decide whether to place their parents in homes for the aged or in nursing homes . This is an emotionally loaded question . The idea of an institution for old people carries with it a black heritage from the past , a heritage that still echoes in occasional scandals . A newspaper headline says : " Old and Infirm Poor Condemned To Live under Inhuman Conditions . " Another says : @#  | " Nursing Homes Found Appalling ' Death Traps . ' " As recently as 1957 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mistreatment as a paralyzed woman slapped unconscious by a sadistic matron , intimidated inmates begging their relatives to get them out , an old man lashed to a chair from 5:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. every day , and meals served just two times every day . In Tucson , Arizona , a woman and her son chained their patients and were sent to prison for beating an old woman . In Portland , Oregon . jail sentences were given to a couple who periodically got drunk and abused the inmates of their nursing home . At Lewisburg , Pennsylvania , a state investigator found that an eighty-one-year-old woman had been confined to her room for more than two years , and during that time , " insofar as your investigator could determine , this woman had not been attended by a physician . " Most often , the victims are welfare patients , frequently sick and senile , who are allotted as little as sixty dollars a month to keep themselves alive . They remain at the mercy of the operators of their " homes " because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare field , trapping those within it . For although a state 's department of health may decide that the absolute minimum necessary for an aged person to subsist is , for example , a hundred and eighty dollars a month , the department of welfare can afford to pay , in most cases , closer to a hundred a month . The welfare patient must then accept the terms of a home that will accept him for a hundred dollars . If this place should be judged inadequate and therefore be closed , the welfare department would have to find adequate facilities for the evicted residents for the same sum of money , and this might prove impossible . Consequently , many states remain lax about inspecting nursing homes . The American Nursing Home Association , which has been in existence for only ten years , has campaigned for stricter law enforcement and , within its own ranks , has insisted that member institutions adhere to high standards . In addition , progressive states have cooperated in attempts to improve existing establishments . BUT now the basic question : who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Greens , to maintain a parent in a foster home , even when such a home can be found ? Fortunately , this appears to be one aspect of the problem that will improve with time . The majority of oldsters of tomorrow will be eligible for Social Security and company-pension benefits . And , more importantly , both they and the young families of tomorrow will , in most cases , know in advance that the problem is going to exist and that their responsibilities in connection with it @# @#  | are going to exist . At least , they will have had the opportunity , now , to take it into account in their budgets as their individual consciences dictate . Today , for the family who wants outside care and can not afford it , there is unhappily no solution immediately in sight . And the man who must weigh a college education for his children against his parents ' economic needs will have to search his own heart for the answer . AS FOR the " old folks " themselves , the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their adult children , and they become dependents only as a last resort . Money apart , they expect children to find other ways of demonstrating that they care about their parents , such as fixing a leaky roof , taking a widowed mother to the doctor , or paying visits occasionally , even if they 're inconvenient . What they seek is some sign of understanding . Aging parents can usually forgive their children for having no place for them in their home , and they may forgive them for having no money to contribute . But they find it hard to forgive them for having no understanding . Shortly after a letter carrier retired , his children told him they would like to replace his old coal furnace with an oil burner . " We know you hate shoveling coal and emptying ashes all winter long , " said his son . The man flexed his arms . " 1 ' 11 be taking the first step toward the grave , " he replied , " when I stop doing the things I do n't want to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age Center 's Health Division . looked at the matter from a physician 's point of view . " It is becoming increasingly clear that it is a good health rule to live within the upper limits of a man 's physical and mental capabilities . It is important , therefore , not to destroy an older person 's confidence in his health . Even persons who complain a good bit may actually have a firm belief in their own good health . To credit their complaints or treat them too seriously may undermine that belief . " Insight into the wisdom of this attitude ? which has important implications for adult children of aging parents ? can be found in the National Opinion Research Center 's study of a nationwide sample of 1,734 senior citizens . More than seventy-five per cent claimed they had been ill at some time during the preceding four weeks . Questioned further , however , twelve of the seventeen explained that the illness had not kept them in bed or a wheel chair , nor had it prevented them from climbing stairs . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only six of the seventeen had bothered to consult a doctor . In the same way that an older person 's confidence in his health can be undermined by those around him , so can his entire philosophy of life . " Often our senior citizens become old , ' " said Dr. @# 2n  | Maurice Linden , " because they think they are old , because they are told over and over that when youth is gone , there is nothing to live for . " Few considerations for adult children are more significant than the conviction held by Doctor Linden and most of his colleagues that the emotional climate in which the older person lives can either nourish him for many years or let him starve to death . A U.S. Public Health Service publication , The Older Person in the Home , contains this warning from a specialist in diseases of the aged : " The physical letdown ( in the later years ) is largely mental . Frustration , discouragement , unhappiness and fear are the hazards that lead to loss of appetite , insomnia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , with its youthcentered culture , its emphasis on efficient productivity , and its dedication to the future , the general emotional climate can not sustain an aged person . He is. in a sense , like a man who has spent all his energy and strength climbing toward the sun-drenched mountaintop , only to discover at the summit that the air is too thin and he is dying for lack of oxygen . To survive , he needs a place that is pressurized against outside forces ? where he is respected not for what he may do , but for what he has proved he can do ; where he is encouraged to develop his hidden potentialities under no obligation to anyone but himself ; where he is seen as a unique individual and never as a statistic or a stereotype ; where others draw close to him as he does to them , and each comforts the other . Whether they shelter him or not , whether they feed and clothe him or not , a man 's children can be expected to give him the will to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade , one of every ten Americans will be sixty-five or older . and medical researchers hope that . within the same period , they will conquer the four leading causes of death . thus opening the way to life spans of a hundred years . An already complex social problem will then become even more challenging , and new solutions will have to be found by the nation , the state , the community . But no matter how long man 's life may stretch , the relationship between parent and child will remain essentially unaltered , and it is within the family that all fundamental social solutions must be found . Adult children who today face the dilemma of what to do with aging parents are previewing their own future . The golden rule may be paraphrased : Do unto your parents as you would have your children do unto you . For they probably will .
