Many astronomers argue that only colossal pride prevents men on Earth from concluding that there are other people on other planets . In the Milky Way alone , there are probably billions of planets revolving around stars similar to the sun . A conservative guess is that 100,000 of the planets support some form of life . It is an easy step from there to conclude that they support rational creatures and a civilization . <P> Lecturing last week at M.I.T. , Dr. Otto Struve , director of the new National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank , W. Va. , announced a project that aims to bring earthlings out of their isolation . Starting New Year 's Day or soon thereafter . Green Bank will point the observatory 's 85-ft. parabolic reflector antenna at the most likely stars , listen for radio signals from planets around them . <P> <P> Razors , Trolleys . Radio astronomers have long tried their hands at listening for artificial signals from space , but have only recently developed the equipment necessary for the job . Receivers , once confused by electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can now be built to block out all conflicting interference . Antennas are being built ever larger : Green Bank already has a 140-footer under construction , has hopes for others 300 ft. and 1,000 ft. wide . <P> In direct charge of the project is Harvard-trained Astronomer Frank Drake , 29 . His assumption is that if other civilizations do exist , some must be more advanced than the one on Earth . " We would expect , " says Drake , " to find scattered throughout our galaxy , planets from which radio transmissions more powerful than ours are radiated . " <P> <P> " A New Society . " To support their hunches . Drake and other radio astronomers cite a closely reasoned paper published this fall by Cornell Physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi , who postulate an advanced society not far away ( as space distances go ) that has long been " expecting the development of science near the sun . " Wrote Morrison and Cocconi : " We shall assume that long ago they established a channel of communication that would one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently to the answering signals from the sun which would make known to them that a new society has entered the community of intelligence . <P> " Since the object of those who operate the source is to find a newly evolved society , we may presume that the channel used will be one that places a minimum burden of frequency and angular discrimination on the detector . . . The wide radio band from , say 1 mc to 10,000 mc , remains as the rational choice . For indisputable identification as artificial , one signal might contain , for example , a sequence of small prime numbers of pulses , or simple arithmetical sums . " <P> Morrison-Cocconi refuse to concede that their speculations belong to science fiction . " We submit , rather . . . that the presence of interstellar signals is entirely consistent with all we now know , and that if signals are present , the means of detecting them is now at hand . . . We therefore feel that a discriminating search for signals deserves a considerable effort . The probability of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance of success is zero . "
