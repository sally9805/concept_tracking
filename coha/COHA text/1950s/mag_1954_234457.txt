When first this order was ordain 'd , my lords , Knights of the garter were of noble birth , Valiant and virtuous , full of haughty courage , Such as were grown to credit by the wars ; Not fearing death , not shrinking for distress , But always resolute in most extremes . <P> - Henry VI Though Winston Churchill is not strictly of noble birth , few Britons better fulfill Shakespeare 's qualifications for membership in England 's oldest chivalric order . <P> This week , in the first Garter service of her reign , Britain 's young Queen Elizabeth formally installed 79-year-old Sir Winston as a Knight Companion . <P> For the occasion , Churchill , the only living commoner in a company whose 31 other members include three queens , two kings , and two ex-kings , got himself rigged out in blue and crimson velvet , topped by a black hat adorned with ostrich feathers . <P> At a morning ceremony in the throne room at Windsor Castle , Elizabeth herself adorned him with the ancient insignia of the Order : the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser George , " the Star and the Garter itself , a band of dark blue edged with gold and embroidered with the famed admonition of Edward III , " Honisoit qui mal y pense. " - Later , in St. George 's Chapel , Lord Halifax , Chancellor of the Order , read aloud the new knight 's name and style ( " Sir " ) , and he was led to a stall hung with the lion rampant of the Churchills . <P> After half an hour of prayers and anthems , it was all over . Queen Elizabeth hurried away to prepare for Ascot Week festivities , and Sir Winston Churchill , K.G. , returned to London and the humdrum 20th century business of being Prime Minister . <P> Reluctant Step . Throughout his 60 years of public life , Winston Churchill has managed better than any other Briton to suffuse the political scene with the spirit of knight errantry . But to those Britons whose business was the practical administration of day to day politics , the principal interest concerning the newest Knight of the Garter last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Weeks ago , Churchill had told his faith ful squire Anthony Eden that he intended to retire soon after the Queen 's return from her round-the-world tour . He was mortally tired ; he still had his great moments , but the aftereffects of a stroke last year had left him often unfit to conduct the daily business of government . <P> Retirement before Parliament rises in late July would give Eden a chance to take over smoothly as Prime Minister and pre pare himself for a possible general election either this fall or next spring . To defer his retirement until the very eve of an election and then let Eden bear the brunt of possible defeat would be a serious affront to Churchill 's own rigid code of loyalty . For the best interests of all concerned , it was agreed that retirement should come on or about July 15 . Yet , as the moment for quitting drew near last week , the old man still seemed loth to take the step . <P>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
