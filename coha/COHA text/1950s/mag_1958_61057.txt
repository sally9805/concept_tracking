Some odd specimens of tremble-fingered man can put 10 bullets into less than a one-inch circle at 100 yards . That is a wonderful feat , even though such marksmen use a heavy barrel , a telescopic sight and a bench rest . It brings together in excruciating perfection the precise matching of ammo to rifle and ammo and rifle to shooter. // It is the calculus of shooting but it is not a romantic sport . It is quite unrelated to hunting , for instance , or to shooting in self-defense . It is not romantic because it has so little to do with the basic purpose of shooting , which is to kill . // Romantic shooting is offhand shooting and has deep roots in our folklore , all the way back to Daniel Boone and Wild Bill Hickok and beyond , men whose skills are legendary and unproved . They used inferior weapons by today 's standards and , by today 's standards , they did not know a dime 's worth about ballistics . But the stories say that whenever they pulled a trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories is so great that they are cherished in our hearts , if not in our heads , and so , all the way from William S. ( for Shakespeare ) Hart to Wyatt Earp 's TV incarnation , every one of us has , from childhood on , been entertained by the essential premise of the Western story : that such magic is possible . It is an artistic convention , like the one-minute commercial . // The astounding truth is that anyone can perform similar feats of offhand shooting , feats that would pop the pristine eye of Davy Crockett. // In the hurly-burly of Pete Rademacher 's wonderful assault on the heavyweight boxing title a year ago I could make only passing mention ( SI , Aug. 19 , ' 57 ) of one Lucky McDaniel , a member of Rademacher 's Youth Unlimited organization . ( They call it Unlimited Enterprises now because a pre-existing Youth Unlimited Foundation objected to the similarity of names. ) // The title fight so overshadowed Lucky 's ability to teach shooting that I had only a few paragraphs to report how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to shoot with such marvelous accuracy that soon I was hitting crawling beetles and tossed pennies with a BB gun , with scarcely ever a miss . The first time I ever wore a pistol I was able to draw it and hit a pine cone in the road , at a distance of some 20 feet , six times out of six , shooting from the hip . // After Rademacher failed to go into orbit against Floyd Patterson I visited Lucky again , this time at Sea Island , Georgia , where he was giving lessons to guests of The Cloister . The idea was to study his teaching method and try to explain it . // The most lucid explanation of the method is Lucky 's own . He calls it " instinct " shooting . That is all there is to it . You look at something , you shoot and you hit it . // Ordinary offhand shooting with rifle or even with pistol is an attempt to approximate the conditions of bench-rest shooting . You take careful aim . You breathe according to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the target . You find it impossible to control the wavering sight but you hope you can discover a rhythm that will permit you to let off the bullet at the correct instant . You try , therefore , to time the wavering of the sight , the beating of your heart , the extraordinary turbulence of your softest breathing . When you think you have all these in rhythm you do not pull the trigger . You squeeze it , ever so gently , making sure that you are holding your breath . You try to time the squeeze so that the bullet will let off between beats of your mounting pulse . If you are a demi-semi-waver off in all this delicate timing you miss the 10-ring . Offhand shooting can be the most exasperating of the sporting arts . // But a student of the Lucky McDaniel method ( " The Lucky McDaniel System of Muscular Coordination and Synchronization Between Eyes and Hands " ) does not trifle with the meticulous . A true McDaniel follower will go so far as to have the sights removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will point rifle or pistol as naturally as he would point a finger , pretty much as good shotgunners do . Looking at what he wants to hit and quite disregarding the cant of his weapon or the state of his breathing , he pulls the trigger . He does not squeeze the trigger . He might even slap it , as shotgunners sometimes do . That is all . He hits the target , which may be a flying dime or an Alka-Seltzer tablet tossed into the air by Lucky . // It takes Lucky , a slightly built young man with blond , close-cropped hair , about an hour to transmit this miracle-making power . It takes his pupils the rest of their lives to get over the fact that they can do it . // Not that they can do it for the rest of their lives solely on the basis of one lesson . Practice is required thereafter , as in any sport . // Ross Baldwin , a young architect who has since been inspired to design a BB gun to Lucky 's specifications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Georgia road . He drew a nine-shot .22 revolver and , shooting from the hip , knocked down all nine matches without reloading , shooting far faster than what is considered rapid-fire in competition . // " I paid Lucky $25 for a lesson , " he said , " and I have since spent $1,500 for practice ammunition . " // The McDaniel method has evolved from doing what comes naturally . Lucky is 33 years old and has been shooting at game for 28 years . // " Everything I have got today , " he says , " I was born with . " // He was born with it on his father 's 800-acre peach farm in Upson County , Georgia , an area lush with woods and streams . His first weapon was a rare piece , a .22 caliber Winchester , which was fired , not by pulling a trigger , but by pressing down on a small obtrusion with the thumb . It had been expropriated from a farmhand who had used it to shoot an associate . Lucky 's Uncle Elmo Draughorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precaution of filling the barrel with lead . Lucky brought the rifle to a blacksmith , who removed the lead . Then Lucky took to the woods , where he began shooting rabbits and squirrels . // Just before Lucky 's sixth birthday Uncle Elmo gave him a .410 shotgun , and the two went off to shoot quail . // " The dogs flushed the covey , " Lucky recalls . " One quail came up the hill my way and my uncle said , ' Here he comes , Bobby . Get him ! ' And I did . I killed my first bird with the first shot from my first shotgun . " // Thereafter Lucky hunted just about daily under the guidance of a Negro farmhand , Johnnie Smith , and in the companionship of Johnnie 's son , Elmo , a year older than Lucky . Lucky 's father , Benjamin Franklin McDaniel , gave Johnnie very simple instructions : " You take my boy out and bring him back safe . " // Johnnie was a superb shot , and his method , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " instinct " shooting . // " Johnnie never aimed , " Lucky recalls . " He said a sight was a crutch for a shotgun . " // It was a wonderful time and place and way for a boy to grow up . On hot summer days Lucky and his cousin , Bushy McDaniel , now fire chief of Thomaston , Georgia , shot frogs in Potato Creek and sold the legs to hotels and restaurants for movie money . Lucky fished , too , as did his mother ( " she fished every afternoon for 35 years " ) , and he developed some astonishing skills , all of them having something to do with marksmanship . By the time he was 7 he could kill a fly on the wall with a slingshot . He hunted rabbits with a bow and arrows he made himself . He became expert with the lariat , developing skill on cows and horses about the farm . " I beat everyone at horseshoes , " he recalls . With a bull whip he would knock a cigaret from the lips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an air-rifle barrel and found it useful on frogs . He won his school 's marbles championship . // At age 13 , ill of pneumonia , Lucky discovered the blow gun . He made one out of half-inch pipe taken from a peach-spraying rig . With homemade darts he could pin a lizard to a pine tree or knock the ashes off a cigaret ( held by the magnificent Elmo ) at 30 feet . Today , while his wife , Betsy , watches in admiration , Lucky will pick up his blow gun and demonstrate his skill by hitting a minuscule spot on the living-room wall . // With a gun in his hand Lucky would strike you as quite a nerveless fellow , in spite of his quick , birdlike movements and bright , impulsive chatter , but the Navy discharged him in 1941 because of " bad nerves " and , of all things , weak eyesight . // His eyes were examined recently by a shooting student of his , A. C. Hobbs Jr. , M.D. , of Columbus , Georgia , and found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the impression , perhaps because of his Navy experience , that he was nearsighted . He believes quite firmly that his kind of shooting develops visual acuity . My own experience has half persuaded me that he is right . In busting clay pigeons with a .22 rifle I can now see the bullet hole  --  a tiny dot against the blue sky  --  in that fleeting fraction of an instant before the pigeons powder . // " Lucky 's ability , " Dr. Hobbs says , " is just something you do n't believe . I had a theory that accurate shooting represented bisecting the lines of vision from each eye , but that collapsed when Lucky shot just as accurately from his hip . One eye is as good as two . Lucky has taught one-eyed persons . I think I could almost have been blindfolded and hit the target . " // There is something a trifle odd about Lucky 's left eye . It has two pupils , which is probably against Navy regulations . He was born with a single pupil in it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , injuring it so that a portion of the pupil 's fluid drained into a corner of the iris . Lucky believes this may have given him a little extra in the way of peripheral vision , which is very useful , he points out , in knife fighting . He teaches knife fighting on the side . // After the war Lucky became a salesman for the U.S. Tobacco Company , going from store to store trying to sell Model tobacco . On his first day as a salesman he had no luck until his 19th call . // " Then , " he remembers , " in this fellow 's place of business I noticed a rifle . I mentioned something or other about being able to hit a coin in the air . He did n't believe me . So I made him a wager  --  12 dozen of my tobacco against hitting that coin with his rifle . I hit it , and after that I had the ring in my hand . " // From then on selling was no problem . Lucky just shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In gun-loving Georgia his sales record became fabulous . One skeptical prospect , C. D. Lane of Moultrie , bet his grocery store against Lucky 's new Dodge that Lucky could not hit a quarter in the air . Lucky refused to carry away the store . Instead , Lane became a steady tobacco customer . // Lucky stumbled onto teaching . Four years ago , while selling tobacco in Valdosta , Georgia , he took time out to have a pistol repaired . In the shop he encountered Brooker Blanton , former University of Georgia football star who is owner of the Dixie Lakes Distributing Company . Lucky just happened to mention his shooting ability , in a way he has , and Blanton bridled at the thought of such nonsense being foisted on him . " He called me a liar , so to speak , " says Lucky . They met at Blanton 's home . // There Lucky performed his usual feats . Blanton demanded instruction . // " It 's a God-given thing , " Lucky said dubiously . " I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little persuasion  --  Blanton offered to pay Lucky even if he flunked  --  and Lucky undertook the job . They started with a .22 rifle and Blanton shot 500 rounds without a smidgen of improvement . // It was getting a mite expensive . Lucky suggested they borrow a kid 's air rifle and use BB shot . // That did it . It was late afternoon and the sun was shining behind their backs . They could see the shot emerge from the BB gun . They could follow its trajectory . Thereupon Blanton began to hit small objects tossed into the air . // The BB gun is now basic to McDaniel 's teaching method . It is the pupil 's first weapon . Before he can shoot it at anything Lucky insists that he be able to see the shot leave the gun . Seeing the shot , the pupil unconsciously notes his margin of error on a miss and , again unconsciously , corrects for it on his next shot . // This is so important that Lucky has designed , and Ross Baldwin has built , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students can be helped to see a slow-moving pellet as it emerges from the barrel . The spring which propels the BB can be weakened or strengthened by turning a screw . The gun has , of course , no sights and the fore end of the barrel is even necked down in order to discourage any inclination to sight along the barrel . Its balance is very like that of a shotgun . // Successful with the BB gun , Blanton went back to the .22 rifle and , finding he could now shoot spectacularly with that , swore Lucky to secrecy and " went out and clipped everyone . " Next day Blanton brought another student to Lucky and his teaching career began . // Lucky guesses that he has taught thousands in the past few years , among them members of several police departments . In addition to hip shooting Lucky instructs the cops in the quick draw , at which he is most adept . He demonstrated this to me by having me point an unloaded pistol at him . // " I 'll draw and fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger . " // He did , too . // But the quick draw is a dangerous sport . The first policeman Lucky taught was Maurice Phillips of the Dalton , Georgia force . Phillips prevailed on his chief and the mayor to pay Lucky $20 a man to instruct the department 's 23 cops . The policemen were so enthusiastic that they took to practicing against each other with empty guns . But one day Maurice Phillips was killed in such a match with a fellow officer whose gun , it turned out , was not empty . On the other hand , Patrolman T. J. Blake of Prichard , Alabama owes his life to the quick draw , which came in handy when a burglar attacked him . // Alabama police now have restricted Lucky to teaching the draw to police and to civilians approved of by the police chief of a town . Lucky himself is not enthusiastic about teaching it to civilians . It is dangerous , he points out , because once trained the shooter is so conditioned that he finds it difficult to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both movements blend into one . The tendency , furthermore , is to shoot at whatever catches the eye , which might be the family cat . // Lucky 's method of instruction is a marvel of simplicity . There is , in fact , very little instruction because Lucky does not want to clutter the pupil 's mind with inhibitions . // The pupil is handed a BB gun and told to shoot it at nothing a couple of times . He is asked if he has seen the pellet leave the barrel . When he has satisfied Lucky that he really has seen it , the pupil is permitted to shoot at objects tossed into the air by Lucky , who stands at his right side and a half-step to the rear . Practically the only advice he gets is to cheek the gun lightly and to look at the object without sighting along the barrel . // " Cheek it and shoot it , " Lucky tells the pupil as he tosses up the first target , a rather large iron washer , a little bigger than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where did the BB go ? " Lucky asks . // The pupil says he saw the shot pass under the target . // " That 's right , " Lucky says , and tosses up the washer again . " Cheek it and shoot it . " The pupil misses again , is asked where the BB went and again he says it went under . Lucky agrees that it did . But on the fourth or fifth miss a pupil may say that he saw the BB pass over the target . // " No , " Lucky says firmly . " It never goes over . You 'll never miss by shooting over it . Now try to shoot over it and you 'll hit it . " // The pupil tries to shoot over the washer . He hits it . In that instant he becomes a wing shot . Smaller and smaller washers are tossed into the air and the misses become very infrequent . Eventually the pupil is hitting penny-sized washers and is able to plink them on the top or bottom , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly few minutes , usually under a half hour . During that time the shooter has been kept very busy . Lucky gives him no time to think about what he is doing , no time to theorize , no time to tense up . Targets are tossed in fast succession while Lucky keeps up a patter of suggestion pretty much implying that this is just about the brightest pupil he ever has taught . The pupil is inclined to think so , too . // After establishing expertness with the BB gun , the shooter moves on to the .22 rifle . The routine is much the same except that targets may be anything from small clay pigeons to charcoal briquets , either of which powders in a very satisfying way when hit by a bullet . There is almost never any difficulty in making the shift to the .22 . The shooter now has ingrained ability to resist the temptation to aim . He just looks at the target , pulling the trigger when , somehow , he senses that he is pointing properly . This is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of empathy with the target . Establishment of this " sense " is the big fundamental of Lucky 's teaching . // One reason for seeing the BB leave the gun , Lucky says , is that he wants the pupil to " learn to focus on a single object without looking at everything else around . " // " I tell him to hold the gun easy against the cheek , not force the cheek down to the gun in the regular way , " he explains . " As soon as he begins to shoot I know what he is doing wrong . There are a thousand things he can do wrong . But I do n't excite him . You 've got to give him confidence or he 'll tighten up . I tell him he 's going to hit the target and most of the time I call ' em right . When he 's shooting high I do n't just point to where he should be shooting . I throw the object and point while I 'm throwing it . I keep this up steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting the target , like from one match to another on the ground , so he wo n't get wrapped up in one target . // " This is instinctive shooting and it 's got to come easy . " // The third step is pistol shooting from the hip and again Lucky gives only minimum instruction . He shows how to press the elbow of the shooting arm firmly against the hipbone , makes sure that the wrist is held stiff . The shooter stands with feet apart and knees slightly bent . Lucky tosses small objects  --  pine cones , cartridge boxes , briquets  --  onto the ground and the shooter selects one for a target . He is told that if he misses on a shot he must not try to hit the same object again but must shift to another target . The reason is that after a miss there is a tendency to overcorrect on the next shot . Shifting to another target seems to relieve the tension that leads to overcorrection. // Finally the shooter is given a shotgun and goes through the same procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition is difficult for some shooters . A shotgun 's blast and kick can cause flinching , the pitch of the barrels is different and the heft and balance of a shotgun feel strange after the rifle . But the principle on which Lucky has taught rifle shooting is the basic principle of good shotgun shooting . With a little practice it pays off . // Lucky has no patience with those who teach shotgunners to lead their birds , even though this makes good ballistic sense . // " When a man tells me he does n't know how he hits , I figure he must be a good shot , " Lucky says . A good shotgunner , he believes , does n't know whether he leads or not . // Fred D. Missildine , a Sea Island resident and champion skeet shot , dropped by to watch Lucky give a lesson to Colonel J. Henry Pool , a retired Army officer . Missildine is a Winchester shooting promotion representative and a few days before he had given Lucky a new Winchester Model 55 single-shot .22 rifle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inserted in the rifle . Lucky has found it an ideal teaching weapon . // Missildine was curious about the teaching method . He watched intently as Colonel Pool , using the .22 , began to knock nickel-sized cardboard plugs from the center of tossed washers . He grasped quickly the idea behind Lucky 's " instinct " shooting . // " I 've been shooting like that all my life and did n't know it , " he said finally . In 1957 Missildine set an all-round world record at skeet , blasting 496 out of 500 targets . // Missildine was further impressed when he saw that Lucky could be equally successful with the experienced Mrs. Charles Moeser , wife of a former Princeton football captain , who that afternoon was to go on a turkey shoot , and the totally inexperienced Mrs. Stella Harned , wife of The Cloister 's manager , who had an actual dislike for shooting and had to be persuaded to take a lesson . // It was not so impressive to me since I already knew that Lucky had taught small children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention that the legendary shooters of the West actually did perform as the stories tell and that they shot by instinct . // " Every once in a while some wife gets mad at her husband , " Lucky says . " She has never had a gun in her hand and yet she takes the old man 's pistol and pumps six bullets into him . Wives never miss when they shoot at their husbands . That 's instinct . " // Lucky warns his pupils that they may be embarrassed if they try to show off without practice . It seems to be true , too , that Lucky 's presence is a large factor in success . // William O. Walton , county solicitor in Lafayette , Alabama , says that after being taught by Lucky he could hit at least five out of 10 pennies in the air in front of friends , and once hit eight of 10 washers. // " I shot a lot better with Lucky standing there , " he said . " It 's some sort of hypnosis . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit these things , yet I do . " // The hypnosis theory comes up quite frequently . Lucky grins and concedes that " the power of suggestion " has a lot to do with it . // But Lucky insists that his pupils can , if they will practice faithfully , retain their skill . // If you would like to try it out , here are some pointers . // 1 ) Wear glasses to protect the eyes against ricochet . // 2 ) Remember to shoot at nothing a few times until you can clearly see the BB leave the gun . It will look like a coppery streak , and eventually that streak will seem to you like an extension of the gun barrel . You will have the feeling that you are reaching out with this coppery streak , quite as though it were a long , thin pole , and touching the target with the end of it . // 3 ) Have a friend toss the targets straight up over your head at first to a height of about 12 or 15 feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same spot each time , and that the flat side of the washer is presented to you as you shoot . // 4 ) Do n't shoot at a single object on the ground . Toss out several , and if you miss on one , shift to another target . // 5 ) Even if you are shooting at something as small as a penny , pick out a spot on the penny to concentrate on . // 6 ) Cocking the gun may be tiring . Ask your target-tosser to do it . // 7 ) Take your time . // 8 ) Do n't pay too much attention to these instructions . Just look at what you want to hit and pull the trigger .
