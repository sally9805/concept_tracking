txt The split in the ranks of Premier Felix Gaillard 's government is still visible , although it now is five days since , owing to ' Socialist ' pressure , Finance Minister Pierre Pfiimlin had to take back his orders that all subsidies should be removed from foodstuff and public services . The threatened resipation of . the eight Socialist ministers and secretaries of state is still valid , although it looks as - though they will not disrupt the Cabinet just before , the Dec. 16 meeting of the NOrrh ? i:Atlantic Treaty Organization . During the past five days , since he was obliged to cancel the long list of price increases ready for publication In the official price bulletin , M. Pflimlin has been trying to reconcile two important themes  --  the . need ' to keep the Socialists in the Cabinet by finding a compromise , and the imperative need to show that France is doing something serious about putting its house in order before obtaining new loans from its allies or international bodies . More Francs Sought . M. Pflimlin now is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of some subsidies he has agreed to maintain after SoCialist protests as well as the increase in salaries for the state employees who are the Socialists ' main electorate . This new hole in a budget , which all ministers had previously agreed should not total over 5,300 billion francs , with a 600 billion . deficit expected , comes just when M.

This is the last source of currency on which ' France can count  --  and it will be gone by the end ? of the month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the 54 billions are disconcerting . As Mirabeau said : " Bankruptcy , hideous bankruptcy , and you are still talking ! " The curious thing is that while the public is hesitantly deciding that the general picture looks black , it is almost totally uninformed on the exact details . The Cassandra speeches made in the National . Assembly by financial experts such as former Premier Paul Reynaud or Pierre Mendes-France , appear to have no great echo in the country . The tendency has been to talk , and await the compromise that is always found , to think in terms of " muddling through . " This time again it seems as if the Socialists , the Finance Minister , and the Conservatives are all awaiting signs of weakening on each other 's part , expecting the compromise to come from the other fellow . It seems like a period of uneasy waiting while the govern  --  ent argues the pros and cons of a series of financial measures that become more necessary every day . ?           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
