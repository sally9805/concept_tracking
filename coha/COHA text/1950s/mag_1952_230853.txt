In the heyday of Marshall Plan spending , ECAdministrator Paul Hoffman had one persistent warning for the governments of Europe : after the Marshall Plan expires in 1952 , the U.S. Congress will be reluctant to vote any more funds for economic aid . Last week a reluctant House of Representatives made good Hoffman 's prediction , voted to slash some $1.7 billion-most of it in economic aid and Point Four funds-out of the Administration 's $7.9 billion Mutual Security bill . <P> The big cuts came in two days of runaway voting which the Democratic leadership was powerless to head off . Toward the end of the first day of debate , the Democrats mixed up their signals and allowed too many Administration members to go home early . The Republicans suddenly found themselves a majority on the floor , seized control and never let go . G.O.P. Boss Joe Martin deftly fended off Democratic delaying maneuvers , pushed through two drastic economy amendments sponsored by Ohio 's John Vorys . These cut a total of $726.5 million and came on top of the $1 billion cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Rayburn himself descended from his rostrum to try to repair the damage . Said he : " I am not happy about our situation in the world , nor in the U.S. , nor in this House . . . I notice this House , in glee , and . . . without a great deal of reason , cutting the appropriations in this bill . . . below what those in charge , and who are supposed to know the most about world affairs , said was necessary . " But the Vorys cuts carried-the most important one by 221 to 137 ( 160 Republicans and 61 Democrats-mostly Southern - voted for , 127 Democrats and ten Republicans voted against ) . <P> This week , in the Senate , the Administration launched its battle to regain the lost ground . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had recommended a cut of $1 billion in the Truman program , but Committee Chairman Tom Connally promptly made it clear he would yield no further . " The way to get real economy is to defeat this bill entirely , give them nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , " roared Texas Tom . " Then you can go home and stretch yourselves before your constituents and say , ' I saved $7 billion ' - and let the world go to hell . " <P> Last week the House also : Voted down an amendment raising Social Security retirement payments , by refusing ( 150-140 ) the two-thirds vote necessary to make the amendment a special order of business . Reason : most members wanted additional time to study American Medical Association charges that one provision in the bill added up to " socialized medicine . " <P> <P> The Senate : <P> <P> Confirmed ( 52-18 ) Federal Judge James P. McGranery , 51 , of Philadelphia as Attorney General of the U.S. Heard a report from its Banking &; Currency Committee recommending that the Wage Stabilization Board 1 ) be stripped of its industry and labor members and be composed solely of public members ; 2 ) be limited to acting only on stabilization of wages and not on other labor demands ( e.g. , the union shop ) .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
