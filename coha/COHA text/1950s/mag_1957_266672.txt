After years in which medical headlines went to tranquilizing drugs , it looks as though 1957 's drug of the year is an anti-tranquilizer . Its name : iproniazid . Dropped like a hot potato after 1951 trials against tuberculosis because of admittedly unpleasant and possibly serious side effects , iproniazid was shunned until about a year ago , when psychiatrists decided that it might be useful against deep , unshakable states of depression . The first few researchers got encouraging results ( TIME , April 15 ) . A fortnight ago , at a Manhattan conference sponsored by Hoffmann-La Roche , Inc. , which markets the prescription drug , more psychiatrists affirmed their faith in iproniazid , and medical researchers in other fields are now chiming in . <P> In psychiatry , Dr. Nathan S. Kline of New York 's Rockland State Hospital reported , the drug is equally effective as a " psychic energizer " for long-term hospital patients and the at-large depressed whom he sees in private practice .

Dr. Kline , though conceding no symptoms in himself , admitted that he had taken the drug to boost his efficiency when his work load was heavy . <P> Electric shock treatment for stubborn cases of depression has been steadily reduced in the tranquilizer era . While it still may not be eliminated , it can now be largely replaced by iproniazid , reported Dr. Theodore Robie of New Jersey 's Orange Memorial Hospital . He got good results in 46 out of 50 patients kept on the drug , believes that shock can now be safely withheld unless the patient is " aggressively suicidal .

One man , incapacitated for eight years , who had taken up to 20 tablets of nitroglycerin a day , lost his pain , began climbing stairs , and walked a mile without distress . U.S. and Swiss specialists reported good though less dramatic results . <P> Of 41 patients with rheumatoid arthritis put on iproniazid , 18 felt better and also had improvement that the doctors could verify ; 14 simply felt better . <P> Victims of far-advanced cancer enjoyed a marked " mood elevation , " complained less of pain ( thus needed fewer narcotics ) , gained weight , though iproniazid had no effect on their disease . <P> Senile patients ( up to age 92 ) who had been moody and withdrawn or waspish and argumentative became happier and easier to get along with on iproniazid . <P> Even in lowly acne , iproniazid got good results ( perhaps because of the emotional factors that are one of its causes ) . Most notable was the reduction in disfiguring scars.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
