In view of the alarming shortage of classrooms ( 300,000 ) in the nation 's public schools , it was probably inevitable that the Federal Government should have to step in . But how to provide federal aid without federal control ? Last week President Eisenhower offered his own solution : a $7 billion school-construction program whose very complexity seemed designed to safeguard the authority of state and community by avoiding direct federal grants on a wholesale scale . The President 's recommendations : <P> $750 million appropriation to enable the Government to buy school bonds issued by local communities over the next three years . <P> An appropriation to enable the Government to help the states establish a series of special agencies to build $6 billion worth of schools . According to the plan , the state agencies will issue bonds , build schools in districts with restrictive debt limits , then rent or lease the buildings back to the districts . <P> An appropriation of $200 million over the next three years for direct grants-in-aid to meet " urgent situations " in districts that can neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In each case , the state must match whatever the Government gives . <P> An appropriation of $5,000,000 this year and $15 million later to help the states pay the administrative costs of whatever programs they may have to solve " such underlying problems as more efficient school districting . " <P> To some members of Congress ( which already has 23 federal-aid bills before it ) , the Eisenhower program was clearly disappointing . Said Representative Cleveland Bailey of West Virginia : " Nothing short of $1 billion a year over the next six years is adequate . " The whole scheme , added Alabama 's Senator Lister Hill , offers nothing more than " a paltry sum ... an interminable delay on the one hand or a meager dole on the other . " <P> Paltry or not , the President 's program was specifically designed " for the purpose of meeting the emergency only . " In the next few months , various states will hold special conferences on their school problems , and these will lead to a big White House conference on education next November . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have given the best type of federal aid of all : leadership in arousing " the American people to a community effort for schools and a community concern for education unparalleled in our history .
