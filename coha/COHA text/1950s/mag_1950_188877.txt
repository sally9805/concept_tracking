In Madison Square Garden last week the St. John 's basketball team did everything wrong but shoot at its own basket . For a topflight team , their ball handling was wretched , their close-in shooting slovenly . With 45 seconds to play and St. John 's three points behind , all that Utah had to do to score an upset victory was to freeze the ball until time ran out . Then prosperity went to Utah 's head . <P> Instead of freezing the ball , a Utah player tried for an easy lay-up shot . He missed . St. John 's recovered the ball , and before 18,000 fans realized what was happening , the score was tied . St. John 's won in overtime , 51-50 . Later , when his hands stopped clenching and unclenching , St. John 's sandy-haired Coach Frank McGuire was asked by sportwriters to explain how his off-again-on-again boys had gone undefeated through eleven straight games and become the nation 's No. i college team. - Said McGuire , who has coached at Roman Catholic St. John 's University for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning myself . It must be the Blessed Mother . " <P> Free-Hour Throws . St. John 's , a team without an outstanding star , has no set style of play . McGuire likes to say that there is no such thing as a guard or forward on his team : " When we 've got the ball , I 've got five forwards . When they 've got it , I 've got five guards . " What St. John 's does have is a deep-seated enthusiasm for basketball that flows through its 7,600 students as the football fever does at Notre Dame . <P> St. John 's , 79 years old and resident of a cramped little campus in Brooklyn 's Stuyvesant Heights district , abandoned football 17 years ago . That left basketball to concentrate on , and on it St. John 's concentrated . When the varsity is not practicing , De Gray Gymnasium is usually busy with intramural games , or with free-hour students just throwing balls through the hoops . <P> This season , not even the loyal St. John 's student body gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after five warm-up games in Brooklyn , St. John 's moved across the river to Madison Square Garden and plastered Louisiana State , 80-49 . Big ( 6 ft. 6 in . ) Sophomore Center Zeke Zawoluk picked basketballs off the backboards and Gerry Calabrese peppered the basket with deadly accuracy from the " outside . " Unlike most Midwestern teams , which specialize in the fast break , St. John 's has a collection of set-shot artists who do not weave in unless they feel frisky . <P> Buried Champions . After slowing fast-breaking Rhode Island State down to a walk ( 75-54 ) , St. John 's jolted once-mighty Kentucky ( 69-58 ) and then Washington State 's up- &-coming; two-platoon team ( 67-44 ) . Despite this impressive start , there was still some doubt that St. John 's was even the best team in New York City . That title had been reserved for its archrival , City College ( C.C.N.Y. ) .
