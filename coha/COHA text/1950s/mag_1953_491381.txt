PART ONE OR the more than 100 years of its existence , Tiffany 's , the well-known jewelry store , has faithfully practiced a rock-bound conserva- tism that defies most of the standard rules for profitable merchandising . It has done this with outstanding success . For the past fifty years or so , Tiffany 's has been acknowledged as the most famous jewelry house in the world . It has a kind of timelessness about it . Tiffany 's never tries to turn back the clock ; it just ignores it . Not until after World War If was over did an executive of the company appear for work in anything but a dark suit . dark tie and dark shoes . Today a visitor may spot an executive in a conservative brown or gray suit , but it is a safe bet that if one turned up wearing a sport jacket and slacks some horrible fate  --  conservatively administered , of course  --  would be dealt him .

Salaries are not high , yet the turnover in help is slight . Of the 1331 persons who now work in the store and in the Tiffany factory at Forest Hill , Now Jersey , 328 have been with the firm for twenty-five or more years . Eighty-nine of these have Rayed on for more than forty years , and thirty-five for more than fifty years . Two , one or whom is George F. Mahon , now store manager , have been on the payroll for sixty-five years . Some have said that Tiffany 's is a state of mind . If you are in the jewelry business you undoubtedly respect Tiffany 's position in the industry . If you are a reputable competitor , the firm 's continual harping on ethics may strike you sometimes as being bombastically self-righteous . But you probably also admire it and collaborate in Tiffany 's efforts to maintain high levels of business ( Continued on Page 102 ) 31 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Th TREASURE HOUSE ON FIFTH AVENUE Lt ow howl ! teem hoo . : 111 ) practice . If you are not reputable , you probably fear and hate Tiffany 's , while at the same time you try to imitate it . It you are not in the jewelry business , you may awed by Tiffany 's . Some people , indeed , testily that they actually are afrnid to ge into the store lie-mum of the legends of elegance and expensivenies that surround it . But pnictically everybody , in one way or another , is aware of the place . The late 0 . 0 . McIntyre once wrote that Tiffany 's was " as much a part of the New York scene as Coney Island , the Bowery , the Statue of Liberty or the Brooklyn Bridge . " Columnist McIntyre might have gone further . Tiffany 's , in its elegant way , is a distinct part of the national scene , loons American as a box score or the electoral college . It has become . indeed , an American standard . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Tiffany " of whatever it is and nobody will misunderstand you . Many tourists visiting New York ? 3.5 per cent of Tiffany 's business is from outside the metropolitan area  --  include the store and building at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue in their sightseeing . It is the sixth premises to have been occupied by the company since it was founded ? a conservatively modern . seven-story , **31;4273;TOOLONG building , with a granite , marble and limestone facade . People are impressed by the building because it is simple , functional and beautifuL They probably would he more impressed if they knew more about it . The main showroom on the ground floor is remarkable in itself . Tiffany 's jewelry , the watches , its stationery department and its leather goods are on display there . It is designed like a ballroom , and it is 100 by 85 feet and has a ceiling twenty-four feet high . No columns support the ceiling . It is suspended on three giant steel trusses which also support the rest of the building , and it is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of Tiffany 's , and A. L.

Their problem was to supply light to display jewelry and at the game time keep the light out of customers ' eyes . When they were finished . 200 incandescent spots shone on the counters from different angles in the ceiling , so that any tray of jewelry , any brooch , any ring , sparkles properly . But the customer is unaware of the light ; there is no glare , no noticeable ray or beam . Tiffany 's is thorough . On the mezzanine are three discreet private showrooms , the diamond office and the gem laboratory . The second floor holds Tiffany 's great array of silverware , and the third its china and crystaL Above these are the offices , the engraving and jewelry workshops , watch-repair department and the designing room . No other jewelry store seems to have the same glamour as Tiffany 's , and people are drawn by it . Not that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outnumber real customers by ten to one . Nevertheless , they are welcome . The browser of today is likely to be the buyer of tomorrow . Such interest also contributes to Tiffany 's prestige . This is sometime even invoked by other jewelera . One New York dealer in cultured pearls  --  which Tiffany 's will not customers Ihat has approved his wares 1111 ? 1 recommeni lei I I hem . This is untrue . But it is a pitch thet sells cultured pearls . Some others make males by tolling a prospective customer to go to Tiffany 's to confirm the worth of the atone in question . Still others declare that Till'any 'm will set 1 lie gem Linder consideration , the implication being that . by setting the stone Titlfany 'm approves of it . So the company refuses to set , or even appraise , any stone nut bought in the store . There are good reasons for Tiffany 's remarkable prestige . In the first place the establishment has grown up with the country . When Tiffany 's set up shop , Martin Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a nation of less than 17,000,000 , Tiffany 's has had the time to become an American state of mind . Tiffany 's was horn in September , 11337 , when Charles Lewis Tiffany , son of a Connecticut manufacturer , left his home town of Danielson and came down to New York City . With . John B. Young , a boyhood Friend whose sister he was to marry four years later , he opened what was called a Stationery &; Fancy Goods store et 259 Broadway , opposite City Hall Park . Their capital was $1000 , borrowed from Charles ' father , Comfort Tiffany . The new store was pretty far uptown at the time ; New York 's retail business was transacted farther down Broadway , toward Wall Stnert . Moreover , there was a financial panic and business depression in that year . and people said Tiffany &; Young never would make it . They were mistaken . For the first three days , receipts were only $4.98. but business got so much better t hat when Charles Lewis Tiffany died at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his estate was estimated at S35,000,000 . Meanwhile Tiffany 's has made and sold an astounding variety of things . During the Civil War the firm manufactured swords and rifles . In World War I it was surgical instruments . Tiffany 's also had a hand in the Tokyo raid led by James H. Doolittle in World War II . As Doolittle and his pilots were about to take off they discovered their baffles were inadequate . A baffle is a device controlling the air flow in air-cooled motors , and it is an essential part of the rrawlmnimin . It would have helm suicide to go with the ones at lintel . Since Tiffany 's bad the contract to make the fitting blocks t hat are used in manufacturing baffles , it was given the job of milking the things themselves for Doolittle 's raid-ere . They had to do this by baud while Doolittle and history wnited nnpaIiently . At 1.11e moment , the Forest Hill plant is turning out precision ports for antiaircrnfl guns , along with its silver . Tiffany 's even made horseshoes once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable owned by the tobacco millionaire , P. Lorillard . Mr. Lorillard apparently believed that only people who could set precious stones and fashion beautiful silverware could make shoes for the delicate feet of his thoroughbreds . But horseshoe 's and baffles are notable exceptions , and the early " fancy goods " soon gave way to more conservative merchandise . In less than ten yeareaf ter its founding , jewelry and silver were the main items in the store . When Tiffany 's was incorporated in 1858 , Edward C. Moore , grandfather of the present president and son of John C. Moore , a leading silversmith of his day , was brought in as a director . With him he brought in his own silver business Charles Tiffany had bought all his silver from the Moores anyway . With the merger , Tiffany &; Co. became substantially what it is today . Millions have come to know Tiffany 's , if not by the direct contact of visiting the place or buying there , then by the things that have come from there and bear its stamp or its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone 's children have used ; the engagement ring with its six- or eight-pronged Tiffany setting , said to be the finest yet devised for displaying the fifty-eight facets of a brilliant cut . But it is typical of Tiffany 's that nobody at the store or factory  --  although the fifth generation of the Tiffany family and the fourth generation of Moores are currently associated with the firm  --  knows when or by whom the Tiffany setting was invented . It 's just there  --  a part of the place and a part of the jewelry industry generally . Tiffany 's takes its traditions calmly . But the sight-seers are aware of the traditions . The store itself may be 1953 ? yet ghosts walk there . Tiffany 's was where Abraham Lincoln bought pearls for Mary , his wife . J. P. Morgan , the elder , was a good customer . Hs bought only through the firm 's noted gemmotogist , Dr. George Frederic Kunz , in his day as famous in his own right as Tiffany himself . Along with ' Charles Tiffany , Kunz gathered- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these took eight years to acquire and is composed entirely of American gems ; the other was eleven years in the gathering and includes stones dating hack to the Mesopotamian civilizatione of 4000 a.c . Both are in the Museum of Natural History , in New York , along with a collection of sapphires , also gathered by Kunz and bought through Tiffany 's , for the younger Morgan . It is typical that nowhere in the records at Tiffany 's is there any ' mention of either Morgan , al . though both were heavy buyers . Other than the museum collections , Morgan purchases were nobody 's liminess Tiffany 's is discreet . To Tiffany 's Union Square stare  --  the fourth of six locations the business has occupied  --  came Hetty Green , the miser , clutching her paper bag stuffed with currency . It was where Diamond Jim Brady bought , and where an anonymous admirer of Sarah Bernhardt ordered Tiffany 's factory to make the great French actress a bicycle incrusted with diamonds and rubies . What became of it is unknown . Nobody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber pot one of her admirers gave her . Tiffany 's is also the place to which J. W. Mackay , grandfather of Mrs. Irving Berlin , actually brought three tons of silver from the Comstock lode and had it processed . There were twenty-eight different types of articles in all , and over 1000 pieces made , including 200 items of hollow ware . There are living legends too . The visitors might , if they happened in at the right time , stumble across the Duke of Windsor , who likes to come in and talk precious stoned with the salesmen ; or Barbara Hutton or Arthur Godfrey . who like to browse there . The odd part of it is that with all the tradition , all the color and legend and elegance , and despite an internationally held belief to the contrary , Tiffany 's prices are relatively low . It is true that Tiffany 's has sold china sets with the staggering tag of $50,000 , but there are others you can buy for less than $100 . It is the same in all other lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the price . This reputation for quality is the first and ( Mal reason for Tiffany 's prestige . It has been building for 115 years . Somebody once defined " Tiffany 's " as " the infinite capacity for taking pains . " Tiffany 's will not eell antique chins became it is too difficult to certify , and therefore a mistake might be made . It will not handle white gold  --  it might be mistaken for platinum . Tiffany 's introduced sterling silver to the United States in 1852 , thereby setting a permanent standard for the country . Tiffany 's laboratory , which was opened in 1925 , and was the first in the trade in America , X-rays every pearl the firm buys to make sure no cultured article infiltrates the inventory . It also examines every pearl of more than a grain , with an optical instrument called an endoscope . This permits microscopic inspection of the pearl through the drill hole . A record of the hundreds of thousands of pearls the firm has sold ( Continued on Nue 101 ) ( Continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its intnriduc-thus is on tile . Buy a pearl necklace at Tiffany'e and you get its family album too . Tiffany 's laboratory also has devices for determining whether the precious stones the company wants to buy an ? genuine or sync het ic . It " fingerprini every diamond of over two and 0110 half carats that it has in stock . This procedure was started two yea 's ago . and because of it a customer has a record of his stone , and no one may claim that a atone is from Tiffany 's when it was not bought there . The " fingerprints " are obtained by suspending the diamond with the crown , or top , down , shining a vertical beam of light on it from below , and photographing the tangential reflections . Since no two diamonds are cut alike , there are different patterns recorded for each stone . Tiffany 's is the only store using the system . Records of other stones are kept along with those of diamonds , Thus Tiffany 's two gem buyers , Moore and William T. Lusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep check on the inventory . They have bought , personally examined and evaluated every precious stone the firm has in stock , with the exceptions of a few acquired before their tenures There is something like $ ; 3 , - 000,000 in unset stones in Tiffany 's safe , about half of the total inventory of $6,000,000 . Some people charge that Tiffany 's attitude on cultured pearls is designed solely to protect an exorbitant markup on their real pearls Tiffany 's counters this by replying that if they handled cultured pearls they could make more money than they are making from their real pearls , the market for which has been ruined by the boom in the other article . This close control is also evident in the corporate structure . Tiffany 's , capitalized surprisingly low at 5.1,800 , - 000 , has 192,000 shares of stock issued and outstanding , almost 60,000 of which are owned in the company . Two prominent extra-company stockholders , by the way , have been the British and French governments , which forcibly took the stock from people of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get dollar exchange after World War 11 . Some have called Tiffany 's conservatism mulish . At any rate it is a conservatism of towering proportions , as Sherman Billingsley , the Stork Club man , discovered recently . Billingsley 's television sponsor gives away prizes to people appearing on the show , and on one occasion Mr. B. thought it would be nice to include a Tiffany handbag . " So . " as Billingsley relates it , " we asked them to contribute one . We said we 'd announce that it came from Tiffany 's . " This , of course , is standard procedure in such matters . " But , " Billingsley continuum , " they said they 'd rather we did n't . Said they 'd be happy to contribute and to help , but that they did n't really want the plug and would we skip it ? Thought it would be bad taste . Can you figure that ? " Mr. Billingsley is still shaken by the experience . ? Tiffany 's just always was conservative . Not for years after the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the proved advantages of the new writing machine , Tiffany 's dignified correspondence nevertheless continued to be written by specially employed calligraphers in a properly flowing Spencerian script , until primsure of events forced a change . Such conservatism , though marked under the administrtitions of Charles Lewis Tiffany , 1837-1902 , and Charles T. Cook . jafs successor , 1002-1907 , became really nuignilicent under John C. Moore , who was president from 1907 to 1910 . Tiffany and Cook , after all , hall shrewd eyes for proper publicity , and I here was plenty of it during their terms . ' Tiffany gloried in being called the " King of Jewelers . " But with the accession of John Moore , all such fireworks stopped . Moore , along with Charles L. Tiffany , the founder 's grandson , seems to have regarded almost any mention of the firm with a kind of horror . This extended to Tiffany 's personalities , including themselves . Moore 's win , Louis de B. Moore , the current president , although conservative enough , has relaxed his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear on the exterior of Tiffany 's Building at 37th Street . and Fifth Avenue  --  its fifth location ? for more than thirty years . This structure was designed by the famed Stanford White . It was large and spacious , and presumably you were supposed to know instinctively that it was Tiffany 's . Practically everybody , indeed , did , although once it actually was mistaken by a bewildered lady out-of-to  --  ner for the Grand Central Station . She asked an equally bewildered doorman where the trains were . John Moore finally was persuaded to put the name of his Iirm over the building 's three entrances . It is chiseled chastely over the 57th Street and Fifth Avenue doors of the present building . Tiffany 's is conservative in its buying too . Moore and Lusk never attend auctions and never buy from estates , although the best gems from such sales usually are offered to them sooner or later by dealers . Earlier , Tiffany 's bought at auctions both in America and in Europe  --  principally Europe . Such buying was done from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1850 . The French capital , up until World War II , was also the gum capital of the world . It was in Paris that the famous Tiffany diamond was bought and where the 378-carol emerald that was part of the belt buckle of AbdulHamid II , Sultan of Turkey , was acquired . This was not a fortunate tram-action . The emerald was recut , and the heart of it , weighing seventy-five and one half curate and remarkable for its color and clarity , was set in a clip surrounded by diamontle . But it remains unsold , although priced at a mere $39,000 , less than half of what it ought to bring . The market in expensive jewelry is n't what it once was . After World War II the European market became much lees important , and Paris gave way to New York as a jewelry center . So Tiffany 's in Paris closed up . It . 111140 has closed its London quarters , established in 1868 . The Paris store was in the Rue de la Pais , near Cartier 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the gem inventory ? valued in the millions ? was stored in the vault of the Soci6te Generale Bank , to which the Nazi jewelry administrator and A. A. Southwick . Tiffany 's Paris man , had keys . The administrator , a Luxembourger , happened to be an honest man and never went near the vault . Southwick , now retired and in his eighties , was considered too old for internment and therefore was able to keep watch at the store . Tiffany 's Paris store bought part of the jewels belonging to the great Hungarian princely house of Eaterhazy , in Paris , and also one third of the French crown jewels . Among these was a zone , or belt , of diamonds once owned by Marie Antoinette . Tiffany 's broke it up and sold the stones in pieces of its own design , without mentioning where they had come from . This , by the way , 114 another exampls of Tiffany 's conservelimin . No attempt is ever made to capitalize upon any legendary or historical association stone may have , Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have belonged to Marie Antoinette . But they said nothing about this . " To authenticate it , " says Lusk , " would have required the services of anti . quarians and historians . We did n't even try . It was a beautiful ruby and we sold it as just that . " Moore and Lusk examine stones al-most every day except when the sky a overcast . They refuse to buy in dim light and , since they do n't trust artifi. cial light , the dealer who wants quick action should not come in on a cloudy day . The dealers bring their stones in papers  --  soft tissues , folded and refolded into a square in which the unset gems are carried . The dealer is interviewed through an opening in the well of the diamond office ? which is kept locked  --  and passes his paper through to an employee inside . If he has something of interest , he is admitted to an outer office , also kept locked , where his gems are screened by a small but expert staff mid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moore and Lusk for final decision . If necessary , the buyers resort to the several devices of Tiffany 's elaborate laboratory , which is presided over by Dr. A. E. Alexander , the gernmo1ogist , who is now a Tiffany director . Doctor Alexander , along with Moore , developed the use of these machines to the point where no mistake is possible in the genuineness of any precious stone Tiffany 's buys . Actually only four-not including the pearl , often called a precious stone , but organic in composition -- are considered precious : the diamond , the ruby , the emerald and the sapphire . Determining value in these is tricky . Stones usually are valued according to size and quality . Beyond this , and with economic conditions always a consideration , there is also a rough rule of thumb in relative values . Moore and Lusk , using the diamond as par , figure it this way : A top-quality emerald of one carat is of about the same value as a diamond of the same weight . A ruby of one carat is worth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 30 per cent . At five carats , emeralds are worth 15 per cent more than diamonds , rubies 35 per cent more , and sapphires drop to 20 per cent of the diamond par . At ten carats , an emerald is 15 to 20 per cent above the diamond , but the ruby may be 100 per cent or even more in excess of it . This is because rubies of ten carats and above  --  rubies of finest quality , that is  --  are so rare as to be almost nonexistent in the general market . Tiffany 's has one of about that weight , valued at $79,000 . There may be others here and there , but Moore says that in his forty-one years as a jeweler he has seen only two that he would term of the highest quality . Emeralds , after passing ten carats , tend to level off in comparison with diamonds because there are more of thent , while sapphires usually decline still further because they are less rare . Certain line star sapphires are , of course , exceptions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone because of " silk " ? the rut ile , or titanium , needles that abound in it and make the stone nontransparent . Usually such lack of transparency militates against the desirability and beauty of a stone .

The KO lilt , phenomenon occurs in rubies , which are of the same composition no sapphires . Both are of the millet-el corundum . Moore and Luck , by I he way , bad a chance a few months ago to buy the biggest sapphire in the world . This gigantic stone , weighing in excess of 423 carats , is as big as a turkey 's egg and cut ' in an oval shape . It is in a brooch , surrounded by nineteen diamonds , each weighing three carats .

Although this price seems ridiculously cheap for such a magnificent stone , the fact is that there is no market at all for a gem of that size . Tiffany 's could have used it only as it uses the Tiffany diamond ? for display and publicity . In this day of high taxes , the utility of a gem must he figured more carefully than ever before , although some diamonds still fetch enormous prices in the upper weights . if of exceptional quality . The carat value of diamonds also is very high in the very small weights , into which they , more than the other stones . may be cut . This is because of the diamond 's hardness and the tendency of the others , because of their brittleness , to shatter in such an operation . Tiffany 's has diamonds as small 1113 1 450 of a carat , hardly visible to the naked eye , but cut with as many facets as a large atone . The whiter a diamond , by the way , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Tiffany 's steadiest sellers over the years . Styles in jewels change very little , if at all , and these two stones are long-term favorites . Exceptions to the usual classification of diamonds are certain rare colored stones . The great gem that bears Tiffany 's name is a canary , or yellow , diamond . It is the largest and finest of its color in the world , and the most unusually cut . Where the ordinary brilliant cut has fifty-eight facets , the Tiffany diamond has ninety . It is approximately an inch and an eighth square , and its weight is 128 . L:i carats , to which it was cut from its original size of 2871-4 in Paris , where it was brought from Kimberley in 1879 . People are always impressed by the Tiffany diamond .

Tiffany 's inventory , like that of any jeweler , but especially Tiffany 's , is one to inspire thoughts of larceny . To crack the security of the most famous jewelry house of all time must . be temptation to the more adventurous outlaw . But Tiffany 's is prepared . Russell Davenport , the editor and writer , once told his Yale schoolmate and friend , Tiffany 's Bill Lusk , that he always has an impulse , when in Tiffany 's , to break suddenly from the counter and dash for the doors to see what will happen . Mr. Lusk has advised against this . There are twenty pistol permits among Tiffany 's employees as well as the usual troupe of Pinkerton detectives lurking about . The security system is elaborate . Tiffany 's is under the protection of the Holmes Patrol , and a series of signals into the Holmes offices controls all doors and windows , and the skylights too .

Inadvertently he broke one of the protective electric circuits . The ensuing uproar , says Mr. Barney , was magnificent . Bells rang , sirens sounded , grim men jumped from careening automobiles before the cars bad stopped , and advanced on the store . All they found wan an abashed Mr. Barney . The Holmes protection is taken off each morning for the working day , but not before Tiffany 's watchman signals Holmes over the electric system in code .

Tiffany 's has not always been invulnerable . The store was burglarized and almost cleaned of all its stock just two years after its founding . And about fifty years ago occurred the greatest theft in its history . which is unsolved to this day .

Tiffany 's never saw the blonde  --  or the rings  --  again .
