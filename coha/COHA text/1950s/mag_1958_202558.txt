THE signatures you see on this page are those of a few of the hundreds of distinguished Americans who were among the original subscribers to TIME 35 years ago . We are , and always have been , especially proud of our original subscribers - of the John Smiths as well as the Al Smiths . Theirs was an act of faith . For TIME was an experiment in journalism , its future in 1923 full of uncertainty . <P> This week there is at hand evidence of another act of faith on the part of TIME readers . Late in 1956 we made a special long-term renewal offer to TIME subscribers - $20 for five years . To date more than 100,000 of you ( 117,178 , to be exact ) have placed five-year renewal orders . <P> We believe it is without precedent in publishing ( and if it 's not , we 're sure to hear ) that so many people would put up that much money for a product not yet produced . <P> This is by way of expressing the thanks of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in the rise in weekly circulation from 12,000 in 1923 to 2,753,000 ( in five editions ) today .
