At Douglas Aircraft 's plant in Santa Monica , workers this week put the finishing touches on the first DC-6A built for all-cargo operations . On the silver sides the pressurized , 325-m.p.h. plane was painted the owner 's name : " Slick Airways Inc . " Said 30-year-old Chairman Earl F. Slick : " For five years we did n't even know if we could stay alive . Now we ca n't grow fast enough . " <P> Hard-driving Texan Slick was not merely talking Texas-style . Last week , he reported that in 1950 his all-freight airline finally got over the hump , had a $506,608 profit after taxes . It was the first year Slick had been out of the red since he and his fellow pilots from the Air Transport Command started the shoestring line in 1946 ( TIME , Jan. 28 , 1946 ) . Moreover , they had hauled almost twice as much freight as the year before-45,318,000 ton-miles , 26% of all U.S. air cargo and far more than Slick 's closest rival , huge American Airlines ( 36,606,771 ton-miles ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting up $500,000 of the $1,000,000 cost of his first DC-6A ; Manhattan 's Bankers Trust Co. lent the balance . With 1951 's business still gaining ( February profit : $150,000 before taxes ) , Slick has made similar deals for two more DC-6As to be delivered later this year , for a total $3,500,000 expansion . The three new planes ( payload : 30,000 Ibs. each ) will boost his cargo capacity almost 50% . <P> Ground Loops . Slick and his hard-flying airmen had turned the corner none too soon . Though they had proved they could drum up a lot of freight business-from 11 million ton-miles in 1946 to 26.4 million in 1949-they had trouble proving they could make it pay . Several times they had edged into the black only to groundloop into operating losses that totaled $2,440,000 . If Earl Slick had not been able to tap his family 's Texas oil millions , the airline probably would have cracked up . <P> Slick lost heavily in a two-year rate war with American and other big scheduled airlines that ended in 1948 when CAB set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a bigger break in 1949 when CAB gave him a 52-city , transcontinental route tapping the major traffic centers . Thus , for the first time , he could fly regular , advertised schedules . <P> Calm Air . Slick drummed up new trade ( textiles , television and auto parts ) and opened up new markets , flying Christmas mistletoe from Dallas to Manhattan , Texas okra to Detroit 's big colony of Southern workers . Last year , after complaining to CAB that airmail-subsidized American and the big boys were still harassing his unsubsidized line , Slick slapped a $30 million suit on them , charging antitrust violations . After that , he says , they let him alone . <P> By last spring Slick had enough business to get his loads above the break-even point ( 70% ) . Then the Korean war brought a rush of defense business , and the line 's tonnage soared from 2,900,000 ton-miles in June to almost 6,000,000 in December . Slick knows there may be plenty of bumps ahead , but thinks he has weathered the worst . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All the U.S. domestic air freight hauled last year amounted to only 172,500,000 ton-miles , yet CAB itself estimates the potential at 1 billion . "
