Ptioiogrcrphs by Bill 5hrout For weeks I lay awake at night pondering the problem . Our beautiful and blond two-year-old daughter , Mari , was deaf . Not hard of hearing but profoundly deaf . She could not speak , she could not hear us speak . Her bright little mind could not be reached . We were told to send her away to a school where she could receive specialized training for the deaf . My husband , Charles , quiet , thoughtful and al  --  ways ready to do what is best for his family , considered this , but not I ? Send away our baby where she would miss the affection and atten  --  tion we lavished upon her ? What about the protection we strongly Celt she needed ? What about the feeling of being wanted ? We would not give her up , I said . And yet we did , Charles and I , eventually . This is the story . Mari was born in August of 195n . We did not suspect her deafness until a year and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her hearing . She was our third daughter and a most welcome baby . Her sis  --  ters , Ann and Ellen  --  ten and eight at her birth  --  were always eager to bring her to meals , play with her and put her to bed . While they were in school and if I was busy , we had a de  --  voted maid , Rosa , to follow her around . My husband and I enjoyed her in the relaxed way a couple often enjoys the child that comes later in marriage , after all the books on child rear  --  ing have been thrown out . Mari slept soundly , cried occasionally , laughed a lot and jabbered incoherently , like all babies . But the jabber never turned to words . We began to worry a little about this , 0 but our friends reassured us . Most had stories of babies who did not talk until they were two or three . It occurred to my husband and me that Mari might not hear well , but it was hard to believe . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it , and there were those co  --  incidences with sound to disprove it . She would turn her head a the right moment , seem startled at a loud noise , and we would enjoy the marvelous sensation of relief that she did hear , after all . The crushing suspicion of deaf  --  ness was upon us , but we continued to grasp at the slightest proof that we were wrong . Then one day while I was out in the yard watching her play in the sand pile suddenly she ran into the street . I called sharply , but she did not hesitate or turn . I ran after her , catch  --  ing her up in my arms , and even under the barrage of scolding , worried words , she looked up and smiled . And then I knew  --  she had not heard me . There was a tightness in my chest and I wanted to ( Continued on Page 54 ) // ( Continued from Page 39 ) go off to the bedroom with Mari , close the door and never come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cried and told him Mari could not hear . Now . besides the problem of Mari , I had become a problem to him , for my own handicap  --  an emotional one  --  had begun . We took her to several doctors in our community and to cities in our state . None were too encouraging , nor too dis  --  couraging. and we decided the farthest reach of Mari 's handicap was the neces  --  sity of a hearing aid , a nice little instru  --  ment that would not he too noticeable beneath blond curls . We live in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas near the Mexican border , a delight  --  ful easygoing community made up of a string of small towns . There is no school for the deaf near here ; in fact , the prob  --  lem of profound deafness had not oc  --  curred to anyone in the wide range of people we knew . And yet , when we were truthful with ourselves , we could not be sure Mari ever heard anything  --  not even hells , whistles or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing . As we had no means of communicating with her , she had no way of learning right from wrong . Try teaching unselfishness , politeness , neatness , precaution and safety without words . She had no sense of fear . Strange dogs , horses , deep water , moving cars held no fright for her . Charles , during this period , was a study in patience . He would hold her in his arms to calm the rebellious little spirit . I was in despair , but still I thought the problem would work itself out . She was still a baby . When she was two , a doctor in Galves  --  ton told us about the Tracy Correspond  --  ence Course for the Deaf , and we wrote to California and enrolled . For a while the nightmare lifted and 1 became over  --  optimistic . So did Charles and the two girls  --  all of us were so intent in our de  --  sire to help Mari . I worked with her in a beautifully de  --  signed course which ' was the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two balls , two cars , two rabbits . Two red dolls , two blue dolls . On and on , always speaking the names of the objects to her and trying to form in her the lifetime habit of watching lips . How she learned , we 'll never know . Watch someone say " red , " then " green , " without sound . The visual effect is ex  --  actly the same . Mari began to understand everyday words and to say : " Bye-bye . Thank you . " The most welcome words in the world ! The course was aimed at my husband and me as much as at Mari , for the Tracy Clinic understands the emotional parent , and knows that if the parents do not progress , neither will the child . Their cor  --  respondent poured out worlds of heart  --  felt compassion and concern . At the same time we found a therapist nearby and I drove twenty-two miles a day for Mari to have an hour 's work . But even with this supplement , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . By this time we knew Mari had a Severe hearing loss and should have full-time training . Charles tried to discuss it with me , but I still turned away from the idea of separation . Busy as she was in working with me on the Tracy course and with the therapist , we decided that Mari should have more contact with children , and we started her in nursery school with hearing children . With the special magic that small chil  --  dren have with one another , they under  --  stood her completely , and she them . The children begged to sit by her , and Mari was radiant . She would come home from nursery school bursting with news , but she had no language to convey it . Once she stood before me in agony , trying to explain what had happened at nursery school ; then , in complete frustration , she ran through the house , overturning the chairs . There was an ache inside me that took my breath . I wanted to project myself to encompass her and take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bond between parents and a handi  --  capped child is as abnormal as the very fact the child is handicapped . The rela  --  tionship does  --  and must  --  go to ex  --  tremes : either to overprotectiveness and a closer bond or to detachment , embar  --  rassment and shame . My husband and I were drawn more closely to Mari as we saw the hundreds of barriers in her way to a normal life . After a year , the correspondent at Tracy Clinic wrote : " Now you must pre  --  pare to send your little deaf child away to school . " Deaf . The very word hurt us . We never used it . We said , " hearing loss . . . does n't hear well . . . impaired If patriotic Texans had man  --  aged to have their way 106 years ago , Texas would be even bigger and broader than she is . For the early Texans claimed much of New Mex  --  ico , including Santa Fe and Albu  --  querque ; the southwest corner of Kansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyoming in the vicinity of Cheyenne . It took the United States Government , which was young and brash in those days , to separate Texas from this outlying real estate . The Texas claim dated back to 1836 . At that time Texas proclaimed herself a republic indelx'ndent of Mexico . She divided the territory west of the Pecos River to the Rio Grande into three whopping coun  --  ties , El Paso , Worth and Santa Fe , hearing , " or mainly avoided speaking of it even between ourselves . For me , the word " deaf " became a mental block  --  a block which was finally crushed by a woman I had never met . She was the mother of two children , both hard of hearing , and when I found out about them , I phoned her to discuss Mari . Yes , she knew who I was and she had heard of Mari 's difficulty . " My two children wear hearing aids and get along very well , " she said . " Just how much does your daughter hear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , but " " Oh , you mean your daughter is deaf . " " No ! Please do n't use that word ! Mari 's hearing is impaired , but " " Listen to me , " she said . " I do n't want to hurt you , but do this for your own sake . Sit where you are and say the word ' deaf ' over and over and over . Because that 's what your child is . You 've got to learn to face it and live with that word . " Our resolve to keep Mari within the bounds of the family circle seemed doomed . Nothing worked out to help us . I could not find an adequate therapist to live with us , and from the clinic , the fine local therapist and even my friends and family , I ( Continued an Page 56j and soon sent 300 Texans to rule it . Mexican troops captured them and herded them on a death march across the deserts to Mexico City . After the United States defeated Mexico and annexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent at El Paso , Robert S. Neighbors , was elevated to the rank of United States commissioner . Neighbors , appar  --  ently a Texan first of all , promptly established Texas county govern  --  ments despite the protest of the United States Army commander at Santa Fe . A United States territorial representative to Congress was elected . Meanwhile Congress began to feel , as many Americans have since , that Texas was mighty big . Sen. Henry Clay proposed chopping off much of its western lands . Senator Benton , of Missouri , urged that the Pecos River be made the western boundary of Texas . Texans argued for the Rio Grande . Under the Com  --  promise of 1850 , Texas reluctantly yielded 98,380 square miles . Nine years later , a Federal sur  --  veyor , John H. Clark , hampered by lack of water and shifting desert sands which obscured his landmarks , surveyed the line . His survey added a strip 510 miles long by two to four miles wide to Texas . New Mexico , then only a territory , whereas Texas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when New Mexico was about to become a state , the line was re  --  marked and an unsurvcyed gap of sixty-nine miles was charted , Nobody worried about the " worth  --  less wasteland " then . As late as 1953 , a Texas officeholder purchased 991 acres of this public land at five dol  --  lars an acre . He said it was in Texas despite assertions that it was in New Mexico . Whatever the facts , the land is now within sight of oil wells and worth considerably more than five dollars an acre . Clarence M. ConklIng 56 ( Continued from Page 54 ) kept hear  --  ing , " Mari will have to go away to school . " We prayed daily for guidance out of this cobweb . Never once , though , did we pray that the Lord change Mari , So grateful were we for her as she was . Instead , we prayed that she could be happy , that she could learn and that she could find her place in life . And so I still lay awake at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at home for her own sake or mine ? The angel that must watch over Mari worked through my mother and father . They found Sunshine Cottage for deaf children in San Antonio 300 miles away . " Just what we 've been looking for , " said mother , insisting I talk with the director , Mary Katharine Van Wyk . Charles agreed with my parents , but still I refused to consider the school , knowing that one step would lead to another , and enough of them would lead Mari away from us . But Charles and my parents kept insist  --  ing , and one day I found myself in San Antonio , talking with Miss Van Wyk , a brilliant and understanding woman who charmed me into filling out an applica T tion for Mari . Later I could n't believe I 'd done such a thing . I would never let her go ! But now 1 had no allies . Everyone talked it , everyone agreed  --  over my pro  --  tests  --  that in all fairness to Mad , she should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just four years old , I marked some of her favorite toys and all of her clothes , packed her belongings , and my husband and I drove her to San Antonio . We placed her in Miss Van Wyk 's beautiful , spacious home . Besides Mari , Miss Van Wyk took care of two other little deaf girls from out of town . For Sunshine Cottage is a day school , and most of the students come from local homes . I must have been hypnotized to let her go . We drove home in silence , except for my tears . There was nothing to say . The most feared and dreaded moment had come and passed . We wondered how we 'd lived through it . This sounds like emotional exaggeration ? Take your small child  --  the one whom you comfort and soothe with words . Think of taking that child , plugging her ears so she ca n't hear , put tape over her mouth so she ca n't speak , drive to a strange city and , with  --  out uttering one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , it had to be done , but what was Mari thinking ? Would the shock destroy her gay spirit ? Would she become with  --  drawn , retiring , suspicious and fright  --  ened ? If only we could have told her that we 'd see her soon ! That she 'd be happy , cared for , and she 'd learn . Four years old  --  tiny , vulnerable , so dependent  --  and abandoned by her family . At first I was beset by doubts at hav  --  ing sent her away from home and her family . In truth , my overprotectiveness was exposed with no adequate use for it . I kept telling myself firmly that Mari must be left alone to adjust to the new environ  --  ment . But I paced the floor , preferring not to leave my bedroom , for to leave it I had to pass Mari 's room , see her bed , her toys ; and the hurt was a sickness . 1 could n't enjoy my family or friends , nor my usual social activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I had been . I was morose and tearful , a poor wife and mother to my family at home , a family who missed her as acutely as I. At first we visited too often . Mad was adjusting and doing well in school , and only when she parted from us after these // visits would she cry . Then we would re  --  turn home and I would take to bed for a few days ; Charles would go back to work , but any semblance of happiness was gone . In time , Mari 's life fell into two pat  --  terns , and both she accepted . One was made up of school , work , her school friends and teachers ; the other meant home , family and holidays . And with this change in Mari and in seeing the amazing amount they taught her , I was able to realize the importance of the training she was receiving , and my own unhappiness began to melt . I began to live a normal life again , and Charles and her sisters were better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could laugh once more . As for Mari , even 300 miles away , she was secure in knowing we loved her and wanted her home every moment she could be spared from school . Sunshine Cottage . I had to be calmer really to see it and appreciate it , this low , modern brick building with sunny ex  --  posures and green landscape . It is like any other modern new school inside , ex  --  cept for the presence of earphones at each little desk . The degree of hearing , or lack of it , varies among the sixty or so students , but the earphones arc used by all to utilize every particle of hearing available to a child . The school covers preschool through the seventh grade , and more grades are to be added . Mari is in the first grade . There are eight or nine members of the staff , all highly trained . Almost all of the children wear hearing aids , even those who are profoundly deaf , like Mari , for there is always the hope the child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hearing aid helps strangers realize the child 's handicap . Mad is very proud of hers , and many of her little friends at home are envious of such complicated adornment . A few of the children at Sunshine Cot  --  tage have heard once , and then lost their hearing , and for them the training is much simpler . But to be born deaf  --  how can one convey the meaning of sound and the fact that everyone else hears ? Mari con  --  nects it with movement . Fingers move on an instrument . Someone hammers , shakes a bell , beats a drum , claps his hands  --  and everyone says he heard it . It is " sound . " So Mari says , " 1 heard the trees . " Trees move , and to say she April 13 , 1957 " heard " anything seems to please every  --  one , and Mari wants to please , We watched them test Mari 's hearing . By means of a set of amplifiers and a re  --  cording , she was fed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noises . The teacher held up Mari 's forefinger while the record played  --  out of her sight  --  and when the record was turned off , the teacher bent Mari 's forefinger down . This was repeated over and over . Finally the forefinger was left up , the record stopped , and had she heard any  --  thing , she would have automatically bent her forefinger . Mari did not , but a variety of tests will be made each year . There is always hope . Then began the long , tedious , add another , combine two . Mari touched her teacher 's face in the nasal area to feel the vibration of certain words . Then Mari 's hand was put to her own face in the nasal area . The teacher repeats the words . Touch the lips for new vibrations ; the throat , Try the words . Repeat . Try . Repeat . When we first heard the children in Sunshine Cottage speak , we were ter  --  ribly disappointed . Then we learned that the school does not expect profoundly deaf children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandable speech . And when a child can he understood , he or she is usually returned home to be sent to public school . The aim of Sun  --  shine Cottage is to enable the child to join normal living as soon as possible . After the simple words , the training becomes more complicated in trying to learn placement of the tongue . and the use of the vocal cords in an effort to keep sounds moderate  --  not too high or too low  --  not too loud or too soft . The teacher conveys it somehow , and without facial exaggeration . This is important because Mari must live in a hearing world where people will not exaggerate for her benefit . So the words came to Mari , then the phrases , and finally sentences . " 1 love you . " Think of the miracle in saying that without hearing ! " You saw the boy . " " I am not sleepy . " Each sentence Mari said was excitement to us , not only be  --  cause she was overcoming her handicap but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . We were getting acquainted with her at last . For me , for her father and sisters , happiness could be a three-word sentence . Mari is now six and she 's had two and a half years of intensive training . She can count beyond a hundred , add and sub  --  tract , she knows the parts of speech , she can write simple letters home , she has read several first-grade books . She is learning the refinements of speech  --  an apple and a banana . She says her prayers and pledges allegiance to the flag . She can name and spell all the colors and al  --  most all the objects she sees . She dresses herself , makes her bed , puts her toys away , plays ticktacktoe . She swims well , dances gracefully and can play simple card games . Best of all , though , she is able to com  --  municate her thoughts . She tells us every  --  thing  --  even things that happened long ago in nursery school when she was speechless . The frustration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke , seek sym  --  pathy and give it . Her bright little mind has been released with the power of speech . Most of my terror is gone . Of course I conjure devils about the future . I hope she will be well enough trained to go to high school at home . But what about adolescence ? It is diffi  --  cult enough without this serious handi  --  cap . Will other children accept her ? What will her speech be like when the training is over ? Can she find a place for herself in life where she will feel impor  --  tant and needed ? After her parents are gone , we do n't want her dependent on her sisters , for her sake as well as theirs . . So I am fretting , after all , but even while I fret , I keep remembering the worst is past . My husband 's view of her is calmer than mine . He misses her , but he accepts it day to day . A few weeks ago , after we 'd taken her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car to wipe Mari 's handprint off the windshield . " Leave it there . " Charles said . " I like to look at it . " Yes , something has been done for Mari  --  something wonderful . She can talk , she can understand others , and ev  --  ery year that passes will bring her silent world more alive , so that she can find her way in a world of sound , and , in knowing this , we are finally making our peace . Today , while I write this , Mari is here at home watching television with the sound cut off . " Mother , " she said a moment ago . " I want water , please . " 57 I was tempted to jump up , so grateful am I for being able to understand what she wants . But I stayed in my chair . I turned so she could read my lips . " You go get the water , Mari . " She 's a tease , so she laughed and cud  --  dled a pillow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses moved across the television screen and smoke puffed from their flashing guns . " Bang , hang ! " said Mari from the couch . " Yes , baby , " I answered . " Bang , bang . "
