When Roy Howard moved into Birmingham , Ala. by founding the evening Post ( circ. 69,963 ) in 1921 , he did so with all the assurance of Grant in the siege of Richmond . But he found his local competition no demoralized Confederate Army . The morning Age-Herald ( circ. 45,804 ) and the evening News ( circ. 166,017 ) , both published by C. B. Hanson Jr. , made things so hot for Howard that last week he beat a strategic retreat . He folded the money-losing Post , and signed up as junior partner with the opposition ( which folded the Age-Herald ) in a new combined morning newspaper . <P> The Post-Herald , making its bow this week , combined the staffs as well as the names of the two old papers , although 200 persons lost their jobs . The Post-Herald carried the familiar Scripps-Howard lighthouse on Page One , and was edited by a Scripps-Howard holdover , 49-year-old James E. Mills . But under the 30-year contract signed by the Hanson and Howard interests , more than 80% of the annual gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to the Hansons . Yet the deal was the best Howard could make under the circumstances . His Post had failed to keep pace in circulation and advertising with the faster-growing News . At the end , the Post was losing an estimated $75,000 a year .
