The Pleasure of His Company ( by Samuel Taylor , with Cornelia Otis Skinner ) is the first suavely managed drawing-room comedy in several seasons . With Actress Skinner 's help , Playwright Taylor-on whose shoulders , more than anyone else 's , has fallen the opera cape of the late Philip Barry-has contrived a bright tale of the prodigal father who , turning up for his daughter 's wedding , turns everything around him upside down . And Cyril Ritchard , on whose shoulders have fallen both acting the prodigal and directing the play , has added greatly to the gloss . <P> Actor Ritchard plays an eternal playboy , a gleeful , middle-aged enfant terrible , an international charmer and flirt . When he descends on the correct San Francisco world in which his daughter lives with her mother and stepfather , and his own glamour puts the girl 's serious young ranchman fianc in the shade , the wedding bells begin to grow faint . For father 's ideal of enjoying every real or sham pleasure goes to daughter 's head like champagne . Simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he denounces father 's wastrel charms in ringing tones . After that , the play gets a bit shaky-and talky-what with having to cast its vote for either irreproachable dullness or irresponsible dash . In the end , daughter goes off for a before-the-wedding whirl with her fermented father-presumably as a way of eating her cake and having it , too , or of becoming so well fed with cake as to want only bread and cheese thereafter . <P> Drawing-room comedies , like drawing-room furniture , tend to be fragile and spindly , and with heavy handling The Pleasure of His Company might easily crash to bits . Happily , the authors have a feeling for tone , and have made the talk-half insulting and half elegant-a nice blend of spit and polish . The Donald Oenslager set is stylish . And with the help of a pleasant cast-Co-Author Skinner , Walter Abel , Charlie Ruggles , Dolores Hart , George Peppard-Cyril Ritchard has carried things farther . Acting papa , he has the grace and precision of a lithe figure skater ; directing the play , he keeps things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Golden Six is Off-Broadway Maxwell Anderson and it is badly off the beam . The contemporary theater 's most avid creator of historical drama , Playwright Anderson this time has swooped down on Rome during the last years of Augustus , when the Emperor and his powerful wife Livia ( Viveca Lindfors ) look forward to a continuing family empire , while most of the family prospects are shown scheming backward to a republic . Proffering history in great swigs and histrionics in huge gobbets , the play staggers and plunges on through a brace of reigns , amid dedicated and degenerate heirs , with Livia 's the hidden , misdirecting hand .
