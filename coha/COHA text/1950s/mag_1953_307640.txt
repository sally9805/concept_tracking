Heavy , dark-haired Valeriu Georgescu was just about to leave for the office when the telephone began ringing in his New York apartment . He picked it up offhandedly . A second later , listening to the voice of the strange man on the other end of the wire , he felt a shock of mingled hope and alarm . The stranger began by suavely explaining that his name was " Costapeter , " and that he was just in from Rumania . Rumanian-born Valeriu Georgescu understood instantly . He had been stranded in New York during a visit in 1947 by Communist seizure of the Rumanian oil industry , had long since been an executive of Standard Oil of New Jersey and had recently become a citizen of the U.S. But his two sons-Costa , 19 , and Peter , 14-were still in Communist hands , and he had not heard from them for three years . <P> " Dear Daddy .

I shall wait for you . " <P> Moments later , the stranger turned up at the front door . He was a dark , personable man in his middle 30s . He had a soft face , a faint British accent and a confidently friendly air . <P> " This will no doubt prove my identity , " he said . He handed Georgescu a photograph of his sons . On the back was written , " Dear Daddy , please do all you can to help us . " It was signed , " Costa and Peter . " Georgescu left the room for a moment " to disguise my emotion . " But when he returned , he said , firmly , " I want to know exactly who you are . " <P> The stranger stared at him , then brought forth a diplomatic identification card . Georgescu , describing the scene later at a Washington press conference , said he noted carefully that the card was made out in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dated Nov. 5 , 1951 , and bore the title : " First Secretary to the Rumanian Popular Republic Legation in Washington .

" " Mr. Georgescu , " said the visitor , " if you want to see your children , this can be arranged , and I am proposing to you the following deal : you may see your children within the year if you will agree to collaborate with us . " <P> Georgescu : Collaborate with you-what does that mean ? You want me to collaborate with the present Communist regime ? <P> Zambeti : Yes . <P> Georgescu : Do you realize that I am an American citizen ? <P> Zambeti : Yes , but it does not make any difference . <P> Georgescu : It may not make any difference to you , but I have sworn allegiance to the United States Constitution , government and flag , and I mean to maintain it . <P> Zambeti : Poof ! Do you take things that way ? <P> Georgescu : I certainly do . <P> Zambeti : Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to do something about it . <P> Georgescu ( firmly ) : There is no deal there .
