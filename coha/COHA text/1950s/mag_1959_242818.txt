As she flounced off the set of Can-Can in Hollywood one day last week , Actress Shirley MacLaine began running over her lines . " How the hell are you , Khrush ? I 'm goddammed glad you 're here . Welcome to our country ; and welcome to 20th Century-Fox , and I hope you enjoy seeing how Hollywood makes a musical . We 're going to shoot the can-can number without pants . " Like most of Hollywood , which was like most of the U.S. , Shirley MacLaine had the Khrushchev visit on her mind ( she is an official movie hostess ) and , since it was inevitable , saw no reason for not relaxing and making it the gayest oddball social event of the season . <P> Around Shirley , Hollywood was scrambling with Oscar-night fury for tickets for the Khrushchev lunch at the 20th Century-Fox studios . Wives who had not been seen publicly with their husbands for months were demanding that they were just as essential as Mrs. Khrush ( only the celebrated married couples , e.g. , Tony Curtis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic twosome invitations ) . Things were getting so tough that the host committee , trying to winnow Hollywood 's must-be-seen-there thousands down to a sociable 400 , flatly decided to discriminate against actors ' agents . <P> It was the same all along the Khrushchev banquet circuit , from white tie to rolled sleeves , from the White House to Manhattan , to San Francisco , Des Moines and Pittsburgh . In San Francisco , demands for tickets to the Commonwealth Club 's banquet were matching Franklin Roosevelt 's historic appearance in 1932 . Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria grand ballroom was booked solid for the mayor 's lunch ( and a visiting convention of dentists , with a prior booking for the ballroom , was not too sure it was going to give up its rights ) and again for a dinner sponsored by the Economic Club . <P> Even the solo performances took on the glamour of major production . New York 's ex-Governor Averell Harriman and Eleanor Roosevelt , both Khrushchev 's guests in Russia who doubtless had said politely , " Come and see me if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a reception in his Manhattan apartment , Mrs. R. with a tour of the F.D.R. home at Hyde Park . Khrush 's favorite U.S. farmer , Roswell Garst of Coon Rapids , Iowa , placated photographers by trying on a coat given him by Khrushchev in Moscow last March , finally decided to turn his planned small country luncheon for the Khrushchev party over to a Des Moines caterer . Most overtaxed solo performer of all : U.N . Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , assigned by the President to be Khrushchev 's official host , ready to answer , parry or debate any of the unpredictable Khrushchev public thrusts . <P> The whole scene of week-before pandemonium would have pleased Nikita Khrushchev as much as a red carpet . He had made it clear to the State Department that he really did not want to see any more of the U.S. landscape than he could avoid ( he ducked a visit to TVA and Ike 's old home at Abilene , Kans . ) . Quite obviously , he wanted a lot of places to talk and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week-before signs , that is just what most of the curious and relaxed U.S. wanted too .
