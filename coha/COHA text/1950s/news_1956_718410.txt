txt Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden 's government faces a critical new test in a full-scale House of Commons debate on the consequences of the Anglo-French intervention in Egypt . At the end of this Parliamentary debate , the government faces a vote of confidence . Westminster is abuzi with speculation about the government 's future , the Prime Minister 's future , and the country 's future in view of the crushing new economic burdens just announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan resulting from the Suez closure and loss of foreign confidence in Britain . There is even talk of an imminent coalition government of the kind Sir Winston Churchill headed when Britain stood alone in 1940 . But current political tensions tend to discount this . In any case many politicians consider a coalition in Britain is only justified and workable in a major war . 1Task for Citizens There is no doubt , however , that the political pattern of British life as well as its economic pattern is currently in the melting pot . Exhortations from nonpartisan leaders in speeches and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves who can achieve British recovery in the end  --  not the politicians . It is considered essential , therefore , that the nation 's confidence in its leaders should be restored , and that it is no ? good repeating , as some Conservatives and commentators do , that Sir Anthony 's government can not be unseated in Westminster because it has a sufficient majority to keep it in office . for the next three years or more . Fact is that if British confidence is not restored in its government the economic life of the nation could very soon fail to meet the stark challenge which Britain has to meet as a result . of its Suez action and consequent world developments . ' Political Disorder Ebbs In those circumstances no government could last long without reasonable confidence of the people who are being called on to bear new austerities , new cost burdens , and who are-going tic  --  litile to work harder if their nation is to pull through . First task , therefore , seems to be to sort out the political crisis caused ' by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change Dec. 4 from political disorder to more political sanity . It appeared that the Laborite opposition had decided that it might be doing itself harm by its tumultuous reception of the Suez withdrawal announcement made Dec. 3 by Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd . It appeared that Mr. Macmillan had also learned . the same lesson which had been forced home on the Foreign Secretary , namely that in times of acute crisis the British will not tolerate what some persons term half truths or political make-believe . Tell the British the truth , tell them the worst , and they will stand up to it . That was the secret of Sir Winston Churchill 's great wartime triumph in leading the British . Wavering Charged une of me main accusations against the present government 's handling of the Suez situation has been that it has wavered in trying to state reasons for its action . And it continued to assert that the situation was going to be better than it turned out to be . Britain 's livelihood  --  whether it continues to have a high standard of living from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization  --  depends on world confidence . This has been shown by Britain 's gold and dollar losses resulting from the Suez crisis . This is Britain 's biggest worry of all . Can that confidence be restored ? As a foreign correspondent who works daily in Westminster side by side with the correspondents of practically every country in the world , this reporter would say it definitely can be . The Swedes , the Dutch , the Danes , the Germans , the Indians , the Pakistanis have for the most part been shocked and saddened by what has happened to Britain in the past month . But there remains among these foreign observers of Britain a deep reserve of good will if only the British can pull themselves out of their political mess . Therefore it is of the utmost importance that out of this week 's Suez debate there shall come a political clearing up involving the whole political outfit . Pressure on Defenses ? Financially the outer defenses of the whole free world including the United States are under pressure . This is indeed an engagement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps taken by Britain include the claim for the waiver of interest due on American and Canadian loans amounting to approximately $110,000,000 . Britain is also applying to the International Monetary Fund to draw on part of its quota there of $1,300,000,000 . Harold Macmillan , Chancellor of the Exchequer , told a silent House of Commons Dec. 4 he is also prepared to use United States securities owned by the British Government ? totaling nearly $1,000,000,000 ? if necessary to reinforce the reserves and maintain the pound sterling at its present parity . For the first time all Britain 's reserves , first line to last line , have been mobilized . At home the credit squeeze is to be maintained and tightened . Tax Boost Indicated The British have been warned to prepare for an increase in . come tax . It is expected that the standard rate of tax may be raised again in April to 9s. 6d. on the pound  --  more than 45 per cent of income . Mr. Macmillan has allowed an increase in the price of gasoline and diesel oils by five cents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 49 cents a gallon . The chancellor claimed that this increase would put the cost of living up less than 1 per cent . Industrial observers are unanimous its effect will be far greater than that . The British Road Federation declared , " The rise will have to be passed on to every family in Britain . " Prices of bread , milk , meat , vegetables , and housing are beginning to show an increase . Fares are almost certain to rise . The need to ask for a waiver of payments on the United ' States postwar loan is a bitter blow to many Britons at this moment . It stresses Britain 's special dependence on the United States . Many people think , as the Daily Telegraph says in its leading editorial , " Would it not be better to pay this without demur ? if only for the sake of being seen to be solvent and to be reluctant to ask for favors ? " Good Economic Base Yet others note that the financial battle in which Britain is engaged  --  a battle on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won unless its causes , effects , and demands are clearly understood here at the center . Part of the cause , perhaps , has been a distaste for . facing unpleasant facts ; another part , to use the words of the Financial Times , " the effort to keep up appearances . " The strains on sterling , the run on the reserves , are not tie . product of industrial or tradjrig weakness . Britain 's trade ; is balanced . Britain 's exports , ' are at an all-time . high . Britain is actually in a . position of : basic economic strength . The crisis is a crisis of confidence . It reflects opinions that foreigners have held or hold now about Britain . It began at the time President Nasser of Egypt . nationalized the Suez Canal Company . Speculators began to sell sterling , fancying this might be the beginning of a slide toward devaluation . And , listening to threats of military action , many individuals , institutions , and countries with large funds in . London began to withdraw them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in their funds in case the British " blocked " them : Import Costs Up . . That is one part of the crisis . The second part is the first payment for the blockage of the Suez Canal:and the cutting of oil pipelines . Oil has-had-to be-rationed. - Jt also costs more to bring to Britain . Other commodities that used to come through the Suez  --  wool , food , rubber , copper , tin  --  face higher freight charges . Shortage of shipping , threatens exports . Industrial production here may decline . In these circumstances ? put .. chasing power must be severely rectricted . Otherwise too much money would again start chasing too few goods . The result wouldbe the added enemy , inflation . This part of the battle can be won either when Suez returns ; to , peace and normal commerce , or failing that , when new , bigger and faster ships have been built , new fuels found , and new productive energy released . The first part  --  the crisis of confidence  --  can be overcome as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of its opinions is regained .
