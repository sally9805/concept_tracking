For a fellow who ended his formal schooling after the eighth grade , Harry M. ( for Mathias ) Hoxsey , 52 , has made quite a name for himself in the world of medicine . His formula for success : a mixture of roots , water and licorice , labeled Hoxsey Tonic and sold in 16-oz. bottles to thousands as a remedy for cancer . <P> The tonic , and Harry Hoxsey 's special treatment , have brought him wealth - and fame of a sort . He has been denounced as a charlatan by the A.M.A. ; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regards his tonic as worthless as a cancer cure . Yet some 40 new patients a day keep coming to the Hoxsey Cancer Clinic in Dallas , hoping for the miracle cure-at $300 to $400 a treatment ( " charity " patients pay little or nothing ) . Hoxsey friends are now trying to extend his domain beyond Texas . For weeks an attempt to establish a new Hoxsey clinic in Pennsylvania has been kicking up a major row . <P> Also Barber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , when he inherited the magic formula from his father , an itinerant veterinarian turned faith healer and " cancer expert . " Skipping from town to town across the U.S. , Hoxsey prescribed the tonic for internal tumors , and a yellowish arsenical powder ( a widely used turn-of-the-century remedy ) for skin cancer . By his own count , he was arrested more than 100 times . During a suit against the A.M.A. in Iowa , in 1931 , one patient testified that after Hoxsey diagnosis and treatment , he had gone to a local doctor and discovered that he was suffering not from cancer but from barber 's itch . Yet enough patients have stood by him to convince juries that Hoxsey and no other saved them . Through it all , Hoxsey recalled later , " I stood the humiliation for humanity . " <P> In 1936 Harry Hoxsey set up a cancer clinic in a small building in Dallas and got a naturopath 's license . Despite several lawsuits , he was soon doing well enough to move to plusher quarters . He hired two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years boosted his annual net income to $100,000 . On the side he plunged into oil and real estate , bought a 588-acre ranch . <P> Today Hoxsey runs a fast-moving medical assembly line . When a new patient applies for treatment , he gets an interview , routine blood and urine tests , X rays , and a fast diagnosis from osteopaths Delmar Randall and Donald Watt . The fee is paid in advance . <P> Also Cough Syrup . In 1952 the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denounced Hoxsey 's claims for his cancer tonic as " false and misleading , " ordered the district judge in Dallas to forbid interstate sales and shipment of Hoxsey 's bottled wares . ( Hoxsey and his lawyers delayed the ban for 15 months . ) Said the A.M.A. 's watchdog bureau of investigation : " The whole thing reeks of fraud .
