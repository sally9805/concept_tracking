A month ago , as collateral for a loan , Chicago 's North Shore National Bank accepted twelve $1,000 Cities Service sinking-fund bonds . When they were sent to New York for checking , the bank was told that the bonds were counterfeit . The FBI went to work while the New York Stock Exchange warned investors of printing errors in the counterfeits : a narrow white border , a mottled look on their green seal , breaks in the crossing on capital Ts . <P> Last week , the FBI arrested three men in New York 's Grand Central Station , charged them with having $25,000 worth of the counterfeits , and with trying to sell them at one-third of their market price to an FBI agent posing as an investor . Those arrested , the FBI think , were only middlemen ; the actual counterfeiters are probably still at large-and so are other counterfeit bonds .
