THE GILBERT AND SULLIVAN BOOK ( 443 pp. ) - Leslie Baily-British Book Centre ( $9 ) . <P> <P> Though either man would have perished rather than commit a symbol , it remains a suggestive fact that William Schwenck Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan were introduced while standing in an empty English theater . <P> " I am very pleased to meet you , Mr. Sullivan , " Gilbert went prattling off , with a mouth as long as a curate 's . " My contention is that when a musician , who is master of many instruments , has a musical theme to express , he can express it as perfectly upon the simple tetrachord of Mercury ( in which there are , as we all know , no diatonic intervals whatever ) as upon the more elaborate disdiapason ( with the familiar four tetrachords and the redundant note ) which , I need not remind you , embraces in its simple consonance all the single , double and inverted chords . " <P> Sullivan gravely asked him to repeat . <P> Whom jest had joined together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years , Gilbert &; Sullivan filled the English theater with such rollick as it had scarcely known before . Pinafore , Patience , The Mikado , The Gondoliers and the rest were something new under the limelight : real comedy operas whose music , in its own fribble fashion , was better written than most of the " serious " stuff of its time , and whose plots and lines were among the cleverest on the contemporary stage . These were smash hits , and today , after more than half a century , they are fresh hits every time the curtain rises . <P> <P> The Gilbert &; Sullivan Book should therefore find an eager public , if not a wide one at $9 . Yet , for the price , Author Leslie Baily has given full measure : his is both the liveliest and the most complete account ever rendered of the great collaborators , their private lives and public works . <P> Ransomed Poet . Gilbert was the older of the two by six years , and a personal devil of quiddity seems to have rocked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trip to Italy with his parents , he was snatched from his nurse 's arms by two Neapolitan toughs , and held for a ransom of 25 . Papa paid . As Author Baily observes , " it was a bargain . " <P> Gilbert proved " a clever , bright boy , who was extremely lazy , " and a rather unpromising young man , very tall and very skinny , who came averagely out of Kings College , London , and took a minor civil service job . Soon , to appease the boredom , he was squiggling little poems and doodles . <P> <P> The humorous weeklies began to accept them ; eventually they were collected as the bubbling Bab Ballads. * <P> " Literature , " wrote Max Beerbohm , " has many a solemn masterpiece that one would without a qualm barter for that absurd and riotous one . " In society , as in print , Gilbert began to establish himself as a formidable zany . When asked , for instance , if he had " seen a member of this club with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's his other eye called ? " He turned this compulsion for dialogue to the writing of plays , and was already the leading comic writer of the London stage when he was introduced to Sullivan .
