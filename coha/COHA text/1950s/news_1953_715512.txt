txt By a single ballot Georges Bidault , French Foreign Minister , failed early today to obtain the necessary 314 votes required to secure approval of the National Assembly for the Premiership . The count was 313 to 22S . Leaving the Elysee Palace after informing President Vincent Auriol of the vote , M. Bidault said : " France needs a strong government . One more vote ought to have been given , for everything I advised stands . They will have to accept it in the end . " M. Bidault obtained support from his own Popular Republican Catholic group , from former Premier Antoine Pinay 's Independents and ' a large part of the former Gaullists , but just fell short of success by reason of the opposition of the major part of Edouard Herriot 's Radicals , who had voted to refuse to take part in the Cabinet if M. , Bidault were approved . Though they did not explain their hostility , these opponents had been strong supporters . of Pierre MendesFrance , for whom M. Bidault had not voted . M. Bidault was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly since Rene Mayer 's Cabinet was overthrown three weeks ago . President Auriol has now tried nearly every possible combination to secure a majority to deal with France 's worsening financial situation and to- get a Premier in office in time to participate in the Three Power talks in Bermuda . M. Bidault 's defeat will make the choice of a successor one of the most difficult in the post-war period . M. Bidault , like all of his predecessors in attempting to form a Cabinet , told the Assembly he would need special powers to act in the present emergency . He urged the Assembly not to prolong a crisis that was causing France to lose prestige at home and abroad . The instability of cabinets , according to M. Bidault , would ultimately end in dissolution of the Assembly . Many observers thought tonight the Assembly was moving rapidly in the direction of dissolution and the calling of new elections , because , unless a strong majority can be formed , the stopgap government that would come out of the present disarray would shortly be in a minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote upon a question of confidence under the next cabinet . a dissolution may be asked . It was partly fear that M. Bidault might be tempted to make use of this power that apparently was one of the major factors of his defeat . He might have obtained a larger degree of support by promising , as had M. Meriden . France , to refrain from using that weapon and also by promising not to ask a confidence vote for ratification of the European Army Treaty . Indo-China , the European Army Treaty , the proposed Three and Four Power talks and possible dissolution of the Parliament ? were the chief issues in the Assembly 's debate . All but dissolution were questions of foreign policy . Would Press Indo-China Effort M. Bidault told the Assembly that with him as Premier , France would not abate the war in Indochina but would " seek by every means to end the conflict through the situation which would be created by the armistice in Korea .

If the treaty were presented , he declared he would be obliged to ask a vote of confidence from the Assembly . This , according to the Constitution , would open the way to dissolution of the Parliament in case of a rejection . Under the , cross examination of the Gaullists , M. Bidault said he would not use the dissolution threat as a means of forcing ratification . He said dissolution could be asked only if there were no majority for an alternative to the treaty put forth by the Assembly . Upon financial reforms , M. Bidault told the Assembly he would ask for special powers to make cuts in the budget and to increase receipts . He said he would also seek immediate constitutional reforms . " The present situation is harming the international prestige of France , " he said . He added : " This is not only because of the instability of French Cabinets but also because of the uncertainty as to who will speak for F'rarwe and the uncertainty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
