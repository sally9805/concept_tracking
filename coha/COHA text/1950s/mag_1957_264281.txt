The fastest-growing segment of the West German auto industry ( world 's No. 2 , after the U.S. ) is the midget-car business . Last week crowds at the opening of the 38th International Automobile Fair in Frankfurt hurried past the halls filled with big , sleek U.S. models , slowed down only slightly in the rooms where a new Porsche hardtop convertible , a new face-lifted Mercedes , Opels , Volkswagens and other German-made regular cars were on display . They finally came to a halt and milled around in the pavilion where midget-auto makers , some of them motorcycle manufacturers , were showing a half-dozen new models added to the score they brought out last year . Among the new bug-sized eye-catchers : <P> A four-seat version of Bavarian Motor Works ' two-seater Isetta . The Plexiglas front still opens up to admit the driver and front passenger . The two back passengers enter by a new narrow door in the right rear . <P> The Janus , a four-passenger , one-cylinder , 14-h.p. car from the Zndapp motorcycle factory . Both front and back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the motor under and between them . <P> Three new models of Hans Glas 's Goggomobil . The T 600 line is expected to sell for about $1,000 , has a bigger ( 25-h.p. ) engine than the older models , goes faster ( up to 70 m.p.h. ) but burns more gas ( maximum : 45 miles per gal . ) . <P> The racy Messerschmitt Tiger , only 50 in. high with two seats arranged tandem fashion under a lift-up plastic dome . Fastest of all the midgets , the Tiger has been clocked at 87 m.p.h . <P> The NSU Prinz , an almost grown-up-looking car , although barely 9 ft. long , 4 ft. high . <P> The Mopetta , a tiny ( only 3 ft. high ) one-seater with three wheels , a plastic body , and a motor the size of a cabbage head , which sends it scuttling along at 30 m.p.h.
