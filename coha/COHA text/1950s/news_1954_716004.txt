txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ** Ways and Means Committee approved today a plan to give varying degrees of relief to persons living on annuities . The plan , members of the House ' group estimated , would ease taxes for about 500,000 persons now retired and about 1,200,000 scheduled to receive annuities , with still others to benefit in years to come . The ' proposal is highly technical and complex . The committee offered an example of how it would work in the case of a $1,200 annuity . Unler present laW , a $1,200 annul ant pays income taxes on $327 of his annuity for the first twelve years of payments , on $776 the thirteenth year and on the whole $1,200 after that . Under the new plan he would pay , income taxes on $110 from the start of the annuity payments to the end of his life . The principal beneficiaries of the plan would be those who outlived their actuarial life expectancy . To inaugurate the plan , the present " 3 per cent rule " for taxing annuities would be discarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general , the rule now taxes an annuitant on the annuity payments he receives at a rate of 3 Per cent of the amount he paid for the annuity . Any payments he receives above this amount are excluded front taxation until the total amounts excluded equal the cost of the annuity . Thereafter the annuity payments received are taxable in full . Under the new plan , in the usual case , the annual exclusion would equal the amount the annuitant paid for the annuity , divided by his life expectancy at the time the annuity payments started . This exclusion would remain the same even if the annuitant outlived his actuarial estimate , which , experience has shown , is frequently the case . Employes who were members of company annuity programs would not be put under the new // MOVE WOULD EASE TAX ON ANNUITIES // ? rUle if the amounts payable to them ' in the . first three years equaled or exceeded the cost of the annuities to them . In such cases , the entire annuity payments received would be excluded from taxation until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the annuitant 's cost of the annuity . The plan does not apply to , pensions.provided wholly by an employe ? . All of such a pension would be taxable . The committee also moved today to see that the Government collected its full amount of taxes on ' prizes and awards ' made on television and radio shows and on other programs . It declared that a ' rigid legal set of rules was wanted , because varying court decisions had left a. soft foundation upon which to build hard revenue expectancies . It , proposed that prizes and awards be included in income subject to taxation , unless they were won in recognition of religious , charitable , scientific , educational , artistic , literary-or civic achievement . Basis for Exemption But even in such cases the rewards would be included in taxable income unless the recipient was selected witijout action on his part and was not required to perform substantial future services -. to obtain the award , such as teaching for salary at a level viewed ' as too high for tax exemption . The Nobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be affected . These are exempt because the winners are selected without action on their part . Also , . the provision would - not apply to scholarships and fellowships . When the award in a contest is an automobile , washing ma ( chine or other material objects instead of cash , the winner would have to include the fair market value of the prize in income tax . The committee acted on the provisions concerning taxes on , a.limony and separate maintenance payments . The wife must now pay taxes on the payments to her and the husband is allowed a deduction if the payments are made under a court decree . The proposed change would not require a court decree so long as there was a written separation agreement . Dividends Plan Assailed A proposal made by the committee last week for lightening of income taxes on dividends from corporate investments was attacked tonight by George Meany , President of the American Federation of Labor . He asserted that the committee was making " a bold attempt to use the label of ' technical revision ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthier taxpayers who already enjoy preferred treatment under existing tax laws .
