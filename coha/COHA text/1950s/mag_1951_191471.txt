South and west of New York City , the Jersey Meadows stretch desolately . On the flat , salt-soaked tidelands , the reed grass is sharp-edged and bitter , and around its roots , the soot is thick in the spongy soil . Freight trains chuff across the flatlands ; across them , too , each day , rumble the gritty , hard-seated trains of the Jersey Central and the prosperous Pennsylvania 's Bay Head line , carrying commuters to the trim farms and tidy suburbs of New Jersey 's shore towns . <P> Last week dusk had shrouded the flatlands as the Pennsylvania 's 5:10 express ( the Broker ) pulled out of Jersey City , crowded with standees . Veteran Engineer Joseph Fitzsimmons roared through a light ground fog . Ahead of him lay a spur . It was newly installed , had been opened only that afternoon . It swung gently off to the right , crossed a temporary trestle over an underpass , then paralleled the regular track to allow for construction of a new bridge for the Jersey Turnpike project . <P> Snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5:43 . The first cars lurched wildly . Just past the trestle , the steam locomotive toppled over on its side . There was a thunderous crash . One after another , the cars smashed ahead , tumbled down the embankment in a tangle of steel , slicing glass and mud-hurling bodies from their sides like maggots . <P> Said a passenger afterwards : " It felt like a whip being snapped . Newspapers started flying all over the car . The next thing I remember , the car was over on its side . I saw bodies stuffed into the baggage racks . " A great cloud of hissing steam , smoke , dust and soot smothered the wreckage . Inside , men and women screamed and struggled . " They were like a bunch of wild animals trying to get out of turned-over cages , clawing and punching each other to get clear , " said one of the survivors shakily . <P> Around the clotted misery of those six mangled cars in a town called Woodbridge-a dormitory for factory workers perched above the marshes-wives , fathers , husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . They gathered in numbed and desperate numbers at the entrances of hospitals , tugged at the sleeves of rescue workers , sat in rigid discomfort on the hard chairs in the Sunday-school room of Woodbridge 's Methodist Church . <P> A Yellow Light . This week the ghastly casualty figures were still mounting . There were 84 dead so far , 400 injured in the nation 's worst railroad wreck since 115 were killed at Nashville in 1918 . For New York commuters , it was the third big wreck in twelve months-32 were killed in a Long Island Rail Road smashup at Rockville Centre last February , 79 in another L.I.R.R. wreck at Richmond Hill. * For the Pennsylvania , it was the second major crash in five months ; in September , the Spirit of St. Louis rammed into a stalled troop train near Coshocton , Ohio and killed 33 soldiers . <P> From a hospital bed in Perth Amboy , bruised and with two broken ribs , Engineer Fitzsimmons talked with the ICC investigators . " I was looking all the time for a yellow light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chanted with desperate insistency . " That is the custom . One light as you approach . The second light is at the point at which the slow order is effective . " Said Fitzsimmons : " Those lights were n't there . "
