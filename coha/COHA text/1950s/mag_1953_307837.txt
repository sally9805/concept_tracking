Calcutta lies beneath its flies , swollen and unhealthy . The great city now crowds between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 souls into its dank tenements , often six to ten to a room , scores to a back-well privy . One man in three is a D.P. from Pakistan or the poor uplands , with no money and no place to go . And although the sacred cows roam free down Chowringhee , the native Bengali feels no more free than the refugee : the Marwaris and the British have the best businesses ; the quick Madrasis get the best jobs ; the workers for the jute mills come mostly from Bihar . Moreover , there is seldom enough money for the dowry , and the daughters stay long at home . All this discontent spreads like a heat rash and inflames at the slightest provocation . <P> Acid Bulbs . Last month the British-owned tramways provided just such a provocation . To give its workers a bonus and cost-of-living allowance , the company increased the fare by one pice ( one-third of a cent ) . Bengalis objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> First they organized a Tram Fare Enhancement Resistance Committee , told passengers not to pay their fares , and beat up those who did . Next they swarmed into the trams , burned the seat cushions of the first-class section , and hurled second-class passengers into the streets . But the drivers kept on going . So the Communists pelted them and their passengers with bricks , bottles and Indian Communism 's favorite weapon-bulbs filled with nitric acid . <P> Fighting spread . The mobs rampaged through the bazaars , stopped trains in the outskirts , cut signal wires and threw acid at firemen who tried to stop the fires . Their tactics showed how long the Communists had prepared . When police jeeps came after them at night , someone would blow a whistle and the street lights would go out . Then , at the moment of blindness , they would rush from the alleys , sear the cops with acid and drive them from the street . <P> Forces of Chaos . By last week four people had been killed , 200 seriously injured , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general strike was spreading across Bengal . Mobs surged unchecked through the streets . From Lucknow , Jawaharlal Nehru commented despairingly : " Looking at happenings in Calcutta , " he said , " it seems as if Indians are a mad race . We achieved freedom by peaceful means ... It will be a bad day for India if leadership passes into the hands of such forces of chaos . " At week 's end the government surrendered to the rioters , called off the fare increase . <P> The Communists were not ready to stop : they said the rioting would go on until all agitators are released from jail , until " police atrocities " are investigated , until food prices come down to a " reasonable " level , until there is work for all men-in other words , indefinitely .
