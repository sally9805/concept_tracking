ROSENBERG was told six years ago that he probably had only a short while to live . Though one cancer , in the groin , had been removed , others kept cropping up . Rosenberg was treated with X rays , but the Navy retired him on medical grounds . Then Rosenberg astonished the Navy by getting well . It took an act of Congress to get his retirement set aside , and Rosenberg back on active duty , but back he went ( TIME , Sept. 4 , 1950 ) . Last week Lieut . Commander Rosenberg , 32 , saw his Annapolis dream come true : he was ordered to his first sea command , the destroyer escort J. Douglas Blackwood . <P> GAMBLER FRANK COSTELLO has nothing worse than chronic laryngitis now , his doctor testified last week , but in 1933 it was cancer of the vocal cords .
