Just as things seemed to be going better in his struggle to save South Viet Nam ( pop . 10.5 million ) , Nationalist Premier Ngo Dinh Diem last week ran into serious trouble . He was caught in an ambush set by the discredited but still powerful rearguards of his country 's past-feudal warlords , religious fanatics and big-city hoodlums , with French colonials hovering indistinctly in the background . About 30,000 well-armed troops of the Cao Dai , Hoa Hao and Binh Xuyen sects ( long subsidized by the French ) were out in coalition against Diem 's national government , lobbing mortar shells into peasant villages to demonstrate their lethal potentialities .

That is why the French dislike him ; it is also why he is the first Vietnamese politician ( outside of Communist Ho , who also rose to power by stressing not his Communism but his anti-Frenchness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
