txt The Eisenhower Administration feels distracted and hampered by the demands made upon the time of its officials by Congressional committees and has asked for an early adjournment of Congress . This was disclosed today by Republican leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives as the party policy groups of both met in what plainly were sessions to cut sharply into the existing legislative lists of business . Speaker of the House Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts declared that despite earlier talk of a Congressional recess from the end of July until the autumn , all exertions would now be pointed toward quitting in July for good until the next regular session beginning in January . ' Senator William F. Knowland of California , the acting Senate Republican leader in the absence of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , in substance echoed the Speaker . Taft Absent From Meeting What view Mr. Taft himself would take upon his return to Washington from Ohio remained to be seen , and was the subject of a good deal of speculation at the Capitol . The Martin-Knowland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday at which Senator Taft was not present . Mr , Taft had been an advocate la as speedy a Congressional leavetaking as possible without leaving a great deal undone , but he has ' not shown much enthusiasm for creating a situation in which the Administration alone would be responsible for the Government for many unbroken months . He has spoken of a July recess , as against the finality of an , adjournment , so as to leave Congress in position to take another look at affairs a bit later on and to reassemble quickly on its own motion . The distinction is this : When ) Congress recesses , it quits until a day fixed by its leaders . When it adjourns , it can not come back until the next regular session ? in this case , next January  --  except on the decision of the President alone . ) Senator Knowland told reporters after a meeting of the Senate Republican Policy Committee that the " overwhelming sentiment " in the House and the preponderant sentiment , at least , in the Senate was for adjournment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thought of a mere recess , but he said one should not be contemplated if a " substantial " part of the legislative program could be cleared by July 31 . Moreover , in announcing the Senate agenda he said that the last of the routine appropriations bills probably would not be on the Senate floor much before that date . Though issuing no " must " list , 1 he put in the category of more or less certain action only a few major subjects , such as the extension of the foreign aid and . te- I ciprocal trade programs and President Eisenhower 's plan to continue the excess profits tax for six ' months beyond July 1 . Left out of any such category were such controversial issues as the following : Statehood for Hawaii ; amendments to the Taft-Hartley Labor Act ; proposed alterations in the North Atlantic Treaty defining the legal rights of United States forces overseas ; a bill to permit CongresIsional investigating committees to . give immunity from prosecution to a witness in exchange for information , and a proposed constitutional amendment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile to the provisions of the Constitution . Subjects Held Not Pressing Mr. Knowland stressed that all these subjects should not be described as " dead . " Nevertheless , he said that some among them could be considered to be the sort of subjects for which it would not be essential to come back this year after a July recess . " The Executive Branch , " he said , " would like to have the opportunity to give its undivided attention to the problems before , it . " It needed time to reflect upon and to form policies free of Congressional distraction , he added . Speaker Martin said bluntly : " The Administration wants an early adjournment . " Though not discussing what the House leaders would consider an adequate agenda for this year , he made it plain that the Administration was insistent on being left alone a while , and that he wholly agreed .
