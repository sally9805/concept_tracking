Festooned with colored lights and filled with little tables &; chairs , the ordinarily bare parade ground of Port-au-Prince 's broad Champs-de-Mars wore the air of a fte champtre . While bands blared meringues through the soft tropical night , 15,000 happy Haitians downed free rice , beans , griots ( fried pork ) , and heady island rum . Nearby cinemas and bars offered free movies and more free drinks . From time to time loudspeakers broadcast polite speeches by politicians suggesting that the picnickers might vote for Colonel Paul Magloire for President . <P> For more than a month Haitians have been reeling under one such outpouring after another of Candidate Magloire 's official hospitality . In addition to buying movies , drinks and picnic suppers for everybody , the tall , handsome colonel has also wooed the upper crust with balls and brunches in the best hotels , the masses with sandwiches tossed from army trucks . <P> Colonel Magloire is the strong man of the Haitian army .

The Estim experience convinced the colonel that he had better stop fooling and run the country himself . <P> In a shrewd move to make the most of his power and prestige , he arranged that the new President would be chosen not by Congress , but by direct popular vote .

This week , as the voters prepared to go to the polls , there was no doubt that the open-handed Strong Man would be Haiti 's next President .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
