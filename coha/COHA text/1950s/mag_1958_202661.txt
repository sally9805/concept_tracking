Convoyed from his native coastal village by a task force of rifle-slung motorcyclists and troop-filled jeeps , Major General Fuad Chehab rode to his inauguration as Lebanon 's new president through a capital seething under a 48-hour curfew . In all its five-month civil war , Lebanon had never been more tense . This time it was the Christians who had erupted into new violence in protest against the abduction of a Christian journalist and backer of retiring President Camille Chamoun . <P> Ignoring the tension , the new President called on his countrymen to work with him for the " reestablishment of government authority " and " above all , the speedy evacuation of foreign forces . " A Christian elected with Moslem support , Chehab pledged himself to uphold " the unwritten constitution . " This was the 1943 compact in which Lebanon 's Christian and Moslem communities agreed that Moslems would refrain from urging merger with other Arab states , Christians would hold back from aligning the country too closely with any Western power . <P> From the Barricades . But next day the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pro-Western Moslems . Chehab 's choice for Premier was Rashid Karami , 37 , a Moslem lawyer who led the rebel resistance in Tripoli . Chamoun 's most fanatical backers vowed that they would fight rather than accept a Premier from " the barricades . " From the mountain village to which he had retired , Chamoun fanned the flames with a statement : " The new Cabinet is not satisfactory to me . " Members of the khaki-shirted Christian Phalange , a strong-arm outfit that has been in the forefront of the Lebanese fighting , printed posters proclaiming " Death rather than government by Karami , " stormed into the streets to shoot up Beirut stores , fire cars and fight sharp scrimmages with Moslem partisans , in which 26 died and 35 were injured . <P> That night Chehab 's army cracked down as it never had when Chehab was merely army chief , charged with upholding the authority of the Chamoun government . Troops were ordered to shoot armed civilians on sight . Army patrols shot and killed two men who pulled guns to stop a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced he was all for peace . <P> By week 's end tension eased , and the barricades first put up last May began to go down in Beirut streets . Premier Karami helped cool things off by announcing that " our chief responsibility is to bind up the wounds and wash the traces of blood from the face of Lebanon . " At heart an Arab nationalist ( " I consider Nasser a superman , " he said recently ) , Karami is nevertheless on record as opposing merger with the United Arab Republic .
