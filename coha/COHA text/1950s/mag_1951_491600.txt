OHOUGH founded by a Baptist minister , Temple University , of Philadelphia , which calls itself , and is , a " poor man 's university , " has always been nondenominational . Rut religious feeling somehow pervades its corridors ; and when , in 1941 , Temple was snagged in one of the Worst of its many emergencies and a committee had been charged with the task of finding an ideal new president , all of the committee 's sessions were I ? Pened with a prayer for inner illumination . The coMmittee also sought the more mundane aid of learned societies throughout the country . The learned societies disagreed on many of the qualities an ideal president should have , but were almost unanimous in extending this advice , " Do n't pick a businessman . " When the committee , having thoroughly examined the qualifications of seventy-eight nominees , had prayed again , it flew in the face of worldly advice and came up with Robert Livingston Johnson , of New York City . Some friends of the proletarian university wondered whether the committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuse . Johnson was not only a businessman but a millionaire , though only a scratch millionaire that is , one who had given up money-making after having amassed a single million . He held no academic degrees . The first World War interrupted his education at Yale , and he had never gone back to finish . He was a breezy , gregarious extrovert , full of dynamic friendliness and about as fax removed from the traditional university-president pattern as he could get . Actually , as things turned out , the committee 's choice proved to be an excellent one . Johnson is not a standard president , but Temple is not a standard university either . Temperamentally , the new president and the university have many affinities . As much as any other supercharged American , Johnson has sprinted through life as if calendars and clocks were man 's worst enemies . His sense of urgency about whatever he happens to be interested in at the moment is extremely acute , and he is always in a hurry . These traits , plus an indefatigable optimism , shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion human and collegiate careers 17 marked by a series of recurring crises . In harnessing the two careers , the selecting committee apparently was either genuinely inspired or powered by some high-class intuition . Johnson is so fond of grappling with crises that , according to some of his friends , he would be driven to invent one if none happened to be lying around , for the sheer satisfaction of surmounting it . So far , he has n't had to invent any . Temple has supplied them in abundance . Temple 's crises have resulted largely from its self-assigned mission of providing first-rate higher education to the sons and daughters of the Philadelphia area 's low-income groups . To this mission it is , and always has been , fervently dedicated . Well over half of its students help to earn their way by working before and after classes , at part- or full-time jobs . One fifth of the students come from homes in which both parents are of foreign birth , and another fifth from homes in which one parent was born abroad . An average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labor union . These statistics are reflected faithfully in political-campaign straw votes taken among the student body . Invariably , the students vote overwhelmingly Democratic , which causes their president , who is a Republican , no worry at all . In 1948 , while the student body was recorded as backing the Truman-Barkley ticket , Johnson took a two-month leave of absence to campaign for Dewey and Warren . Temple , like its opposite number , the University of Pennsylvania , takes an unusually liberal attitude toward occasional political activity by its president . So far Johnson has not ventured into world politics , as has Pres. Harold Stassen , of Penn , but if he wanted to knock on Stalin 's door the Temple trustees would probably back him up . To accommodate the purses of the kind of students Temple wants to attract , tuition fees must be kept very low , and they are . In turn , the modest tuition-fee dollar must be stretched to the snapping point , as it accounts for 82 per cent of the operating budget , the remainder being supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronically bursting at the seams , and the money for expansion of facilities and for permanent endowment must come from wealthy private donors . Under the impact of rising taxation on incomes , the ranks of this human species have been well thinned out in recent years , and Johnson explores the diminishing field with the tenacity of an ornithologist keeping tabs on the vanishing whooping crane . He does this with gusto and affability , as he is at heart a salesman . He talks Temple and its problems constantly . At any public or private gathering to which he is invited , even wedding receptions and teas , he always manages to buttonhole at least a few of his fellow guests and impress them with the importance of Temple to the community . During Johnson 's nine years in the presidency , the university 's enrollment has almost doubled , increasing from 12,790 to 24,273 , and the faculty has grown from 790 to 1140 members . The endowment fund has risen from $250,000 to about $3,000 , - 000 , a small one for what Temple is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging one , nevertheless . Donations for ' expansion , in the same period , have totaled about $5,000,000 . Last year Johnson 's energetic labors brought him down with high blood pressure . After three weeks on a rice diet , he recovered enough to return to his educational chores , not much hampered by his arterial troubles . Since then he has adhered to a special diet which excludes , among other things , salt and cream , and he has cut down his enthusiastic consumption of cigarettes from three packs a day to one and a half . He gets a medical check-up every two weeks , and is required to rest for an hour or two every afternoon . Except when taking his afternoon nap or when tied up with a problem of administration , he goes about town with appalling energy , making new friends for Temple . He travels at a kind of lope , seeming to be well ahead of his clOthes . On an average of more than four nights a week he attends civic dinners , bringing his dinner jacket from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his office . On busy evenings he sometimes makes a circuit of several dinners , taking soup at the first , a main course at the second and dessert at the third . The mere experience of meeting people exhilarates him . " It is an exciting job and an exciting school , and I love both dearly , " he remarked to a visitor one day not long ago , just before tumbling onto an office divan and going promptly to sleep , as his doctor had ordered . - From its earliest days , Temple has kept itself alive and growing through masterful improvisation . It got its start , in embryo , late in the nineteenth century , from the determination of Russell H. Con-well , the pastor of a church in North Philadelphia , to see that higher education  --  then mostly a privilege of the well-to-do  --  was made available to any young person of good character and intelligence who was willing to work for it . Conwell got this idea one evening in 1884 when a young man of the congregation called at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study for the ministry , but lacked the price of a suitable education . Conwell volunteered to tutor him privately if he would return with a few more young men of similar aims , earnestness and financial difficulties . The caller came back within a week with six others , and night classes began in Conwell 's study . As a one-man faculty , Conwell was well qualified . He had entered the ministry at thirty-six after a varied experience as a Civil War soldier , lawyer , journalist and world traveler . He was also an eloquent speaker ; if he had n't been , the educational experiment would have foundered early . Whenever he needed money to keep his experiment alive , Con-well would go on a lecture tour and come back with a husky bank roll . Lecture audiences were partial to one of his talki , Acres of Diamonds , a long-drawn-out homily on the seeking of riches of all kinds in one 's own back yard . Conwell delivered this lecture More than 6000 times , and made several million dollars out of it . Conwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic yield of Acres of Diamonds , as time went on . Four years after it had begun , the project had attracted around 600 tuition-Paying students , some of them candidates for the ministry , others interested in learning stenography , languages and other subjects that would fit them into the business world . From Conwell 's private study the classes had moved into two rented build-'rigs and Conwell had talked several other teachers Into joining in his experiment . In 1888 he obtained a charter for his institution , calling it Temple College . Temple kept expanding and renting buildings and by 1907 , when it got its charter as a university , it Consisted of a college of liberal arts ; schools of theology , medicine , dentistry , law and pharmacy. and a hospital . By 1925 , when Conwell died , aged eighty-Iwo , he had added schools of music , business and Public administration , oral hygiene , teaching and Chiropody . During the regime of his successor as president , Charles E. Beury , a lawyer , Temple built a new medical school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Fine Arts and acquired a country day school in which to give laboratory training to students of Temple 's Teachers College . When Johnson came along as Temple 's third President , in 1941 , he inherited an institution that Sprawled all over the city and the suburbs , and an internally dissident board of trustees . He was able , through earnest persuasion and the appointment of new members , to unify the board . Unifying the widely scattered divisions of the institution has proved to be a much tougher assignment , but with the aid of the telephone , telegrams , letters and faculty convocations , and his own ebullient personality , he has succeeded as well as was possible under the circumstances . And he has given the students , faculty and board of trustees a sense of motion they had lost . One of Johnson 's earlier acts after taking over the presidency was to appoint a provost and charge him with keeping up academic standards . Many of the academic crises , though , have a way of landing ultimately in Johnson 's lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem at Temple . Often a housing problem can be solved , temporarily at least , by renting or buying old houses or business buildings , and remodeling them for classroom use  --  if there is enough money in the till . If there is n't , Johnson resorts to a stratagem not ordinarily recommended in colleges of business administration : he contracts to buy or rent property and then gets money to pay the freight . Like President Conwell , Johnson is a firm believer in the old adage that the Lord will provide . In 1944 , for example , it was suddenly discovered that the school of theology , which , like many Temple departments , had been shifted around several times , faced the prospect of having no place to sit when the fall term began . In Temple 's continuing game of musical chairs , theology had come out the loser . Some of the trustees favored dropping the school . Johnson , recalling that Temple 's origin had been theological , was aghast at the idea . Scanning his real-estate list , he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The congregation was about to move out into the suburbs , and another congregation had already made a bid of $65,000 for the building . Johnson appeared before the church 's board of deacons and , in a masterpiece of persuasion , got the deacons to reject the $65,000 bid and to sell to Temple for $47,000 . To bind the deal , he gave his personal check for $500 and left the meeting carrying a $46,500 4nortgage . On the following Saturday afternoon Johnson played golf , feeling relaxed and enjoying the sun . The course was crowded , and when Johnson 's foursome arrived at the tenth tee it ran into two other foursomes which were waiting for the fairway to be cleared . As is his custom whenever he runs into strangers , Johnson introduced himself all around and managed to get in a few words in behalf of Temple . When he told of his church deal , one of the strangers , a wealthy paper manufacturer , asked him where he expected to get the money for it . " Oh , " Johnson replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say , ' Bob , here 's that $47,000 . ' " Within two weeks the paper manufacturer telephoned Johnson and said that he wanted to be that " nice guy " and was sending a check for the full amount . He apologized for having taken so much time to make up his mind . ( Continued on Page 60 ) WHAT A PRESIDENT THEY PICKED ! ( Continued from Page 19 ) In typical Temple fashion , the school of theology now shares the remodeled church building with a special division of Temple which teaches radio-station operation . While the divinity students upstairs are probing the intricacies of the human soul , radio and speech students in the basement may be delivering sports and news broadcasts in four dummy studios . The pastor 's residence , which was thrown in with the church , is used as a dormitory for coeds . Johnson 's theological-school coup was a fair sample of his most frequently used technique for wangling gifts ; basically , it is a technique of being , as often as possible , where the financial lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen-odd clubs , ranging all the way from the Rotary up to the Union League , and is a board member of a bank , an insurance company and four corporations . He attends club functions and board meetings faithfully , and these are the most profitable fields for his indirect type of salesmanship . By now , almost all of Philadelphia 's fat cats and those that are only slightly emaciated have been exposed to the Johnsonian " poor-man's-university " pitch . Johnson rarely uses the direct approach  --  he has a special administrative department for such orthodox methods of fund raising  --  he merely gets prospective donors to like him , to sympathize with his plight as the head of a university for the masses , and keeps his lightning rods in good shape . Johnson is a highly informal man , and it is difficult for anyone to talk more than five minutes with him without addressing him as " Bob . " His genius for establishing , in practically no time at all , a thoroughly friendly relationship has brought millions of dollars into the Temple cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946 by a skillful execution of what might be termed the financial hidden-hall trick . This crisis involved the school of dentistry and it was set off by a notice from the American Dental Association that the school would lose its approved rating unless it got better quarters and equipment promptly . Its current quarters consisted of several old residences joined together and shared with the school of pharmacy . Johnson consulted his real-estate list once more and fixed his sights on a vacant four-story building a few blocks from the medical school and Temple University Hospital . If he could get it , a dream he had of an integrated medical center would come considerably closer to fruition . Originally the building had housed the Eastern distributing headquarters of a Detroit automobile company . During the war it had functioned as a radar-equipment factory . The lighting was ideal for precision work of any kind and there was plenty of room ; the building had 190,000 square feet of floor space . As the building had reverted after the war to the War Assets Administration , Johnson hastened to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a similar offer , and it took all of Johnson 's informal eloquence to get his own bid accepted . After he had returned to Philadelphia , feeling triumphant , it occurred to him that his bargaining had not been so spectacularly successful as it could have been , and he went back to Washington to work his hidden-ball play , In disposing of war surplus , he argued , the WAA had a policy of giving greatly reduced prices on items , such as microscopes , that were earmarked for scientific or educational purposes . The building he coveted would be used for both purposes . Therefore , he said , Temple ought to get it at a much lower price than it had bid . The Government , agreeing with his line of reasoning , knocked off $700,000 , giving the building to Temple for $300,000 . The problem of paying for all new equipment remained . Johnson appealed to Temple 's dental and pharmacy alumni , and got $250,000 in pledges . He borrowed $200,000 from the university 's trustees and $1,000,000 from an insurance company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and a half miles of partitions were erected . The latest in equipment was installed . Johnson had meanwhile obtained a new dean and had shaken up the faculty . After the accrediting committee of ADA had called for another look , it took the dental school off the probation list and pronounced it fully approved . After its financial worries , Temple 's toughest problems are those of barely ( Continued on Page 62 ) ( Couthmeti from Page 60 ) adequate classroom space and intramural communications . It manages to solve the former by an ingenious and intensive use of the space it has . Few of its odd assortment of buildings are ever idle . When one department is through with a classroom , another one moves in . This goes on from eight in the morning to ten at night . " We never give a classroom seat a chance to cool off , " is the way one faculty member describes it . " And when this policy leaves a substantial number of students still without a place to sit , we rent another house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church or synagogue meeting hall ? any place that will accommodate a teacher and his students . " The intramural-communication hurdle is even tougher . If Temple can be said to have a campus at all , it is the asphalt of North Broad Street , one of the least-lovely thoroughfares since city planners began designing such expansive gestures at civic beauty , only to see them go to pot . It is lined with neon signs , rooming houses , lunch rooms , filling stations , used-car lots and undertaking establishments . Ternple has taken its main stand on and around Broad Street two miles from City Hall . Once a good residential district , it is now a semislum and the local crime rate is high . With the crime rate in mind , Johnson last year bought a wooded eighty-six-acre tract , in the pleasant Chestnut Hill section where he hopes ultimately to move the undergraduate departments . At present the main cluster of academic shrines includes the library , the administration and alumni offices , the colleges of arts and sciences , journalism , theology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another Broad Street cluster , located about two miles north of the first cluster , embraces Temple University Hospital and the schools of medicine , dentistry , pharmacology , nursing and oral hygiene . The law school occupies rented quarters in a downtown office building , and the rest of the divisions are scattered all over the map of Philadelphia and its environs . Only about 15 per cent of the students live in dormitories . The others live at home and commute to and from classes ; these have dubbed themselves " subway divers " ; after class they jump into the subway or board a bus , headed for home or an after-hours job of some kind . Thus campus life , as such , is virtually unknown to the bulk of the students . The same is true of the faculty members , most of whom commute from homes in the suburbs or rural counties of Pennsylvania and New Jersey . As Temple 's chief reason for existing is the subway diver , it can not complain , but the problem of integrating him into the extracurricular program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , is almost insoluble . He tends to build his social life not around the university , but around his home neighborhood , and Philadelphia is strong on neighborhood pride . In the spirit of Founder Conwell , who brought his various schools to areas where the demand for education was greatest , Temple has lately been putting its student organizations on the road . The dramatic society , for example , may rehearse and give a public performance one week in Frankford , another in Upper Darby , another in Bridesburg , another in Roxborough , and so on . Thus the subway diver gets a chance to participate as part of the cast . To bring to faculty members a feeling of joint enterprise , Johnson and his wife entertain his deans at their suburban home on Saturdays throughout the scholastic year . Once each year he gives a dinner and reception at a hotel for the new members of the faculty and their wives , and other faculty couples turn up later for dancing and getting acquainted with the newcomers . Johnson 's passionate feeling for unification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . Occasionally he banquets the janitors , scrubwomen , carpenters , plumbers and elevator operators , and afterward takes them to a play given by the student dramatic society . He has a deep capacity for exhilaration and a knack of exhilarating others . Because of this , and because of the eagerness for learning that the students show , Temple is able to hold many faculty members in the face of better salary offers from other institutions . " The atmosphere of struggle is challenging , " one of the deans remarked the other day , " and the president keeps us all souped up . Personally would n't trade for a quieter post on a beautiful ivy-covered campus . " The dean pointed to a placard on his desk , which stated : " If you are one of those people who like hard work , you 're going to have a hell of a good time here . " " That 's what I mean , " the dean said . Johnson 's own early life was marked by a considerable dose of struggle . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalid , died when Robert was six years old . In time , Mrs. Johnson became engaged to her late husband 's best friend , William B. Birge , who was sales representative in the United Kingdom for a harvester company . When notice of his promotion to European representative reached Birge , he took a brief vacation in Ireland , where he was permanently paralyzed by a tragic accident . Unable to take up the larger job , or any other , he returned to the United States , and he and Mrs. Johnson went through with their wedding and settled in Norwich , Connecticut . Each had a small income and , by pooling their resources , they were able to get by . Robert helped substantially to pay his way through school . At Norwich Academy , where he began his prep education , he organized a small business of selling class and school pennants to prep students all over the state , and made $400 in one year . He shifted to the Taft School , at Watertown , Connecticut , bringing his money-making talent with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year was business manager of the Taft student newspaper . It was a memorable year in the newspaper 's chronically unprofitable career . The paper turned in a profit of $1200 , through Johnson 's exuberant solicitation of advertising . In an amicable division of the profits , one third went to Johnson , another third to the editorial staff , and the rest was kept in reserve for the next year 's staff . Up to that time , Johnson had been torn between the ministry and business as a career . After this and other business successes in prep school , and later at Yale , there was n't much doubt which career would win . Johnson was an impetuous young man , but usually in a practical way , and he had lots of confidence in his future . By the time he was a Yale junior , he was engaged to marry Miss Anna Talcott Rathbone , daughter of a prominent New York lawyer . Toward the end of his junior year , the United States got into the first World War , and Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale campus , went off to Plattsburg , New York , and got a commission . A week before sailing for France he married Miss Rathbone . After taking a course at the French artillery school at Saumur , Johnson was assigned to the 1st Division and he saw a good deal of action as an artilleryman . Following this tour of duty , he was brought back home to instruct in the operation of the French 75 at a firing center near Fort Sill , Oklahoma , and he was still there when the war ended in 1918 . Once again a civilian , Johnson walked the streets of New York for two months , trying to get a foothold in some advertising firm . He finally succeeded , by offering to work for a small firm at no pay for one month , at which point it was agreed that the firm could then put him on the payroll or drop him . The firm liked his work enough to pay him ten dollars a week , and by 1922 his salary had gone up to $110 a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sixty dollars a week to become advertising manager of a then unpromising , and as yet unborn , weekly news magazine which was to be called Time . It made its maiden appearance in 1923 , and inside of five years it was in the black and Johnson was a vice-president of Time , Inc . When the firm , in 193 ' ) , was setting up another new kind of magazine , Fortune , Johnson helped to organize its advertising staff , and he did the same thing in 1936 for the firm 's new picture magazine , Life . The Time , Inc. , empire prospered mightily , and a $2500 investment in its stock , which Johnson made in 1922 on borrowed money , is today worth , roughly , $1,000,000 . In , 1937 , with the pioneering excitement over , Johnson resigned from Time , Inc. , and looked about for a new challenge to his selling and organizing talents . His mother had always urged him to go into some kind of public service , and her words stuck tenaciously in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's leave from Time as public-relief administrator for the state of Pennsylvania , at the request of Democratic Gov . George H. Earle . Johnson 's department was under constant scrutiny by the legislature . He disbursed $204 , - 000,000 of relief money without giving anyone anything to complain about , except some local politicians who were annoyed at his nonpartisan selections for the 14,000 relief-administration jobs throughout the state . One result of Johnson 's close-up experience with the patronage system was a renewal of an old enthusiasm for reducing its influence on the apportionment of government jobs ; he became active in the affairs of the National Civil Service Reform League , serving as its president for two years . He is still active in the organization , and since 1949 has somehow found time to function also as national chairman of The Citizens ' Committee for the Hoover Report , which keeps pushing for reforms recommended by The Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government . On an average of about once a month he calls on ex-President Hoover in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnson had enjoyed his 1935 bout with the Pennsylvania politicos , and for a time afterward thought of running for public office of some kind . A quick look around , though , convinced him that Republicans were out of season , and probably would be for some time . On leaving Time , he set himself up as a management consultant ; and , in order to provide a job for an old friend , he established a magazine for distribution in Manhattan 's plushier hotels , and made his friend the editor . The friend died two years later , but the magazine is still alive and it supplies jobs for about fifteen people . In 1940 , Johnson took another brief fling at politics , this time in behalf of another old friend , Wendell W illkie , who was running for the presidency . He helped to organize , and to keep organized , the turbulent Willkie campaign headquarters , and he did a lot of leg work in soliciting the public support of prominent men for the Republican candidate . Disappointed with , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his management-consultant work , and he was still licking his honorable wounds when , in 1941 , he was tapped for the presidency of Temple University . Three days after he was installed at Temple , Pearl Harbor was attacked and everything went topsy-turvy . In the war 's first year 1600 students dropped out to enter military service , and considerably more than that during the second year . Temple more than recouped its student losses by setting up more than 100 short courses to give special training to war-industry workers ; in four years it trained 25,000 employees of 543 plants . A postwar outgrowth of this work was the founding ofa Community College division , which gives two years of training to high-school graduates in whatever specialties Philadelphia business and industry stand most in need of . The list of courses includes such specialties as dairy technology , packaging and materials-handling in factories ; heating , refrigeration and air conditioning ; electroplating and television ; laundry management , and mortuary operation . Maintaining a high degree of flexibility , Community College shifts its curriculum to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial plant has a sufficient number of prospective students , Community College will send teachers into the factory itself and hold classes there . A stickler for the niceties of public relations , Johnson is especially careful in answering his correspondence , taking care to see that his replies strike just the right note of friendliness . This care has paid off in many ways , most spectacularly in the instance of a letter received in 1945 , postmarked Reno , Nevada . The writer of the fetter was a Dr. Theodore L. Chase , an elderly retired physician . Doctor Chase enclosed a check for $50,000 to start a cancer-research foundation as a memorial to his late wife , who was a Temple medical graduate of the Class of 1909 . Chase himself had been educated , and had practiced , elsewhere , and , up to the time his windfall check had arrived , no one at Temple was aware that he existed . Johnson , being no man to stop at a windfall , relayed his thanks , by telegram , and said that among his fondest desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude personally . To this Doctor Chase replied ? in another letter  --  that he intended visiting his old friends in Philadelphia soon , and would be happy if he could drop in at Temple University Hospital , for which his wife had had the highest praise , and look it over . The hotel-room shortage was severe at the time he arrived and , on Johnson 's invitation , he took a room in the hospital . Chase loved the place , and stayed in the hospital for four years , at which point he died . ? et During his marathon stay at the hospital , Doctor Chase kept showering money gifts on Temple , the total coming to $1,400,000 ? the largest benefaction the university had ever received . The university was also remembered in Doctor Chase 's will , and a member of the Chase family sued to break it , charging undue influence . The suit was settled privately , and on undisclosed terms , a day after it had gone to trial . Johnson reverted to his indirect-salesmanship technique in the case of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years Fels had been financing studies of various kinds , and his pet was the Fels Research Foundation , which was concerned with unlocking the secrets of digestive-tract diseases . He wanted to get the research foundation under the wing of some university , and , with this end in mind , canvassed a number of universities . After a long conference in Johnson 's office , he asked what the president 's politics were . Johnson replied that he was a registered and lifelong Republican . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " Fels , a Democrat , said . " Imagine a Republican being the president of a great people 's univer- ! sity " Johnson took this remark as a disturbing sign , but on a hunch , and flouting the advice of his associates , decided not to pursue the Fels matter any further . The hunch turned out to be right . Two years later Fels decided on Temple . He gave $400,000 for the construction of an extra floor on the medical school to house the research work , and provided an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed unit . He died last year , at ninety , in Temple University Hospital . The latest big crisis to drop on Johnson 's lap was set off last year by a letter from the Association of American Medical Colleges . An examining committee had made a highly glowing report on the Temple medical school in general , but had been critical of the clinical and preclinical facilities available for the proper training of students . It recommended construction , as soon as possible , of a new outpatient department and an extra private wing to the hospital . This meant gathering , from somewhere , $4,500,000 , and doing it in a hurry . It also meant postponing another money campaign Johnson had strongly in mind  --  for the erection of a law-school building ( $300,000 is already in hand for this purpose , via a bequest from a former student to whom Temple had awarded an honorary degree ) . Johnson is now engaged , along with his associates , in campaigning for the medical $4,500,000 . At fifty-six , and still a vigorous devotee of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism and remarkable output of energy . His busy schedule leaves little time for his favorite indoor sport  --  that of playing with his grandchildren . Johnson has two sons , both of whom have followed him into the publishing field ; one is on the editorial staff of a national magazine , the other on the advertising staff of another national magazine . The thrill of the chase for the elusive $4,500,000 really arouses Johnson 's competitive instinct , and he is playing the civic-dinner circuit as he never played it before . " Sometimes , " he said recently , " get tired of broiled chicken , but when I remind myself that Temple will benefit , the chicken tastes like pheasant , and I 'm truly happy to eat it . " The oddest thing about Johnson 's record at Temple is that when he accepted the presidency he made it clear to the trustees that he was no hand at money-raising This probably ranks high among historic understatements.                    @
