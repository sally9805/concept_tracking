IN THE tranquil dusk of early autumn , several thousand citizens stood around the trim green lawn of the Civic Auditorium here while the Texas Air National Guard band played sometimes martial , sometimes lilting , music that added to the festive atmosphere . Ladies stood regally in the still heat beneath heavy fur stoles and chatted pleasantly with handsome , gray-templed men . A young girl remarked to a friend that she had been to the fashion show that afternoon and had never seen such ghastly things in all her life . The band played " Hail , Hail , the Gang 's All Here , " and then a lone gentleman ascended the red , white and blue draped platform and all eyes turned toward him as the music stopped and his voice came over the public-address system in friendly tones of greeting to the audience : ' " Welcome to the first public unveiling of the first Intercontinental Ballistics Missile of the Free World . Dallas can be proud tonight ; all Texas can be proud . . . . " The speaker , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that indeed the whole Southwest was honored on this occasion , not only because Dallas had been chosen as the site of the Air Force Association annual convention , but especially because the affair was to be marked that evening by the unveiling of the Atlas missile . It was appropriate that this historic event was to take place in Dallas , Mr. Schenk said , because this was an air-minded city ; and , as further reason for local pride , there were more Air Force bases in Texas than in any other state in the union . The next event on the program , Mr. Schenk said , would be a performance by the Lackland Air Force Base Drum and Bugle Corps . The audience applauded . A gentleman turned to . a lady beside him and asked , " Do you know what today ' is ? " " The 25th of September , " she said . DAN WAKEFIELD is a staff colttribittor . " Three months till Christmas , " he said . A gentleman in a black flannel suit placed a cigarette in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message : " Barefoot Sanders for Congress . " A dark-haired , nineteen-year-old girl in a dress of white satin and a mink stole was identified by someone as the local young lady who had been chosen by the Air Force Association convention as " Miss Space . " Over the music of the Drum and Bugle Corps came a roar which soon was identified as a " flyover " of " three Tactical Air Command F-101 Voodoo supersonic fighters " just arrived from Bermuda on a record-breaking , non-stop , non-refueling flight known as " Operation Long Leap . " Their arrival signalled the coming of the special motorcade of Cadillacs which brought to the outdoor platform the " group of men who are responsible for developing the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile . " The Texas Air National Guard Band finished playing " Our Team Will Shine Tonight , " and amidst the resounding slams of Cadillac doors , a dozen or so men , some of them in uniform , some in civilian suits , climbed the bunting-draped platform . The men in civilian clothes were identified as members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Force in developing the Atlas . J. V. NASH , of the Industrial Team , explained that twelve years ago , a group of men in the Air Force " dreamed a great dream ? a missile capable of going to distant parts of the earth They coined the word atlas ' . . . . " At the same time , Mr. Nash said , a group of men at North American Aircraft Corporation were " dreaming bold dreams of a missile power plant . " Fortunately , these two groups " joined together to dream this bold dream . " Today , Mr. Nash said ; we stand here " a little nostalgically and look with pleasure at their dream that came true . " The eyes of the audience turned toward the slim , eighty-two-foot object which towered above the Civic by Dan Wakefield Auditorium . There , encased in folds of royal blue taffeta , stood the Atlas . Those in the audience who had read the local evening paper knew that it had been brought to this spot from Los Angeles by the combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oldt Company , at a cost of $75,000 to the United States Air Force . They knew , further , according to the paper 's report , that " . . . As an Air Force spokesman pointed out , it is worth the expense . From Dallas , the whole world will learn more about the ICBM , ' he said . " The historic placement of the Atlas on its base outside the Civic Auditorium , the report went on to say , was engineered by a crane which was operated by J. E. Brockway of 1531 Whispering Trail Street , Dallas . TO PULL the lanyards which would unveil the missile , Mr. Schenk said that there was on hand a captain and a master sergeant from the Strategic Air Command . The lanyards were pulled , assisted by General Thomas White , Chief of Staff of the SAC , who said that the achievement before us was the result of thinking co-ordinated " under our free institutions . " The taffeta slipped and fell , caught on the silver nose of the missile , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of the Atlas to the applause of the audience . Those in the crowd with complimentary tickets then proceeded inside the auditorium to the champagne reception of the Air Power Panorama , staged by the Air Force Association with the help of its Air Force and industrial members . , Negro waiters in white coats bore trays of pink champagne to the hundreds of guests of the Panorama opening . At the Bell System booth , an attractive , blond young lady explained , with pointer and map , in a slow , Dallas drawl , that the Bell Telephone Company had constructed a whole system of emergency circuits which would route calls around " disaster areas " in case of atomic attack on the United States . The NATION " Suppose , " the young lady pleasantly conjectured , " a city is destroyed ? , let 's say by nuclear attack . . .. These green lines on the map are by-pass routes which can get information and calls through even if the city it ordinarily passes through is , entirely destroyed . ? . . Nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite any emergency . " At the G. B. Wiggins Oil and Tool Co. , Inc. , booth , sponsored by the company which makes " Wig-O-Flex " wire connections for missiles , a group of guests had gathered for the " launching " of a model cardboard missile from a special model launching pad . A recorded voice announced the count-down , and then a blast was heard , and the cardboard missile shot into the air and landed on the floor beside one of the ladies who was sipping from her glass of pink champagne . A general cry of delight went up , and one of the ladies commented : " How cute ! " tion , in view of the forthcoming Third World War This war , which will be fought with nuclear weapons , was one of the main topics of discussion throughout the proceedings . The actual date of the outbreak of hostilities was not announced , although there were those who urged that the time be " strategically " postponed . In the words of Lt. Gen. Clarence R. Huebner , Director of Civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the evacuation plans for NeW York City : " . . . We think this plan gives people greater confidence in our ability to win the next war . But we need time to develop these things ? tactical time through warn-mg systems , but strategic time , in holding off the war until we 're ready , by the work of the President and the Secretary of State . " General Huebner explained , with the aid of maps and slides , that in this year 's simulated nuclear attack on New York , an estimated twelve million out of a total of seventeen million people in the target areas of the state died from radiation , and a million more died within thirty days . " We get quite concerned ' about radiation , " General Huebner said . How-'ever , the General stated that if the newest Civil Defense plans are carried out fully in New York State in a nuclear attack , " We do n't all need to die ? we have a better chance of surviving than any other people in the world if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed on his slides the six-point program of New York Civil Defense , from Point One , " Detection Warning , " to Point Six , " Recovery After Attack . " He flashed on the screen the outline for Point Four , which was as follows : IV . Use of warning time for evasive movement a . Duck and Cover b . Take Cover c Go Home d . Evacuation Unfortunately , it is impossible to present here in detail the full scope of General Huebner 's plans , but he ended his talk by saying that " I hope you will take heart with what I have just told you . " The audience applauded warmly . Maj. Gen. John P. Henebry of the Air Force Reserve , serving as master of ceremonies , then thanked the speaker for " throwing light on this serious subject . " Dr. Richard C. Raymond , manager of the Technical Military Planning ' Operation ) of General Electric Company , Santa Barbara , California , was the next speaker . Dr. Raymond pointed out that there was no limit to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a limit to the practicality of preparing for offense . " When you have planned to kill every Russian once there 's no sense in killing , him twice , " he said . " The idea of dropping 100 , - 000 megatons on Russia , for instance , seems to me unrealistic . " The speaker went on to offer a suggestion which had relevance both to the recession and to the defense of the nation in World War III . He suggested that all unemployed workers be put to work digging slit trenches for use as shelters during nuclear attack . The Hon. Dudley C. Sharp , As- , 285 sistant Secretary of the Air Force ( in charge of materiel ) spoke to the Dallas Rotary Club during the convention on other practical business aspects of the Air Force and its preparations . Secretary Sharp pointed out that , " When a commander takes his B-52 off the ground , he becomes in effect the vice president in charge of about eight million dollars worth of property . What percent of the business houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ? " The social highlight of the convention was the Friday night party entitled " The Western Wing-Ding . " The AFA explained to those attending the convention : " We have one little problem we would like to explain and solicit your understanding . Several months ago , we thought it would be most appropriate to give every convention registrant Western outfits . After studying the situation further , it be came apparent that this would be a task that even a Texan would not want to tackle . We finally were able to arrange for a Western hat for each person who registered before the deadline given us by the hat manufacturers . . . . We are sorry that we could not arrange hats for everyone . So that no one will go bareheaded , we have arranged to have hats on sale for $3 each in the drug store at the Statler Hilton and in the check room at the Adolphus Hotel . . . . P.S. : Regarding Western hats ? a Atli ' . al MI 11 : - .11 " ? ? Ili ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had to assume that these persons did not desire hats and therefore none were arranged for them . " THE convention was opened by a reading of the Air Force Association official invocation , led by Father Mulalley and recited , as suggested in the program , by the entire assembly : " Lord , God of Hosts and Father of us all , be with us as we are about 141 to open our national convention . Take out of our hearts all selfishness . May our constant motivation be the ideals and principles expressed in the Preamble of our constitution ? Peace through Airpower . Lord , God of Hosts and Father of us all , may all our deliberations and all our decisions at this convention be in accord with thy Holy will and merit thy continual blessing . Amen . " Let us pray . e.
