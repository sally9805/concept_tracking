THE PARKING PROBLEM <P> FOR many Americans the most worrisome , day-to-day problem is not the Russian menace or Washington politics , but where to park . With U.S. auto registrations topping 50 million-and increasing at a fast rate-more and more cities are banning street parking to speed up traffic . Thus there is an increasing number of motorists to compete for fewer places . Every day ; for example , 260,000 vehicles enter downtown Boston to compete for 82,000 spaces . In Louisville the problem is even worse : 125,000 motorists jockey for 17,600 spaces . Most U.S. cities have ignored the soaring automobile registrations , done little to keep up with the need for new parking space . <P> But the parking problem is getting too big , and too costly , to ignore any longer . The lack of curb space in New York City adds an extra $350 million yearly to deliverymen 's costs . New York 's movie and theater owners estimate that they lose $30 million worth of business every year because patrons can not find places to park . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dairy-route man in a modern truck delivers only 25 cases of milk daily , about 60% of what a route man with a horse and wagon could handle 25 years ago . <P> Parking problems often create more talk than action . In St. Louis some seven public and private groups are debating what to do , but to date have accomplished little . Dallas left the off-street parking job to the parking companies . In four years , they boosted spaces almost 50% , but they still can not keep up with the 270,445 cars that roll into the city every day . The twin problems of parking and downtown traffic are speeding the nation 's flight to the suburbs . <P> To save their downtown sections , some cities have created public authorities to float bonds and build off-street garages . They have also encouraged private garages and parking-lot companies , which have already spent $3.5 billion to create 2,750,000 off-street spaces . With a remarkable burst of civic energy , Chicago tackled its problem in 1952 , accomplished almost overnight what many cities plan to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to pinch retailers , they persuaded the city to order a $50 million emergency program . Beneath a great tract of Grant Park , facing Michigan Avenue 's luxury stores , the city built an underground garage with 2,359 spaces ( rate : $2.40 for 24 hours ) . It cost $8,300,000 , but business is 20% better than expected , and the garage turned a $96,291 profit for the city in its first six months . Chicago also completed five other garages downtown , six in the Englewood shopping area , plans four more ( total capacity of the 16 garages : more than 8,000 cars ) . Said Commissioner of Streets Lloyd Johnson : " Without the parking facilities now operating or under construction , the central business area would be strangled within a few years .
