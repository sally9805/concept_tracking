For the seventh month running , a book called Arthritis and Common Sense ( Witkower Press ; $3.95 ) , by one Dan Dale Alexander , was high on U.S. bestseller lists . It is . sadly misnamed . Alexander is no man of medicine , but a sometime medical technician in the Army ( where he rose to the rank of Pfc. ) who got a Ph.D . from a London diploma mill . Burden of the book ( aside from emphasis on the imagined importance of a full output of ear wax ) : " Arthritis is a deficiency of specific dietary oils . This deficiency results in a ... lack of better-grade lubricating oils for the bodily joints . " The answer to it is just a question of diet , says Alexander . Sample recommendation : " If cereal is eaten at breakfast , be sure that the milk you pour on it is of room temperature . " <P> The truth is that , for generations , medical science has tried every imaginable dietary trick for arthritis and related diseases and found none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission plans to have Alexander up for a hearing next week about his claims and promotion . But the popularity of his book is an accurate reflection of the prevalence of the disease and the despondency of its victims . <P> Sophisticated Arthritis . ' In the U.S. there are 11 million people who have one form or another of the arthritis group of diseases-what grandma called her " rheumatiz , " the genteel called rheumatism , and the pseudo-sophisticated now call arthritis . Each year , more than 300,000 people are made temporarily unemployable for varying periods by rheumatic diseases , and many of them become rheumatic invalids . <P> The American Rheumatism Association lists seven forms of rheumatism , the collective term for all diseases marked by pain or stiffness in the joints , muscles and related structures . In six , arthritis ( inflammation of the joints ) is a symptom . The seventh classification , " nonarticular " ( not involving the joints ) , is a catchall for many of the commonest forms . Of the seven , osteoarthritis and nonarticular rheumatism are the commonest ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rheumatoid arthritis ( 10% to 20% ) is the most crippling . Many patients have more than one form . <P> The one thing that all forms of rheumatism have in common is that they affect connective tissue . Despite its wide occurrence in the body , connective tissue* is still something of a mystery to medical researchers . And because rheumatism is a crippler rather than a killer , and victims drag out their lives undramatically , only meager funds have been allocated for research into its causes and cures . Recently research has been stepped up on a broad front . The result has been dramatic progress in some areas , but disappointingly little in others . The scoreboard : <P> Arthritis Due to Infections . Once a major cause of arthritis , infections by common bacteria ( notably gonorrhea and tuberculosis ) no longer give the rheumatologists much concern . The joint symptoms , like the underlying disease , can be treated swiftly and effectively with such drugs as the sulfas , antibiotics and isoniazid . Can now be cured in nearly every case .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
