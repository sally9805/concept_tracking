One of the unusual features of British public life today is the amount of anti-German feeling now being stirred up . Part of it is political : Nye Bevan and his left-wing Socialists are setting up a hue and cry about " Guns for the Huns " - not bothering , of course , to point out that the Communists have already armed East Germany . In Lord Beaverbrook , the maverick Tory press lord , the Socialists have an unexpected ally . His big Daily Express ( circ. 4,000,000 ) is so het up that it caricatures Chancellor Adenauer as a Mephistopheles surrounded by Junker ( see cut ) , and not content with whatever debatable influence his editorials have , Beaverbrook has been buying up billboard space and ads in rival British papers to further his campaign . <P> The flurry has the Tories worried . Though Clement Attlee and the Labor leadership still endorse West German rearmament , Churchill 's government fears what GUNS FOR THE HUNS might do as an opposition election slogan . Last week the Tory government made its own bumbling contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Assistant Judge Advocate General , is a World War I hero ( he won the Military Cross three times ) who served as senior legal adviser at the British army 's war crimes trials . Ever since , Russell has been convinced that the West is too quickly forgetting Belsen and Buchenwald . In 1951 Russell was sacked from his post as Deputy Judge Advocate General to the British Army of the Rhine after he and Lady Russell tried to drive their car through a procession of German villagers , and got manhandled in the attempt . Shortly afterwards Lord Russell started work on The Scourge of the Swastika , a legalistic account of the gas ovens and crematoria of the concentration camps . As a matter of courtesy , Russell sent the completed man uscript to his boss , 72-year-old Lord Simonds , the Lord High Chancellor . Instead of winning the expected perfunctory approval , his book became the subject of anxious discussion in the British Cabinet . <P> Backed by the nervous Foreign Office , Lord Simonds told Lord Russell that his book was opinionated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would be fired from his 2,200-a-year ( $6,160 ) government job . Angrily , Lord Russell decided to go ahead , " whatever the cost to my career , " and the air was rent with cries of government censorship . Promptly Beaverbrook 's Daily Express proclaimed last week that it would publish daily extracts from " the Book They Tried to Ban . "
