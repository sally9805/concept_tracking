In clouds and swarms , the politicians , pundits and pollsters descended on the Midwest . Not since the great locust plagues of the 1870s had the farm states seen such an invasion : candidates criss crossed one another 's paths , columnists probed and interviewed , and any farmer who had not been polled by the pollsters felt sadly neglected . The consensus at week 's end : Adlai Stevenson has cut into Dwight Eisenhower 's farm strength , but not by enough to win the national election . <P> Democrat Stevenson was leaving no field unplowed in his effort to win the Midwest . Following up his defense of continuing surpluses and his promises of fixed 90%-of-parity price supports made in his major farm speech at Newton . Iowa ( TIME , Oct. 1 ) . he rounded out his case ( see box ) at Oklahoma City , picturing the farmer 's lot under the Republicans in terms of despair and suffering . Then he took off for a trip through the South , but by midweek he was back in Missouri , thence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ill. traveled Dwigtit Eisenhower , having already turned down all suggestions that he try to outpromise Stevenson . If Adlai 's farm-rich home state was turning against Ike ( who carried Illinois by 443,000 in 1952 ) , it could not be seen in the crowds fanking Peoria 's streets four and five deep . That night in Bradley University 's overflowing field house ( seating capacity : 8,300 ) , Eisenhower was interrupted 31 times in 28 minutes by applause while he scorned the Democratic farm program , stood confidently by his own ( see box ) . <P> Nonetheless , from every hamlet and crossroad , pundits pushed the panic button for Republicans after studying the skies ( large parts of Missouri , Colorado , Oklahoma and Iowa , as well as Kansas , are suffering from drought ) and the statistics ( Republicans cringed at an Agriculture Department report last week showing that farm prices had gone down by .5% between mid-August and mid-September ) . Wrote Columnist Stewart Alsop under a What Cheer , Iowa dateline : " Candidate Eisenhower is in deep , deep trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " <P> Interest in Divorce . Some of the pollsters agreed . A squad of New York Times-men , circulating among the crowds at Newton 's National Plowing Contest , came forth with the information that " 10.6% of those who said they voted for General Eisenhower in 1952 now say they will shift in November . ' ' A farmers-only poll in Iowa released this week by Hallaces ' Farmer and Iowa Homestead shows 43% for Stevenson , 35% for Eisenhower , 22% undecided ( in July , the same poll showed Ike 49% . Adlai 32% , undecided 19% ) .
