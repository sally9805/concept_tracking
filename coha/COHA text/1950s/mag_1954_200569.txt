As seems always to be the case on Elizabeth 's great occasions , it was chill , dank and raining as Britain 's 28-year-old Queen returned to England last week for the first time in nearly six months . But not even a generous sample of what all Britons have come to call " the Queen 's weather " could cool the warmth of her welcome . Crowds rivaling those which thronged London for the coronation lined the royal route from Westminster Pier where Elizabeth stepped ashore . <P> All along the Thames-side and along the south coast of England from Cornwall to Kent the night and day before , other eager millions had clustered , to follow the course of Her Majesty 's yacht Britannia . As it steamed slowly toward the Pool of London , it was escorted by warships of the Royal Navy and the greatest flotilla of private craft since Britain 's yachtsmen set forth in a body to rescue the British forces on the beach at Dunkirk . Some fresh from their beds in pajamas and trenchcoats , others stiff with long waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of any moving figure on the yacht 's deck and called excitedly : " There she is ! There she is ! " <P> The Priceless Possession . As the royal yacht moved closer to shore at the river 's mouth , the Queen was more plainly discernible . Like perhaps a thousand or more other mothers on the shore at that precise moment , she was firmly gripping the coat collar of her squirming son to keep him from leaning too perilously over the rail . The cheers that rose at the sight of her familiar , youthful , dignified figure on the Britannia 's deck were tinged with relief and thanksgiving . It is part of the family feeling that characterizes the British attitude toward its monarchy that all Britons feel safer when their sovereign is home in England . During the 174 days during which she had traveled by land , sea and air more than 40,000 miles , Elizabeth 's subjects in Australia , in Ceylon , in the British West Indies , even in tiny Tonga ( TIME , Nov. 30 et seq. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as Britain 's , and that they hoped to see more of her in the future . <P> That was a new idea to many Britons . What had been a titular role , her trip had made real . Said the Economist sternly : " Let the bells , the bands , the saluting cannonade ring over London with no note of jealous possessiveness , no claim that the capital is taking back to itself a priceless possession that has been on loan . . . for it is the other Commonwealth countries which have a right to ask of Britain today that we should not overwork their Queen .
