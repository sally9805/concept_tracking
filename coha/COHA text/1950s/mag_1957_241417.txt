Village bazaars in Bengal and the Punjab were jampacked last week with farm women on a gold-buying spree-gold rings for their noses , gold bracelets for their ankles . In Bombay , betel-nut-chewing brokers in multicolored turbans jammed the city 's bullion exchange , traded up to $50 million worth of gold daily . The nationwide gold rush heralded no sudden influx of wealth to the world 's second most populous nation ; on the contrary , it was proof that even the village folk knew their country was in serious economic difficulties , and that confidence in the Indian rupee was declining daily . <P> After only 16 months , India 's overambitious second five-year plan is coming apart at the seams . In New Delhi dismayed M.P.s were unimpressed when Jawaharlal Nehru tried to dispel their gloom with fine words . " Our difficulties of internal and external finance are the difficulties of a progressing economy , " said Nehru . " They are good **25;18285;TOOLONG of progress and not of stagnation . " <P> <P> Losing Charm . In private , probably not even Pandit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's foreign-exchange reserves ( sterling balance ) , which many Indians now watch as closely as they do cricket scores , stood last week at $906 million ; in another month foreign-exchange reserves will be at the $840 million minimum that the Indian government maintains in London as backing for its currency . <P> Internal finance is drying up too . India 's banks , already 75% lent out , are paying 4.4% for call money , relending funds at 8.5% . Hard-to-get loans are going at a minimum of 12.5% . Inflation is spiraling : prices of industrial raw materials are up 40.8% since 1955 , wholesale food prices up 54.1% from the same date . In the past six months , food prices have jumped 16% , will go higher if Nehru has to yield to demands for wage increases . When workers in India 's nationalized factories clamored for pay rises last week , Nehru snapped : " If these demands persist , nationalization might well lose much of its charm . " <P> In a series of token gestures toward austerity , pomp-loving Indian government officials have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed their salaries 10% . Last week the government was getting ready to nick some 36,000 Indians , including the fabulously wealthy Nizam of Hyderabad ( whose fortune is estimated at somewhere between $200 million and $1.2 billion ) with new wealth taxes . President Prasad did without his private train when he took off on a tour of the south ; he hooked one private car onto the end of a regular express train , took all his 22 aides in with him . Prime Minister Nehru himself was going over plans for a modest ( four bedrooms ) new official residence , which will permit a drastic cut in his present contingent of 200 security officers and will also provide , as Nehru put it , " peace of mind and untold savings on my present electric bill . " <P> <P> " Never Mind . " But none of these gestures were anything more than that , and the country 's top officials knew it . " Never mind austerity , " said Industry Minister Morarji Desai . " Our only answer lies in greater production . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , and at what price ?
