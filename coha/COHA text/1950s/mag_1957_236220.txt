The only notable change of expression that flickered over the bored faces of Hollywood 's stars and officials at the recent Oscar-awarding ceremonies came when the name of Robert Rich was announced as the writer of the year 's best original motion picture story , The Brave One . After a startled pause , eyebrows raised curiously . Who was Robert Rich ? <P> Who , Indeed ? Up to the stage trotted Jesse Lasky Jr. , an officer of the Screen Writers ' Guild . The academy had asked Lasky to pick up Rich 's Oscar after someone claiming he was Rich phoned to say that he had to sit up with his sick wife . But neither Lasky nor anyone else had ever heard of Rich-except Frank King , producer of the award-winning story of a boy whose pet bull is spared in the bull ring because of its gallant fight . King says he knows Rich all right , met him in Europe in 1952 and bought a " five-or six-page treatment " of the story . Where is Rich now ? " In Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him now . He 's around 34 , and he wears a goatee . " <P> King 's story left Hollywood profoundly unconvinced . Last week nearly everyone in the colony was gleefully playing a slapstick guessing game about King 's goateed friend . Oddly enough , King has a nephew named Robert Rich who has occasionally worked around the studio . But this Rich , now an accountant , has truculently denied that he wrote the story . <P> Before the guessing game started , Producer King and his two brothers were tagged with a $750,000 piracy suit by the Nassour brothers , independent film producers , who charged that The Brave One was lifted from a story they have been animating for the last four years . Nassour 's screenplay was done by Paul Rader , 33 , now a Boston television producer , who adapted a script written by Willis O'Brien , the Hollywood special-effects man who put the chill into oldtime movies , e.g. , King Kong . After the Oscar-awarding show , Rader got a wooden Oscar from his co-workers bearing the inscription : " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Said Rader : " I 'm convinced that it The Brave Owe came from my script . " ( The Nassour brothers claim their suit was recently settled out of court . ) <P> Hurrah for Them ! Other movie folk also thought they detected a familiar ring in The Brave One . Director Fred Zinnemann recalled that the late documentary pioneer Robert Flaherty ( Nanook of the North ) had told him in 1931 of a similar story he wanted to shoot . Flaherty later sold the idea to Orson Welles , who produced an unfinished version of the story for RKO called My Friend Bonito . In her Vermont home , Mrs. Frances Flaherty has no thought of suing anyone . " I would n't think about protesting that award , " she says , " but I 'm highly amused by the whole situation . " Welles is even more delighted with the flap . " If they the King brothers used a lot of our stuff and it worked , " he chuckles , " hurrah for them ! "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
