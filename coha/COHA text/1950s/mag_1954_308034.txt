Ken Nordine is a fortunate fellow who enjoys double rewards for living a double life . Over national TV hookups , as a smooth-talking pitchman for deodorants , detergents and such ( Stopette , Pamper Shampoo , Tunis ) , he earns , he figures , about $80,000 a year . But Nordine has his real fun and finds his real fans on his own show , which pays him practically nothing . <P> Chapter &; Verse . Once a week , over WNBQ in Chicago , tall , hollow-cheeked Ken Nordine recites poetry to a late evening audience . Perched on a stool , with a stepladder full of books beside him , the 34-year-old lowan reads earnestly in a subdued , husky voice , glancing from page to camera like a casual host reading to guests in his library . What distinguishes Nordine 's shows from others like it is the flashing telephone by his side . He has adapted the disk jockey 's request-format for poetry and made it work . When he finishes a poem , he picks up the telephone , listens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk while he leafs through his library to find the poem or passage wanted . Now for Nordine is broadcast after peak viewing hours , yet hundreds of listeners try to phone in every week . Those who fail to get through send in requests by mail . Last week he read , by request : Alexander Pope 's " Ode on Solitude , " Robert Frost 's " Mending Wall , " Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's " How Do I Love Thee ? " , Carl Sandburg 's " Clean Curtains , " I Corinthians 13 . <P> Although Now for Nordine is only a few weeks old , Nordine himself is no stranger to experimental television . For more than a year he has been frightening and delighting Chicago audiences with eerie readings of classic horror tales such as Poe 's Pit and the Pendulum , Lovecraft 's Rats in the Walls . He calls this show Faces in the Window , plays weird music as he reads and scares his listeners with a bagful of simple but effective tricks . For a story where a man is hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest a corpse swinging on a rope . Trick lights and a turtleneck sweater make his cadaverous face appear to float in air , and sometimes a zoomar lens moves in until only one glittering Nordine eye fills up the television screen . <P> The Big Money . Nordine keeps his programs simple because he has no time to rehearse . Each week he records commercials for more than a dozen radio and TV sponsors , acts on soap operas , announces local shows , narrates for Chicago 's growing TV film industry . <P> Nordine 's own shows are unsponsored , but he has no intention of making them slick enough to sell . Says he : " Television tries to show off too much . I just want to sit down with people and read poetry . " On the practical side , he also wants to stay in Chicago and keep on reading commercials . Thanks to tape recording , he can get his slice of the big-money network shows that originate on the East and West coasts .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
