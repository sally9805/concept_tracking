In a gloomy house in the Hungarian village of Felsopeteny , 45 miles northwest of Budapest , Josef Cardinal Mindszenty , free from prison these 15 months but not a free man , sat alone at dinner . People in the area knew the house as an atomic-research station of some mysterious sort : that was the explanation the Communists had given for the heavy armed guard that surrounded it . Mindszenty 's guards paced about uneasily , and a Russian tank stood near by . Suddenly , out of the darkness a small band of young revolutionaries appeared , brandishing machine guns . Before their gun barrels , Mindszenty 's guards quickly surrendered . The liberators broke in upon the surprised cardinal . With tear-filled eyes he said : " You are good Hungarian boys . " <P> Thus , almost eight years after his trial and imprisonment on trumped-up treason charges , Cardinal Mindszenty , 64 , Prince Primate of all Hungary and most famed prelate of the " Silent Church , " last week came forth to freedom-a freedom that might prove tragically short-lived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jailers had moved him from prison to prison to mislead possible rescuers . He was guarded by a cordon of political policemen , policewomen , police dogs and , lately , Russian tanks . During those years , the Communists strove with all their might to destroy the faith of Eastern Europe 's 60 million Catholics . As Mindszenty went free , their failure was obvious to the world : the Church of Silence now spoke out with undimmed vigor . <P> <P> Blessed Weapons . Mindszenty 's rescuers whisked him to a nearby military barracks , where everyone broke out wine to celebrate his release . Early the next morning three armored vehicles escorted the cardinal over the battle-torn road to Budapest . In towns and villages along the way , people threw flowers before his car . The new Nagy government declared that the cardinal 's trial and imprisonment had been entirely illegal , that his ecclesiastical rights as Primate of Hungary were restored . Before a cheering crowd at his palace , Mindszenty appeared , a small Hungarian tricolor pinned to his cassock . His ordeal had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey than Hungarians remembered him , but his eyes were bright and alert .

" I trust that the glory acquired by Hungarian weapons will become greater yet should the need arise . ' He was bitter about the West . " A thing which no one in the world , not even the big powers , dared to do , was done by small and forlorn Hungary . Our people started the fight for their faith in their country . The Hungarian people are waiting for the world , especially the big powers , whose business it should have been to handle this affair , to stand up in action . " <P> Four days later events gave terrible point to his words . It was the Russians who " stood up in action , " sweeping into Hungary with the full , brutal weight oi their armor .
