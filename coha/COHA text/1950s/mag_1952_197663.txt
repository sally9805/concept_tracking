Night fell and lights were snapped on in the big , modernistic debating hall of West Germany 's Bundestag . Wearily and warily the Bundestag debated the most important decision in its brief history-a vote on the treaties which will end the occupation , in exchange for a West German promise to rearm . <P> From the rostrum spoke the dry , spare , 76-year-old Chancellor , Konrad Adenauer . Ordinarily icy and unemotional , Adenauer summoned up all the passion and eloquence he could muster . " It is the fateful hour of Germany ! " he cried . " We are at the crossroads of slavery and freedom . . . A vote of ' no ' on these treaties means ' yes ' to Stalin . . . Germany 's position is more exposed than ever before in her history . Germany is divided and torn , disarmed and defenseless She is overshadowed by a colossus that is trying to enslave and swallow her . " <P> After Adenauer had spoken , the required " second reading " of the treaty bill , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even opposition deputies conceded that the Chancellor had it in the bag . <P> Next day , to everyone 's surprise , Adenauer , the man who had appealed so urgently for fast action , discomfited his supporters and confused his opposition by announcing postponement of the final ratification vote . He wanted to wait , he said , until the Federal Constitutional Court can rule on the constitutionality of a simple majority vote on the treaties-a power the Socialist opposition has long challenged . The court 's deliberation will probably take about a month . <P> The maneuver threw the Bundestag into an uproar . Adenauer coldly demanded that the deputies proceed with the second reading and thus demonstrate their good faith to the Allies . After two stormy days , with the speaker 's brass handbell jangling almost constantly to bring order , the house obliged . Chubby Erich Ollenhauer , successor to the late Kurt Schumacher as leader of the Socialists , angrily urged the Chancellor to abandon his " teenage enthusiasm for European unity " and start working for the interests of Germany . The Chancellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take as a matter of course the handsome 50-vote majority with which his treaty proposals passed their second reading . <P> Confident that West Germany had thereby made its " political decision " to rearm and join the Western Allies , Chancellor Adenauer sat back confidently to await what he assumed would be an equally approving court decision .
