Perhaps you have seen the first few chapters of Crusade in the Pacific on your television set . This MARCH OF TIME documentary is the most comprehensive project of its kind in terms of resources used as well as length and scope of the final film . Its subject , the Pacific war from its opening guns in 1931 to its explosive aftermath in late 1951 , is man 's most concerted struggle over huge areas of land and water . <P> The new 26-chapter series sprang from the success of Crusade in Europe , which you probably remember as the film based on General Eisenhower 's book . Now being shown for the fourth time in some U.S. cities , Crusade in Europe proved the country 's appetite for serious TV documentaries , a taste soundly confirmed by TIME-sponsored telecasts of Kefauver hearings , and by Your Stake in Japan , TIME 'S joint CBS-ABC network program last week on the Japanese peace treaty . <P> Like the vast and on-going war it covers , Crusade in the Pacific differs considerably from its predecessor . The Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander Eisenhower , whose quarterbacking story set the pattern for Crusade in Europe . In the Pacific war , the Marine , Navy , Army and Air outfits fought under various separate and shifting commands that sometimes passed the ball to each other , more often starred individually in sallies against the enemy . Even today , MOT 's research staff often has to dig long and well to resolve hard-held disagreement over the strategy used by Admiral Nimitz ' fleets , General MacArthur 's forces , or the various commanders in China , Burma and India . Working only a few weeks ahead of telecast dates , the scripters and editors are pulling together the story of the five years of restless peace since V-J day , will do the final chapters on the Korean war from the news being made each week by U.N . soldiers and negotiators . MOT runs a sort of celluloid race with history , for each chapter of the past struggle reflects and forecasts the events now making headlines . <P> One of the three key men for Crusade is Jack Bush , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together from film shot by combat photographers of six nations , enemy and friendly , in history 's best-photographed war . For a look at this work , I recently dropped by Jack 's editing room to find him barricaded behind some 10,000 feet of film for the twelfth chapter , " The War at Sea . " As he flicked the knob of his film viewer , I saw a periscope 's view of a torpedo-blasted Japanese ship . Another strip showed another side of the submariner 's life-a U.S. jazz trio playing a jam session 150 feet under the sea . He showed me many other interesting strips-a Navy plane 's gun-camera record of dive-bombing a Japanese ship and an enemy ship 's movie of a U.S. Navy plane attacking . <P> Jack works with Assistant Producer Fred Feldkamp , scripter on both Crusade pictures , * who freshened up his knowledge of the Pacific theater on a trip to Tokyo for talks with surviving enemy foot soldiers and officers . In one interview , he found that the Japanese ex-officer , with whom he was talking , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Feldkamp , a World War II Marine Corps combat correspondent had been crouching in a hole ducking the fragments .
