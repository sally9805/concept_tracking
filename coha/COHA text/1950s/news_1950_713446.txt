txt More than 400 buildings in Chi cago 's downtown business district will be surveyed during the next few weeks to determine how many have basements suitable for air raid shelters , it was revealed yesterday by Lyndon H. Lesch , air raid shelter chairman of the Chicago civil defense committee . Lesch said at a meeting of his committee yesterday that downtown buildings , in order to fulfill minimum requirements for shelters , must be fireproof , have a basement floor immediately below ground level so there is no danger of flooding , have two entrances at least , be sufficiently large to provide six square feet of space for a sizable number of persons , and use a minimum of- outside air to reduce the danger of radioactivity . Buildings to be surveyed include department stores , large office structures , railroad buildings , federal buildings , hotels , and the city hall and county building .
