Bishop Angel Herrera of Malaga is one of the few men unafraid to speak out in Franco 's Spain . Last week in a pastoral letter published in Madrid 's Catholic daily Ya , the bishop said : " There is in the conscience of Spain a great lack . . . We have created a type of Christianity poor in social virtues . The lack of justice and , to a great extent , of mercy , maintains a system of sharing the national wealth which gives to a minority the great bulk of our income and keeps the multitude in poverty . <P> " Our upper classes ... do not realize the daily scandal which they present to the nation . They do not have the remotest idea of the atmosphere which their insensitive conduct foments in factories , in the fields , in the university and in professional circles . " The bishop may have had in mind the secret government poll taken recently at the University of Madrid , which showed 60% of the students against the regime ( TIME , Jan. 16 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
