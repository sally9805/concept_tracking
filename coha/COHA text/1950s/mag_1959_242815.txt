THE news , like a great river , gathers its unity and strength and direction from the tributaries of seemingly separate events . It is TIME 'S weekly purpose not only to follow those tributaries from their sources in the past but to show and give them meaning at their confluence in contemporary history . <P> Last week , in the wake of President Eisenhower 's trip to Western Europe and on the eve of Nikita Khrushchev 's visit to the U.S. , historic events were in full flood , political leaders and diplomats rode a crest of world interest and hope . TIME describes those events - and relates them the one to the others and the parts to the whole . <P> Yet the mainstream of news consists not only of the efforts and activities of statesmen . Indeed , such efforts and activities can be supported only by the currents of thought and culture springing from man 's mind . This week TIME 'S cover subject , British Sculptor Henry Moore , provides a significant case in point . <P> The course of Moore 's art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has run across shallows and been slowed-but never stopped . And after each stagnant period it has moved again in full flow . In ancient Rome the statuary was a way of life , as much a part of the city as the humans who walked the streets . That way of life seemed ended when the barbaric Goths came pillaging , leaving behind them ruins of Roman art . But the Goths themselves , even while deriving from the Romans , gave their name to an art form that took its own place in the cultural current . Henry Moore draws from this past , as from the past of the savage idol carvers of Africa , Central America and the South Seas . But he has also moved beyond the past , and in so doing he is the representative of a group of brilliant moderns who have led the way to the greatest resurgence of sculpture since the Renaissance-see ART COVER , Maker of Images . <P> *WHAT British political party has won the most national elections ? <P> The fewest ? What Prime Minister served the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that British elections would be held Oct. 8. copies of TIME 'S " General-Election Argument Settler , " a handy reference wheel with the answers to these and 250 other questions about 31 elections and 23 Prime Ministers since the parliamentary-reform bill of 1832 , were distributed to government officials , party headquarters , university political clubs , educators , libraries , and other groups throughout the British Commonwealth . TIME previously distributed its " Argument Settler " for the 1956 U.S. elections and the 1957 Canadian elections , hopes the 1959 British wheel will be as successful as the others in providing useful information and in resolving the disputes that arise during national campaigns . <P> <P> - Answers : 1 ) the Liberal Party , with 14 wins . 2 ) the Labor Party , with four . 3 ) Herbert H. Asquith ( 1908-1916 ) .
