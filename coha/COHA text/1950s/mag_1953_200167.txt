In race after race , Jockey Eddie Arcaro had seen the big grey colt pound in ahead of his own mounts . A month ago , Arcaro 's sour grapes-a rare item with him-ripened to wrath . Said he : " All Native Dancer has done is go around beating the same horses , and most of the time carrying equal weight . . . Would you call him a great horse ? " <P> Then , last week , Native Dancer 's regular jockey , Eric Guerin , drew a ten-day suspension for a foul committed when he was riding another horse in the Saratoga Special . A man with sound judgment and a sense of humor , Owner Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt picked Eddie to ride the Dancer in last week 's $112,600 American Derby at Washington Park , near Chicago . Arcaro took the horse on a trial spin . Allowed Eddie : " He 's a big , powerful animal . " <P> At last the day came , and the greatest U.S. jockey and the greatest U.S. three-year-old raced together . With Native Dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no show betting , fearful that the heavy betting on the Dancer would force the track to cough up , for the minimum payoff , more money than was bet . This goaded the New York Herald Tribune 's Red Smith into some sharp comment : " The sturdy old American virtues of avarice , stupidity and parsimony , qualities that have won for racetrack operators the warm affections which the public ordinarily reserves for pawnbrokers and dogcatchers , were gloriously exemplified . . . " <P> Naturally , Native Dancer , Arcaro up , romped off with his 18th victory in 19 starts , jetting to the fore in the stretch , as usual , to beat James C. Brady 's Landlocked by two lengths . He carried 128 lbs. , top weight of his career , against 120 lbs . for Landlocked and less for the rest of the field . His time for the mile-and-a-furlong : 1:48 2/8 , only one-fifth second off the track mark . The winner 's purse : $66,500 . Although Citation was still the " alltime great " to Eddie Arcaro , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about everything they say . "
