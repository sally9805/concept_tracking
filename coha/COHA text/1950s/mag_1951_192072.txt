Before &; after the Yale-Harvard boat race at New London last year , a professional-looking fellow stepped up to each member of the Harvard crew , including the coxswain , pricked the lobe of one ear and drew a single drop of blood . He was Dr. Albert E. Renold , research fellow at Harvard Medical School , popularly known to the boys as Dr. Vampire . <P> No vampire , Renold was one of a team which was testing the oarsmen 's reactions to stress . Dr. George W. Thorn ( TIME , May 21 ) acted on the theory that in a normal , healthy reaction to physical or emotional stress the adrenal cortex is stimulated . It then puts out more hormones , which ( among other effects ) cut down the number of eosinophils ( a type of white cell ) circulating in the blood . Thus a series of before &; after eosinophil counts might show whether a man 's reaction to stress is normal . <P> Renold took random samples when there was no stress , got an average eosinophil index of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oarsmen 's eosinophil average dropped to 19 . When the day of the Yale race came , the counts were down to an average of 64 before anybody had lifted an oar . The coxswain 's was down to 33 . <P> It was a grueling race over four miles ; Harvard won in the last seconds by a quarter of a length . The eosinophil average at race 's end : three for both oarsmen and cox . Harvard Coach Tom Bolles ' own eosinophil drop : from 101 before the race to six after . <P> A crew of Harvard scrubs provided an interesting comparison : the rowers were nervous before the race , with a count of only 42 , but they led the Yale scrubs easily all the way , won by six lengths , and had a relaxed after-race count of 59 . <P> By the Thorn thesis , all the Harvard-men showed a " healthy " response to stress ; eosinophil counts showed a drop proportionate to exhaustion . If an exhausted man 's count had failed to show a drop of 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that the adrenal cortex was not producing the extra hormones which the body demands under stress . <P> The Harvard testers believe that their technique can be adapted to measure a man 's aptitude for dangerous , " stressful " assignments of many kinds , e.g. , commando duty . Men who become exhausted after a rugged route march , but without a proportionate eosinophil drop , would be eliminated as dangerously hormone poor . <P> The Harvard experimenters , reporting their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine , conclude : " We wish to express our appreciation of the good-humored cooperation of the Harvard crews .
