txt Soviet fliers Honored Scandinavian fishing boats have been picked up when less than 13 miles offshore . Consequently , it is easy to imagine that as an unfortunate naval aircraft , off course on a routine training flight , approached the vicinity of Libau ? spotted well in advance on the Soviet radar screen ? the Russians ordered up their fighter planes . And the Russian fighters undoubtedly ordered the American aircraft to land , and when it refused , shot it down in accordance with routine orders . This week 's award of order of the Red Banner to four Soviet airmen could be a coincidence , but may well indicate Moscow 's endorsement of the Soviet fighter pilots ' behavior . Suppose the Russians have behaved oppositely  --  had courteously waved the American plane back onto its proper course . If the incident had become known at all , the world would have hailed it as further evidence of a new Soviet policy , of courting of the West by Russia . Super Secrecy Stressed But it obviously serves the Soviet propaganda book better today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its military coastlines as a kind of forbidden Tibet which strangers approach at their own peril . It suits traditional Russian se cretiveness. now expanded into a pseudo-exact science by Communist technicians  --  to discourage all forms of contact with the Soviet Union or its satellites which could ( a ) provoke unfavorable comparisons between Russia and the West and ( b ) lead to the slightest disclosure of military or even economic information in the Soviet orbit . Supersecrecy , and this failure to accord assistance to an airplane in distress , may seem like reversion to a darker age . It may be , as Hugh T ast , principal of Brasenose College , Oxford , declared April 13 , that " the century in which we live is the first for over 2,000 years to see a considered challenge flung down to the essence of our civilization . Of course , no nation likes to have its military installations spied upon . And there is not the slightest doubt that , even as Moscow-ordered Communists have sought to ferret out American military and atomic secrets , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sought wherever possible to assess the extent and efficiency of Soviet forces , arsenals , and bases along the Baltic and even behind the Ura Is . But Russian reaction in the present Baltic mystery is a calculated step beyond the usual antiespionage precautions of nations . Now , assuming the United States maintains its restraint , even as it did when Yugoslavia shot down an American C-47 back- in 1946 , where does the incident leave matters ? This much is evident : 1 . Russia has used the incident to attempt to discourage the United States from flying around the Baltic area , which the United States from its German bases and under the Atlantic Treaty has the right to do . The United States will not thus discourage , but from here on pilots will be doubly careful to give the Baltic states a wide berth when putting in flying time . Good Tivity , Practice ' 2 . Simultaneously , the United States obviously has utilized the search for the lost aircraft as an opportunity to get in some good flying practice over the Baltic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which began as soon as the search was instituted and well before the Soviet note , shows how sensitive the Soviet is to these flights close to its Baltic security zone . 3 . Denmark and Norway have been heartened by the quick arrival of American planes for the sea search , but have been chilled by t .. be fuss made by Moscow . Sweden , carefully watched by Moscow , has made its expected gesture of strict neutrality by protesting American flights over a Swedish naval base . Russia has given one more evidence that its general attitude has firmed since the days just a little more than a year ago when a Soviet marshal made a quick apology for a Soviet-caused air accident on the Berlin airlift . Yet this is no reason for surprise or dismay . The Turks have an ancient . saying that every day they become a little more Turkish . Until something reverses the wheels and the pressures at Moscow , Russan policy is likely to become a little more Russian every day .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
