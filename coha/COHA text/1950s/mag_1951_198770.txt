The cost of living , as of mid-July , was up a barely perceptible .2% over the previous month . But this creeping change , announced last week , had a supercharged effect . <P> Millions of workers promptly took their place in line for wage boosts . Under their escalator contracts , 1,000,000 auto workers are due for an immediate 1-an-hour rise . Some 2,000,000 other industrial workers under other escalator contracts may get increases within a few weeks . And under the Wage Stabilization Board 's new policy of tying all wages to the cost of living , some 60 million other U.S. workers will also have claims to higher wages . To meet the inflationary pressures , some of which were of the Administration 's own making , President Truman last week sent a message to Congress demanding repeal of three sections of the Defense Production Act , which he had signed under protest . The three sections which did " the greatest damage to price controls , " he said , were : the Capehart amendment , allowing manufacturers to add increased costs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge the same percentage markups as before Korea , and the Butler-Hope amendment , banning slaughtering quotas in the meat business . Those amendments , said the President , may cost consumers " billions and billions of dollars . " <P> What gave the President 's message a hollow and political ring was a fact he notably failed to mention : wages and farm prices , just as much as manufacturers ' prices , need sterner control . <P> Three Republican Senators , Ferguson ( Mich . ) , Nixon ( Calif. ) and Welker ( Idaho ) , promptly introduced a bill to give the President exactly what he asked . Said Ferguson : " We have in the past found numerous instances of the Executive 's failure to enforce laws because they were not in harmony with the opinion of the President . " Said Nixon : " The purpose of our bill is to give him the power which he says he needs . " Ohio 's Republican Bricker asked : " Has the Senator any idea that the President would enforce any law the Congress might pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great doubt .. . " <P> " So this the Truman message is simply a cheap political trick , " said Bricker , " to try to put the blame upon the Congress . " <P> The Republicans were not serious about their bill . " But , " explained Nixon , " we did n't think the President was serious either . "
