The pleasure-boat industry climbed over the $1 billion mark for the first time in 1954 . Last week , as boatbuilders opened the biggest national Motor Boat Show in history , the outlook for 1955 was even better . On opening night alone , some 25,000 fans jammed into New York City 's Kingsbridge Armory to see 380 boats and thousands of gadgets from 233 exhibitors . <P> The biggest boat in the show was a 51-ft . Wheeler cruiser with twin 200-h.p. diesels , a complete electric galley , two showers , and staterooms for eight . It was sold for $88,000 to John Sparler of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , a paper executive . The flashiest boat was Century Boat Co. ' s chrome-trimmed , 55-m.p.h . Coronado speedboat , with wrap-around windshield and a 285-h.p . Cadillac V-8 engine . Ten minutes after the doors opened , Radu Irimescu , onetime Rumanian Minister to the U.S. , who now works for Floyd Odium 's Atlas Corp. , snapped it up for about $5,500 . <P> Outboard &; Inboard . But the heaviest buying was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility runabouts . Despite increasing costs , boatmakers have held prices to last year 's level , and the show had something for every bankroll . Besides the inboard cruisers , twelve boatyards showed off new , inexpensive , outboard cabin cruisers at prices between $1,300 and $2,500 . The cruisers , up to 23 ft. long , can sleep two , do 20 m.p.h. with two motors on the stern . For penny-pinching do-it-yourselfers , who knocked together 30% of the 300,000 pleasure boats built in the U.S. last year , there are 400 complete boat kits to make everything from 8-ft. prams to 23-ft. cruisers at about 50% less than the same boat would cost readymade . <P> Many of the new outboards had electric starters and mufflers and vibration-free mountings that sharply cut their noise . Evinrude has a new tilt-compensator that keeps the engine from bouncing against the back of the boat when the power is cut suddenly . Scott-Atwater has equipped all its engines , from 5 h.p. to 30 h.p. , with its Bail-a-matic device , which bails the boat automatically as long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For sailboat skippers , the biggest eye-catcher was Luders Marine Construction Co. ' s racy 40-ft. sloop , made from molded mahogany plywood , the biggest molded plywood hull yet made . Price : $38,500 . For cruising yachtsmen , both power and sail , the electronics industry had some new gadgets . Both RCA and Raytheon displayed new lightweight radar and sonar sets that could search out schools of fish as well as tell the precise depth of the water . Bendix even has a radar set for close-in navigating that shows objects as near as 25 ft . <P> Prices on the new radar sets were as low as $3,200 ( sonar : $475 ) , still too steep for the average yachtsman . But with 4,500,000 U.S. boat owners on the waterways in 1954 , there was hope that mass production for the mass market would eventually permit boat owners to navigate anywhere in any weather , with almost as many beeping , pinging gadgets on their craft as on the Queen Mary .                 @ @ @ @
