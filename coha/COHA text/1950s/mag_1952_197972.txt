Among the bleak , soot-smudged buildings in Paris ' Malakoff suburb , one small factory shines out like a beacon . Its neat brick walls are covered with vines ; the windows are immaculately clean . Inside the red iron gate there is a courtyard filled with bronze statues . Plump Renoir and Maillol nudes stand side by side with muscular Bourdelle torsos , Rodin figures , and a host of lesserworks . On most of the statues , two names are inscribed . The first is the sculptor 's ; the second is that of the man who turned it into bronze , Eugene Rudier , the foundry 's 74-year-old owner and the last of the world 's great maitres jondeurs . <P> For half a century the white-bearded old master has stood unchallenged at the peak of his art . Every sculptor who could afford his stiff prices ( $9,000 nowadays for a life-size figure ) sent his work to Rudier . Maillol , Renoir , Bourdelle were all his clients ; Rodin would have no other caster . Today , such outstanding European moderns as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zadkine are on his list . An expert explains why : " Rudier is unique . He is an artist . He produces a grain and patina almost like human skin . The bronze seems alive . " <P> Gold for the Rich . Rudier learned his delicate touch as a boy . His father was a Paris goldsmith who taught him to cast elaborate table pieces for the rich . Rudier wanted a wider medium . At 19 , he set up shop for himself and began casting statues in bronze . Soon he had a small but devoted following-and an introduction to the great Auguste Rodin . <P> " Rodin , " recalls the maitre , " was not particularly friendly . He asked me a few questions and then handed me a bust-by another sculptor . " Rudier worked long hours forming the mold of sand , tapping , carving and measuring it to exact proportions , finally cast the sculpture in a single piece of bronze . " When I returned with the finished product , Rodin looked at it for a long time and caressed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " But from that moment on , until the sculptor 's death in 1917 , Rudier was the only caster allowed to touch a Rodin statue . <P> The orders piled up , but Rudier played no favorites ; everyone got the same painstaking effort . The only favoritism he allowed himself was in the works he chose for his country home outside Paris and the figures lining his tiny gallery at Malakoff . There he collected such masterpieces as Maillol 's Summer , Renoir 's Laundress , Bourdelle 's Heracles Archer , Rodin 's John the Baptist . About 20 years ago , he cast a beautiful bronze of Rodin 's L'Ombre , and ordered it set aside to mark his grave when he dies . <P> Work for the Team . Rudier long did most of the actual casting himself , but as his fame spread beyond France , he began training a team of assistants . He taught them his secrets , but none could quite duplicate his touch . Whenever business slacked off , Rudier &; Co. made metal castings for French industry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rudier would cast cannon balls if necessary . "
