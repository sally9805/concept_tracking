The fear and resentment which defeated peoples feel toward armies of occupation was softened in southwest Germany by the exemplary behavior of the First French Army . In the sleepy little towns of the Black Forest , French soldiers participated in local affairs and shone at local balls , and the French commanders were among the most respected of inhabitants . " We prefer them to German soldiers , " said a townsman . <P> But the crisis in North Africa not only led France to pull out of Germany the troops pledged to NATO , but compelled it to send Frenchmen to put out the fire . Recently France pulled out some of her crack First Army regiments , replacing them with the first of some 2,000 Moroccan troops . <P> The sight of dark Moslem soldiers in their quiet streets last week bitterly reminded Germans of the Moroccans who took part in the 1919-30 occupation of the Rhineland ( which Hitler called a plot against the purity of Germany ) , and of those who raped the Black Forest villages during World War II , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women believe , whether or not it is true , that in those days one Moroccan raped a fraulein , then killed her by biting through her jugular vein . The French deny that Moroccans committed more rape than any other troops , but they are sole possessors of the statistics , and do not release them . Protested much-respected French Colonel Pierre Charton : " The Moroccan soldier is exceptionally well disciplined . . . But you must always keep a certain distance . " The French offered to import enough Moroccan camp followers to keep the Moroccans happy on the base , but this Gallic solution did not satisfy the Germans . County Administrative Officer Robert Lienhart led the outcry : " What kind of sovereignty is this when we have nothing to say , indeed are not even consulted , about foreign troops stationed in our midst ? " West German newspapers headlined the story , demanded the withdrawal of the " Roccos . " The German Foreign Office complained to the French government , which shrugged that it had no other troops to spare .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
