The Old Strife at Plant 's Joyce Cary This tale , in which an old woman relates the story of how she made her life , partly by instinct , partly by guile ; and an artist composes , in his mind , various versions of a picture out of given intuitions , was originally a chapter from a book of mine called The Horse 's Mouth . It was one of the earliest written , and it was designed , like chapters thirteen and twenty-six of the same book , as an experiment to discover if and how certain movements and relations of the theme could be expressed . Two of the characters , Gulley Jimson and Plant , are still in the book . The first is the artist down on his luck , but still working ; the other is a friend of his , a cobbler , and something of an evangelical anarchist , who hold.s occasional uplift meetings in his basement . The scene is this basement at such a meeting ; and it is seen through Gulley Jimson 's eyes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assembled . Then it was cut out for three chief reasons : because it brought in a new character , the old woman , when the book had already all the characters it needed ; because it had not enough about one leading character , Sara Monday , who was needed ; and because the old woman 's story was a closed story . What I mean by a closed story is an anecdote complete in itself . Such an anecdote in any novel is like a knot in a deck-plank , a snag in a brook ; it spoils the run of the grain , the current 's flow . So the old woman was put out and Sara brought in . But my wife , when she was typing the new draft , came to me and asked indignantly what had happened to " her " chapter , saying that it was the best in the book . And she took care that it was kept , making me promise to use it , perhaps in a short story with a different artist . But when at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was reminded of my promise ( as twice before , when other books were finished ) , I found it impossible to take Gulley out of the text . He and the old woman were too closely entangled to be dissected apart without killing the tale . So I left them together in their complex battle with the elements , recalcitrant enough , of their several creative fields. ? The Author I T wAs going to be a good meeting , I could see that already . More and more people kept floating in . Like fish in an aquarium full of dirty gray water . There were three dimensions of fish faces on top of each other . Bobbing slowly to and fro , up and down . Old octopus in the corner with a green dome and a blue beak , working all his arms to take off his coat without losing his chair . Old female in black creeping among the lumpy dusk onthe sea floor and shooting out her umbrella like a crawfish . Young skate stuck up against the wall with bulgy eyelids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought he was a country cousin up for the nauticultural show , flabbergasted by all the flittering dabs , bald-headed herrings with sleek summer suitings , and unctuous eels in skin-tight silks that kept winding themselves past his pearly waistcoat and diving into their nooks and ambushes . They kept on diving at me and sitting on me until they knocked my feelings so low I wanted to burst into tears . So I took . a chair into the scullery to be low in private , and shut the door to get up my misery . For I knew where Plantie kept his bottled beer , under the draining board , and I said to myself , a drink is just what I want to do me bad ; and if I could only get bad enough , I 'd enjoy it . But I got no time to cultivate my weeds , for at once the audience came pushing up their chairs against my door . The people in front were making themselves comfortable for the agony before them and stretching their legs and pushing backwards to snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all meetings , except in a church with sound Christian principles where they screw the pews to the floor . And just as I was opening the first bottle , they knocked the door in and pushed a chair half through . And when I tried to push it back again , Plantie got up and introduced Professor Ponting , who turned out to be the moon-colored gentleman against the wall , the skate . " Ladies and gentlemen , " said Plantie , " we have here tonight the great privilege of meeting the great  --  that is , the great ? " PUSHED the chair forward and the Christians pushed it back , ten to one . But still I might have got the door shut if just then the old crawfish had n't come working sideways along the row , apologizing and groaning and sticking her umbrella into everybody 's eyes until she got her backside wedged up against the scullery door . Then the whole profession began to hiss at her and she got her umbrella jammed between a lady 's hat and a young friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully the other way , gave her a hard shove with his elbow . And she tumbled against the scullery door . But there was the empty chair . The very way she sat down on it was a thank you to the Lord for all His providence . Until she saw me behind the door . Then she jumped several inches and her whiskers went round in circles . " Oh dear , you was n't keeping it , was you , sir ? " " No , Mother , I 'm not really here at all . " " I never thought I should have got one . " " It 's not one really , is it , it 's outside . " " Weil , I did n't want to be in front , it did n't seem right when I only came in off the street . And I did n't want to be at the back either , I 'm a bit hard of hearing . " I took a pull at the stout and felt much worse at once . It washed up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating with the tide , ebb tide . Why , I said to myself , who ever said I could paint . Nobody that knows , and is it likely . Mc , Gulley ! A genius . Get on with you . That 's the very tale the lads at the local tell each other when their teeth drop out and the bill of sale falls in . I 'm a bum . Anyone could see that in the dark without straining his nose . And the proof is , I do n't like my own work . Bless you , what 's the sign of true genius , even if it is n't ? That it believes in itself , that it 's got the strawberry mark . Look at ' em all from Ozymandias to Frank Harris . They tell you right away . Any ladies present ? All right , look here , old chap . I 've got something . See , I 'm unique . I create worlds . Loud sounds the hammer of Los , loud turn the wheels of Enitharmon , Her looms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out from the ashes of the dead . Los lifts his iron ladles With molten ore ; he heaves the iron cliffs in his rattling chains From Hyde Park to the alms houses of Mile End and Old Bow . T HE old woman slid back her chair six inches and gave a sigh like a trace horse at the top of the hill where the grade gets worse than ever . It made me look at her and I saw that she was a real old woman , about thirty years past the age of demeanor . With a real old woman 's face , like an old stone lizard , a real Eve . Eyes all in wrinkles , long thin mouth , long bony nose , and her chin right up to it . She was chewing her meditations and I thought they were memories until she put the crook of her umbrella under her bonnet and made a face and scratched her head as if she hated it . Took the umbrella half way down again , but kept it at the ready and sat still with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleas to start biting again . To make sure of execution . Vengeance is mine . " My friends ? " the Professor had got to work , and you could see at once that he was a real art school professional by the way he blocked out his composition , starting with the chief vertical . " My friends , I ask only why is there no abiding joy in the world , no certain peace , " and then laying down a good strong horizontal for the base , " except among the very humblest of living creatures . " The old woman gave it up . The inhabitants had had a shock , they 'd stopped feeding . Sheep in a thunderstorm . She took down the umbrella and let out another sigh , a long one . Disappointed of her effect . I opened another bottle and it sank me to the bottom . I perceived that as a genius I was a figment and not a very strong one either . Not enough to deceive a teen-ager after a cup of British coffee . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom . Good-by art , good-by paint , good-by all that fiddle about which way to do what , or how to bring up the thingummy without losing the thongurnmy . To hell with all creation , I said to myself . I 'm free ; and I poured myself out another glass of immaterial comfort . The old woman heard the clink and looked at me with her left ear . " Have some , Mother ? " For I took to her . I take to everybody when I 'm free . Why not , there 's plenty of time . " Come on , Mother , it 'll do you good , take years off your mind . " But she shook her head so hard that her backbone rattled . " Oh no , thank you , sir , not just now . " " Why not now ? " She wrinkled one eye at the professor as if to say , " Not in the sermon . " " Is that it ? " I said . " Bless you , that 's what he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , if you wo n't take no , " and she put out her ancient claw . But went slowly at the glass , sip , sip , like a tired horse with sighs between . " Out for a holiday , Mother ? " " Well , I thought it might do me good . " " Religion . " " I used to go to church too at one time ; oh yes , I had a lot of religion . " " What do you think of this sorcerer tonight ? " " Well , what 's he saying ? " " He 's giving you the magic word . " She took a sip and breathed hard . " I suppose it 's a message , is n't it ? But I keep on wandering off . " " I know , Mother , it 's due to the thoughts . " " No , it 's the worry ; oh dear , I did n't ought to have come . " She finished her porter and wiped her lips with the handle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute and find me gone . " " jealousy is a compliment , whatever you may say . " " Oh dear , it 's not that , but he 's got so old . " " What does a girl like you want with an old man ? " She looked at me and moved her wrinkles a little to show she appreciated my gallantry . But she did n't smile , she was too old . " Yes , " she said , " all of a sudden it was ; why , it was only a week I noticed it  --  no , on Monday  --  Monday was a week . " " He may have got a bit younger since then , " I said , but she did n't notice , she was still taking a survey of her possessions . " Of course , he did have a stroke last year , he 's all of one side . And fits . He 's had fits these ten years . And pneumonia all the winter . But I 'd never noticed how old he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , I said , whatever has happened to you , you look so terrible old ? ? And what about you , you old faggot , he came back at me just like a mad bull . Oh he do have a terrible temper these days . It 's a word and a swear . But there , with one leg as good as dead , and being deaf on one side , and half blind , and noises in his head like a tramcar , it 's no wonder . " ' That 's not so old , " I said . " If he 's still got a temper and no responsibilities . It 's being free , old lady , to do what a man likes that stretches out the years behind and before . Look at me . I 'm a hundred and five and I 've lost the use of all my limbs , including my hay and my ho and my hay nonnino ? my face is false , and I ca n't smell a rat , even in the art news , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just now . I 've retired , old lady , I 've got nothing to do but dance in the wild , from this day on , and grow younger and younger . Drink up , Mother , " and I filled her glass . " Drink up and go backwards . " B UT she only sipped and sighed . " That 's right , " she said , but she was n't listening , She was too old , except to talk about her own affairs . " So he called you a faggot , " I said , making so free . " Oh , worse than that , " said she , tossing her nose . She liked to think of the things she 'd been called . " He 's a terror with his tongue . Always was . " " And you never answered back ? " " Oh but I did . Oh yes . I used to have a tongue too . Oh the things I 've said to him . " turning them over to get the richness . She liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And when did the concert begin ? " " Oh my , mister , the very first day . " " And why did it go on , why did n't you cut off ? " " Oh dear , but we was so fond of each other too  --  something terrible . He was a handsome chap and no mistake . " She raised the umbrella and rolled the old eyes upwards . The flock was nibbling again , getting back its nerve . Rainbows in the cloud . God 's promise . " This is not the biased argument of some superstitious creed remote from the stern realities of our modern world , " said the skate , throwing out his ground bait , " but a fact , a scientific fact . A bird will die upon its eggs , the ewe will fight for her young . " The old woman made a jab with her hook hard enough to make a hole in her skull , and scratched the crater with a grin of rage and satisfaction . " That 'll Iearn'em to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me . She was waiting for another bite . " The universal power of love  --  the spirit of mutual understanding  --  and do not the very creatures feel the divine purpose of that revelation . " The old woman pulled down the umbrella and peaked up her chin . " He speaks nice , that young man , and he 's right too  --  like creatures we was  --  we did n't know what was coming to us . " " The mixture as before , " I said . " It 's always new , " opening another bottle . But she was listening to the skate with all her eyes and the front of her bonnet , while he was going into the conscience of humanity sent by God to guide mankind through the wickedness of the world . And she could n't make anything of it . She gave a sigh and made a chop with her weapon at her ear where her bonnet touched it . Thinking it was a flank attack . " Cheer up , main , " I said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea , BUT I had plenty of offers , " and she perked up again . " I was a pretty gal , you know . " At eighty they were all pretty gals . " Healthy too , and well grown . Oh , I was fit to jump over the steeple . And lie was March mad . Oh deary , he was fever-ing for me , he could n't believe his luck ; well , it was a wonder I got to the church before I was spoiled , but thank God and my old main , I had a good training . Why , she would take a stick to me when I was twice bigger than she and ripe these three years . Oh , but I was feared of my mam , oh , she was a cruel one , " And you could hear how she liked to remember how her mam had put the fear of death into her . " Oh , she kept me good , good for my man . And we thanked God for it , God and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than it hurt her . " " Well , she took the trouble , and I was a trouble . You 'd think the devil had got into me with my growing . " " So he does , " I said . " I suppose it 's his job , " and I filled up for her . " Oh , crimini , not no more , not but it warms out the runcles , " " Is n't that its job ? " But she was n't listening . She was thinking , like an old horse over the trough , with the drops on her mustache . Topaz , with a touch of opal off the side of the sink . " Happy days , Mother . " She shook her bonnet , and two amber tears splashed on her little round belly , like an empty dish cover , covered in crepe . " I should n't like to say we was happy . " " Well , he was happy . " " Not what you 'd call happy . It was all such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mam , you had n't time . " " Not really . " " Not any way , " I said , turning my glass about to see if a bit of Indian red on the brown was local color or reflection from Plantie 's scullery wall . " Well , " I said , " I suppose love is a bit of an emotion , it runs you about a bit , do n't it ? " " Oh , deary dear , " she raised the old crest , " up and down and all round  --  such a huddle and a muddle . " " You would n't have it over again for a thousand pounds . " " I would n't say that , mister , if I could have it not all of a rush and a little bit different . " " Different husband ? " " Why no , he was terrible fond , and so was I. It was only we did n't know  --  well , we did n't know ? " " You did n't know how nice it was till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , it 's a little bit of both and a touch of chrome in it too , old gold , and when you get the gas light on the glass it throws a glow against the yellow that 's really rather unexpected  --  yes , it 's interesting , that under color i H LAWSIE , " and the old one was off again , singing from the soul . " Oh you 're right . Oh nobody knows , and as for loving ? " " Never a moment 's peace to enjoy yourselves . " " I wo n't say that , no , I wo n't  --  we had our times . " " Well , sir , he had a regular fit that first night when he saw my hair come down , and it was hair too . I could sit on it . Half-crying he was , and laughing too , and he put out his hand to stroke it . ' Do n't you touch it , ' I said . ' Well , ' he said , ' what a tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my knees ? ' ' You 're a silly boy , ' I said , for I thought it might n't be Christian . ' Get up , ' I said , ' you 'll spoil our luck . ' Oh my , oh my , I was only eighteen , you know , as hard as a bud . And then he got up and he lost his manners . Oh mysie , I drily him regular mad . Well , if you 'll excuse me as a married man , he could n't hold himself in and what did I know except that it was n't suitable . And there we was , arguing and shaming each other . Oh , it was a sillification ; oh , we were young . " And you could see how she liked being young , oh dear , all over again . And I kept on looking at my glass , in a careless way , as you might look at a girl , not to frighten her off , and I thought : All the same , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all at once that brown came right out at me , gave me the eye . It made the old skin jump , it sent the tingles through the tops of my fingers . Here , I said , does she know I 've retired . What is she thinking of ? But I knew what she wanted  --  still life with bottle of ale , or porter . Or landscape with pond  --  autumn landscape and brown reflections . Or yes , damme , why not , dock with tramp , a bit rusty round the water line to give the high light from old Plantie 's scullery bricks . " Oh mysie , that 's when it began , the very first night . " " Yes , mam , " I said , but I was a bit absent , running round the docks . " That was it , or was it ? " " The very first night . " " Did n't your mother ? " " Oh , crimini , it was n't that , I was a country girl . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , feeling the shock , for I had n't expected her to pop up in those parts . " Your grandma , Grandma ? " " Mine , never . His grandma . She lived with us , and just when we might have got things right and proper , she would go cough , cough . I was up and down all night with her . And just her spite because he 'd got his piece and would n't let her go to the workus . Well , I said so at last , and he fired up and said his grandma had always been good to him when he was a lad . I dare say , I said , good for him but not for me . It 's not what I had a right toexpect , a gal that everyone owned was a toothsome bit . And so we were at it . And I said I 'd go home to my mam ; yes , in my nighty , and he said the sooner the better . So , of course , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " the better , " filling her up , for I was all in a sweat . I wanted to be alone to examine my entrails and cast the auspices . That brown had got me , no doubt about it , and the first time in my life . I 'm not saying I have n't been had before by something brunetty , but I was virgin to a brown like that one , a big brown , a classic brown , a Beaumont brown , a brown with the brow of an empress and the kick of a brood mare . Not that anything so majestic would condescend to kick . The blood royal , yes , you could see it under the skin when you turned the glass a trifle edgeways . I was fairly flummoxed  --  shy as an Academy knight kissing hands in a velvet beetle-back . Yes , she 'd nailed me all right , I was fast by the short hairs The maiden caught me in the wild Where I was dancing merrily , She put me into her cabinet And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife was still clapping her gums together . " Oh we were young , we did n't know how to be happy . " " No more than the grass knows how to grow . " I topped her up and had a strong reflex . " Oh sir , 1 could n't do with any more . " " I thought so , mam , but you did n't notice it . " " Well , since you 're so kind . " " Not me , mam . It 's not my beer . And Plantie does n't know so you need n't feel . an obligation . " But she did n't hear a word , she was too old and interested in life , her life . " So there we were , cat and dog . " " There you were , " I said , trying to leave her there . " And Grandma . " " Well , mister , I could n't put her in the street neither , could I. " " You were too kind . " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at eighteen , but I knew what was right . " " Your mam taught you . " " Well , I should n't have liked it if I 'd let my grandma go to the Union . Not but what I did n't keep on at Bill ; why should n't his sister take her . She had two spare rooms and an old husband that was glad not to he in the road . But there , it 's what the Book says , them as does a penny stint for a penny pay has no call to yammer  --  no , not if some others that ought to know better dodge out till the whistle . It 's for the Lord to judge ? Hell send ' em where they belong . " " And what is the proof of God 's intentions for the world , a world of mutual love and peace , " said the skate , working himself up and answering his own questions like the end man at the minstrels . " It is the family ? " AN D she heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down like a policeman sending on the traffic . " Oh that 's a true word , oh yes , it 's the family . And my family was as good as his , better . We never had no one in the Union , not even in the bad times , not in the eighties . Never . But there , Grandma was a trouble , worse than a baby . She could n't kccp herself clean , and all day it was , ' Oh , I 'm nothing but a nuisance and a burden  --  oh , let me take myself away to the workus . ' And we had a baby too , a real one . With the two of them I was nigh out of my mind , well , I was never at one thing but I ought to have been doing another . I did n't take my eye off baby before he was at the kettle or the fire , and when I went after him , Grandma would be falling downstairs and breaking herself , she was that brittle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " yes , it 's well  --  just what you say ? " for I was worried . I was in great anxiety about my brown . I 'd just got her nicely fixed between a couple of Baltic tramps and a Norwegian timber ship when all at once she began to sink away into the dock . Oh my God , I said , stop her , and I made a grab at her hair , but it turned to water in my hand , 112o with accidentals . " Well , I hope I was a Christian too , but it was work , work , work . I was fair off my head with it . Arid when Bill got to grumbling too , I put a bucket of suds over him . Oh , that was an awful day , right over his Sunday suit . " " Well , mam , if you ask me he asked for it . " " Oh , I had a temper too . Oh trims , what a temper I had . " And how she liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing but brown again , nothing but a slop of beer , and I gave her up . I drank her up , good-by , sweet brown  --  good riddance . For hurray , I was at peace again . A free man . Free to go into society . ELL me , mam , how long did your grandma last ? " " Oh a long time . But we got her fixed up in the end . Well , we had to do something or Bill and me would have broke up . " " A nasty problem , " I said , and I even crossed one leg over the other like any half gentleman of leisure talking to a half-sister of charity in a half-way house in Half Moon Street . " And after all , the modern institution is said to be greatly reformed . I have sometimes thought of it for myself . At least it would give one , as I know you yourself , mam , will agree , something that both of us , as , shall I say , reflective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the daily grind  --  peace of mind  --  time to get to the , or should I say , toward the , yes , bottom of things . And from that point of view , the so-called workhouse or Union ? " " Union , mister  --  whatever are you talking about ? Whatever do you think we were ? Why , we 'd have starved first . No , we never thought of no Union , we got her into bed . Of course it meant a lot more work and expense too , but you knew where you were with her . " " Yes , " I said , " I can see that myself . Everything organized . More work perhaps , but a better job . A real job and that 's a real comfort . " " Oh dearie yes , we made her comfortable . Not much thanks neither . But nothing suited Grandma . Oh , if you 'd heard her creating . Grumble , grumble all day , and saying every next minute she 'd walk out . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without her clothes . " " What , you took away her clothes ? " " Oh , never , we would n't do such a thing , but they were all put away and you know what clothes are when you 're in bed . They get all wore out , and the buttons fall off . " " And how long did your grandma lie in bed ? " " Oh deario , you may well ask  --  fourteen , sixteen year . Oh a turble long time it was too , " and she chewed her old lips as if she still had a bitter taste on them . I WAS N'T shocked , which was some satisfacfaction . It showed how free I was ; when I 'm free I 'm never shocked . I 'm too spread out ; too unbraced . I sing to every breeze . I took another look at the old lady and thought a bit of an old specter perhaps , not much oversoul between the ribs of her imagination . But what I say is what would we do without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of firebar in his left glove , where would he be if lie could not depend on the fcrrousity of the metal . Damn it , I asked , where would the Almighty be if His back axle could go soft and turn itself into macaroni ? Nowhere . Absolutely . ' ' Sixteen years , " I said . " More than you do for murder . " " Ah , you may well say it was like jail  --  and worse too . Because we looked after her proper . Why , the washing alone was a punishment . For I never let her lie dirty . Nobody ever saw my grandma , which was n't mine neither , in a dirty sheet . Jail ! It was slavery . All the years of my twenties  --  the sweetest time it should he . " " Do you know , " I said , and I was feeling so social I uncrossed my legs again to come forward into confidence , " I never had any twenties at all . I was at an art school , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Egyptian mummy , dead about ten thousand years ? " but just then my eye happened to rest on the bottle next the sink and I had a shock like a young man 's fate for there was my brown beauty peeping from the bottle ; and my rusty red in a letter on the label , canoning together like a duet of burnt angels . Of course , as soon as they felt my eyes upon them they began to turn pale and edge away at the corners . A blue , I cried , Oh God , a blue , send me a blue quick , and I was rummaging round the cellar for a new sky when plomp , down came my old dungarees from heaven with the new patch on the left cheek and pinned the lot to glory . This cabinet is formed of gold And pearl and crystal shining bright And within it opens into a world And a little lovely moony night . " And then the drink . " The old woman , much revived by the last draught , sang this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision . " Which one ? " I said from the middle of Beulah . " My gaffer . " Did he , indeed . " " Well , you could n't blame him at the first , with me so young and only just started in a job and working all hours , and babies crying half the night , and he was n't a fly away , my MAGAZINE gaffer , he took it all serious . Nothing too good for Grandma nor the babies neither . Wondering if I 'd left a pin or whether onions was good for my milk . Well . I always did like a Spanish onion  --  we all do down in Hereford . And trade going up and down all the time like a weather glass in the back end of April . No , it was n't surprising if he took a bit of drink now and again . All his mates did the same . But I could n't bear to hear him falling up the street  --  I could n't bear to see my belongings in such . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , and being sick in the scullery . Oh my , oh my , I used to give him such a doing  --  one washing day I hit him with the dolly  --  my laws , I thought I 'd kilted him . " s HE sucked in her breath , wheeoo , enjoying the agony of that moment when she 'd killed her Bill . But I was all in the blues . Those dungarees were more of a general limit than a going-away suit . What we want , I suggested , me and brown , is something between a sailor 's collar , straight from the pusser , and the middle of a gas flame  --  say , a night-blue  --  yes , no , yes  --  not too thick  --  a London night-blue  --  yes  --  but not too fat  --  what about a Sunday blue , on the otherworldly side , yes , somewhere over the Bank on a Sunday in August . And I knew at once I 'd got something  --  in fact , a masterpiece ; in fact , the secret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flick of the wrist . In fact , a row of masterpieces , the everlasting miracle of grace turned on at the standpipe in the rose garden . A child could do it when Nursie was n't looking . Somehow I 'd got that bottle with the yellow label in my hand . But I did n't look at it . I just stroked it and smiled . I was as full of smiles as a butler at a peepshow . Another England there I saw Another London with its Tower , Another Thames and other hills And another pleasant . Surrey bower . The old contriver was looking at me as if I were a house on fire and then she looked at herself to see what I was laughing at . But at last she grinned like Essex clay in a dry summer , opening her ancient earth . She was too old to have any pride  --  she had lost even her suspicions . " That gave him something to think about , " I said , not so much social as friendly , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That improved his organs of per-ception . " " Well ; he did get better , and then he got worse , and drinking in the house . " " Ah , " I said , " that 's bad . Speaking as a family man , in fact a three-family man , I should say that was the beginning of the end . " " Well , sometimes it was and sometimes it was n't . Well , in the house you could tell him to stop . Not that he took any notice except to give me a slap . Oh , it was awful the way we went on , and the language . Hawkers was nothing to us when our mother was up . And I could give him better than he gave . Many 's the time he 'd have liked to cut me off by the throat . " " My friends , is it not to the family that all rulers must look for the strong foundations of their states and a model for the kingdoms of the world . " " And did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yellow label to feel how yellow it was , how unique in its yellowness . " Of course he could n't . Because he knew and I knew , and he knew I knew , he could n't do without me . It was n't only I was his wife and kept the house , but I was earning . Three days a week charring at the schools . We needed it too , the children 's boots alone was enough to walk in your sleep . Ah , many a time I drove him mad wanting to break my teeth and remembering he could n't afford to lay me up . Then we was so fiery too . We had our hot blood still , and right in the middle of all , he 'd give me a look , you know what I mean , one of those looks as if you 'd forgotten to do your bodice , and then it was a pat and a squeeze . ' Come on , Sukey , what 's it all about . ' And , well , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't butter the parsnips nor mend the stockings , which , God knows , is crying out from the basket . And so I 'd swallow my Iast word and say , well , perhaps it 's the rain or something , I never could bear a wet Monday  --  it 's not doing right by a poor woman . " And bless you , next minute we 'd be at it again , serious as if we 'd never done it before . Oh , crimini , it makes you laugh and it makes you cry . Oh trims , but love is a comical thing . " ND I smiled , but a bit solemnly , for I 'd just been faced with a challenge . I saw that if my yellow got to playing around with blues , that noble and high-minded brown might die . Already it was turning sad , I did not dare to Look at it in case we both lost our nerve and made a mess of our rather delicate relations . The old wife gave a snigger . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I could tell you , sometimes the tears was running down my cheeks . It 's like being in two places at once . " " Like Lady Macbeth , " I suggested , " in Elsinane in the old Old Vic  --  sleep-walking , with that blashted second carpenter in his ten-pound walrus boots falling down the backstairs right into the firebuckets . Twice in one act is too much even for tragedy . " I thought . " Though if I know anything about housewives , mam , I 'll bet she knew quite well in all her places exactly what she was up to , and just what she was going to make of it , " I threw out , making conversation only , for in my fright I 'd grabbed at an idea , just as it was wriggling past the corner of my eye . " Oh , I 'm not saying I was any better than I should be . Half the time I was calling him boozer , I was boozy myself . Oh lawsie , yes , for having it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the carrying pain in my back , I got to sipping . And you know what that is ; if you get hold of it , it gets hold of you . Drink is mutual . " But I was digging fast to catch that idea . I 'd seen its tail so I knew it was there . " The inevitable end , " I said to mam , to cut her off ; " it 's what they always say , wine is a mocker . " " I would n't say that neither , " said she , casting herself back into the gallons of the past . " We had some good brew in our parts , it gave you what were looking for , yes , oh yes , many a time we was uproarious together , and then we would go rampaging , and after that we would be doting , dear a dear , I 'd often sooner a black eye , he was that fierce , snapping and grabbing at me as if I was a bone that would n't be eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was as tender meat as ever felt the rolling pin . Well , I never had time to lose my childing fat , I had fourteen in thirteen years . " " Fourteen , " 1 said like any philosopher , " into thirteen . " For I was deep in my own guts , digging like any mole after a wire worm . " It was  --  it was  --  what would you say yourself , Mother ? " " Oh yes , I would too  --  all that and more , oh dearie yes , " and you could hear her turning her tongue over it like a piece of hot ginger . " Half the time you was so crowded out , inside and out , you had n't room to think , much less to drown yourself . " " I know , " I said , " they do it on purpose for the glory of God or something . " And I filled her up for a stopper . " Oh my gr , acy , I really had enough , and me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , it makes you feel different . " " War , crime , disease , all the evils of the worldly state , grounded in cruelty and guarded by the violence of the law . Friends , your legal society is a fraud , it could not stand for a day except it was founded upon the eternal rock of love and loyalty , of mutual tenderness . Does the father call upon the law to take vengeance on the son , does the mother send for the police to help support her authority ? " And the old woman turned her nose sideways at him like a parrot looking at a pill . " And that 's not so far wrong neither  --  he 's got sense , that young man . I never used more than a slipper and I never boxed an ear , well , I said , it 's bad for the drum and they do n't remember it neither , you do n't have to sit on your ear . " Pink , I said to myself , like a baby 's bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't believe a word of it . And to divert this attack from the air , by removing to a comfortable spot by the haystack , I smiled upon old Vorwarts . But with too sudden a beam . She had a surprise that electrified her bugles . " No mister , I 'm not . " " No , " I said , sympathetic but wary , " You 're not . You can take it . " She shook her head . " It was n't the beer but the spirits . It was when we got to the gin  --  it flies so to the temper . Beer , they say , makes pillows , but gin makes rocks and razors , and just when Bill got a chance in the yard to go as foreman , we had some real nasty feeling in a lorry and Bill fell off and broke his arm in three places . " ? Impossible . It just could n't happen . Not pink , not to me . " That was a bad business , mam , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks almost like spite . " 64 ELL , mister , what I think is , it was to come . It followed on , as you might say . You see , we 'd been celebrating that job which was our first bit of luck , and I fell off the same time , but I was on top , and then I had my seventh the same night , that was Tom or perhaps she was Sally , the poor morsel only lived the week and what with everything we pretty near tore the place down  --  oh it was an awful time . " She smiled and the blood came up in her cheeks ; she was enjoying the awfulness of that time . " Oh I do n't know how we came through . The neighbors went to the landlord and she comes down and gives us a week 's notice . And , of course , there was no more cottages in the village , so Bill lost his job too . " " What a scandal . " " Well , it was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than a child for looking after . Well , I tell you , we 'd broke the firegrate , solid iron , broke it right through and I do n't know how . It might have been Bill 's foot or my head . " " Yes , " I said , " or no , not your head . " " Well , you know how it is in liquor , you could break in the wall and not be any the worse . " " No , " I said . " That is , yes , it 's a proof , is n't it ? Nobody ca n't really not believe in God , it 's not scientific . " And just when I was surveying the triumph of soul over matter , a sweet little pink gave a smile in my heart and opened his eyes and there was a babe new born out of the very middle of Pears ' Annual . My dear , I said , surprised with joy . Of course you are a darling , and I quite see that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my yellow from making all that noise and frightening my poor gentle brown into the coal hole . But only by surprise . You do n't really belong , my dear , you 're not an inspiration , but a little hit of fun . Yes , you make me laugh , you give me quite a Christmas feeling . Another England there I saw Another London with its Tower . " Broke in three places , it was . " " I believe you , mam , because it was the same as your husband 's arm  --  you would n't make it up . " For in my innocent joy I sported with the daughters of Beulah . " And there we was , in the street , Grandma and all , and Grandma calling the neighbors she only wanted the Union . Well , I said to Bill , did n't we just ask for it . " " At least you were relieved of your grandma . " " Oh , my laws , we could n't do that . Not when we was brought so low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What is the cement of the wall of Babylon ? Is it not faithfulness ? Does not even the anti-Christ Fiihrer of Germany , does not he , even he , exalt faithfulness ? " " Losing your home , " I said , and I dare say the pink had affected my voice a little , I 'm a sensitive chap , especially to color . " I 'm sorry for you , mam . To be turned out of the old home , that 's a real disaster . " " Well , mister , I do n't know . If we had n't been thrown out I suppose we should have stuck there . And it was old too , pretty near rotten . And we got a new bungalow on the buses right next the town with a proper tin roof to beat the sparrows . What 's more , Bill got another job , a real good one , bailiff to an old lady . Well , Bill did n't know farming , but neither did she , and so he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalded cream and fresh butter as much as we could eat . We should have been well off if it had n't been for the drink , and Grandma screaming at the neighbors if we only left two inches of window , how we would n't let her out . Well , she 'd got it on the brain . " " Yes , typical obsession of old age ! " And I thought , all the same , something in that line , not exactly pink ; just pinkish and kept firmly in its place . But no , it 's a trap . Give pink one chance and she 'll trollop all over the place , and wreck the family name if it 's got any . And I said in passing , " I suppose now , mam , that you could take Grandma into the back garden now and then for a quiet run in private  --  say at Easter and Christmas . " " Oh dear , mister , you could n't do that with our grandma . She was that venturesome . She 'd no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how it is in bed , you get so lively in your temper and so weak in your legs , you 're fit for nothing but your meals . She might have fallen down and broken her leg and that would have been the end of her . " " I see , " I said , closing my eyes to shut out Plantie 's wall . And there I was , in a pink world . " I see , " I sighed , " after all , it 's not so much an open question as what you 've got on your plate , and ca n't put off . " " And Bill getting so he did n't know if it was spots in front of his eyes or bugs on the wall . " I F I Musa- show it where it gets off , I thought , I could creep up on it with a Berkshire brick or a tiled roof or a Dutch barn . And then I got a start , for there was poor Maria Martens ' wounded breast bleeding pink at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that pink was a discovery . And as you know , it 's not so easy for an artist to know that his discoveries are discoveries , not so easy but very important . For there right underneath the poor girl 's body stretched in the farmyard was my lovely brown , lovelier than ever , in pools of whatyou-may-call-it . And a pink farm cart with a blue tail . And Maria 's blood floating on the muck . Exactly so , the very thing , bringing your pink right into the main issue , right down into the muck . Oh lovely muck , a bit of glazing there , touch of Peter Paul , feels within feels . " Yes , mam , I agree with you there , I 'm with you all the time . " " Why , he threw the bread trencher at the sprigs in my Sunday muslin because they sat up at him , when it was only the plim of my bosom . Is it a wonder I was nip , nipping before the milk . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal his brightest weapons from the Lord , and to see them turn against his own vitals . For faithfulness , that has such mighty power , is strong by truth and hates a deceiver . " " And that 's a true word , " said she . " For one fine day when Bill got the horrors in the greenhouse , he took a new prong and chased his old lady and spit her too ; we heard her screech from half a mile and thought it was murder or worse . And his own men off the farm tied him with haybands and the doctor said he must be locked up in a ' sylum . " " Murder , " I said in my hurry , trying to lay it up for reference , " and it was locked up , " hastily rubbing a little beer into the label to get my muck darker , and then rubbing it through to the bottle to get the shine of a reflection in Maria 's pool of blood . But do what I would , that brown began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of life on the farm . I KNEW what I wanted . The only way to stop a color from lying down in the dirt is to set another color after it with a gun . And I took a bit of beet-root off Plantie 's supper and put it on the maiden 's breast , a rose , no , Maria 's blood . It was n't quite right , it made poor Maria look like a utility primp on a lemonade advertisement , but it brought her alive , especially her hair , yes . horse chestnut , keep it down and it fires up inside like Chingachgook . It made me laugh and it made me cry . " In a sigh  --  in a sigh  --  yes , a sigh sigh lum , " I responded with choral sympathy . " But you saw it coming , main , it followed as you might say . " " My laws , yes , you can always see it coin-ing . " " All ways  --  al-ways " I murmured , " always and all round  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to come and what it 's going to come like  --  that 's the teaser . " " Tea , " I said , busy as a sparrow in a straw yard , " the tea-tea-teaser , " and I licked a bit of sugar bag and stuck it on the glass just to see what it would do to Maria 's hair , and the gold on the muck . " Yes , " I said , " that 's what keeps you on the hop . " " Oh , yes , mister , yes indeed , for when Bill got sober after a week or two he told the old lady that it was family trouble getting on his brain and of course she 'd never liked me being a bit full-blown , and her on the flat side , and she lent him fifty pounds to pay off his score , and what not , and then he took religion and stopped it . Well , it was a barker in the cattle market selling the number of the beast and he 'd gone in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut his legs off . But when he woke up he heard this chap like a steam circus , and he thought it was Judgment Day . So he thought of how he kept on having pains in his heart and how two of his uncles had mortified in hospital with the ulcers and he stopped it . " " Judge  --  Judge  --  Judgment Day , " I said , bursting into loud chirps , " and he stopped it . " I spat upon the blue to lower its cheek and raise its dander . " A stop was put to spots , and spots . " " You ca n't believe it , mister , can you ? Just like that it was . Well , I did n't myself though I saw it  --  not for years . But he MAGAZINE stopped . Out of that chap in the cattle market selling the end of the world and God 's grace for sinners . And then he got after me too . " He threw all the bottles against the wall and . made me breathe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as a skim of liquor he 'd take pokers and strops to me . Oh mysie , the latherings I had , carpets was nothing . And he would say it was kill or cure because of my soul and because he loved me . And so he did , oh deario , oh dear , worse than ever , being so respectable and getting back to his religion and missing his darts . Well , they say the forties is the true doting time , and I believe it , there was one night the neighbors thought he was murdering me , and called the police . But when the constable broke in , Bill had got him to the second lesson and I was down on the flour bin ; oh crims , it 's no wonder the officer threw his truncheon , you 'd have thought it was murder yourself only we was arguing so loud . " " The everlasting fountain of revelation , the continuing miracle of go-ace . " " Happy days , " I said , " happy days , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to me that I was getting there , wherever it is , with my blue . I slapped on another bit of sugar paper near the brown , reflection of the cart-tail . And yes , and yes , my muck was on the move . Yes , see , all aglow and ashine as if she felt the harvest in her guts . Ah , I thought , I knew that brown was a sweet thing , but only now do I see her real possibilities . Another maiden like herself Translucent , lovely , shining clear , Threefold each in the other closed Oh what a trembling , pleasant fear Yes , I thought , it 's enough to frighten a rope dancer , that pink , but I 'm not going to be frightened . No , I 'm not , and I gave a lick at the beetroot to take off its ambiguities . Never . And I gave it two more licks . It 's got to be a real pink , a pink , tottering on the edge of the Christmas supplement , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pure impudence , or any other of numerous co-respondents including Renoir . The old woman was goggling at me as if I had had enough , and so I looked serious , and I said to her , what I always say when I have n't heard the conversation of anyone over the age of forty-nine . " That was had luck and yet it was n't so bad that it might n't have been worse . " " No , nor it was , and a lot better than we deserved , taking us as them that had a good start . We had our gaiety , and bless you , after Bill cured me of the drink ? " " Bill  --  of course  --  it was Bill who ? " " Not so much Bill neither as I took religion too . Of course , I 'd always been a Christian , but after I 'd got it again I went in the Baptists and they do n't allow so much as beer . Well , I thought I needed it so bad I 'd better take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And though , trust her , Grandma would go and die the very first week we ever had the rent ready , and put that and fifteen pound of debt in a two-coach funeral , we got a lodger for her good front room and in pretty near no time we were that rich we bought a nice terrace villa warm both sides with the kitchen fires , and a bathroom and water closet . Oh , gracy , what a jubilee day when we Went into that house . Not but what I was ashamed of the furniture in the open street coming out in rings and the children quite mad and running in every minute to pull the chain . And if you said a word , saying they were urgent and doing it too as often as not . And if it was only the excitement to see it roar like real waterfalls , how could they know . Children do n't know their own pipes any more than birds . Well , they do n't know what they do n't know , do they , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they had that chain tore up by the root the very first day . Oh , it was n't Bill nor drink nor religion neither that turned me gray and spoilt my sufferance , but the children . It 's no good saying about them like you can of a husband , good riddance and forget him and get on with the next thing ; well , you know he 'll come if it suits him , and if it suits him likely it will suit you or you can shoo him off till when . But you have n't got no hold on a child . Oh trims , the things they did to me , getting married to wasters and creepers . Why , my eldest ran off with a tinker , and my Sam , as good and clever as he was six foot high , went in for the horses and made a mint and then he came home with the police after him and it took half our savings to keep him out of prison . And then he made double what he did before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his money to a girl we never see or heard of . At least she did n't get it after all because it was all bills . There was never a day for forty year I did n't get my palpitation about Sam and he was n't the worst . Oh it 's children that wear a body down . I was an old woman before I was fifty . " B y THIS time I 'd licked the beetroot into a pink like a pink gin , a lovely lucid pink , and 1 thought , that 's what I want , not a solid but a space , not a cart or a murder , but a sky , a pink sky . Rather post card , you say , all right , damn your eyes  --  who said I was frightened . And what you 've got to remember is that the sublime is always ridiculous  --  look at bishops  --  lo'ok at poets  --  blast me , I 'll make it a pink sunset . And yes , split my weasand , a tiger , tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the muck shall be a forest pool , yes . es , with sunset reflections . What do I care at my age . Let ' em all come . You can only die once and I 've been through it so often that I know it does n't last . Yay , I 'll beat the world  --  it wo n't notice anyhow . And I stove off the old devourer with a well-tried pass , " Such is life , inam . " " Oh , my laws , mister , but that 's true . Oh , my lawsie , that 's a true word . Do n't we know it 's true . " " It keeps on , it keeps on , and then it starts all over again . " " Oh my crimini laws , never a moment 's peace if only to do your cupboards out . Not for a woman , a family woman . " " You were a good mother , " I said , giving myself a private pinch to make sure it was me dreaming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse . " " Dearie , deario , the better the worse . But there , its nature , and Bill 's sister that never had no children , well , she cocked herself up for her looks and her house which was certainly a picture for the paint and the ornaments , but a poor mammet after all , a piece of nonsense . I pitied her . Well , you can dress up a mopstick like a moral and gramophones can talk down a bishop . " In my pride and joy I was moved to give myself away . " When I went in for art , old lady , or rather when art went in for me ? " " But it was my youngest that gave me the trouble , oh the cross she was . Right from the beginning . Well , it was even better than that , for she tried to come three months before her time and kept me so nervous I could n't so much as blow my nose . And after all , a month early and fed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't suck , would n't take her pap , and the tantrums , screaming herself into fits , oh , you wanted to strangle her , but , of course , being so delicate , you could n't so much as look sideways . And with all your trouble , growing up crooked because she would n't eat her mince . The best beef mince off the fresh rump , full of blood it was , nothing was too good . Why , Dadda would have bought her lions and elephants only to give her some meat on her poor little sticks . " T 11E , old songster 's chittering fell upon my corn like spring rain , a bit sharp , but who cares on a honeymoon . And as 1 , wandered in the land of Beulah , sweet world of perceptions , I thought how nice it would be when the president of the Royal Academy came to me in tears and a government Rolls and threw down his top hat at my feet . " I know , Mother , I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front moved their ears back . " She was Dadda 's dream  --  his chick , his chick , his chickabiddy dear . " " Oh , she was , but there , we both spoilt her . It 's natural with the youngest . Thinking there 's no more to come , and losing your stomach , and Ady with all her miseries , catching everything she could ? we spoilt her , that 's the truth too , I see it now , we spoilt her . " I gave her some more beer . " Never mind Ady . Drink up and be happy . You 're only old once . " " Me , mister ? " and I saw at once I 'd made a big mistake . Her nose turned verd antique with indignation . " Me , mister ? Speak for yourself . It 's only my teeth  --  I forgot ' em on top of the piano . " " That 's all right , main , and mine are at the pop-shop . You see , a chap must eat , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No offense , mam , catch as catch can and all 's fair . " " It 's not me who 's old , it 's Bill . Oh and lie is old , you would n't believe it . Oh my laws , I ought to be at home . Supposing he was to have another fit and fall in the fire . " " Do n't you worry , mam , lie 's got his Ady . " " Well , Ady does look in sometimes , but I hope she would n't see him , she 's expecting her first in a week . " " Her first , in a week  --  little Ady married . But , of course , she 's a big girl now . " " Yes , and well married too , mister , thank God for it . For I never thought to see it . Oh , what a job we had , and chancy  --  but there everything about Ady was touch and go . You held your breath if you only said good morning . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , he wanted a special prayer about his dreams , and I thought , well , it 's now or never , and I asked him to supper . By God 's mercy we had an apple tart that was n't cut , and then I got Bill out to see a noise in the garden and told him if he went hack it was my dead body . And Ady , I must say , we brought her up for a lady , and she could always do the polite to a stranger . But oh dear , she was a lady too  --  the things she could n't and the things she would n't . It was eight weeks before she let him hold her hand , and after all we had to give them the housc to fire them up for coming in the next bed . For she would n't have a double , she said it was common . But there , I did n't so much mind going back to the old cottage  --  less to clean and nearer the work . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with himself but a job at the gasworks , and that 's almost government . Oh we was glad to get him . If only she 'll keep a hold . " 66 F ONLY , " I said , " if only she 'll keep ? " for I was a bit scattered . The fact is , I 'd taken an eye off the tiger to condescend with the president and everyone knows how dangerous that is in the middle of the big act . When I looked again , the tiger was oozing through the keyh ale like Madame Blavatsky in an Isabella nightie , and the sunset was making a face like a Dicksee , a mere appearance . " If only ? " I moaned , and looked round for something to make a mark with . But all I saw was the old helmet grinning at me and wagging her bonnet like Widow Twankcy . " Oh , mister , we know , we know . But what does she know . Oh , these girls , first they 're silly and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said in my despair . " Girls are  --  I speak generally ? " Just then I was aware of a bottle-opener in my hand . It was a bottle-opener for all tastes , with a loop for beer-caps and a hook for more beer-caps , and as quick as I could draw I hooked a line round that tiger , cutting through the label to the glass , and cutting through the pink so that half of it was sky and half reflection in the pool . " Practically individuals , " I said , " at least by themselves in Oxford Street . " But as I gazed at my tiger and my pink , lo the princess gave a sigh  --  my Sleeping Beauty opened her eyes and there she was  --  there , with all her thisness and her thatness and herself too , the possible she . And when she looked  --  she looked at me , I fell right out of my background . Oh , what a smile , a threefold smile Filled me that like a flame I burned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was croodling in my ear , " and you ca n't tell her nothing neither , not in her first year . She thinks she 's got the whole tickle at one dip . Not but what the chap thinks so too . He is n't one to complain , not if his meat is coke . " " Renewed in every agel " The skate was working up to the great amen , giving his celebrated proof that spiritual joy , by the mediation of grace , is God 's proof to the world that if wishes are beggars , horses will ride . The queen mother nodded her crown at him in a favorable declination and continued in her own right . " A regular mammy 's boy . Well , if ever he wet a bed , I 'm sure it was dill water . He never said boo to a girl till Ady caught him with that green jumper , his nose goes after her when she only walks round the room . He 'd eat cow-pie out of her hand only to lick the dish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle at this present . " " Happy man , " I chortled . " Poor devil  --  dirty blackguard . " And as the tiger went winding through the pink , his yellow fell upon my brown and turned her into flame , I bent to kiss the lovely maid I found a threefold kiss returned . The pink , the gold , and the brown , all mine ? spirit , mind , and body . And with a bold stroke of inspiration I gave the tiger three whiskers on each side . " He 's caught , " I crowed . " She 's she 's nailed him . " " Dear a dear , that 's what she thinks , poor lamb , but you know what it is , take a chap in the spring quick and he 'll jump at old iron . Not but what Ady has n't got something about her . She 's not one of your sentry boxers . But it 's always the same with daughters , they take after their fathers and the boys get all the looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice with your Tommy when he comes to and he 'll get used to everything else . ' But lawsie , you know what girls arc , all over the place till she got four legs to her bed and then all over herself . The airs she gives herself , the poor moppet . Oh , my deario , as if you could raise your bread on the map of a man . " " No , marn , no , " I said . " I mean , no , " for I did n't like those whiskers . I perceived that I had been jubilating on the barricades instead of organizing a constitution . No , I thought , that bloody tiger is devouring my brown and Maria 's hair is lost in the smell of his breath . The whole thing is wombwell . What you need for a brown like that is breadth , dignity , the old cremona . " It 's not in nature , he 'll rear up one of these days and give her a slap . " The classic touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . And I turned the tiger into a cottage loaf , his head into a brass jug , threw in a pink chop on a blue plate , opened a window behind , with some white washing on the line  --  a couple of pink flower pots in front and a brown Windsor chair on the right , with a blue reflection in the seat This cabinet is formed of gold And pearl and crystal shining bright , And within it opens a world And a little lovely moony night . World of the eternal , yes , of the primordial forms , the immortal shore , the everlasting kitchen , the sempiternal sink . S UDDENLY all the people got up which surprised us both , and the old woman in her anxiety to make the right religious move , poked her umbrella into the Christian in front , who turned round with an ecclesiastical expression . But just then someone began to sing about building Jerusalem , and lie was obliged to pass on quickly from his godly wrath , in order to catch up with the tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up her chin like a duck drinking and opened her beak and creaked like a rusty hinge . " In England 's green and pleasant land , ' I like that one , " she said . " 1 always did like the Jerusalem hymn . We could do with some building too down our way  --  decent hardworking girls which you might think they 'd earned some peace having to share up with young snoots of daughters-in-law  --  oh , my mercy , whatever is the time ? " " Not quite closing , Mother , have a quickie before you go  --  on the house . " For I wanted to fix down one or two details that had come upon me , suggested themselves , seized me by the neck , and said , ' Cherish us , love us , keep us , the daughters of Beulah , and be quick about it , before we perish . ' I made a stab at Maria 's right shoulder , or the brass jug with the sun glittering on its hair , a sweet double curve leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it was , there , a piece of history . " Oh , dear , oh dearie , " said she . " It would serve me just right if I miss the last bus and he falls in the fire . " " I dare say , " I suggested , and all at once I saw a woman would give a better line , because more inevitable , yes , a girl is an intellectual thing , at least on the outside , made up , whereas jugs are little removed from natural objects , mud in the eye . And if the aesthetic supercharge on girls has been used to drive sausage machines it is still a primary radiation which mixes well with any good pigment ; yes , and gets all the lumps into one parcel . Yes , girl bathing , yes , let 's be original , get at the fundamentals . " I dare  --  yes , I dare say ? " I murmured , marking round a couple of legs with a sweet section of the plane of the water , solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your Bill would n't mind so much if he were out of it . I mean afterwards  --  well , he would n't even know , would he ? " " Oh , do n't say it 's time for Bill to gol " " Well , main , if Ady has a new baby for you , " and I went up from the lovely thigh , ah , what a pelvis , to the left shoulder , yes , my dear , I thought you were going to turn out something remarkable and already you generate worlds . Yes , if your neck grows so , set upon your shoulders like a tower , not so much of a vertical as a monument " Oh , laws , oh lawsie , " the old woman was in a fluster . " Not Ady  --  that 's just what I 'm afeared of . " " Not Ady , " I said , throwing in a face , any old face with two prods for eyes , to give the angle of poise and its relation with the collarbones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Believe me , mam , she 'll be quite reasonable now , ' That 's my experience , anyhow . Once you get a daughter fixed up or even down she usually turns out a very decent sort of girl and quite ready to do the right thing by her old parents . " For though I do n't suppose I have any daughters , I 've had a lot of other people 's . " Oh , dear , that 's what they all say . Oh , and she does too . She 's got it on the brain about me going out to scrub , and it not being right in her position . It 's why do n't we come home to her back room and live nice like she 'd choose for her dear papa and mamma . " " You ought to be proud of your Ady , mam , " I said , knocking in a castle or barrack , to give a dotty pattern on the right . " You did a good job there . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd do murder for her . You know what young husbands are , especially the soft ones . Oh but I know , mister . They 're getting up a plan . Come , Mother , she says , you 've had a hard life , what you need is a rest . Soon as my gaffer goes they 'll have me in the sheets for the rest of my life . " " All the same , " 1 said , for I was not at all sure that the poor old thing was fit to look after herself , and really some of these aged persons get so cranky and irresponsible they are a danger to the public as well as themselves , " all the same , Mother , you would n't have her not caring , would you ? At least she knows what 's fitting , " and it came upon me like the last trump , a warehouse with four rows of windows in perspective and a yellow wall to keep the pink from turning into ice cream . Yes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red rag round his neck , or no , a Negro washerwoman , a fat one , mountainous , sublime . I stuck a piece of sunlight on the bottle to get the sunshine . And the vast maiden smile , oh what a smile , a threefold smile . Just then Plantie turned down the light to a glimmer , meaning that it was time the meeting left him to his supper . But I had patience , a bride-groom has a lot of patience , I mean , once he has the girl safe in his pocket . A millionaire has a lot of patience , I mean , when he has his millions in gold and buried in the garden . I just sat my maiden on my knee , keeping a loose but affectionate hold round her neck with my right forefinger and thumb , and pressing slightly down in case her bottom might slip off my trouser ; and turning to the old comrade I said to her with the encouraging tone of a prophet at leisure to notice particulars , " Think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble , and none of us like the work , do we , not after the first forty years ? " " Oh , I do n't mind how I work so long as I 've got my own place . And I can scrub too . I 'm stronger than you think for , mister . And time 's no object neither . Well , I do n't need so much sleep as I did . Six o'clock I 'll start and bring my own bucket , a shilling an hour . " I WANTED to look at my treasure , my masterpiece , but the Christians were still blocking up the door , and the lights were too low to see in the scullery . " No hurry , mam , " I said . " We ca n't get out till the crowd moves , and what 's the harm with here . It 's warm , it 's friendly , and we know what we know . We 're old at this game , why rush off from a good place to a worse ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door in the street above , I suppose it had come for the skate , and its lights were sliding across the whitewash of the area wall toward the scullery window . In another few seconds , if I did not move , I knew I should be able to take another peep at my maiden . And I wanted a peep very badly . For , as no doubt you 've noticed , though a chap has looked at his girl a thousand times in an hour , he always wants to look again . To see what she 's like , what she 's really like , once and for all . I could n't wait another minute . The beam was swinging and I prodded my nose at the bottle . Yes , yes , I thought , there she is . And then the light came full glare , and damme if I could see anything but a beer bottle with a lot of dirty scratches on the label , a nasty mess . I was so surprised that I let it drop on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor old frame beside me quiverlike an angel 's harp . " Come on , Mother , " I said , " time to get back to it , " and I placed myself humbly in the Christian stream , rolling its sons away . 0 F ALL the damned fools , I thought , to be caught that way at my age . But it was no use abusing myself to show how wise I was and restore my self-confidence . My bottom had dropped right out and nothing could put it back . I consisted simply of a big dark hole full of windy passages and swinging doors with broken locks . " I beg your pardon , " I said , as one of the Christians trod on My foot . " Excuse me , " I said as two of them combined , by a mutual instantaneous movement of brotherly sympathy , to grind together the fragments of my hollow ruin , and squeeze out the rest of my machinery . " I 'm awfully sorry , I fear I pushed you . " Thus encouraged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my liver . I was pierced by such an agonizing spasm in the lower belly that I thought , ah , gone at last , done for , ruptured , unless it 's appendicitis . Only ten minutes ago I should have been grieved by this miserable and lingering end to a promising career . Yes , promising freely . But now I 'm glad . The more I suffer , the more I shall be delighted . Because I asked for it I strove to seize the inmost form With ardor fierce and hands of flame But burst the crystal cabinet And like a weeping babe became . Boo-hoo , hoo . Suddenly I noticed that the agony in my belly was old Faithful 's umbrella . And I was just going to mention it to her when we were both ejected into the dustbins . And I saw that she was in some distress . " Why marn , " I said , " what 's the trouble ? " for my grief grieved for all the babes in the world . " Oh , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . " " It 's a difficult question , mam , " I said , for I was n't going to have it on my conscience that I broke up a family , " and you 've got to consider Ady 's feelings too . She 's been a good daughter to you . " " Oh , but she 's that obstinate , mister . Oh , these girls , especially the good ones , they go on just like fire engines . " " To tell you the truth , mam , and speaking entirely for yourself and not for the church and the future of civilization , I 'd say , take your brush and your bucket and slip off to some new professional beat , and put up a new plate in a new name . And to hell with Ady . " For I felt my doors banging and I did n't care a Saturday shave for the Pope of Rome . " Yes , mam , " I said , " because it 's nice to be nobody , it 's grand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But just then I noticed the street lamp falling on a red door with a brass handle , and a slight earthquake banged all the doors in my interior . So that the wind pouring through the keyholes played a soft chord rather like the Siegfried horn . o , I SAID to myself , not on your life . I 'm a free ruin , an irresponsible ort without a care in the world . To hell with composition . And I said to the old woman , " Tell them you 'll die in your damp , and take up your bucket and beat it for dear life . " " Oh , you do n't know Ady , she 'd come after me  --  there ought to be a law against it . " " There is , " I said , and the Siegfried motif was so loud that I spoke with great firmness , averting my eyes from the red door . " A lot of laws . Love , including family love , is fifty different kinds of offense according to age , sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But after an , homes are paved with acts of Parliament ? " I looked boldly at the red door , to tell it where it got off , and instantly it blushed pink . The Siegfried song burst into a full orchestra and my corridors bulged with white waistcoats . Another England there I saw Another London with its Tower . " And as for art , " I said , " it comes under the head of undomestic animals , to be shot at sight with airguns , catapults , pisspots , coal , shoes , double-breasted Purdys , crossbows , rods , tear gas , case-hardened bureaucrats with their noses-filed off , blister bombs , art-crickets , Mark IV 's , complete , with their balls in their waistcoat pockets , capax epi , scopari , andall other missiles accredited under the next act , in retrospect , with the exception of those listed in the Minister 's secret administrative ukase , subsection 999 , fertilizers required in the present emergency , floreat in aeternum , for the production of cabbages for the production of members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fertilizers and the general expedition of the starry wheels , and yet it goes on  --  like rats , bugs , moths , and beetles  --  it goes on biting and digging and scratching and undermining everything . " 64 MY soul , mister , wherever is that bus , " and she was crying dry , like an old dog . " Oh , but I do n't want to go to bed . " Just then the bus came along and I heaved her into it . " Good-by , Mother , good luck with the brush  --  God help you if you 'll let him . " But she did n't even look . She did n't even hear . She 'd forgotten her meeting . She 'd forgotten me , her old new friend . She projected herself half way down the bus at one umbrella charge , and her eyes and bonnet and nose and chin were all racing each other to get in front , to get nearer home . And it struck me all at once that the poor old thing was old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of affairs . I felt for the poor old battle and then I felt for myself to make sure that I was not slipping away , while no one was looking , into my grave . And when I found myself , I found myself quite confused , as if I had lost something . My youth , I thought , good gracious . But no , it was my pink . And when , all in a sweat of fear , I stretched out my neck to look for her , she popped out from behind the red door and stood there , the darling , in nothing but her pure self . Ali , how like a true pink , so simple , so frank , so trustful . No more pouts , no more secrets between us any more . I fairly flew to her , The maid had caught me in the wild Where I was dancing merrily . " My beauty , " I cried , " my fulfillment , my life , I have you at last , and you shall have me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , STOP HER , SOMEONE . STOP DARLING , DAMN YOU , DARLING . "
