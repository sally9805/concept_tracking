SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 370 pp. ) - Harold Lamb-Doubleday ( $5 ) . <P> <P> For a few wild weeks in the summer of 1529 , it seemed to be the end of Europe . The Unspeakable Turk , Sultan Suleiman Khan , had smashed the Hungarian capital of Buda and thundered on , 170 incredible miles in one week , to the gates of Vienna . In an instant , Europe broke off its feuds . France and the Holy Roman Empire patched up a quick truce ; even the Pope and Martin Luther buried the ecclesiastical mace for the time being . Twenty days later it was all over , and everybody felt a bit silly . The invader packed up his plunder and poled off down the Danube . <P> But the career of Sultan Suleiman ( rhymes with rule a don ) , last of the great Osmanli Turks , was just beginning . Harold Lamb 's biographical narrative , Suleiman the Magnificent , tells the story of his reign with the skill that has made Lamb 's retraces of history ( from Genghis Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular in print . <P> By the time of the great raid on Austria , Suleiman had begun to suspect that the Turk had ridden as far as he could on the road of conquest , and that it was time to squat on the carpet of diplomacy and consolidate the great adventure into a great state . Accordingly , the Sultan struck alliances with France and Venice , reorganized the legal code , expanded the educational system , opened his borders to European immigration , and announced the pax Turcica . <P> The pax was ably defended by a small , deadly force of janissaries ( most of them Christian children , adopted by the state , and trained in fanatical devotion to the Sultan ) and by the new Turkish fleet . Under a pair of swashbuckling corsairs , Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa and Dragut , the Mediterranean was swept clean , for more than a century , of European fleets. * <P> Yet even before Suleiman 's long reign ( 1520-66 ) was ended , the Turk had a taste of the maladies ( corruption , harem government ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history forced him into the role of a bureaucratizer , a Turkish Diocletian , and he filled it ably . He showed mercy to his enemies , and was remarkably faithful to his wife . He was , in fact , a quite speakable fellow . <P> <P> * Though not without trials &; errors . Legend records that one Turkish admiral , sent out with orders to capture Malta , returned to Constantinople after a long and fruitless cruise to report : " Malta yoq there is no Malta !
