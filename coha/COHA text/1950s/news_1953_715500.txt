txt PUSAN , Korea , June 6 ? Now that a truce in Korea appears to ' be drawing near , there is a vast , difference in what the prisoners on opposite sides have to look forward to . In many cases the Communist captives are living better than they did before they were captured . Their food is better , they are warmly clad in cold weather and they have adequate medical attention . But in spite of this improvement over their usual circumstances a majority of those still in captivity remain regimented . " Follow-the-Leader " The attitude of most of them is the same  --  the " follow the leader " philosophy adopted by the members of the Communist legions in Korea . Fear , of course , has a great deal to do with this . Without pressure , many of the seemingly belligerent , " dyed in the wool " Communists would be as democratic as the average soldier of the Republic of Korea forces . However , eyen in the prison camps well-formed Communist cells function . Those who refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . Though word of the events at Panmunqom has filtered through every week or so to the Communist prisoners of war held in South Korean compounds , the information generally has been meager ' and slanted to suit the purpose of Communist dispatchers in the north . The news has been traveling through the guerrilla chain of command in the South Korean hill country . Many efforts have been made to break up this news transmission line but in a war-ridden country like this the task is virtually impossible . Whatever information has seeped through to the Communist prisoners has left them unchanged . This week they were obstinate , sullen and disorderly as usual . Few Signs of Change Over all , the pattern of behavior has remained exactly as it was three months , six months , or even a year ago . The men inside the enclosures are doing all in their power to create incidents  --  even , in some cases , when almost certain death will result  --  to make their ' United Nations captors appear1 tyrannical and bestial in the eyes of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Koje , or any one of Corn- , munist prison camps around the southern tip of the peninsula and revisited it again this week would ' have noticed almost no change except in the weather . The men look the same , eat the same and get the same well-administered medical care . The same group , with perhaps a few new faces among them , squat around on their haunches and glower sullenly at any and all visitors . The guards are usually ignored until such time as word is passed for some sort of unruliness or demonstration . This may come in the form of noise or extreme violence . Organized Rebellion One direct indication of organized rebellion in the camps came to light about a week prior to formal announcement of " Little Switch . " Even before details of the arrangement for the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners were made known , the Communist prisoners had the news . There was no excitement , no noticeable elation . They seemed only to be awaiting further orders . The behavior of the Communists was completely contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north when they heard the news . Since returning , the United Nations prisoners have testified that they were overwhelmed at the time and could hardly believe their ears . Shortly afterward the Chinese and North Korean captives began to act up . Apparently the word had been passed along . First , some refused to eat , then others among the crippled threw away their crutches or wooden legs . One incident after another was created in a last-minute effort to discredit the United Nations . " Little Switch " and After When the North Koreans and ' Chinese to be repatriated had been chosen , the trouble really began . Prisoner behavior was so bad that the casual observer could mistakenly assume that they did not ' want to be returned to their ' ' homelands . As soon as the new clothing issue was made , many began tearing and slashing their outfits . Some refused to shave , others let their hair grow as long as possible , and still others refused even to wash . Their obvious objective was to look as beaten , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switch " was completed that type of mass behavior has died down . Incidents continue , however . Every few days a riot occurs to mar the routine at one compound or another . These demonstrations definitely are not spontaneous . They are master-minded from north of the battle line , and directives are passed through guerrilla channels . Problem for Army Strangely enough , there is little the Army can do to stop this type of information from filtering through . There is a classification here known as " line crossers " who spy on and for both sides . Some of the South Koreans who are suspected of having guerrilla connections are also sources of information about the enemy , and the Army is reluctant to act against them and thereby cut off this source of information .
