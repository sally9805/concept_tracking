THE NEW REPUBLIC Correspondence Those Cranberries Sirs : The editorial " Those Cranberries " in the November 3o issue was a considerable surprise . Its thesis is that the " cranberry episode " is a calculated attempt to warn the food industry that it must persuade Congress to remove from basic food and drug law the prohibition on cancer-producing substances ( as contained in the Delaney Amendment ) . This may or may not be so ? I do not think it is so ? but in any case here is a direct quotation from information furnished to state health departments with Secretary Flemming 's original release on cranberries . Mr. Flemming is speaking , directly to the principle of the Delaney Amendment : " The application of this principle is necessary in our opinion because while in theory there may be a minute quantity of a carcinogen which is safe in foods , in actuality our scientists do not know whether this is true or how to establish a safe tolerance . " Therefore we would oppose any attempt to take the cancer clause out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a clause in the color bill which is now before the Congress . " Until such time as it should be proved that Mr. Flemming is a most devious and perfidious individual , the above should , in my opinion , be taken as an honest statement of the position of the department . May I , from the body of your editorial , take three statements which I believe to be either untrue or misleading ? 1 . " Recent additions to the basic Food and Drug laws are unworkable . " This sentence presumably refers to the Delaney Amendment . Who says it is unworkable ? And why on earth should The New Republic take the statement for revealed truth ? The amendment is a reasonable attempt to keep carcinogens out of food . There is no reason of which I know that standard tests and processes may not be set up for all new chemicals , that chemicals showing any trace of cancer-producing properties may not be rigidly excluded from food , and that approved chemicals which eventually prove to be carcinogens may not be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , and of course it can not be enforced with very great precision , but it still appears to be a worthwhile addition to services that protect consumers . To say that the law is unworkable is to say in effect that the public might as well throw up its hands and agree to henceforth eat whatever the food industry puts before it . EXperience has shown ( from the days of embalmed beef right down to the present ) that this is a risky proposition ? increasingly risky in the future in view of the accelerating technology of the food industry . 2 . " The cranberry people have pointed out that it is impossible for a man to eat enough aminotriazole ? even over a lifetime ? to suffer a rat 's fate . " In the food and drug control business , one learns to be wary of all statements proceeding directly from a commercial interest , as they are likely to be tinged with bias . ( The " tobacco people " still maintain that cigarettes do not lead to cancer . ) In medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " impossible " about anything connected with the reactions of a large population of people . Tests for carcinogenicity of aminotriazole have been carried out on a small number of laboratory animals , and the only thing that we know with certainty is that it produced cancer of the thyroid in some of them . We do not know whether or not human beings are less susceptible , twice as susceptible or 5o times as susceptible as rats . We do not know that certain people are not exquisitely sensitive to the effect of the chemical . We do not know whether the effect of aminotriazole is not magnified by other substances in the ordinary diet of humans but not of rats and mice . We do not know that young children as a group are not much more susceptiblethan mature humans . And finally and most particularly , we do not know the mechanism of the production of cancer , by aminotriazole or anything else . The thyroids of our youngest children , for example , have already been insulted by a considerable intake of radioactive iodine during the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk has been contaminated by fallout . Is it impossible that the insult ; of minute amounts of aminotriazolej added to the insult of radioactive iodine ; and added perhaps to other insults wej do n't know about yet , will result in al number of cases of cancer of the thyroid 25 years from now ? In the face of our abysmal ignorance only a knave or a fool could use the word " impossible . " Scientifically speak-f ing , the situation with aminotriazole is something like this . The manufacturersi in the mid-5o 's , carried out feeding tests on a small number of laboratory animals over a short period of time All went well , and the compound was released for use and approved by the Departi ment of Agriculture in 1956 . The manu4 facturer 's tests were then in effect greatly expanded : the population of the'i United States became his test animals , and the duration of the test was creased indefinitely . Any reputablei scientist , on the cranberry payroll or ; any other , will tell you that when youi increase your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred lion , and from a few years to decades , ; you are likely to come up with some ; new and interesting data . It is fortunate ; that in this case the carcinogenic prop-t erties of the chemical were first recog- ' nized in laboratory animals ? in 1959. 3 . " FDA may soon be forced to create pandemonium in the food industry by outlawing perhaps hundreds of additives , although scientists believe them safe in the quantities now used . " Who are the scientists ? You are The ) , New Republic and not Godey 's Lady'si Book , and you should know that there are scientists and scientists , and that ' some of them have strong commerciali biases , and that there are often majori differences of opinion among equallyi well-qualified persons . Justification is perhaps the essence of the whole business . Life is full of risks ; and human beings accept them in reDECEMBER 28 , 1959 turn for gains that may be realized . The real question in the cranberry episode is : does the consumer realize any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ( apparently small ) hazards to his health ? If this question is answered in the affirmative , it is then necessary to ask : does the consumer realize such cumulative gains from the use of hundreds or thousands of potential carcinogens in his diet as to outweigh the cumulative hazard to his health that they involve ? If one 's answer to this question is in the affirmative , then one can afford to be complacent about the eventual fate of the Delaney Amendment . If the Delaney Amendment should go , the floodgates will be opened . If there is one thing certain in this business , it is that the food industry will ever more rapidly proliferate its use of new complex synthetic chemicals ? insecticides , rodenticides , weedicides , antibiotics , fungicides , softeners , humectants , antioxidants , etc. ? and that these chemicals will leave residues in food . The eventual effect of this compulsory dosage will probably not be felt by magazine editors comfortably past middle age , but it will bear on their descendants . I should think , in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one might expect it to champion the cause of the consumer , to work for the rigid control of all chemical additives , and to fight for the Delaney Amendment until the death . While an absolute ban on carcinogens might seem " impractical " at this time , you will surely be aware that The New Republic has supported many " impractical " causes in its time , that are now an accepted part of our social structure . Geoffrey Martin , M.D. Kansas State Board of Health In reply With respect to Dr. Martin 's points : i . The Delaney Amendment is well-intentioned but unworkable because several foods naturally contain traces of known carcinogens . Shellfish contain arsenic ; arsenic is at present permitted in given amounts in prepared foods ; the ' Delaney Amendment would ban arsenic - a carcinogen ? from prepared foods but not from the shellfish which contain larger proportionate amounts of arsenic . There are so many substances that can be made to cause cancer under certain conditions that enforcement of the Amendment 's absolute and undiscriminating prohibition would cause chaos in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaney Amendment is unworkable is not , as Dr. Martin states , " to say in effect that the public might as well throw up its hands and agree to henceforth eat whatever the foods industry puts before it . " On the contrary , as the FDA explained when it opposed the Delaney Amendment on first proposal , its arbitrary nature stands in the way of the kind of discriminating and flexible enforcement the complex food industry requires . The basic Pure Food and Drug law places on the industry the burden of proving to the FDA that products are safe , and FDA scientists are capable of weighing that evidence in the public interest . 2 . Dr. Martin here is questioning the validity of the tests and the wisdom of proceeding without more data . This is a sound position , but at some point administrators must make a judgment , while scientists may hold and attempt to prove a minority opinion . The question of Strontium-90 he raises is irrelevant . Of course , the need for more information on the long-term effects of radiation and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until those facts are established is clear , as The New Republic has long said . The unknown danger from fallout is not the problem here , however ; it is the contaminating effects of food additives , about which a great deal is known . 3 . Scientific opinion , as Dr. Martin points out , is seldom , if ever , unanimous , but it has sometimes been unanimously wrong . But to cite the positions of the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration in the cranberry case as an instance of experts coming to opposite conclusions is incorrect . Agriculture scientists approved the aminotriazole weed killer for use under set conditions ; FDA scientists later recommended condemning food containing its residue . But their mandates were technically different . Agriculture was out to find a better weed killer ; FDA , to guarantee the purity of the resulting product . Our concern is that policing power be unified in the agency whose first allegiance is to the consumer . THE EDITORS Birth Control and Bigotry Sirs : I am sure that most of the opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through periodic continence , might concede that at some time in the history of our country or in some future political campaign , the argument over artificial birth control might be a legitimate issue in a national election . However , that time is not now . So far as the present state of America is concerned , including the election which lies ahead in 1960 , any public dispute concerning artificial birth control is , as both President Eisenhower and ex-President Truman have labeled it , a " false " issue . But , I am afraid , it may be more than just false ; it may be a contrived , issue , and therefore a fraudulent one . There are disturbing circumstances which suggest that the issue may have been raised for the purpose of masquerading an opposition to the Presidential aspirations of Senator John Kennedy , which otherwise would stand exposed as an opposition arising solely out of undiluted religious bigotry . The evidence which gives rise to such a suspicion is as follows : It is true that Roman Catholics believe , as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like euthanasia ( mercy killing ) , abortion , and remarriage after divorce , violates fundamental principles of the natural law ( promulgated by the Divinity ) . However , as both Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas teach us , man is a societal animal . Accordingly , in the words of Jesus of Nazareth , men in society must " render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's . " In short , even though a particular law of a state might offend the natural law in some respect , it is nevertheless to be obeyed , unless its enactment so violently offends principles of the natural law and so gravely frustrates man 's nature and the achievement of his divine destiny as to make disobedience or non-application of the law the lesser of the two evils confronting the individual , whether he be citizen or law-maker . That is why , for example , a Catholic judge can grant a divorce , or a Catholic legislator vote in favor of an amendment to the divorce statute of his state . It is also the reason why a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administer a foreign-aid program which authorized the dispensation of artificial birth control information to foreign countries desiring it . I think we can assume that these elementary principles of Catholic theology are known to Bishop Pike and to the other clergymen who publicly called upon Senator Kennedy to answer their question as to whether he would be bound by the tenets of his religion if the birth control issue were presented to him as President . Such of these clergymen who ever studied comparative theology must have known in advance what Senator Kennedy 's answer , as an educated Catholic , necessarily would be . It appears , then , that they might have been more interested in the accusatory inference contained in the question than in the Senator 's answer to it . For the question only , not his answer , could not help but injure Senator Kennedy 's opportunities for nomination and election to the Presidency . I think it unfortunate that outstanding Protestant clergymen may have thus unintentionally lent their offices to the perpetuation of a false issue , and one which , unless carefully dissected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of much of the opposition to Senator Kennedy 's candidacy , i.e. , the fact that he is a practicing Roman Catholic . Alfred L. Scanlon Bethesda , Maryland Sirs : TRB 's article on " A Grave Sin " ( December 14. ) opens by saying " . . there is no use mincing words . . . " and " . the more matter-of-factly and frankly this matter is discussed the better . " I quite agree . A free and viable society demands frank discussion , but it also requires full , open , and lucid discussion based on fact . Just what does TRB mean when he cites a secondary source to the effect that " Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia intervened to block Kennedy 's scheduled appearance at an inter-faith meeting . " Intervened how , or why , or in what manner ? Or again , TRB claims Catholics in Massachusetts and Connecticut have " . . attempted to interfere by law in the relationship between doctor and patient . " How , in what manner , and for what reason ? If TRB insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner that avoids inferences of some sort of subversive techniques on the parties in question . One final word . If we of the West can think of no more dynamic program than birth control , then we are in serious jeopardy . Robert L. Zangrando Philadelphia , Penna . Sirs : If TRB , in opposition to the bishops , thinks that an American-sponsored contraceptive program for the underdeveloped countries is an effective solution to our population problem , let him establish his point . . . . I spent about thirteen years in the Far East , two of them under Communism in China , and my experience and observation tell me that such a program would be politically disastrous . The Communists would have a field-day holding it up to the peoples of Asia and Africa as another sneaky trick of " American imperialism " to insure continued world domination for ourselves . . . . And , please , TRB , where are these priests who claim the " right to lay down Presidential policy " ? I think it 's reasonable to assume that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the priests I know claim only the right of any citizen in a democracy in formulating Presidential policy ? the right of persuasion or opposition , no more than the right TRB exercises week after week in NR . . If TRB thinks Catholic bishops are second-class citizens or disenfranchised citizens , why does n't he say so , if he does n't believe in " mincing words " ? Leon Sullivan , O.F.M. Peoria State Hospital Peoria , Illinois Epistle to the Columbians Sirs : There was something very moving and also ( or perhaps and therefore ) very important about Hans Morgenthau 's letter ( December 21 ) to the students of the university where I teach : I hope some of them were listening . I should say : I hope the right ones were listening because what Mr. Morgenthau said does not apply to all , and perhaps not even to a majority . I say this not because I have made a count ( that could hardly help ) but because I note that Mr. Morgenthau has missed out one whole side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its decision on Mr. Van Doren ( and on this I do not wish to give my own opinion here ) , surely there is something to be said for the principle ! ( this too is a principle ) that one does not ; hit a man when he is down ? I am sorry , if students go in for all this nonsense of withholding their names ( who are they afraid of ? ) , but I am glad they feel sym- ; pathy for failure rather than for the ; triumph of righteousness . As to where some of the students mayj have gone wrong , let me illustrate fromi , an experience at Columbia during thei past few weeks . I asked some 120 un- dergraduates , in a quiz , whether ones must regard Trigorin in Chekhov 's The Sea Gull as necessarily a bad writer . Al large number said " Yes " on the grounds that he had n't a very good character ! An equally large number said " No " o the grounds that he was famous . These two sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American or perhaps just Modern ? heresies . Onei group takes it for granted that talent , appears only in unusually upright individuals ; another group that fame alon j is sufficient evidence of merit . If yolk take these two idiocies , you can undern stand a lot about the affaire Van Doren . For example , you can realize that it was above all an affaire of the America public , and not of one teacher at ColumI bia University . Even before the guilt ol Mr. Van Doren was known , a taxi drivel spent twenty minutes telling me hol furious his wife was with Mr. Vart Doren . She felt betrayed . And why  --  if I may cut that long story short ? Be. , cause he had deprived her of certain it4 lusions . I replied : then she would be , grateful to him . The driver seemed a little taken aback for a second , then , as a taxi-driver must n't be taken aback longer than that , said : Yeh , she 's crazy ; But probably she is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has n't " done anything " and therefore can not be fired by a board of trustees " which anyway has little control over wives as such . But if there is justice , as it were , Above , ( and Mr. Morgenthal believes there is ) , I think it may be harder , when the time comes , on th Betrayed in such cases than it will o the Betrayer . In any event , it is not curious that th taxi-driver 's wife , who now loathes Mr Van Doren , subscribes to the same here sies as Columbia students , many o DECEMBER 28 , 1959 whom would like to see him reinstated ? The real moral is that we should reconsider fame and merit , character and talent ? at least to the point of avoiding idiocy . Eric Bentley New York , N. Y. Franco and His Opponents 5irs : I came back in September from the Iberian Peninsula and I assure you that Ian Gilmour 's article on Spain ( November 3o ) contains no error of fact or feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower 's trip is already having on the Spanish Liberals : one of them in a recent letter said that America and democracy had lost thousands of young men in Spain with that trip . In my despair as a Liberal ( and you know that in Spain this term Liberal has acquired again a resounding and proud meaning ) ? thinking about what could be done to tell the Franco opposition that in this country there were many who are with Liberal Spain ? came your number with the Gilmour article . I am going to order as many copies as I can afford and send them by first class mail to Spain . I have enough names ? I know personally most of the people mentioned . Thank you so much for having published Mr. Gilmour 's report : it is a truly historical event , for the Liberals of Spain at least . Juan Marichal Cambridge , Mass .

Pedro X. , born in 1905 , is a cabinet-maker . He fought on the front throughout the Civil War and returned to his home at its end . He was ' seized by the Gestapo in March , 1942 , and was accused of being a spy for the Allies . He was taken to Madrid and detained until 1944 . After being released he was seized again and taken to Pamplona and imprisoned . He was released and walked 25o kilometers to get home . He fled to France , fell ill ' in February , 1956 , and is now completely paralyzed .
