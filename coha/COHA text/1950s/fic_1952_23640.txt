Leonie A Story by Dan Wickenden . Drawings by Tom O'Sullivan 44ou got here first , for once , " the cashier said when he stopped at her desk to buy cigarettes , and while he was hanging up his hat and coat the waitress said it too . They smiled the same kind of smile , the two stout women , approving and friendly and a little fatuous . We 're individuals to them now , he thought , and they take pride in us , as though they were responsible for having brought us together . They may even remember us for a little while , after we stop coming here for lunch . He was a lean young man , with dense darkish hair that started low on his forehead , and his heavy eyebrows gave him a faintly saturnine look as he sat at a table by the window , staring out at the large slow snowflakes falling on wet sidewalks and wet asphalt , at the periodically clotting traffic and the gray buildings opposite . While people drifted by twos and threes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for Leonie Hofstra to arrive as on so many days , ever since last June , Leonie had waited for him . B UT on that unseasonably hot June day she had n't been waiting for anybody , as he knew from the remote withdrawn way she sat there , hunched a little forward as though to enclose herself in privacy . Because he was in a hurry and there was nowhere else to sit , he pulled out the empty chair at her table and said , " May I ? " She looked so white and tired and so preposterously scared that he could n't help talking to her while he ate , trying to lull away her fear and make her forget the thick dead heat and how tired she felt . She was very plain , he thought at first , but then he saw no woman clearly because of the hard sharp image he carried in his head . Only a small slim black-haired girl could be beautiful , and this one was large and almost blond . Dark-rimmed spectacles magnified her hazel eyes , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lipstick , were almost gray , hardly darker than her skin . At first she did n't respond at all , but only stared at him sometimes with those eyes which would have been abnormally large even without the magnifying lenses . Little by little , though , she relaxed , and presently she smiled and began to make a few half-stifled remarks ; and maybe it was flattered vanity as much as pity for her which made him ask if she lunched here often and suggest their meeting again tomorrow at the same time . He should have known right then that the thing to do was to go to another restaurant the next day , but he was new to the town , feeling bereft and sorry for himself , and something about her had stirred his curiosity . And then on the second day , and the third , he found talking to her so remarkably easy . She would listen with a faint dreaming smile , and she had a faculty for making out of her shyness exactly the right comment or asking exactly the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing impatience by eleven each morning ; by twelve , when he left the office and walked up Main Street to the restaurant , he would be aware of something almost like anxiety , and then of an odd reassurance because he so often found her there , waiting at the table in the window . And after three weeks or a month , the casual encounters seemed not quite enough , and he asked her to go to the movies with him . At that there was a sudden return of her first diffidence . Looking away from him , she said she did n't know ; she murmured something about her mother , and took a sip of water . Then , setting down the glass with an air of having reached some momentous decision , she said stiffly and primly , " Yes , of course I will . Thank you , Mr. Wayne . I 'd love to go . " But she would n't let him call for her . When they met outside the theater she seemed awkward and distant again  --  so obviously afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might begin to make advances , and so uncertain in her own mind about how to cope with such a situation , that he did n't even take her arm as they climbed the carpeted stairs to the balcony . They sat as far from each other as the seats would allow , and he saw little of what passed across the screen because he was so aware of her presence , or perhaps of her own taut awareness of him . He had decided by then that she was more attractive than he 'd first thought . Now that the image in his head was dimmed a little he could see that Leonie Hofstra was strong and well made , and heliked listening to her voice , which was quite different from the metallic female bray so common in this part of the country , and when she forgot herself enough to laugh spontaneously her whole face changed and came alive . Sitting now so close to and so distant from her , he felt his pity turning into exasperation because for some reason she could n't think of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up the barrier between them . W HEN they emerged into the warm evening it was still not much past nine o'clock and a faint pallor remained in the sky , but she refused to go anywhere for a drink or even for a soda ; so he insisted on escorting her home , determined somehow to end his sense of Frustration . They rode first on one bus and then on another , and afterward walked several blocks beneath the dense-leaved trees of some outlying suburban section where children still played in the dark and their elders sat , like immobilized sea creatures in an aquarium , along dimly-lit screened porches . But no lights shone out from the small narrow house up whose front walk she eventually led him , and the complete darkness ended his scruples . He would not let her shut him away on the outside of the screen door at the top of the porch steps , but followed her through , slid one arm around her waist , and pulled her toward him . After her instanta-lt would be a relief , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . neous recoil she began to yield and half gave him her mouth ; and then he felt how , by a great effort of will , she suppressed what had begun to come alive and forced herself to go rigid in his arms . Yet because she made no attempt to draw away , he believed she would submit meekly to whatever he chose to do next ; so that when there was a sudden creak of wicker at the far end of the porch , and lights came on , she was still in his arms . Standing enormous and grotesque in a glade of potted plants , under a whole string of Japanese lanterns , her mother said calmly , " Well , you 're back early . A whole lot earlier than I expected . " Moved helplessly to laughter , he released Leonie and hoped she might laugh too ; but she stood blinking through the glasses , putting up one hand to touch her disarrayed hair , and looked as bewildered as though she had abruptly been set down in familiar territory after a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which he could hear a boy 's voice chanting , down the dark street , " Come in come in wherever you are ! " The same words he had chanted himself on hot summer evenings long ago , through endless games of hide-in-the-dark . Then Leonie said , " I 'll get some lemonade , " and plunged into the house . " Beer , for Pete 's sake ! " her mother shouted after her . " Bring us some beer , Leonie . " Turning , she said , " So you 're Harry Wayne . Pleased to meet you . Sit down , Harry , make yourself at home . If you 'd stayed out a little later I 'd have been in bed , the coast would have been clear . " With a pink-slippered foot , she jerked forward one of the wicker chairs . " You may not believe me , but this is the first time a man ever kissed her , as far as I know  --  and she 's twenty-eight years old . You 're a little younger , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank heavily on a sagging porch swing piled with bloated cretonne cushions . Although her own body looked as bloated , her face was thin , with a great bony nose around which her close-set eyes appeared to squint slightly ; her hair was black too , and looked unreal  --  it was a wig if it was n't dyed , he decided , and he grinned at her as he sat down . " Or twenty-six , maybe . At the outside . " " That 's right . Twenty-six a couple of months ago , " he said . " And not at all what I expected , either . She said you had a sensitive face . Sensitive , my Lord , it 's her favorite word , " said Mrs. Hofstra , and let out a derisive hoot , while her little black eyes went on inspecting him  --  with relish , it seemed . " Honest to gosh , I expected some skinny stoop-shouldered four-eyed kid with a bad complexion , who 'd sit and wave his hands around and talk about poetry or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Astonishingly at ease with her , he shook his head and said , " Basketball , though . " " Oh , well , that 's a tough game too , the way they play it now . You 're working in that advertising agency , Leonie says . Good job , I imagine , coming from back East like you do . But I ca n't figure out why you 'd choose a dump like this . " " It 's a nice town , " he said easily . " A nice town , sure , and Leonie 's a nice girl , is n't she ? Altogether too nice , if you ask me , " said Mrs. Hofstra , pushing at the floor with her slippered feet , so that the swing moved gently back and forth . " It 's her father 's fault . He was sensitive , he talked about poetry . Wrote some , too , had it printed in the paper , and then he spent a small fortune getting it made into a book . Five hundred copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still up attic . " She hooted again , but in anger . " Honest to gosh , the times I had with that man ! A bookkeeper , but he wrote these poems , and he was crazy about nature . They 'd go out hiking , him and Leonie , winter and summer , and come back with their feet wet , and catch cold . Colds , grippe , flu , the two of them , all winter long . Not that I do n't like plants , myself , " said Mrs. Hofstra , waving her great quivering bolster of an arm at the fern stands , the hanging pots of ivy and philodendron , the rampant moonvines beyond the screen . " But there arc limits . I ca n't tell one bird from another , and what 's more I do n't care . " But when Leonie returned to the porch , unease returned with her . Mrs. Hofstra fell silent and gulped at her beer with a kind of moody gusto . Leonie , stiff and upright on the edge of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death the only escape . He himself escaped into the dark as soon as he decently could . He might have escaped forever if habit had n't drawn him back to the restaurant the next day . There . Leonie 's tranquil smile seemed to expunge what had happened , so that he did n't even say he liked her mother . It was true , though : lie had responded not just to Mrs. Hofstra 's approval of him but to her coarse vitality . But he knew that although she was n't the typical possessive mother he 'd expected  --  that she was in fact consumed by a desire to thrust Leonie into any man 's arms and so be rid of her  --  she was bad for her ; and he decided he had embarked , willy-nilly , on a crusade to set Leonie free . So they went on having lunch together ; he took her to the movies again ; on clear weekends they rode a bus to the small lake on the eastern edge of the town , where he hired a canoe and paddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eventually he was asked to dinner by Mrs. Hofstra . It was an , enormous meal , for which he had no appetite because of the heat and because the dim interior of the house , choked with overstuffed furniture and as many plants as the porch , gave him a feeling of claustrophobia . Here Lennie had lived for twenty-eight years : how was it she had n't languished and died , stifled as her father must have been ? But she would never escape , he thought , unless into marriage ; he could n't offer himself as a husband , but he believed he could make marriage possible for her by demonstrating that all men are not predatory , that there can be a placid as well as an agitating companionship between a man and a woman . Toward the end of the meal , billowing now above the wreckage of a monstrous raspberry shortcake , jabbing into her mouth with a toothpick fished from a ruby glass container , Mrs. Hofstra looked at him speculatively and said , " I 've been thinking , Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you could hire one , maybe . Some friends of mine , they own a cottage out there , at the big lake  --  do n't use it much and I have a key . You and Leonie could drive out Sunday , have a picnic , and goswimming . That 's wonderful swimming there . Leonie 's crazy about the water , and you 'd like it , too , " she said , smiling . Her little black eyes seemed to move in even closer toward the great nose : it was almost a leer , so that he flushed in the stifling green gloom , and was surprised because Leonie appeared so serene . B UT perhaps Mrs. Hofstra was gifted with hypnotic powers , for he heard himself agreeing . He hired the car and on Sunday drove Leonie west to the big lake , and while they talked about the me:tly dull flat country and the mostly dismal small towns through which they passed , it was as though they shared a joke against her mother . He believed his crusade was beginning to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite at ease . By the time they reached the cottage , which stood among trees on the dunes above the lake , a scurf of high thin clouds had been swept off by the wind , and the new clarity and freshness , the wild brightness of sun and ruffled water , seemed to infect Leonie , who laughed at him over her shoulder as she put the key in the lock , and said , " We 'd better observe the proprieties , I suppose . There 's a bathhouse down by the beach , Harry : you could change there . ' ' " Right . " He told himself he did n't feel rebuffed , that this was as he wanted things ; and he marched off whistling . He waited a long time on the white sand , gazing out into watery distances so much like ocean distances that the lack of any salt tang in the air bothered him ; and when he turned and saw her corning down the rickety wooden steps  --  slowly and carefully because she had left off her glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .. What there was of Leonie 's bathing suit fitted her like a silver sheath , and her body was as good as he had suspected . Without the glasses and with her hair swept up and tied hack , her face looked quite unfamiliar ; there was a great purity in the lines of brow and cheek and chin . And she moved toward him across the sand with strength and grace , as though , having shed her clothes , she had shed inhibitions too . For just an instant she stood smiling at him , wide-eyed , permitting herself to be admired , so that he felt no pity at all . To himself lie said that she was almost beautiful ; and to her he said , - Hey , that 's quite a bathing suit . " Now the wide eyes evaded his . " Mother bought it for me . All 1 had was an old one , black wool , with moth holes in it . " She turned from him and sprinted into the water . Stranded with the strong new feeling he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while , and saw that she swam well , too , better perhaps than he swam himself . After a long time in the water they lay apart from each other on the sand . The physical ease that followed swimming , and being almost naked in the hot bright light , made him feel wholly sensual . He lay prone , setting his teeth into the back of his hand , telling himself she was n't the kind of woman you could take casually ; if he gave way now , all his work through the last two months would be undone ; and he knew he would never want to marry her himself . Before his involvement should grow any deeper , he decided , he must tell her about Annette . He supposed he should have told her about Annette long ago . Lifting his head , looking past Leonie at the empty sunny solitude , he said , " Your mother asked me , once , why I 'd come out here , but I did n't tell hcr . I 've never toldyou . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusting both hands into her damp hair and unpinning it , lifting it into the wind , so that her breasts rose too ; but it was an innocent and quite unconscious gesture . " I 'm married , Lennie , " he said . " Or I was . And it did n't work out ... Annette , " he said , closing his eyes , " her names Annette . She was going down to Mexico for a divorce , as soon as she could get away . She works too  --  it 's a better job than mine was . Maybe that was one of the troubles . Sometimes I felt like a kept man . Anyway , when we decided to bust up and I heard about the opening here , I figured the best thing to do was leave New York altogether . " Against his closed Lids he tried to see Annette ; he tried to hear her voice and smell the perfume she used ; but for the first time since he had left New York no sort of conjuration worked and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw only an empty bedroom , with her clothing scattered about : she had gone from the room and would not return . She was always untidy , except in herself , but a lot brighter than I am . She made me feel like a fool . An oaf . I could never quite believe she 'd actually broken down and married me . She 's little , Leonie  --  little , quick , pretty , bright . And cruel . " And he was still in love with her  --  obsessed , he told himself , and although he could n't just now discover any trace of that obsession , he said , " One of those women you do n't get over , I guess . " What he did n't say was that , not having heard for a long time from either Annette or her lawyer , he had begun to hope that she might have changed her mind . Because he felt , as he never had before with Leonie , that he was n't in full control of the situation , he wound up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soured me on marriage . " 0 ARING to glance at Leonie , not knowing what to expect , he was disconcerted because she appeared so calm , but perhaps as if she pitied him . To escape from the look in her eyes  --  though that wide intent regard might mean only that without her glasses she was half blind  --  he climbed up to the car to fetch the hamper she had packed . They spread a tablecloth on the sand and set out the sandwiches , the fruit , the paper cups , the bottle of lemonade , and he was almost able to think of her as a little girl on a picnic . There was something naive and outmoded about a picnic of this sort , with no cocktails in a Thermos and nothing to he cooked at an outdoor grill , and he was transported back into his own childhood as he had been by the boy 's voice calling in the dark that night . His childhood in suburban New York must have been much more like Leonie 's than it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned . It had never stopped amusing Annette that he could n't ride a horse , and that until he entered the Army he 'd never fired anything but a BB-gun . He told Leonie about picnics on Long Island beaches , and she said she 'd never seen the ocean ; even the big lake did not help her to imagine what it must be really like . Then at the end of their meal , when a silence fell between them again , she groped in the bottom of the hamper and passed across to him a small gray-bound book . " My father 's . I wanted to show it to you , Harry , " she said . " A Downward Smoke . Poems by Peter Hofstra , " he read aloud , and turned to the dedication . " With love to my little daughter , Leonie , " it said , and there followed , actually , opposite the title page , a photograph of the author . Vanity publishing in excelsis , he thought , looking at the high-domed forehead , and what must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the inconspicuous mustache above the weak mouth and chin . Peter Hofstra stared out as though even the photographer had scared him . " Everybody 's always said I look a good deal like him , Harry , " Leonie said ; and he felt indignant . " Good grief , Leonie , do n't let them hand you that ! When are you going to realize you 're a good-looking woman ? " But seeing that she was hurt for her father 's sake , he began to leaf through the book , reading a stanza here and there , embarrassed because the verses were a blend of Ella Wheeler Wilcox and the most dirge-like kind of hymn . The pity came back , and he said , " It 's nice stuff , in its way . Gentle . He must have been a gentle man . " Smiling at Leonie , he said , " A gentleman , in fact . " " He was , he was , Harry ! " She bent so close that he could smell her clean hair and her sun-warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myopically , laying her hand down on the page , " about the hummingbird . I love this one . He wrote it for my eighteenth birthday . " He had a sudden vision of the small bookkeeper and the tall strong adolescent girl plunging through meadows and swamps and woodlands , with field glasses and butterfly nets ; and that was the closest she 'd ever come to being happy with a man . " Have n't you written any poetry yourself ? " he asked . She shook her head , leaning away from him now . " Oh , I used to try . But I 'm not talented , Harry . " Perhaps it occurred to her , too , that she was saying his name more often than she ever had before . Looking flustered , she began to gather up the picnic litter and pack it methodically back into the hamper . And then she astonished him by saying with sudden intensity , " There 's something terrible about marriage . Something horrible . In the end they always hate each other . They spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing left but that , and it 's worse if there are children ... Harry . Harry , I hope you did n't have any children  --  you and Annette . " " No . " He watched her strong hands , with no varnish on the short-clipped nails , closing the covers of the hamper . " There was hardly time , you might say . But she did n't want children . " He turned and looked out across the water , because he wanted to kiss her hands . " About marriage , though , Leonie . Marriage in general . You 'll have to stop thinking of it like that . " " Flow can I help thinking of it like that ? " As though her hands were aware of his desire , she thrust them into the sand , one on either side of her . " I was almost glad when he died . At first I was actually glad , " she said . Because there was no comfort he dared offer her , he said , " Why do you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hate ? " " I do n't hate her . " He sighed . " All right . Say you do n't . You still should have cleared out , years ago . " There was a silence , and then she . said , " I tried to , Harry . After he died , and I was through business school , I went to Chicago . But it was . . . I was scared , Harry . " She smiled , in faint amusement . at herself , it seemed ; sounding curiously matter-of-fact , she said , " I had a nervous breakdown . I was in a mental hospital for more than a year . " He was ashamed of the feeling that swept through him , but it was too strong to be denied : as strong a revulsion as though she had been physically deformed . " I 'm sorry , " he said . ' ' Oh , God , I 'm sorry , Leonie . " " No , it 's all right . I 'm all right . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , Harry , and I won . So now I 'll never be afraid of being defeated again . " He sat running the warm sand between his fingers , thinking that the victory was n't complete . " But the doctors at the hospital , " he said . " They must have told you not to go back to her . " " There are some things even they do n't understand . In a way I do n't , myself . It 's just a feeling I have , Harry . She was so wonderful , while I was in the hospital . It was a private one , and she took a job , she paid all the bills . And if I left her now . . . Harry , she is n't strong , inside herself . She drinks too much as it is ; and old as she is , and looking the way she does , she still  --  likes men too much . I know what you think of her , but she is n't like that really . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . " " It does n't make sense . None of this makes any sense at all . Leonie , she wants to get rid of you , " he said brutally . Shock treatment , he thought , they may have given her shock treatment in the hospital , but possibly it was n't the right kind . " And if she wants to go to hell in her own way , let her . She 'd be a lot happier , really , Leonie . You 'd both be so much happier , away from each other . " " She only thinks that , " said Leonie , and stood up , and asked calmly , " Do you think it would be safe to go in the water again now ? " T HAT had been the end of August and now it was the end of November and the first snow was falling . Since their day at the beach nothing had been the same ; nothing could have been the same , of course . He felt trapped in a paradox , for if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also moved farther apart , and his crusade had come to seem foolish to him . Because he could n't and did n't want to marry her , there was nothing whatever that he could do for Leonie Hotstra , and he could n't think , really , why they had gone on seeing each other . It would be a relief , he thought as he shook another cigarette from the pack , if she never showed up at all today . He railed at his own conscience , for having been too tender . He had never wanted to be anything but kind , and today he would be forced into open cruelty at last . He was able on this basis to build up a small resentment against her , so that when she did come in and paused by the cashier 's desk , he watched her coolly : beating He turned and saw her coming down the rickety wooden steps . the snow from her coat , fishing out a handkerchief , and clamping her purse under one arm as she jerked off her glasses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pity but only the old exasperation as she came toward him , so bulky and graceless in the coat that the girl in the silver sheath , in the sunlight three months ago , was unimaginable . " I had a stencil to cut at the last minute. ? Oh , thanks , Harry , " she said , when he helped her out of the coat . " It 's getting colder every minute . I 'm frozen . " She laid her hand lightly on his , to prove it , and then flushed and took her hand away too fast . " Just this once , we 'll have a drink , and a real meal . Two old-fashioneds , " he told the waitress , " and then , in a little while , a couple of mixed grills ... And you 're going to drink yours , " he told Leonie , " I 'm going to insist on it . And for Pete 's sake why do n't you wear gloves ? You must like to suffer . " Wondering then if this might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked through the window . But such an explanation explained nothing , really , he thought , and felt relieved when the waitress , in a bustling starchy crackle , came back with the drinks . " Well , " he said , and raised his glass . " Go on , drink it , it 'll really warm you up . Besides , there 's something to drink to . I 've had a real break , Leonie . " " I 'm glad , Harry . " Smiling , lifting her glass , she said , " To your break . " But after she had sipped she made a little face . " Like medicine . I 'm afraid it really does taste like medicine , to me . " " Drink up your medicine , then , like a good girl . " He drank rapidly , himself , but the taste was sweet and watery and one weak cocktail was going to be no help at all . He could n't help thinking how much easier it would have been to say what he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to tell me about the break . " " Yes. - But he continued to mark time until the waitress had come charging back with her tray and then , having breathed heavily and benevolently above them , gone off again . " What 's happened , " he said , poking at his food , " is n't sudden , as a matter of fact . 1 did n't know it would happen so soon , that 's all . If I had , I might not even have taken the job out here . Except that I wanted to get away , of course . " Seeing her small nod , he thought that actually , since their day at the beach , he had done all the talking and had talked exclusively about himself . What an egotist I 've been , he thought , what a bore , what a pain in the neck . " This guy , though , old friend of mine  --  he 's like Annette , he really made good in advertising . ' And now he 's reached the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves . Got some good accounts , too . And there 's a place for me . " He paused , but her head was bent . She might have been interested in nothing but the food on her plate . " I could have told you sooner , " he said , " but I 'm superstitious , I suppose . Did n't want to say anything until it was all set . " " Of course not . " Still she did n't look at him , and he had no way of telling whether she was as calm as she appeared , or stretched taut and hoping desperately that what he was about to say might somehow destroy all foolish scruples about her mother . " I 'll be making about twice what I 'm getting here . Not that I wo n't need that much more , " he said , " living in New York . " " New York . " She broke open a roll . " You 'll be glad to get back , Harry . You never did really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and looked out through the plate glass . The flakes were smaller now and corning down faster , whitening the window ledges across the street . He wondered what she would say if he asked her to go with him , as he was n't in any position to do , or even if he just said something about her joining him later , after he was settled . What had seemed quite clear , fifteen minutes ago  --  the necessity for breaking things off neatly and cleanly but as kindly as possible , and the relief it would be to know that this bewildering relationship was over  --  had grown oddly blurred . He almost resented her composure ; and yet he put off saying the final devastating words because he was terrified lest her composure end . Staring out at the snow , he thought again about writing her a letter instead . He saw her taking the letter up from the table in the dim front hall , and turning white as she read it beside the painted drain pipe in which umbrellas stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into the bedroom he had never been able to imagine except as a kind of nun 's cell , and lying down on a hard narrow bed to weep . But however she felt she would n't behave like that . She would smile and hand the letter over to her mother and go on smiling even after her mother had said , Well , I might have known it , he 's ditched you ; the only chance you 'll ever have and you threw it away , and the Lord knows I did all I could . Leonie would go on smiling because in her own way she really was strong , from having won her battle . Shaking off the hypnosis of falling snow , he said , " It 's turning into a regular blizzard . . . . Hey , yoU 've been eating too fast , you 'll give yourself indigestion . " But he had no appetite , himself , and turned to signal the waitress . " How about cherry pie  --  a la mode ? And coffee ? " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfect . " He thought of all the years and years through which her mother must have battered at that reserve , tried to invade that privacy , until it had become something that nobody would ever invade , even with love : for who can love a woman who will not let herself love or be loved ? Even if she had just started to fall in love with him , last June , she would have kept the emotion small , controlled , pushed away in the dark where it would soon die . But he became suddenly sure that she had n't even started to fall in love with him . And of course it was this which he resented . " Harry , " Leonie said , after the waitress had brought the dessert and coffee . " Is Annette there again , now ? Back from Mexico ? Do you think you 'll see her ? " Then she said hastily , " I 'm sorry , I should n't have asked . It 's none of my business . " But it is . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her , and me . Why did n't you ever tell me to shut up ? Why did n't you say how bored you were ? " he demanded , and felt a small mean triumph because he had succeeded in making her flush . " Yes , she 's in New York . Still  --  not again . She never did go to Mexico . " " Oh . " The flush had concentrated itself into a small bright splotch on either cheek . " I could have told you that sooner , too . Should have , " he said . On the evening of the day Annette 's letter came , he almost had ; he and Leonie had gone to see a stale Broadway hit put on by the Little Theater group , and he had been so full of a fierce wild happiness and a sense of victory that it had been difficult not to tell Leonie . " She 's changed her mind , " he said . " She wants me back . " Leonie sat turning a lump of sugar between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick wavering curtain now , through which the buildings across the street seemed only a condensation of the same substance . " Two breaks , " she said , with her faint smile . " Not one . " 44IL even join you out there , " Annette I had written . It was a complete capitu- lation , and he nccd never again feel humble or unsure or anxious in her presence ; but at this moment he disliked the taste of victory . Leonie believed that marriage turned inevitably into a bitter conflict of wills ; but he found himself wondering if marriage to Leonie , though she had once spent more than a year in a mental hospital , might not turn into something quite different and much better . " I 'll see her , naturally , " lie said . " We 'll talk things over . But . . . " " You 'll go back to her , " Lennie said calmly , and dropped the sugar into her coffee . " You 've never stopped being in love with her . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . I knew it even before I knew Annette existed , " Leonie said , almost smugly  --  that maddening female smugness , he thought , that conviction they all have about understanding men better than men understand themselves ? and she lifted her cup and drank from it . Denying to himself that he was hitting back at her smugness , lie said , " Leonie , look , before we say good-by . You 'll have to get away from your mother , you 'll . . . " " We 've been all through that , Harry . I do n't want to talk about it . " " No , but listen . You 're young , and you 're a lot more attractive than you think , and it 's all wrong , living the way you do , shutting yourself up in that house , away from everybody , away from life altogether . You ought to get married before it 's too late , " he said , knowing he was echoing what her mother , in coarser words , must have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , now , is n't it ? Now that 1 ca n't possibly misunderstand . " She had never before spoken bitterly to him . -T know , I know , I know . I 'm a heel , " lie said . " But you 're important to me now , what happens to you is important . I worry about you , Leonie . I always will . I want you to be happy . " " Oh , happy , " she said . " Is anybody ? For more than a little while , now and then ? I 'm all right , I get along . " She touched his hand , this time without constraint . " I 'm sorry , Harry , I did n't mean to . . . No , you must n't have a guilty conscience about me . You 've been so very kind , but all this  --  all the times we 've had lunch together , and gone out together , and that day at the beach , and the time you ? " she drew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What does it amount to ? Nothing , nothing . " " It 's amounted to a lot , for me . And if I had n't stopped short at one kiss ... " " Are you boasting , Harry ? " She smiled , and pushed her chair back . " I suppose you were never sure enough of yourself . Annette 's fault , perhaps , " she said , astonishing him all over again ; and she opened her purse . " Now you 're going to let me pay for my lunch . And my drink . " " No . Put that away . " He shoved two quarters beneath the edge of his saucer , rose , and helped Leonie back into her coat , and then as lie took his own coat and hat from the stand he wondered what had happened and how it was that she had , in effect , taken charge of the situation . Or perhaps she had really been in control of everything , from the start ; and during all these months through which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , it was she who had succeeded in giving comfort to him . Leonie Hofstra had restored what Annette had come close to destroying . H E AVOIDED the waitress 's eyes ; laying the check and a five dollar bill down on the nippled rubber mat before the cashier , he avoided her eyes too . By the time he had his change , Leon ie was waiting outside in the snow , with her collar turned up . " I 'll walk you to City Hall , " lie said , taking her by the arm ; but she did not move . " It 's out of your way , Harry . . . You 're leaving quite soon ? " " Tonight , as a matter of fact . " He looked past her . " So you see , I really did leave it to the last minute . Telling you . A coward to the end . " And there had been no need for cowardice , of course : Leonie had courage enough for two . " We 're really a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , Harry , I think . " She turned , half impatiently , it seemed , so that his hand fell from the sleeve of her coat . " We sha n't be seeing each other again . " " Oh , some day . We 'll have to . We 'll have to write . I 'll want to know what happens to you . " " Ifarry , you know what will happen to me . Nothing , " she said , " nothing worth writing a letter about . Good-by , and good luck . And thanks , my darling . " She turned and walked off so fast that by the time her first and last words of endearment had settled into place and taken on meaning , she was already far up the street in the falling snow . The sidewalk was crowded and before he could move from where he stood he was n't even sure which hat and coat were hers in the wild whirl of flakes . He had to fight down , as much too belated and essentially false , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with love into the snowstorm . He turned the other way , and walked back toward his last afternoon in the office here , and toward what lay beyond : New York , and the good job , and Annette again . At this instant he wanted to think of them as being only way stations on what was really a great circle that must bring him back at last to Leonie Hofstra , who had somehow become his responsibility and so a woman from whom he could never quite escape . The need and the wish to believe he might return were strong inside him , now . But so was a knowledge that the need would dwindle and the wish die , and he walked through the snow feeling heavy with guilt and cold with a sense of loss .
