The Scar A Story by Nadine Gordimer Drawings by Edward Sprague Jones T ME new wife saw them first , and recognized her predecessor , Hannah , at once , even though she had never seen her before except in the photograph . Hannah was coming down the pavement on the arm of Count Bianci , an arm bent at a foreign-looking angle in the ridiculous parody of exaggerated gallantry which old Marcus delighted to use . Hannah and Bianci were coming from their first lunch together since her return from Italy , and the empty pavement outside the Chinese restaurant in the lower end of the city aimed them at Hannah 's former husband and his new wife like a missile . To cross the street deliberately in the middle of the block was impossible ; there was nothing to cross for but the shuttered warehouses of merchants on the other side . The two couples seemed to pause for a second ofeternity , hanging fire , but in fact their legs went on walking , bearing them down upon one another . " I never wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before her husband Jo , who did not have particularly keen sight , had even seen that it was his first wife and his old friend Marcus Bianci whom they were about to encounter . And as the girl beside him spoke , he saw . " Do n't be silly " he said , and banished the instant when she might have turned and run , stopped dead , anything . At the other end of the pavement , Hannah said : " Oh God . . . " " So ? It 's nothing . It 's got to happen sooner or later , just as well get it over . . . " Marcus swaggered her along , his head turned lingeringly to her profile in a magnificent example of what she and Jo had always called " Marcus 's only-woman-in-the-world act . " And it was just as well , for at once she was clinging to Marcus the way a child will almost strangle its mother in embarrassment or fear , inhibiting its own escape by making it impossible for the woman to bear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along very close and absorbed with her companion , laughing up into his smile and using her white-gloved hands as she talked . Nn it seemed that as they drew close , the first thing the girl saw about Hannah was the scar ; in all Hannah 's tall ele-gance , her beautiful clothes , her long , pointed feet in the handmade shoes from Spain , her wide hat as dark as her brilliant eyes , it was the scar that the other saw ; and the scar seemed Hannah 's greatest elegance . Of course the new wife had seen it in the photograph . Jo still had all Hannah 's letters that she had written to him during the war  --  when he had moved into the new house with the new wife he had taken them out of one of the mover 's packing cases before her , and had put them away at the top of the cupboard where he had decided to keep the suits and flannels that he no longer wore . In silence , she had watched him , silent , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the angle of the back of his head as lie peered up to the shelf , he took the photograph out of the packet of letters and looked at it himself , half-offering it to her , the way one indicates a willingness to share a newspaper or a book . She had come to stand under his arm , obediently . They had studied the face of Hannah for a moment . " Of course the scar spoils her , " Jo had said . She knew the story of the scar , the new wife . Everybody who had ever heard of Hannah and Jo knew it . It had happened as the result of a motor accident on their honeymoon ; driving down to the coast at night , Jo had dropped asleep at the wheel and the car hadturned over into a deep culvert . A piece of glass from the windscreen had slit Hannah 's mouth on the left side from corner to chin , diagonally . And of course , it did not spoil Hannah in the least . Even in the photograph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a plastic operation to smooth away the cicatrice . " It wil not make me what I was , " she would say in her regretful , half-amusing , half-acid way . " If I can not be what I was , I do not want to-be what the plastic surgeon may fancy to make of me . I would rather keep it , like a wrinkle or the gap of a lost tooth . I hate cars that look as if they 've never been driven , perpetually having the dents knocked out of their fenders and shining with new finish , people who keep running to psychiatrists to have all evidence of the scratches of experience rubbed out of their souls . " What ' Hannah meant by " what I was " ? beautiful or merely attractive  --  no one would ever know , so no one knew , either , whether she believed she was spoiled , or whether , like poor people who cease to weep over a maimed child the moment they realize the possibilities for it of a stand on the street corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easier to he a woman who is beautiful despite the flawing of a scar than it is to qualify for the standards of a flawless beauty . N ow they were bunched together blocking the pavement : in that expanse of empty street like survivors of a shipwreck huddled on an enormous beach . Bianci stood by in a courtly fashion , with the polite , prim look people keep on their faces when they are waiting to be introduced ; Hannah held her neck arched a little , her head drawn hack , smiling elaborately , warmly , as if , though her arms remained one bent through Bianci 's , the other pressing her handbag to her side , they were extended in a gesture of welcome , acceptance  --  the stage gesture with which the bountiful lady takes the young people to her heart . The new wife looked unblinking into that smile . She stood there quietly , her handbag held in front of her in her two hands , the way a schoolgirl holds a hat . Her look seemed to say : I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet you until I know you . The eyes of Hannah and Jo met over her head ; of course it was not the first time Jo had seen Hannah since her return from Europe . He had gone to meet her at the airport when she arrived early on Friday morning . ( " Why must you go ? " the new wife had said , with the faintest possible emphasis on you . " " Well , it seems the only decent thing , " lie had answered ; " it 's dismal to find no one to meet you , and it 's at such an awkward time , it 's not likely that any of her friends will make it . " When he had come home on Friday evening , they had not mentioned where he had been ; it was as if , like Orpheus , he had gone down to escort Eurydice back through the shades  --  but this one , his new wife , was his real , his earthly love , belonging to ordinary , warm life . ) The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mere signal in the air rather than a sound : the way husbands and wives bypass these formalities through familiarity . Jo cleared his throat and said , " You two have n't met , really , have you ? ... This is Gypsy . Gyp , Hannah . And Count Bianci  --  Marcus . " The girl managed a very slow stiff smile which did not even part her lips . And then it was gone and she was looking at Hannah again . completely expressionlessly . The acknowledgement , such as it had been , seemed E0 have been dragged out of her by Hannah ; by the brilliant , frank smile that Hannah had turned to her at the exchange of names . The full charm of Hannah came out of herself , her body , even , like a strong perfume wafted into Iife by a movement of clothing . Jo saw , fascinated , the beauty , the coaxing of that greeting ; Hannah 's face , Hannah 's manner saying : Come , you are a charming girl , I am delighted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I take it gracefully , I am sure I shall like you as a person . Do n't be shy , do n't be frightened , we are all civilized grown-ups , are we not ? SID while Hannah looked and spoke ( " I am so glad to meet you . How do you do , Gypsy ? " ) no one , not the new wife , not Jo , not Bianci even , though he was in contact with her body through her arm , knew of the horrible spasm of terror and despair that contracted inside her for one unbearable moment . Her head was thrust down brutally into darkness ; the eternal , smothering dark-ness of what has been lost . And her jealousy was like the shocking sight of the beating heart of some small animal , exposed through dissection , and still alive in the cold pain of the air . He 's mine , the voice clamored in that terrible place ' inside herself where people were fighting , where everything writhed and staggered from wall to wall . He 's mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He 's mine . . . . Marcus said we 'd better go there because I have n't been to China , so at least I should n't be able to say , oh , but you should taste the way they do it there ! " she was saying , laughing , pulling a face at herself , culpable . " You know how it is with her whenever she 's been overseas , " Marcus appealed to Jo . And he parodied the expressiveness of Hannah 's face : " If she 's been to Italy , the macaroni 's too short here . When she went to New York , the chewing gum here was n't sticky enough for her . " The idea of Hannah chewing gum ! Only Marcus could put his finger so unerringly on the impossibly ludicrous . Jo laughed delightedly in the joy of Marcus , which he had forgotten , and Hannah laughed too , for the situation threw Marcus and her into a kind of act together , and she must play foil for him as he " fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question shifted the talk from Marcus , Jo , and Hannah to Hannah and Jo . Jo said : " I forgot to ask . Did you meet Bella and Leslie in Florence ? I wondered . ? Did you hear what happened about the flat the day they left ? ? " " Did I hear indeed ? I was blamed for the whole thing . You see , when they cabled me to Genoa  --  no , it was Venice ? " and she re-counted the story , with nods and interjections from Jo : " Well , they told me ? " " That was n't what I was told ? " All her life people had said of Hannah : she can talk her way out of anything . And now that seemed literally true ; hand over hand , her animation , her zest , her attractiveness , her easy command of herself lifted her out of disadvantage ; she climbed over the faces of Jo and the new wife and the old friend , away out of the situation where she  --  spoiled child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , who had played some perverse game of rejection with Jo until she had goaded him to divorce her , and then had never thought that he would ever struggle sufficiently free of her to marry someone else ? found herself indeed bereft , indeed replaced , pushed out on the lonely corner of the triangle . But she was as agile as ever ; she proved it again , as she had proved it many times before : the ability to come out on top that they had impressed upon her so admiringly , so long . She produced it as obediently as a circus animal does its trick . Like the seal with his ball , of whom it is difficult to say whether he has enjoyed his skill , or whether it came to him mechanically at the crack of an invisible whip . T HE new wife stood there with nothing to say and nothing to give . Marcus retired to the side of the stage , unobtrusive , but there to catch his partner if  --  unthinkable thing , seeing her spangled upthere  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful timelessness of such a meeting contracting the instant it was over into the ordinary dimensions of a few minutes ' encounter  --  they had parted . With the polite scuffle of good-bys ( Marcus bowed to the new wife , who looked as if she did n't know what to do with such a gesture ; lifted two fingers in an old easy signal to his friend Jo ) the two couples had re-formed and got rid of each other , got past . The heels of the new wife sounded quickly away down the pavement behind Marcus and Hannah ; sounded in Hannah 's ears like the scamper of a mouse . Hannah was breathing deeply . Marcus saw the tanned shiny skin in the neckline of her dress swell with the rising pressure of her breasts , saw , quite distinctly , the one or two freckles flecking that hollow . It brought out in him not desire , but , oddly enough , a sudden homesickness ; homesickness for one of those Italian Riviera beaches where he had lain , summer after summer , before the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaven skin . He squeezed Hannah 's arm ; he had never felt such kinship with her before . And he saw , as a man sees a trickle of blood on the face of the comrade with whom he has come through a battle , sweat under the powder between her eyebrows . She pulled her lips down swiftly , one against the other , the way women even the thickness of their lipstick . And there too , on her upper lip , there was sweat . But back in repose , the corners of her mouth indented in a high , nervous smile . After a minute she turned to him and her eyes were so dark , so flooded with intensity that they had no color and were bright as black water in sunlight . " Stood there like a child hanging around while its parent has a gossip ! ' Sullenly waiting to be yanked off  --  no will , no volition . Did you see ? " " Yes . " said Marcus . She was breathing so hard she had to breathe through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . He nodded , making an understanding mouth . " You know ? " " Of course , " he said . " Like a puppy dog on a string . Stop when the master stops . Wait to be allowed to go on . " He shrugged . But it was still not enough for her . " Was n't it so ? " she insisted again . " Well , what do you expect . . " he said , deprecating . He disposed of the new wife , kindly , with a half-movement of his hand , as if she were not even worth the full gesture . " She seems a nice enough little girl . " " Of course , " said Hannah . She was laughing . " But you would have thought I was the one in the strong position . Any one would have thought I was the one who had ousted her . " They both laughed , at Hannah . " Simply stood there staring at my scar . Did you see ? Like a rude child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Well , I suppose she was embarrassed , poor girl . " " Why should she be ? Why more embarrassed than anyone else ? 1 felt like saying , I wo n't eat you . And poor Jo . . . " " I told you , it 's a good thing it 's over , " said Marcus in an aging man 's voice . T T SEEMED to spurt Hannah up into youth and gaiety . " Darling old M , " she said , " she probably thinks you 're my new lover . A wicked foreigner , picked up in a casino . " " Now , now , " said Marcus . " She 's pretty , you know . ? Well , of course . Very tiny . Did you see how I towered over her ? Well , that 's good . Jail feel more masterly , he 'll be able to be protective toward her . " Marcus knew she was talking to herself , she did not want any response but his presence . Then she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were afire inside with her own arrogance , and she said in a different voice , the voice of a conspirator , the voice of a child seeking the approval of a father ; a voice that was every contradiction she herself was : " Was I all right ? " She was clutching his arm , looking excitedly down at him . He looked at her , ruefully , admiring : " Oh you , " he said . She was watching his eyes with her own shrewd , distrustful , inescapable ones . " But my behavior . Was it all right ? Did I behave well ? " He shook his head slowly in the absolute assurance of it . " Perfect . You carried it off ? magnificently . You managed well . You were very good . " She smiled at him slowly , he watched the curve of her mouth back from her teeth , the flush of her cheeks , the softening lines round her eyes , and last , was held by the dance of the eyes themselves . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last and yet again , the trumpet notes of another triumph . RIVING his car with the stranger who was his new wife sitting silent beside him , Jo heard the notes too , but to him they tolled something different . He saw the head of the girl at his side , who was faithful , affectionate , reliable , commonplace  --  Hannah had made him see that in the ten minutes she stood beside her. ? The dog virtues , he thought . Hannah had made all that perfectly clear , simply by being there . And lie , who ten minutes before had seen all Hannah 's charm , the great desirability she had for him , unimpaired despite all that had happened , had now for the first time an entirely new feeling toward Hannah . Now it was dead , completely dead ; lie no longer loved her , and for that , and for the other , at last he hated her .
