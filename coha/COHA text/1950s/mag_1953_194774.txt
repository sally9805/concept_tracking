COMMUNISTS How Stands the Party ? <P> In 1948 , when Whittaker Chambers began to tell in public his story about Alger Hiss , he called his testimony " an act of war . " Since its foundation in 1919 , the American Communist Party has , in fact , been at war with America , but during most of its existence , the party was allowed to grow and do its work of conspiracy and infiltration with relative impunity ; between 1933 and the end of World War II , it was , in fact , often coddled and encouraged . The Hiss case was a turning point . Since 1948 , hardly a week has gone by without some bulletin about the battle-a battle which , in a democracy , must be fought slowly and patiently in the courts , in police archives , in the minds of men . What has the U.S. war against the U.S. Communists accomplished so far ? The visible party is in worse shape today than it has been in 30 years . Items : Virtually the entire known leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelve-man national committee were convicted in 1949 , at the marathon trial before Judge Medina , of conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. Government . Of the eleven , eight are in jail ; three jumped bail and are still fugitives . The party 's nominal boss , William Z. Foster , 71 , is under indictment . Last year 21 members of the Communist second team were indicted , including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn ; 13 of them are now on trial in New York City . Altogether , 85 key Communists have been indicted since 1948 under the Smith Act ; in the last six years , 88 alien Communists have been deported . <P> Open membership is down to less than 30,000 compared with some 90,000 ( including the Young Communist League ) in 1938 , some 54,000 in 1950 . <P> Finances are strained . The Daily Worker , long in difficulties , this month pub-llished a particularly desperate-sounding appeal for money , last week announced that it got results ( see PRESS ) . Organizations which helped finance the party ( e.g. , the International Workers Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being put out of business . <P> Nearly 150 Communist fronts have lost most of their usefulness , having been labeled subversive by the Government . <P> A decade ago the Communists had heavily penetrated unions representing 20% of organized labor ; today , Communists remain strong in unions representing only 2% of organized labor ( but some of the unions are important ) . <P> The invisible party has also suffered some setbacks . The convictions of Alger Hiss , Harry Gold , David Greenglass , Morton Sobell , Ethel &; Julius Rosenberg have hampered Red espionage operations , although it is impossible to know whether the mainspring of the Red spy apparatus has been broken . <P> The Party 's Mood . The party has always existed in a thick conspiratorial atmosphere , but since 1948 it has become heavily defensive . Keeping of member ship records has been forbidden , and in the last four years no party cards have been issued . Party records have been destroyed or hidden , public meetings held to a mini mum ; use of the telephone and the mails is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
