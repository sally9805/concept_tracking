Since the first atomic bomb exploded at Alamogordo in 1945 , Washington and Ottawa have been hunting diligently for new uranium deposits . Reason : capacity of Canada 's only uranium-producing mine , at Great Bear Lake on the edge of the Arctic Circle , is far short of U.S. needs , and overseas sources might be cut off by submarines in wartime . Last week in Toronto , William J. Bennett , boss of Canada 's uranium monopoly , announced that Canada 's second major mine would go into production , probably next year , at Beaver-lodge Lake in northwestern Saskatchewan . He fixed its initial production at 500 tons of ore daily , revealed that its output " will probably be considerably in excess of our Great Bear Lake property " - thus more than doubling Canadian output .
