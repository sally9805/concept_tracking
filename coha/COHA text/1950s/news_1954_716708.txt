txt A former member of the Federal Trade : Commission recently had some words to say about the so-called " fair tradelaws and his remarks added up to ** reason why the statutes lend themselves more to unfair trade than any other The immunity from prosecution under ? the anti-trust laws which the , Act grants is right now under question by Attorney General Brownell 's commission studying the anti-trust laws . Yestiedity our Mr. Clark , in his ' story on the'tilenhower legislative program for the . chiming year , wrote that the Brownell commission is " almost sure " to include:A proposal to repeal the Federal " fair trade " law , ? The - point has often been made that ibis a strange concept of fairness that holds that a contract signed between a manufacturer and one retailer in a state should bind all other retailers to a set price for certain goods . Noer , to this point , Mr. Albert A. Garrotte , Washington attorney , adds another ; that of the double standard . " It is totally immoral , unethical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two distributors in competition with each otherand then compel one distributor to abide by a fair trade agreement and permit a competitor of that distributor to disregard the fair trade prices . " The suspicion has existed for some time that some of the cries about the discount houses violating the fair trade laws were uttered more for the record than anything else ; we never could quite understand how the so-called price cutters could sell the goods unless the manufacturers blinked the selling .

And the answers he gave are one more reason why the laws are n't working ? as , indeed , laws which are intended to . ehange the habits of people seldom can be expected to work . It is a habit of people to try to buy the best goods at the least possible cost ; and other people habitually are willing to supply the goods . It is a sad thing that some of the fair traders so critical of free traders are themselves setting up the double standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thing ; for the sooner the unfairness of the price setting laws is disclosed in all its manifestations , the sooner will fair competitive trade return to the market place .
