When 26-year-old Father Hermogenes Coronel came to the sleepy little parish of San Rafael in 1940 , no one welcomed him more heartily than Alfredo Musni . The priest took a room in Alfredo 's house , became fast friends with Alfredo , his wife and his daughter Gloria . Later , Father Coronel and Alfredo 's brother-in-law entered a business partnership to found the San Rafael Academy . In 1946 , Alfred Musni enrolled blooming 18-year-old Gloria in Father Coronel 's school . <P> Last week , the Musni family and Father Coronel , friends no longer , were glaring at each other across a Manila courtroom while a judge weighed the legal answer to a delicate question that had disturbed the whole Philippine Republic : Was Father Coronel legally married to Gloria Musni ? <P> " So I Hit Her . " Father Coronel 's own answer was an emphatic no . True , he told the court , he and Gloria had gone through a marriage ceremony before a justice of the peace in 1948 , but there were at least two invalidating circumstances : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfredo Musni was holding a gun at his back at the time . After the ceremony , Father Coronel said , he returned to his parish , finally managed to slip away from the ever-watchful Musnis and escape 600 miles away to Zamboanga . Last fall , after church authorities had declared the marriage void , Father Coronel returned to Manila . He filed a suit asking for a civil annulment and financial redress from the Musnis . He was met by the Musnis ' countersuit for 100 pesos monthly alimony and 10,000 pesos moral damages . Alfredo Musni gave the following version of Gloria 's marriage : <P> " On Jan. 14 , 1948 , I arrived in my home on Lealtad Street and found my wife crying . I asked her what was wrong , but she refused to talk , so I hit her . Then she talked . She said Gloria was pregnant and crying in her room . I asked Gloria if this was true and who did it , but she kept quiet . So I hit her . Then my son Nestor arrived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Then she talked . She said it was Father Coronel who did it ... The next morning I went out with my son . . . came back in the afternoon with Father Coronel and in the evening they were married . " <P> " Plain Blackmail . " Alfredo denied that the marriage of Father Coronel and Gloria was a shotgun affair , claimed instead that the priest himself had suggested that he marry Gloria when he learned she was pregnant . Said Alfredo : " I even asked him how it was possible for a priest to marry , and he said there is no law against it , that in America they do it all the time . " <P> Snapped Father Coronel : " All lies . . . plain blackmail . " <P> Said Judge Gabino Abaya : " This is a hard case . It is not a mere matter between a priest and a woman , but a delicate problem that affects church and state . I want to give it all the time I can . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
