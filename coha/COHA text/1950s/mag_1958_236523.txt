THE PROFESSIONAL ( 338 pp. ) -W . C. Heinz-Harper ( $3.95 ) . <P> One of the remarkable facts about U.S. daily journalism is that its most talented practitioners write about games for boys - or , at any rate , about games for men with boyish hearts . Still , the situation is bearable when the sportswriters stick to sports . The trouble begins when , like aging college athletes shadow-boxing before the bathroom mirror , they tangle with that elusive opponent , literature . <P> On the jacket of this novel by Freelance Sportswriter W. C. Heinz , the reader is warned of its contents by Quentin Reynolds , himself an ex-athlete ( Brown 's football team of 1923 ) and a sportswriter so eminent that he no longer writes sports . Reynolds ' warning : Heinz never loses " the hard jab of actuality . " The New York Herald Tribune 's Sports Columnist Red Smith , no athlete , puts in a few jabs of his own : " Here are the people ; this is what they are like , how they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out not to be " the people " at all , but a fight mob and the literary gents who write about them . <P> The You-Man Sentence . Two warning signs mark the literary he-man pusher : the use of the historical present and a tendency to address the reader as " you . " Nearly 20 years ago , British Critic Cyril Connolly said that the " youman sentence " finally " would seem to have had its day " ( Connolly alleged James Joyce started the whole thing ) . But sportswriters , who might believe a man named Connolly , would never listen to a character called Cyril . <P> W. C. ( for Wilfred Charles ) Heinz makes the point in what he has to say about the view from the New York elevated : " You can see the flower pots , too , on the fire escapes . Most of them have geraniums in them ... and always , a long time after they should n't be there any longer , you 'll see the long , yellow leaves of Easter lilies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Professional , though , is not roses , lilies and geraniums all the way . It 's about the fight game , see . It is told in the first person by this sportswriter who signs his stuff Frank Hughes . The story begins with Hughes 's recollections as one of a bunch of sportswriters returning from an Army-Fordham game ( it was bloody as all get out ) . " After that first half , Fordham could n't have won except by a knockout , " says Tom Meany . Jimmy Cannon says : " How about that ? " Cannon and Meany , of course , are both real-life sportswriters who would , at one time or another , have recognized each other at Toots Shor 's . This sort of thing solves a problem confronting all novelists-how to create real characters . Well , in a youman sentence , you just put in real men .
