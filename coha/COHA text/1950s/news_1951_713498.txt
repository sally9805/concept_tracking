txt Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is unfortunate , in our current discussion about conscription and the colleges , that we have made , no effort to consult the British experiences . Britain has had its so-called National Service program for some time : it calls for two years ' service , and young men may choose to serve their terms either before entering upon or after completing their university education . Once having elected to matriculate , they are permitted to finish their courses of study without interruption . Initially , most university people seemed to favor National Service before matriculation . Like us , their experiences with the returned veterans had been very good : their maturity made them better students . But peacetime service , apparently , is something else again : and now British university opinion is beginning to swing the other way . It is hard for a peacetime army to challenge the capacities of youth : boredom and useless tasks ( needed to inculcate discipline ) take their toll . Effect on University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speaker from Cambridge University , commenting on those students who came to the university after National Service , declared that out of every seven two had profited from the experience , three were not particularly affected , and two were definitely worse . The speaker did not protest against conscription ; the fault lay in an administration that simply could not provide properly for such young men . Sir Godfrey Ince , Permanent Secretary , Ministry of Labor and National Service , did not reply directly to these strictures . He admitted the need for flexibility " to take into account the views of schools , universities , industry , and the services . " In any case , he declared , Britain was committed to maintenance of freedom of choice of the boys themselves . It was for them to decide whether National Service was to be elected before or after the university . The London Times Educational Supplement of Dec. 22 , 1950 , in commenting on the conference 's discussions , is of the opinion that university people want to see British young men get their education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say that for most boys of high ability it is better to have the university imprint stamped on first . The Army would then receive a grown man with character and skills well developed . * * * There will always be boys , and probably they are the best sort of boys , who will be ready and eager to do their military service immediately after school American equivalent , high school . That is why uniformity in the age of call-up would be harmful . But for the majority there appears much to be said for deferring service until the character is formed . " Specialized Training Required Some further observations are in order . If we in the United States are talking of deferment or postponement , why do we persist in doing so only in the cases of medical and dental , engineering and science students ? Are we to assume that an American army will require no other skills ? That ? it milli not need , as well , intelligence and political personnel acquainted with the languages , customs , and political and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am indicating that college and university trained people ? in addition to maturity  --  will possess all sorts of specialized trainings required by a modern army . In this case it is easier to follow the British example than to write into legislation deferment or postponement of specific categories . The inevitable result will be a rush into science , medicine and engineering programs and the neglect of the humanities and the social sciences . Another point we lose sight of : the typical American young man is not accustomed to thinking of beginning his college training at 20 or 21 . At that age he is looking forward to a job and ? in a few years  --  marriage . If we postpone college entrance until 20 or 21 , we will be losing many of those who should be trained academically ; or we will be burdened with a perpetual G. L Bill of Rights . Greater flexibility in administration and freedom of choice by the boys themselves ( as regards both time of service and courses of study to be followed in college ) are some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of conscription and the colleges . LOUIS M. HACKER . New York , Jan. 12 , 1951 . Will to Fight Held Lacking To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK TIMES : May I file my protest against the view that we should get out of Korea ? Such a withdrawal , I submit , will so shake the faith of other nations in our will to resist , and so undermine our prestige in the Orient , that in the course of a few months all Asia will probably be in Communist hands , and in Asia , not Europe , lies the future . Talk of the vast numbers of the Chinese or Asiatics is not conclusive . At the battle of Assaye ( 1803 ) the Duke of Wellington with 5,000 men and 17 guns suddenly came upon a Mahratta ( Indian ) army of at least 50,000 men with more than 100 guns largely officered by European officers ? mostly French ( the - Russians of that day ) . Because he had a rule " never to retreat before Orientals , " Wellington nevertheless fought  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000 men and 8 guns defeated a Mohammedan army of 50,000 men and 50 guns . The argument that we need our men elsewhere to " continue " the fight against communism is often merely a softener by those who wish really to follow Hoover 's strategy of defense in this hemisphere . But no nation has ever successfully remained on ail eternal defensive against a determined and implacable foe . That Russia is implacable , while she is Communist , can be seen by anyone who cares to read Lenin . The truth is we lack the will even to fight for the minimum basic freedoms prized alike by the non-Marxist socialist and the capitalist . As for our conservatives , the late Professor . Schumpeter , perhaps the greatest authority on the subject , remarked fifteen years ago that the notion that peace can be bought is the most fatal political weakness of business civilizations .

Designating Chinese Reds Correct Terminology Is Asked in To THE EDITOR OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over reports of repeated cases of molesta : - tions of Chinese by Americans in some American cities . It is unfortunate that the rightful indignation of Americans over the acts of the Chinese Communists have to find such a way of expression and visit it upon the innocent heads of our fellow-citizens in America , most of whom strongly object to what the Communists are doing , as was shown by the recent demonstrations by our nationals in America over the presence of Wu Hsiu-chuan in the United Nations . While there may be more than one cause for such manifestations of ill feeling , we are inclined to think that the main cause of trouble lies rather with the unfortunate choice of words in the messages filed by the correspondents from the Korean front , when they call the Communists " Chinese , " or " Chinese troops , " or " Chinese forces . " The use of some such name is apt to mislead ordinary American news readers into believing that the entire Chinese nation is at war with them . We realize that under the stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to a high degree of nicety in language . We shall , therefore , appreciate it if you would publish this letter with a view to obtaining concerted action on the part of the editors and news editors in calling the Chinese Communists by their right name . Quite aside from the question of terminology , a much bigger issue is involved in the matter under discussion . For to call the Communists " Chinese " carries with it the implied meaning that they are 475,000,000 strong ; but to call them " Chinese Communists " or " Chinese Reds " means that they are at most a crowd of four or five million . We are sure that under existing conditions no newspaper man of any standing would like to exaggerate the importance of the Chinese Communists .

Seen To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : THE NEW YORK TIMES reports that a group of women called " The Republican Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to withdraw from the United Nations . As one Republican Woman I am profoundly shocked by this action . By leaving the U. N. we would be telling our friends in the U. N. that we doubted the sincerity of their expressed desire for peace and that we were resigned to the inevitability of a third world war . This type of thinking would ' not be acecptable even to those Administration critics who agree with either Mr. Hoover or with Mr. Taft . To those Republicans who , like myself , resent the exclusion of Senators Ives and Margaret Chase Smith from the Republican Policy Committee this thinking is simply incredible . It evidences none of the traits of constructive criticism or of balance and statesmanship which are so needed by the party leadership in these critical times . JOAN HAMLIN .

School Inquiry Assails Practices , " attracted my attention . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thirty years ago , following World War I , the same revelations were made . I was then attached to the Veterans Administration program , called the Federal Board for Vocational Education , Division of Rehabilitation of Disabled Ex-Servicemen . The same practices were then indulged in by some schools , and some of us made them known in our reports . It would appear that our Government has been negligent in not setting up adequate safeguards to prevent such practices . Let us hope that Congress will lose no time in correcting this evil .
