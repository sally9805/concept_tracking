Must a Unitarian be a Christian ? The question has bubbled through Unitarianism for years ( temperatures reached new highs last May when the monthly Christian Register changed its name to the Unitarian Register ) . Last week another vote for the negative was cast when the temporary pastor of Washington 's influential All Souls Church used his Sunday sermon to bow out of Christianity . <P> The Rev. Ralph W. Stutzman , 29 , who came to Unitarianism from the Evangelical-United Brethren Church and served as assistant to All Souls ' late , famed Pastor A. Powell Davies , rejected for himself even the loose definition of Christian as one who tries to follow the teachings of Jesus . " Which Jesus should I follow-the one who said ' Turn the other cheek . Love your enemies . ' or the one who said ' Do not think that I have come to bring peace , but a sword ' ? " <P> Unitarians have " come out of " a Christian tradition , Stutzman admitted , " but now I think it is time for Unitarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If civilization lasts another ten years , the world is going to need a denomination like Unitarianism in the midst of the Christian western world . As the major religions of the world begin really to rub shoulders , men of foreign countries are going to find Christianity to have an obnoxious air of superiority . "
