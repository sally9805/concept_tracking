A world which was once set afire by a spark in what is now Yugoslavia has learned to take seriously even the slightest rise in temperature in the Balkan tinder box . Last week diplomatic pulses in half a dozen world capitals thumped over a frontier fracas on a half-submerged sandbank in the unnavigable Evros River which , in one ten-mile stretch , forms the border between Soviet-dominated Bulgaria and U.S.-protected Greece . <P> All summer long , Greek and Bulgar soldiers had lurked along the Evros , taking potshots at one another . The most serious skirmishes occurred on three swampy sandbanks named Alpha , Beta and Gamma that lie in the lee of the wooded Greek shore . Then one day last month a Greek patrol on Gamma island , which is about the size of a football field , walked into a Bulgar ambush and lost four men killed and two wounded . It became painfully clear to the Greeks that the Bulgars , egged on by the Russians who have a tank army close to the Evros , were determined not only to annex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attached to the Greek shore ever since the Evros River shifted its channel to the Bulgar side some ten years ago . <P> To the Evros last week went a task force of mechanized Greek infantry , supported by tanks , field guns and fighter planes . Third Corps Commander Stylianos Manidakis broadcast a 24-hour " ultimatum " telling any Bulgars who might still be on Gamma to get off or be blown off . A team of excited U.N . observers sent an alarmist cable to New York : " Big forces ready for action on both sides . . . Very dangerous situation may follow . " <P> Next morning at 9:30 , after waiting for Europe 's famed Simplon-Orient Express to roar along the nearby tracks on its way from Sofia to Istanbul , the Greeks opened fire with machine guns and mortars . After 60 minutes ' bombardment and no reply , four bedraggled Bulgars crept off the sandbank and sloshed across the river into the woods on the Communist side . By nightfall , despite a constant barrage of propaganda insults on the Bulgarian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Manidakis was able to report that all was quiet on the Evros front . Not this time was the tinder lit.
