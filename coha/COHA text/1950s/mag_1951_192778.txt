With the General Election less than two weeks away , Labor , behind in the public opinion polls , was fighting hard , and with any weapon that came to hand . In the shadow of 900-year-old Norwich Cathedral , Labor M.P . John Paton thumped out a message to his constituents : " Tory policy means war . " In suburban London , another Socialist denounced the Tory candidate : " Nothing but a bloody warmonger . " Labor placards in grimy , bomb-battered Liverpool proclaimed : " A third Labor government or a third World War ! " <P> The " war party " label was a good ( though unfair ) line for Labor-and the Tories knew it . The Tories , who had been hammering away at Labor 's timid foreign policy , quickly switched to " bread and butter politics . " They attacked high prices , small rations of butter and meat and Labor 's failure to build enough houses to replace those destroyed in World War II . New Tory posters appeared showing an infant grumbling , " The way things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my house . " <P> The campaign was hotting up . Party headquarters supplied " scientific questions " for hecklers to ask at opposition meetings . Sample Tory heckle : " Mr. Bevan , do you and Attlee agree on policy ? " Sample Labor heckle : " Is n't it true that prices in Britain have risen less than in any other major nation ? " <P> Laborites were counting heavily on Clement Attlee to pull a Truman . They do have some things in common . People are apt to write Attlee off too easily ; lacking greatness , he impresses by his plainness . And he is a fighter . Last week he set off on an eight-day , 1,000-mile , 53-speech Trumanesque " whistlestop " tour of Britain , talking up a " fair deal to all the people . " His flat , colorless words conjured up , in the minds of thousands of north country folk , deep-seated memories of " dark Satanic mills , " unemployment and poverty-the evils which millions of British Socialists instinctively associate with Toryism . <P> Clem Attlee 's tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the bad old days . " One of Labor 's political weaknesses is that a new generation is growing up with little experience of such " capitalist exploitation . " At Labor meetings , sometimes as many as two-thirds are people in their 50s . Grumbled one old diehard : " The youngsters will ruin us . They 're too young to remember Tory misrule . " <P> Sometimes Labor 's haymakers swung wide . In the village of Caister outside Yarmouth , an elderly lady rose and quietly asked Labor M.P . Ernest Kinghorn : " Why ca n't the government take off the purchase tax , at least on essentials ? I find it so hard to make our money cover all the necessities . " Others in the audience applauded . Kinghorn jumped up and shouted : " I want all of you who applauded to raise your hands . " Sheepishly a few listeners raised hands . Then Kinghorn demanded : " Now how many of you have false teeth provided by the government ? " There was a moment 's shocked silence , then embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
