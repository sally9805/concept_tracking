TOKYO , Monday , Nov. 27 ? Strong enemy counter-attacks led by soldiers of the Chinese Communist armies stalled yesterday the United Nations general offensive driving toward the Manchurian frontier on the Yalu River . Along a twenty-five-mile sector of the Korean western front United States and South Korean divisions lost ground , with some small units cut off in the enemy advance . On the critical right flank the Korean Republican Second Corps pulled back as much as twelve miles , and the Communists were reported this morning to have reoccupied the key town of Tokchon , covering enemy communications with Manchuria . According to The Associated Press , a later report , from an Eighth Army spokesman , said that the South Korean Second Corps still held Tokchon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northeast , units of the United States First Marine Division were attacking westward to relieve the Red pressure on the Eighth Army 's eastern flank . A coordinated counter-attack was launched yesterday morning by an enemy who blew bugles , rolled drums and clashed cymbals in a manner that United Nations troops now have learned to associate with Chinese attacks . First Cavalry Bolsters Position Main strength of the enemy appeared concentrated against the Allied right , between Yongwon and Tokchon , where troopers of the United States First Cavalry Division rushed into the line yesterday to bolster a crumbling South Korean position . Early this morning the Communists resumed the attack , striking at the United States Twenty-fifth and Second divisions in thrusts beginning under the cover of darkness at 2 o'clock . Reports at Eighth Army headquarters in Korea said that the assault on the Twenty-fifth Division was launched all along its front , which had been pulled back four miles southeast of Unsan , in the Sanggu area . Fighting to drive a wedge down the Chongchon River valley in the center of the Allied line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sion . Preliminary reports said that elements of the division that had reached Sinhung were now pulling back behind the river near Kujang , four miles to the south , in the face of the renewed enemy attack . One company of the Second Division , cut off more than twenty-four hours , was holding out last night east of Sinhung , sending up flares to mark its position . Recovery for Chinese Reds The attack was over the ground that United Nations troops had gained in patrol actions and enemy withdrawals last week and in the first stages of the general Allied offensive begun Friday . The Chinese Communists , who last week were reported concentrated to the north behind screens of North Korean troops , now had come to the front to defend this territory . By this morning they had regained at least some miles of it . United Nations forces made some progress on the extreme left of the line , where a task force of the United States Twenty-fourth Division rolled beyond Chongju , on the coastal highway , meeting almost no resistance , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Tenth Corps said that troops ' of the South Korean Capital Division who entered Chongjin yesterday afternoon pushed eight miles northwest of the town , on the road that leads to the Soviet border about fifty air miles to the north . Resistance had crumbled to almost nothing , it was reported , with small groups of the enemy firing a fey , shots from weapons they could carry on their backs . While in Korea a United States First Corps spokesman called the situation serious , sources at Gen. // ? Douglas 's headquarters cautioned against undue pessimism . It was said that stubborn enemy defense had been expected as United Nations troops reached the hubs of the Communist positions covering roads running northward to the Yalu River in the west . The most dangerous situation appeared to exist in the Tokchon area , where a deep enemy penetration would threaten to envelop the right of the seventy-mile United Nations front . Here the South Korean Second Corps had advanced about eight miles from positions four miles north of Tokchon . Recapture of the town represented a twelve-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the TokchonKunu road , one of the main lines of lateral communications behind the United Nations front , which was bitterly contested in earlier fighting . The United States Second Division has been authorized to collect " stragglers " from the Republican Second Corps  --  a possible indication that at least some units were broken and the soldiers scattering to the rear . In the Second Division sector the attack came after United States troops had gained several miles to the vicinity of Sinhung against the fire of automatic weapons and mortars from dug-in enemy positions . Here , according to official accounts , the withdrawal , to adjust the line , was made to the neighborhood of Kujang . The Second Division captured 200 Chinese , it was reported , the largest bag of soldiers from Manchuria yet rounded up since Mao Tse-tung 's intervention in the Korean war . The counter-attack , however , overran one United States company and isolated another . This morning the division was reported holding the line in the vicinity of Kujang , plugging the gap on the right . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division , south of Taechon , with seesaw fighting Saturday and yesterday . While the Communists counterattacked in the west , the eastern sector had a pattern of United Nations patrols pushing forward and fighting small groups of the enemy , these then broke contact and withdrew , as they had done for the last fortnight . Troops of the United States Seventh Division which reached the Yalu River at Hyesanjin , dispersed a small enemy force southwest of town . The Hyesanjin , and that a Seventh Division regiment ran into strong new opposition two miles south of the Manchurian border . Other forces of the Seventh Division who pushed through Samsu last week advanced eight miles northeast of the town , within about three miles of the Manchurian frontier below Hyesanjin . The opposition of small enemy detachments again was light . The Republican Third Division , also advancing toward the river in the northeast " panhandle , " moved six miles northeast of Hapsu , important road junction captured last week , meeting virtually no resistance .

Here the Communists withdrew to the north after the action , and air reports indicated that they might be preparing a stand near the hydro-electric power dam at the reservation 's northern end . U. S. Marines Strike Westward ON THE NORTHEAST FRONT , Korea , Monday , Nov. 27 ( R ) ? The United States First Marine Division attacked westward from Changjin Reservoir today against Communist forces pressing against the east flank of the United States Eighth Army in Northwest Korea . A spokesman said the First Marine units ' spearhead reported no opposition in the first two hours , either from the Chinese Communist Eighty-ninth Division or from the tentatively-identified Chinese Communist Sixtieth Division . The terrain made a coordinated jump-off employing mass troops impossible . Marine elements were pushing past a series of seven undefended road blocks , ranging from straw bundles to heavy log emplacements along the road leading west from Yudam . Low-flying Marine Corsair planes ripped the countryside ahead of the Leathernecks with rockets , bombs and machine guns .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
