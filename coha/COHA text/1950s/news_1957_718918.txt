txt There was dancing in the streets last night , a custom inaugurated at the Boston Arts Festival a year ago . To be truthful , it was only a part of one street  --  that section of Boylston adjacent to the Public Garden  --  but there was dancing in it and by people , not performers . As it did last year , the communal event followed a program by the New England Folk Festival Association in the open-air theater by Le Lac des Swan-boats . An ill-timed shower had not prevented a large audience from assembling or the show from going on . It did , however , cause some delay in getting started . The stage was wet and had frequently to be mopped up . The disturbed amplifying system had to be repaired . A A A Finally , the versatile Alan Smith , dancer with the Scottish Country Dance Society and caller for the American Square Dancing , took the stand and had things rolling merrily along .

All through the program these differences , as well as certain similarities , appeared .

A brilliant Morris Dance was done by the men of the Country Dance Society , wearing flowers in their hats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going through their evolutions with grace and precision . A A A The men of the Armenian group did most of the dancing , rich in Oriental feeling , and , characteristically , keeping the women in subdual . The Swedish dances were mainly circular , men and women , happy together at harvest time , or gay in their native polka . A boy and a girl , the girl alive with the lilt of dancing , illustrated dances of young Israel . Mr. Smith guided the proceedings with his usual savoir faire and humor , and then , after the closing Scottish dance , invited the audience to follow the procession to the square-dancing area . Led by four stalwart men with skirling bagpipes , the dancers marched across the stage ( to enthusiastic applause ) and up the garden paths . The audience followed in a quiet , orderly manner . Soon , over the loud speaker , came Mr. Smith 's directing voice . Four couples had come forward from the crowd , and " Dive for the Oyster , Dig for the Clam " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new program had begun .
