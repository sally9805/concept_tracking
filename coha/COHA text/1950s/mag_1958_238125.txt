Nikita Khrushchev 's newest tactic to shake the free world was to give the West six months to make Berlin " a free city , " disengaged from the cold war and demilitarized in the heart of Communist East Germany . It brought predictable cries from critics of the Western allies ' basic positions-of-strength foreign policy that it was time to think through " flexible , " " positive " solutions for the whole of divided Germany . Yet Khrushchev 's belligerence was convincing evidence-particularly to West Germany-that the policy of making West Berlin a showcase of prosperous freedom was successful . <P> Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , who had unduly alarmed West Berliners with legalistic press-conference talk about dealing with East German puppet Communists as " agents " of the U.S.S.R. in " perfunctory , routine matters , " backed a strong statement that the U.S. was " solemnly committed ' ' to West Berlin 's defense , would never abandon " the people of West Berlin to hostile domination . " Vice President Nixon , visiting Britain ( see The Vice-Presidency ) , proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , " and sent a message to West Berlin 's Mayor Willy Brandt : " I , as well as the other members of the American Government , wish to assure you in these difficult times of undiminished American support . " As if to underscore U.S. bipartisanship in Berlin , a U.S. congressional delegation of one Republican , three Democrats , toured both halves of Berlin , after which Ohio 's Democratic Congressman Wayne Hays summed up : " The one thing the Communists respect is force . We must take a strong position and not retreat . " <P> At week 's end Khrushchev let out the word that the Russians would like to discuss things around a round table . There or elsewhere the West would get its chance to talk " new solutions . " Best guideline : stick to the policy that has already been strikingly successful by 1 ) prodding the Russians once more to reunification of Germany by free elections , with free choice whether or not to join NATO ; 2 ) insisting that they keep their pledged word on the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspices and turned the city into a striking outpost of prosperity , hope and defiance only because the Communists wrapped their drab , unsmiling empire around it .
