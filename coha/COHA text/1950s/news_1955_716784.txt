Twenty-two hours later , at 3 A. M. , the situation remained unchanged . Prison officials maintained a waiting attitude and were prepared to keep it that way " for two or three days " if necessary . This was in spite Of a. shouted threat at 9 P. M. : " One shot , one gas bomb , and an five of your screws ( guards ) die .

Prison officials , asserting that " this is a waiting proposition , " refused the offer . Fear of harm to the guards prevented officials from storming the cell block . John I. O'Brien , Chief Warden , told reporters , " I 've got five men in there and I want to give them every protection . " Perley S. Vance , Deputy Warden , said that there were ten prisoners , in addition to the five guards , held in the cell-block last night .

" He made his announcement by public address system in the prison area . He said that he would conduct any prosecution personally .

Later , there were reports from inside the yard that the convicts had broken some windows in the cell block .
