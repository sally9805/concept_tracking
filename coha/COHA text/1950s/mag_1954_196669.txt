Italy 's Reds dislike Mario Scelba with a special fervor . For Premier Scelba is a double threat : he leans to the left with a program that competes for the workman 's allegiance , he is also the tough-minded Interior Minister who in 1948 cowed Italy 's rioting Reds with his jeep-riding celere . Last week , as Scelba prepared to ask the Senate and Chamber to confirm his new government , the Communists took after him in the piazza and in Parliament . <P> Italy 's biggest trade union , the Red-led C.G.I.L .. called 24-hour general strikes on the pretext of demanding an overdue wage increase . But several days before the strikes , the new government of Mario Scelba had cut the ground from under them by promising a raise . That did not stop the Reds : they surged into downtown Rome and massed for a march on the Chamber . Scelba was ready : thousands of his celere rushed in , quietly hustled 500 toughs off to jail . <P> Time to Stop . In Milan and Bologna and elsewhere , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the country , strikes were only partly effective . And even the minor dislocations irritated more than they impressed . Remarks like " It 's time Scelba put a stop to this sort of thing " could be heard as commuters waited for delayed buses . <P> In the small mountain village of Mussomeii , 47 miles from Scelba 's Sicilian birthplace , 900 threadbare townspeople gathered to demonstrate against a new $8-a-year water tax . Egged on by agitators , the crowd tried to storm the town hall ; the police , ordered not to use firearms , tossed tear-gas bombs . Mistaking the missiles for hand grenades , the crowd stampeded into a blind alley . In the crush , three women and a boy were trampled to death . The Reds had the martyrs they wanted . They quickly ordered a " National Demonstration of Mourning and Protest , " a series of leapfrog strikes in the north , a 24-hour walkout in Sicily . <P> " Murderer , Swindler . " The next afternoon , Scelba went to the Senate to outline his program and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked in general terms of land reform and of law and order . Communists hooted , shouted and heckled : " Murderer , swindler , cheat . " It took Scelba two hours to read a 45-minute speech . It was worse in the Chamber a few hours later . The Reds rose as though by signal , screamed . " Faker , liar ! for shame ! " and stomped out of the hall . <P> The Communists ' noisy performance was the kind that lent aid and comfort to such sensational U.S. journalistic jobs as Henry J. Taylor 's recent This Week article . " Italy Is Going Communist ! " U.S. press and politicians , who a few months ago failed to take the Italian situation seriously enough , were now lurching to the other extreme and calling it desperate . But Italy 's Demo-Christian leaders are taking a stronger anti-Communist stand ; Italy 's economy is at a relatively high level . Italy , which is 65% antiCommunist , is by no means ready for a Communist Putsch . <P> Scelba himself ignored the shouts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not underrate the danger of our situation . But we do not agree with those who write that democracy in Italy is heading toward its doom . "
