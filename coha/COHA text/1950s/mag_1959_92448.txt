TOMMY BOLT 1958 Open champion Crystal River , Fla . Golf equipment is improving so much that we will get scores in the low 50s . The perfect game would be getting on the green in the required number of strokes and holing your putt . At Winged Foot that would be 52 , now highly improbable but possible in the years to come . // KEN VENTURI Los Angeles Open champion San Francisco The perfect game is not so much the score as it is the complete satisfaction you feel after playing each hole . I 'm sure Sam Snead does n't think his 59 was a perfect game . No , it will never be played because the better a player becomes the more of a perfectionist he is. // ART WALL JR . 1959 Masters champion Honesdale , Pa . No . A golfer must position each tee shot in the most favorable spot preparatory to getting on the green . Then he has to hit to the proper spot on the green . These two shots alone are well-nigh impossible . If you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel . // DOUG FORD 1957 Masters champion Paradise , Fla . The format would be to make 18 birdies . Sure it 's possible , but it will never be done . Sam Snead shot the lowest score ever in major competition , a 59 . Tommy Bolt shot a 60 at Wethersfield in as fine a game on a tougher course . I think that is as close to perfection as we pros will get . // ARNOLD PALMER 1958 Masters champion Ligonier , Pa . If you mean the perfect game within the realm of probability , maybe it will be played . That would mean hitting 18 perfect tee shots and 18 perfect second shots and landing in the cup in no more than one or two putts . But no one is ever going to birdie 18 holes . // FRANK STRANAHAN 1950 British Amateur champion Toledo In the perfect game you reach the green in the fewest possible number of strokes and hole your first putt . If you can reach the green in two strokes , then the second shot should go in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect driving and putting for 18 holes . // CARY MIDDLECOFF Two-lime U.S. Open champion Hollywood , Fla . I do n't think the perfect game will ever be played . Even on your most fantastic rounds you wo n't hit 36 perfect shots on a par-72 course . A golfer 's natural makeup wo n't let him do it . Sam Snead had 11 one-putt greens when he shot 59 at Greenbrier . That 's pretty close to perfection . // JIMMY DEMARET Three-time Masters champion Houston A perfect game by a pro is one where the shots come off as he plans them . The score has nothing to do with it . He may be playing against the wind or with it . The point is that his plan works . I do n't think the perfect game has ever been played , but it may be done someday . It 's not impossible . // CLAUDE HARMON 1948 Masters champion Mamaroneck , N.Y . The perfect game will never be played . I shot as good a game at Seminole , Fla. as I will ever play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 60 . But I have the chart of that course in my office . And if I show you the pattern of my score you will see that a lot of my shots were not perfect . // TONY PENNA 1948 North and South Open champion Cincinnati What do you mean by a perfect game , the evaluation of every shot or the score ? If you are talking about the score , with a birdie on every hole , a couple of holes in one and eagles on the par 5s , I think it is a possibility . Some day it will be done . Sam Snead did n't come too far from it with a 59. // MIKE SOUCHAK 1959 Tournament of Champions winner Grossinger , N.Y . In football every play is good for a touchdown if each man blocks perfectly . Similarly , in golf , if every shot goes where you plan and you get to the green in the fewest possible shots and hole your putt , it 's a perfect game . This is possible but it will never be played because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco To me , an amateur , a perfect game of golf is a par score on any course . Since it is humanly impossible to hit the ball perfectly every time , I would not give this as a definition of the perfect game . I prefer to say that whenever I break par , I 've played better than a perfect round . // TOMMY ARMOUR Former U.S. Open and PGA champion Defray Beach , Fla . No perfect game is possible in any sport . In golf there will always be something to spoil a perfect game . Tee to green you may be perfect , but then perhaps you 'll fall down on the greens . On a full drive the clubhead moves 20 to 22 feet . I 'm happy if I can hit five perfect drives in a round . // SAM SNEAD Pro at the Greenbrier Country Club White Sulphur Springs , W. Va . Of course , it 's got to be within the realm of possibility . The perfect game of golf should be par on any course . Then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting on each green in less than the number of strokes required for par and holing each green in two putts or less .
