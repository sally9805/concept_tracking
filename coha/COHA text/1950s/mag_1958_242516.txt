Less than a year ago , the attitude of most Tory politicians to their leader , Prime Minister Harold Macmillan , was respectful but restrained : a fine man in the House of Commons , they said , but hardly a man to appeal to the people . He looked too sedately Edwardian ; people did not know what to make of him . Then , partly as a result of his U.S. visit and the widespread rebroadcast of a humanizing TV appearance with Ed Murrow , the British public-and Tory leaders too-began to see their chief in a new light . <P> Last week , after completing a getting-to-know-you tour of Britain 's grimy industrial Midlands-the first by a Prime Minister since Churchill 's V-fingered tours in World War II-Macmillan confirmed the fact that he is something fresh and original in British politics . As one disgruntled Laborite reporter observed while suffering through a factory workers ' ovation for the P.M. : " Why , they 're doing everything but touching their forelocks . " <P> Rope and Chains . It was not that the Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artistocratically rumpled suit , he responded to crowds with a wave that seldom took his arm above his shoulder , and they liked him for not trying to be what he was not . Accompanied by his Lady ( who is a daughter of the late ninth Duke of Devonshire , and showed herself pleasantly old-shoeish ) , Macmillan neatly dodged political questions , mumbled his way through a string of " Splendids , " " Jolly goods , " and " God bless you alls . " Instead of putting people off , his very proper U-ness was apparently just the thing to put giggling factory girls and suntanned Shropshire lads at their ease . He showed endless interest in everything from a boys ' rope-swinging exercise in a Worcester gym class to the manufacture of chains in Walsall . <P> Fed up with " life in that Vatican City called Downing Street , " Macmillan had announced that he was " out to have some fun . " In Wolverhampton , while Lady Macmillan unpacked the bags at the hotel , he popped up at a local Butchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist a good band . " Next day , his pants rolled up , he tramped through the Kidderminster cattle market , chuckled loudly when a runaway pig scampered between his legs ( being photographed with pigs was a specialty of a previous Tory Prime Minister . Stanley Baldwin ) . Later Macmillan dropped in at the Half Moon for a spot of ale . Near Shrewsbury he donned a pair of hastily bought gum boots for a plowing and hedging contest , sloshed over 17 acres , talking farming all the way . <P> The Man Nobody Knew . Back at " Vatican City , " the Prime Minister had every reason to be pleased with his lot . With the Laborites in near disarray , Tory stock was going up , the nation 's gold and dollar reserves were at a seven-year high of more than $3 billion , and not even Britain 's fear of war over Quemoy had produced much of a public clamor . The man nobody thought could ever be popular had brought his party a long way from the dark days of Suez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on our way to having a Father Figure . "
