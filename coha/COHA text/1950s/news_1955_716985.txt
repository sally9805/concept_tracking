txt A flying machine that defies gravity without rotor blades , wings , tail or ordinary propellers was shown here today . At a distance it looks in the air like an airborne manhole cover with a man standing on top . Parked on the ground , it resembles a castiron stew pot on four short legs . This device , officially dubbed a " flying platform " by the Navy , was unveiled at the Hiller Helicopters plant . The machine was designed and built by Hiller Helicopters . It was developed as a research tool under the Office of Naval Research . Its first vertical take-off in free flight with a pilot aboard was made Feb. 4 . The device rises vertically with two counter-rotating ducted fans set horizontally just under the platform on which the pilot stands . A Navy spokesman said it represented anew principle of lift and propulsion known as " the ducted fan . " Controls Are Simple The fans are enclosed in a circular casing . They suck in air through holes in the platform , then thrust it forth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together develop less than 100 horsepower . The contraption is about six feet in diameter and thirty inches high . Two men can carry it . The controls are only a throttle , plus another control for an undisclosed purpose . There also is a small engine temperature gauge . The pilot stands in the center of the platform , his feet strapped in place , his hands on a light railing . He can fly the platform forward , backward or sideways simply by a slight shift in his weight . Although it looks as if it could easily be tipped over , experts say the platform has an inherent stability . The first man to go aloft on the platform was Phil A. Johnston , a World War II fighter pilot who downed two enemy planes. , He says he found the device so simple to fly that it was almost a disappointment . " Sure rd let my kids fly it , " he said . " It 's no trick at all . " Pilots Easily Trained A Hiller spokesman said a novice could fly the round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cheaper to build and simpler to fly , the platform may supplant the helicopter , the spokesman added . It could serve as a flying jeep to carry personnel or , when larger platforms are developed , could transport tanks , guns and other heavy equipment over difficult terrain , it was said . Mr. Johnston said he had flown the platform " quite a few times , " at altitudes from eight inches to eight feet . Once or twice , he scooted over the fields at the Hiller plant at a speed that the Navy did not 3isclose.1 The development of the machine began in 1947 . Stanley Hiller , youthful president of Hiller Helicopters , met Charles Zimmerman. an aircraft engineer , of Bridgeport , Conn . The latter was experimenting with the idea of stabilized vertical take-off flight controlled by shifting of the pilot 's weight . He attached two downwardfacing propellers to the ends of a board and tested their upward thrust . Hiller brought Mr. Zimmerman to his Palo Alto plant to work on the idea . After a year , as expenses mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in 1950 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics . The work attracted the Navy . In 1953 Mr. Hiller was , given a contract . Work got under way in 1954 . Arthur Robertson , an aeronautical engineer who had designed planes for Lockheed and once worked on a flying automobile project , was placed in charge . Mr. Robertson said that , in addition to the thrust of the fan. , lift was provided by the flared lip of the platform , like the edge of a pie tin , The ' fast flow of ; air through the sieved platform by the sucking action of the fans reduces the air pressure over the flaring lip , making the pressure under the lip relatively greater . He also said the counter-rotating fans acted with a gyroscopic effect , producing stability . A problem remaining is emergency protection against engine failure . If either engine conked out now , the platform would drop like a brick . Built a Railroad at 7 Mr. Hiller has been described as " a real-life Tom Swift .

The police told him to keep the vehicle off the streets because of his age . His father , Stanley Hiller Sr. , an inventor who had made his own airplane , taught the boy to fly . The son sat on his father 's lap to reach the controls . Several years later young Hiller surveyed the wreck of a gasoline-power model airplane he had built , salvaged the engine , and built a model racing car . Attached to a pole and a wire , this swept around a ring at 80 miles an hour . There was a demand for his models . In his sixteenth year , he marketed $100,000 worth of the toy racers . While a freshman at the University of California , he became interested in helicopters during physics discussions . Mr. Hiller produced a series of helicopters , One of his latest models landed at Wall Street after taking off in California .
