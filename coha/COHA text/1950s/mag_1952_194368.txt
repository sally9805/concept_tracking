The U.N . truce of 1949 settled the Arab-Israeli fighting , but not the fate of the 880,000 Arab refugees who fled Palestine . They straggled into camps scattered all over the Middle East and settled down to a wretched life in crowded hovels , with bad food , no sanitation , little schooling for their children and increasingly less hope . Each year the U.N . has thrown an embarrassed money handout to the refugees . Last week the annual handout kicked up a brief but bitter fight . <P> Before the General Assembly 's Special Political Committee , Arab delegates charged that " Zionist terrorism " had forced the refugees to flee their homes ; the Israelis accused the Arab spokesman of being Nazi-minded . Then , everybody got down to talking figures . They settled finally on $23 million to sustain life in 880,000 people for one year-$5,000,000 more than last year , but $4,000,000 less than the Arabs asked . <P> Stopgap . The U.N . ' s millions are a stopgap , not a solution . Four years of living on a dole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extremist agitation . Even the unsavory Grand Mufti , who used to control the camps , has recently lost out to the more radical agitators . So long as the refugee camps exist , stability in the Middle East is impossible . <P> Last week there was one leader in the Arab world who seemed to know what to do and to be willing to do it . In a third-floor office in the Syrian general staff headquarters in Damascus , flanked by clanging phones and beset by sniffles and fatigue , Strongman Colonel Adib Shishekly held in his tough fists the key that might possibly unlock the refugee problem . He has just signed an agreement with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for a $30 million project to irrigate the potentially rich , unpopulated and undeveloped northern stretches of his country . On this reclaimed land he expects to settle every last one of the 80,000 refugees in Syria-each with work and housing . <P> Solution . The idea has to be sold skillfully . The refugees , or at least their leaders , regard any attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their dedication to Palestine . Yet the reality is that they can not go home again : the Israelis have already given their land to Jews . Colonel Shishekly labeled his project simply " amelioration of the lot of refugees , " and it was accepted . He impressed the need for caution on the U.N . Though the agreement is signed &; sealed , U.N . headquarters in New York last week referred all inquiries to Damascus . <P> There Shishekly too was diplomatically vague about his refugee resettlement program , and preferred to talk about land reform and reclamation . Lighting a Pall Mall , he said : " We hope the democratic countries-first of which is the U.S.-will help us . With money we can raise the standards of our people and fight bad ideas which are coming from . . . " He paused , leaving the sentence incomplete . His secretary , a young , English-speaking lieutenant , smiled and said : " You know what country the colonel means . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
