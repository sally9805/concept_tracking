During the Battle of Britain , when airmen parachuted by the dozens and scores into the choppy waters of the English Channel , the R.A.F. was never quite satisfied with its , search &; rescue gear . The keenest eyes and the most sensitive radars often missed the tiny , bobbing targets made by helmeted heads and yellow Mae Wests . <P> Last week , more than a dozen years after the R.A.F. 's heroic tangle with the Luftwaffe , Ultra Electric Ltd .. a London television manufacturer , announced that its engineers have finally built a reliable gadget for finding lost flyers . For more than 200 NATO delegates at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough . <P> Ultra demonstrated " SARAH " ( search and rescue and homing ) , a tiny ( 42-oz. ) transmitter-receiver , small enough to be hung on a Mae West . <P> Downed pilots need only pull a ring to release a coiled , 31-in. antenna , and the little , battery-powered transceiver automatically transmits distress signals . Search planes as high as 10,000 ft. and as far away as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antennas . Matched like radar pips on the face of a cathode-ray tube , the signal from each antenna is the same length when the plane is headed directly toward the target . Directly over the target , both pips disappear . Then the downed pilot switches to voice communication for final instructions to his rescuers .
