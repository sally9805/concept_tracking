Key to Air Supremacy <P> THE cold war has created a new kind of industrial battlefield . Obscure and little-known , it lies behind closed laboratory doors . There , researchers for industry and Government are tackling the problem of developing and perfecting wonder metals " - those metals capable of meeting the unparalleled strains and stresses of the jet and atomic age . Aircraft builders have already laid down this axiom : the nation which first masters the use of wonder metals will rule the air . <P> Jet engines often reach temperatures3,700 Fahrenheit at the core of their blast hot enough to burn ordinary steel like paper . The planes themselves are approaching speeds at which aluminum aircraft skins would lose their strength , then melt . Nor is heat the only problem . Building of the first atomic reactors disclosed the fact that most metals absorb or " eat up " the atomic neutrons needed to provide the fission and motive power . <P> The great metals search explores a field that is relatively new . Some of the new metals were little more than laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these curiosities were found to have enormous possibilities . <P> Two of the best-known " wonder metals , aluminum and magnesium are now commonplace , although a few decades ago they were prohibitively high priced . Aluminum and its alloys are still the basic materials of all aircraft . But magnesium , which is one-third lighter , is encroaching on aluminum 's domain ( Douglas 's 1,238-m.p.h . Skyrocket has a magnesium-sheet fuselage ) . In the field of atomic power the most important metal , next to uranium , is zirconium . Reason : it is one of the few metals yet found which will not absorb atomic neutrons . But it is a frightening metal to process ; in powder form it is so unstable that it will ignite from the motion of just being transferred from one dish to another . Its ores are more plentiful than tin , but the metal itself is still scarce . <P> Until recently , one of the scarcest and hardest-sought metals was columbium . Although not extraordinarily tough in itself , it mixes with steel , nickel and other metals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. must depend on Africa , however , for 95% of its limited supply . Accordingly , a big hunt was started for substitutes and yielded the most promising wonder metal of all-titanium . <P> Titanium , the world 's ninth most common element , is almost everywhere in the earth in minute quantities . It has been used for years in a powdered , oxide form to make paints whiter and make them cover better . But titanium combines so readily with any other element that for years it was considered impossible to refine as a pure metal ( scientists call it " the streetwalker " because it will pick up anything ) .
