With proper medieval pomp and ceremony , the University of Bologna 's top academicians and some important guests , e.g. , U.S. Ambassador to Italy Clare Boothe Luce , Italy 's Education Minister Giuseppe Ermini , gathered in the high-ceilinged Aula Magna last week to inaugurate a new addition to one of Europe 's oldest universities : the Bologna Center of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , first U.S. graduate school to be established on the Continent. * Said Ambassador Luce : " America is not here to add something to Bologna 's centuries-old tradition . . . but to gain strength from it in a specialized field . " <P> Spirit &; Substance . The University of Bologna has much strength to offer , both in spirit and scholarly substance . Although its exact origins are lost in the mists of 11th century history , during the 13th century Bologna attracted as many as 10,000 students a year to study canon and civil law , rhetoric and composition . Organized into 35 separate " Nations , " foreign and Italian students hired their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonacademic matters . Later , branching out in the arts and sciences , Bologna over the centuries mothered some of Christendom 's greatest intellectuals , e.g. , Dante , Petrarch , Copernicus , built up what is probably Western Europe 's finest library ( 500,000 volumes ) of history and economics . <P> Although its library and its cosmopolitan tradition helped bring Bologna Europe 's first U.S. graduate school , the project 's prime mover has been its director , slight , affable C. ( for Charles ) Grove Haines , 48 , onetime professor of diplomatic history at Johns Hopkins ' School of Advanced International Studies in Washington . While serving as a temporary State Department attach in postwar Italy , Historian Haines had an idea : the young experts the U.S. and its allies need to conduct European affairs could best be trained on location . After winning over his Johns Hopkins superiors , Haines went back to Bologna with a detailed program , got Rector Felice Battaglia 's offer of the use of all university facilities . U.S. donors agreed to underwrite the center 's annual $200,000 cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Bright Young People . The center will operate on a limited scale ( eleven students , three professors ) until July , but Director Haines 's plans call for an eventual enrollment of 50 U.S. and West European students ( most of them on fellowships ) and eight full-time professors , six of them European specialists . Standards will be high ( passing grade : B ) , classes limited to ten or twelve students apiece , with heavy emphasis on original research into broad subjects , e.g. , Governmental Structures for Conduct of Foreign Affairs , Administrative Law and Practice in Italy . Required for admission : a college degree , fluency in at least one European language , an outstanding academic record in the social sciences . Tuition : $800.
