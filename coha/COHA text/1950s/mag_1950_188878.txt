In Fascism 's heyday , Italy 's press minded its political p 's &; q 's , covered celebrities from a respectful distance and avoided sensations like the plague . But at war 's end , editors gave violent vent to long-suppressed enterprise and emotions . They soaked their pages in sentimental crime stories , enthusiastically badgered headliners from Winston Churchill to Ingrid Bergman , encouraged reporters and photographers to operate like workers in the gaudiest days of Chicago journalism . <P> One of the most enterprising of the new generation was squat , baby-faced Photographer Ivo Meldolesi , 34 , who was acquitted of collaboration charges in 1945 for " insufficient proof of guilt . " Last spring , Meldolesi made front pages in Europe and the U.S. with two notable beats . Masquerading as a Capri fisherman , he snapped the only picture of Britain 's Princess Margaret in a bathing suit ; later , he surprised camera-shy Greta Garbo without her hat , got a shot of her covering her face with her long , tawny hair . Last week , Meldo-lesi 's energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and photographed Italy 's famed Bandit Salvatore Giuliano ( TIME , Sept. 12 ) . <P> Nighttime Nibble . Two months ago while 2,000 hand-picked carabinieri scoured Sicily 's wind-whipped hills in a vain search for Giuliano , Meldolesi hinted to Italian editors that the celebrated " Robin Hood of Sicily " had invited him to his hideout . Only Editor Edilio Rusconi of Milan 's weekly Oggi ( Today ) fell for Meldolesi 's story . Rusconi assigned a top reporter to work with him , paid 800,000 lire ( about $1,300 ) for the promised beat . <P> Knowing Giuliano 's affection for his mother ( " the dearest thing in our lives " ) , Meldolesi wangled permission to photograph the old lady in jail ( where she is being held for helping her son ) . Roaming the countryside , he showed the pictures to every peasant , carter and fisherman he met , hoping one would pass the word along . A month passed , with nary a nibble . Late one night , as Meldolesi and Reporter Jacopo Rizza wandered into the hills near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pair to an abandoned stable . Next morning , the door flew open and in strode Giuliano . <P> The bandit was wearing boots , riding breeches , a yellow sweater and an ornate belt buckle which , he explained , had " a star for luck , a lion for strength , an eagle for cleverness . " Posing for Meldolesi 's pictures , Giuliano cleared up any misconceptions about the size of his " army . " Said the bandit : " We have seldom been more than 20 men all told . In these mountains , it is easier for three men to see a marching column than for a column to see three men . " <P> Glorified Crime . The Giuliano issue of Oggi was a swift sellout ( 1,200,000 copies ) . It had barely hit the streets when the conservative // Tempo accused its rival of " basically indecent " conduct in consorting with a bandit . Embarrassed Minister of Interior Mario Scelba fired Palermo 's chief of police , ordered the Mi-Jan police to arrest Meldolesi , Rizza and Editor Rusconi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime .
