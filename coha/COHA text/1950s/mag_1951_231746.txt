At 3:15 a.m. , as Pan American World Airways ' El Presidente winged northward across the Brazilian jungles , one of its four engines ran rough . The steward woke the 38 passengers , explaining that their Stratocruiser would have to land for brief repairs at Belem , near the mouth of the <P> Amazon . A grumbling line formed outside the men 's room as passengers hurried to wash and shave . Suddenly , a huge figure in white silk pajamas brushed past the queue , commandeered one of the wash-stands and vigorously commenced a predawn toilet . Don Mauricio Hochschild , Bolivia 's fabulously wealthy tin magnate , was in a hurry to get to New York . <P> At Belem , Don Mauricio brusquely took command of the Pan American ground force while other passengers straggled off to an airport breakfast . Soon he pried out information that the plane would need a new engine , might be held up in Belem for a day or two . Don Mauricio burned up the wires to New York-not to Pan American but to W. R. Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panagra is the rival service that flies down South America 's west coast . <P> Don Mauricio said he wanted a plane that would get him to New York-quick . He explained that his wife got earaches flying ; they were fed up with ordinary " public " planes . <P> Early next morning , a Panagra DC-6 landed in Belem on charter to Hochschild , having flown nearly 3,000 miles into territory where no Panagra plane had ever ventured before . Shortly afterward , the 57-passenger plane took off for New York , carrying Don Mauricio , his wife and nobody else . " What money wo n't do ! " gasped one of the stranded passengers . Thirty-nine hundred miles and 12 hours later , Hochschild 's DC-6 touched down at New York 's Idlewild airport , having just about shattered all known records for a private charter flight . Though Panagra declined to talk about the feat , the gossip was that Hochschild had shelled out some $40,000-at $1,500 an hour .                 @ @ @ @
