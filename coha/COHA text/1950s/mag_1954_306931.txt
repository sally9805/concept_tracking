The British aircraft industry , still reeling from the heavy blows of successive Comet crashes , last week bounced off the ropes and back into the center of the ring . After negotiations in London ( TiME , June 7 ) , Capital Airlines President J. H. ( " Slim " ) Carmichael , 47 , flew back to the U.S. with the news that he was buying a whole fleet of British turboprop transports , expects to start operating them by next April . He bought three Vickers Viscounts , has an option on 37 more , to replace most of his Constellations , DC-3s and DC-4s . Total price : $45 million . <P> To towering ( 6 ft. 4 in . ) Slim Carmichael the Vickers-Armstrongs Viscount seemed custom-made for Capital . It is powered by four Rolls-Royce turboprops ( i.e. , gas-turbine engines that drive propellers ) , can carry 48 passengers at a cruising speed of 335 m.p.h . In service with British European Airways , Air France and Air Lingus , the Viscount has proved an economical operator over medium-distance routes such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest . On European routes its vibration-free performance and relative silence have lured many a traveler from piston-engine planes . While operating cost per hour will be slightly higher than for Capital 's DC-4s , the actual cost per seat-mile will be less owing to the Viscount 's 115-m.p.h. greater speed . Sample new schedule : 1 hr. 31 min. between Cleveland and New York compared to the present 1 hr. 50 min. run . Says Carmichael : " The Viscount will be the most profitable plane we ever operated . " <P> Carmichael found it easy to finance the deal through Vickers since the British are eager to break into the U.S. market . By 1957 Viscounts should completely retire Capital 's Constellations and a good part of its fleet of DC-3s and DC-4s . One big advantage : the Viscount can operate from all but three of the 51 fields on Capital 's routes , whereas Capital 's Constellations can not operate from 15 , and its DC-4s can not operate from ten . Says Slim Carmichael : " This plane puts us close to the airline operator 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one type of plane and one type of engine . " <P> Carmichael , who got a flying start as a barnstormer years ago and was a commercial airline pilot and airline executive for years before becoming president of Capital in 1947 , will be the first to fly British planes over U.S. commercial routes . But Slim Carmichael is not scared by innovation . Six years ago , he launched the first air-coach service . It has not only helped pull Capital out of the red ( to a net of $1,652,289 in 1953 ) , but has since been copied by every other major U.S. airline .
