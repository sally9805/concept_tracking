In the U.S. and Britain for the past fortnight , thousands of scientists have been getting together to discuss ways &; means of making the world a less perilous place to live in . <P> The 118th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Chicago attracted some 9,000 scientists who brought along a staggering total of 1,181 papers . The chemists and chemical engineers were pleased by progress in production and use of cortisone and ACTH , delighted by reports on improved petroleum weapons in man 's war against the insects , but worried about a major problem of the atomic age : safe disposal of deadly radioactive waste material . <P> In Birmingham , England , scientists attending the 112th meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , spent three hours heatedly debating the Wegener theory of continental drift. * Finally they put the question to a vote . The result , an even division for and against , proved that the scientists are as thoroughly split as the continents . Less controversial was a speech by Sir Harold Hartley , the group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's biggest problems : 1 ) the growing strain of increasing population , 2 ) the malnutrition and endemic sickness of perhaps half the world , 3 ) the inequalities between the more forward and the backward peoples , 4 ) the gradual depletion of resources and their unequal distribution , 5 ) the human problem of improving the way of life of many of the earth 's millions . <P> At Harvard more than 1,000 of the world 's leading mathematicians met in the International Congress of Mathematicians - the first to be held in the U.S. since 1893 . The main purpose of the congress was to give mathematicians , who are seldom understood by anyone else , a chance to talk to each other about their specialties . Mathematicians from 45 countries showed up , but a message from the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science stated that Russia 's mathematicians could not possibly get around to attending because they were " very much occupied with their regular work .
