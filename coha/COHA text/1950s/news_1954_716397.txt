txt WASHINGTON , July ** defeat of the health reinsurance bill is a defeat for the American people , President Eisenhower said today . He spoke with uncommon indignation ' when the question came up at his news conference . He declared that those who had voted against it " just do n't understand what are the facts of American life . " The House of Representatives yesterday voted , 238 to 134 , to send back to committee- an Administration bill to encourage the improvement and expansion of private and nonprofit hospital and medical insurance plans . The central feature would be a $25 , - 000,000 Federal fund on which cooperating insurance groups could draw to meet abnormal losses . After telling his press conference he would continue to fight for a reinsurance program as long as he was President , General Eisenhower dispatched a supplemental appropriation request for $33,556,000 for the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , with $25,000,000 of the amount intended for financing the House-rejected health measure . Although this action served notice of the President 's expectation of favorable Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of a legis lative formality . These " budget estimates " are a necessary part of Executive requests for authorizing legislation . House leaders continued to insist that the reinsurance program was " dead " for the rest of the session in that branch of Congress . The White House authorized direct quotation of the President 's reply to a request for comment . " Well , I hope you did n't invite me to use up the rest of our time // making a speech , " the President began . He locked the fingers - of his hands tightly together in front of him as he continued : " Ladies and gentlemen , in the campaign I made two promises that have to do with the health of the American people . I said , first , that I was opposed to socialized medicine , and would use every single attribute and influence of the Presidential office to . defeat any move toward socialized medicine . " I also , in talking about the great deficiencies in medical care in this country and , particularly , for people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now available to us in our best hospitals , that something must be done . * * " I am sure that the people that voted against this bill just do n't understand what are the facts of American life . " At this point the President was pounding the desk top with the fingers of his right hand . " I do n't consider that anyone lost yesterday , except the American people . * * * When the opponents of the plan get up in the House and say that this is only an effort of the Republicans to redeem our campaign promise , I plead guilty . " Of course , I am trying to redeem my campaign promises , and I will never cease trying . This is only a temporary defeat . This thing will be carried forward as long as I am in this office . " Representative Charles A. Wolverton , Republican of New Jersey , sponsor of the measure and chairman of the committee that reported it to the House , blamed the American Medical Association for the defeat of the bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Welfare Committee , urged the Senate in a speech to go ahead with its version of the reinsurance plan . The New Jersey Republican joined Representative Wolverton in blaming the American Medical Association for the House action yesterday . He said Senate debate would " demonstrate to the people what this program is * * * and place responsibility where it belongs , on the people who would sabotage * * * the best program ever suggested . " Although the President promised to continue his fight for the plan , informed sources said no serious effort would be made to bring up the issue in the House again at this session , and that if it was pushed in the Senate now it would only create a legislative snarl . Instead , it was indicated , the Republican leadership hopes to use the issue effectively in the fall campaign against Democrats in marginal city districts who voted against it .
