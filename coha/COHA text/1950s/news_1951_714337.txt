txt With the disclosures of the corruption of his administration continuing seemingly without end , President Truman is striving desperately to lay the ghost of Pendergastism before the 1952 Presidential election . Whether he can do it is the anxious subject of conjecture among Democratic leaders . Many of those friendliest to the President concede privately that the scandal of the corruption he has tolerated and even condoned eliminates him automatically as a candidate for a third term . The only hope of their party , they think , is to seek safety first by nominating an &-; tarnished candidate . " Down with Pendergastism " has become a battle-cry raised by Republicans a n d anti - Truman Democrats . It begins to look as if it would ring thru the 1952 election campaign , particularly if Mr. Truman should be the Democratic candidate . - Considers House Cleaning Facing the burgeoning corruption crisis , the President cut short his Key West vacation and re-a turned to Washington . He is reported to have two house cleaning courses under consideration . One is reported to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau of investigation , to investigate the whole corruption mess . The other is reported to be appointment of two distinguished lawyers , one a Democrat , one a Republican , to prosecute t lI e grafters as President Coolidge did in the Teapot Dome scandal . The latter course appeals strongly to many Truman lieutenants because Coolidge thereafter was elected overwhelmingly despite the scandal . Mr. Truman is particularly vulnerable to the charge of Pendergastism for two reasons . One is that the corruption exposed , in the collection of federal taxes , in the enforcement of tax , anti-trust , and other laws , in the loans of public funds to administration favorites by the Reconstruction Finance corporation and in the administration of other agencies - takes on more and more the appearance of the corrupt practices of the notorious Boss Tom Pendergast of Kansas City . Protege of Boss The other is that Mr. Truman was a political protege of Boss Pendergast and is still the most important cog in the Pendergast machine . The nominal present boss , is Jim Pendergast , Tom 's nephew , who sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership dues to the Jackson County Democratic club , which is the Pendergast organization . But on at least one occasion that came to public notice Mr. Truman was revealed as the real boss from whom Jim Pendergast takes orders . The late Tom Pendergast was a big , bull-necked bruiser of a man , cunning , ruthless , remorseless , truculent , and domineering . For nearly 20 years , he ruled Kansas City and , finally , the state of Missouri , with the tentacles of his power reaching into Washington to which he had , sent Harry Truman as United States senator . Pendergast stole e l e o n s , stuffing the ballot boxes for Truman and . other candidates with the ballots of 50,000 " ghost voters , " so-called because their names had been copied from tombstones . ' Me boss sold his ready mixed concrete and building materials for the contracts made by Harry Truman and other Pendergast county and city office holders for paving and public construction . Truman said the Pendergast products were as good as any other and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected vice and crime . He fixed taxes and judges , procured exemptions from law and other favors for business interests and the politically influential quite in the manner now being made familiar to the public by the current exposure of the . Truman administration corruptionists . But he was good to the poor . " Feed ' em and vote ' em , " was Boss Pendergast 's motto . In 1922 , when the old boss was looking for a candidate for Jackson county judge the equivalent of a county commissioner , Truman Ivas suggested by the present boss , Jim Prendergast . Jim had met Harry in an army camp . The old boss liked Harry , who was then 38 , and presently Harry became " Judge " Truman . Four years later , he became presiding judge , a position he held until 1934 . During his incumbency Truman handled 60 million dollars of county funds . Dead Men Vote In 1934 , Truman asked Pendergast for the office of county tax collector , a fee job worth $30,000 a year . The boss was sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman landed as Pendergast 's third choice for United States senator . Truman , by virtue of the " ghost voters , " was nominated by a plurality of 41,000 . By 1940 , the election rolls had been largely purged of " ghog , . voters " in consequence of the 193E election frauds for which 259 Pendergast henchmen were convicted later , they were released from prison by Presidents Roosevelt and Truman . But Truman was renominated by a margin of 7,000 votes delivered by Bob Hannegan of St. Louis , who went on to become Democratic national chair. ; man . Hannegan subsequently maneuvered the nomination of Truman for Vice President , became Truman 's first postmaster general , resigned in 1947 , and died two years later worth several million dollars . Tom a Fearsome Boss Old Tom was a fearsome boss and made a fortune robbing the taxpayers and shaking down bustneis men in the manner emulated by the Truman administration corruptionists . But in the end he crashed . In 1929 , the fire insurance companies in Missouri increased their rates 16 2-3 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts impounded the excess premiums , which by 1935 aggregated 9 million dollars : A few months later , Boss Pendergast 's state insurance superintendent , Robert Emmett O'Malley , signed a compromise with the 14 insurance companies whereby they were to receive 80 per cent of the impounded 9 millions and the policyholders 20 per cent . In 1936 , the internal revenue bureau discovered that the 14 insurance companies had paid $100 , - 500 to Charles R. Street , vice president of the General American Insurance company , who had made the settlement with O'Malley . From admissions made by Street , it was suspected that he paid the money to Pendergast . But the revenue bureau either failed or neglected to get the goods on the boss . In 1938 , the Kansas City Star heard this story and reported it to th  --  e Democratic Gov . Stark of Missouri , who brought about a conference at the treasury department attended by internal revenue bureau officials and Maurice M. Milligan , United States attorney for the western district of - isamri . Tells $750,000 Bribe Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suppressed evidence in the internal revenue bureau , which when released resulted in the indictment of James P. Finnegan , former St. Louis tax collector , for taking bribes , so Gov . Stark , to the embarrassment of the internal revenue officials read a memorandum of the photostats of the 14 insurance checks in their files . Spurred to activity , the treasury assigned to the investigation its ace investigator , Rudolph Hartmann , who had traced the $50,000 ransom in the Lindbergh kidnaping case to the kidnaper . Hartmann found that Street had collected an additional $330,000 and paid it to the same person as before . Milligan summoned a grand jury and the insurance company executives . He turned on the heat and eventually one of them was induced to tell the story of how , at a meeiing in Chicago , Pendergast agreed for a bribe of $750,000 to effect a settlement favorable. to the companies . Street died before the full amount was paid but up to that time Pendergast had revived $440,000 and had given $62,500 to O'Malley . Neither Pendergast nor O'Malley reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was determined that in 10 years , Pendergast had d e - frauded the government of half a million dollars in taxes . Loyal to the End When Milligan was ready to indict Pendergast and O'Malley for tax evasion , the treasury department asked him for a delay of 30 to 60 days , which sounds a lot like the treasury shenanigans in tax cases of today . Milligan was suspicious and slammed thru the indictments the next day . The defendants pleaded guilty and went to prison , where they joined numerous Pendergast henchmen doing time for election frauds . Pendergast came out of prison a broken man , forsaken by his wife and many of his former friends , but not by Vice President Truman . When Pendergast died Jan. 26 , 1945 , the Vice President ordered an army bomber and flew to the funeral of the fallen boss at public expense . " He was my friend and I was his , " said Truman . He was loyal to Pendergast to the end . After he became President Truman vetoed the reappointment of District Atty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pendergastism Lives on The old boss was dead , but Pendergastism lived on . Jim Pendergast was the new boss in name , at least , tho it soon appeared that President T r u m a n , vice president of the Pendergast organization , was - the real boss , For in 1946 , Pendergast , who had declared for the renomination of Rep. Slaughter ED. , Mo. , found himself summoned to Washington and compelled to eat his words by Mr. Truman , who commanded the retirement of the congressman . Slaughter , as a member of the house rules committee , had failed to do the President 's bidding . Pendergast complied and Slaughter was defeated for renomination . The President 's candidate , Enos Axtell , %vas successful in the . primary , but %vas defeated in the general election . The primary had been redolent of fraud . After a cursory inquiry by the department of justice and a whitewash , a Missouri state grand jury indicted 71 Pendergast henchmen for vote frauds . Before the case could come to trial , Pendergast eracksmen blew open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with the incriminating ballots . By a coincidence , Truman was asleep that night in the neighboring MuehlebaCh hotel . Republicans in congress clamored for federal action against the miscreants , but the department of justice with no protest from Mr. Truman dragged its feet until the statute of limitations had run its course and the Pendergast gang was safe from prosecution .
