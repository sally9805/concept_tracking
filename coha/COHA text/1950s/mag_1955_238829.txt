A French general with eight police inspectors , 30 gendarmes and a section of paratroopers drew up in a hurry outside the Hotel des Thermes in Madagascar one day last week . They came not to try the golf course , to splash in the pool or to take the waters ( which are said to be good for that old weakspot of Frenchmen , the liver ) . They came instead to see a splendidly installed prisoner , the exiled Sultan of Morocco , Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef . French General Georges Catroux , 78 , found His Majesty waiting for him in a nearby villa once occupied by Aly Khan and Rita Hayworth . <P> Back from Madagascar . General C-troux 's mission was to win Ben Youssef 's approval for Premier Edgar Faure 's ingenious plan to settle the Moroccan crisis ( TIME , Sept. 5 ) . The French propose to depose the present puppet Sultan . Sidi Mohammed ben Moulay Arafa , but not to restore Ben Youssef , who would , however , be able to leave Madagascar and live more luxuriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strong position . Until he approved Faure 's plan , Morocco 's loyal nationalists would not give the French an inch . Yet Ben Youssef was miserable in exile : his Buick had been stolen , he had less than half his usual complement of 40 concubines with him , and he daily complained about drafts in the hotel . Three sessions with Catroux were enough to convince His Majesty where his best interests lay . Ben Youssef agreed to broadcast a message ordering his faithful subjects to avoid more violence . <P> Over to Tangier . Convincing the other Sultan , Moulay Arafa , was a task for another French general , Pierre Georges Boyer de Latour , the new French Resident-General in Morocco . Last week De Latour called on the old man in his dazzling white palace at Rabat and delicately indicated that the time had come to leave . <P> From the French colons and their ally in intransigeance , aged El Glaoui , the Pasha of Marrakech , came exactly the opposite advice : Stay where you are . Moulay Arafa uncomfortably announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time looked longingly at the sumptuous palace waiting for him across the border in Tangier . <P> The next move was up to Premier Faure , who had promised a " solution " by Sept. 12 . At week 's end , he announced what he had in mind : once the old and new Sul tans had been replaced by a three-man regency council , a Moroccan government with control over most of Morocco 's internal affairs would be set up in Rabat . This new regime would negotiate a new political link with France , revising the obsolete protectorate treaty of 1912 . <P> The new arrangement would set Morocco on the way to what Paris called " independence within interdependence . " It was not freedom , and it might not last , but it was an improvement . <P> our hundred French air force reservists , recalled for service in Morocco , refused to board a southward-bound troop train at the Gare de Lyon in Paris this week . " Leave Morocco to the Moroccans , " the airmen shouted . " We do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police finally rounded them all up and drove them back to their barracks .
