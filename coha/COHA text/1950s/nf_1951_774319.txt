txt  | The adult may use any words he wishes to list and describe his own objectives for children . He may borrow from the writings of the founding fathers , from famous historical documents , from John Dewey and others , to clarify his thinking about democratic values , democratic relations , democratic methods . But he will not make the mistake of thinking that the children will be able to understand , and accept as their own , these objectives expressed in general abstract terms . A child 's vocabulary largely describes specifics . Abstract words and phrases , such as respect for the rights of others , responsibility , integrity , are understood only when translated into action . The right of each child to have his turn on the swing is the beginning of an understanding of " respect for the rights of others . " Willingness to clean up after a school party or following through the plans of a committee to successful completion are specifics which carry the meaning of the word responsibility . In setting up objectives with children , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be overstressed . Objectives are always set in relation to a particular situation . They may be long-term goals , covering the time the group will be together ; they may relate to short-term projects carried out within the total program ; they may be immediate aims to be accomplished during the day 's work . LaSalle in The Guidance of Children Through Physical Education gives many examples of children setting their own goals after realization of needs . For example , in one case , the children realized that they were missing the first part of their physical education period by allowing noise and confusion to exist . Through discussion , the teacher and children stated the problem , arrived at their objective , made suggestions for improvement , tried these out , evaluated the results , made further plans and finally achieved their goal , namely , less noise and confusion and more time for play.l The scope of the objectives set will determine the scope of evaluation . This is readily understood in terms of physical activities . If the objective is " learning to play newcomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than if concern is specifically footnote 1 LaSalle , Dorothy . The Guidance of Children Through Physical Education . New York : A. S. Barnes and Company , 1946 , p. 129-34.  | centered on " learning to serve the ball " and ways to estimate progress in learning to serve . Objectives in the area of human relations have this same difference in scope . Many specific objectives are set in the course of a program , each specific related to and contributing to the larger goal which children may gradually come to understand and accept . They understand and accept as they build many particular experiences in democratic living into a generalized concept of what being democratic means . Listing Desirable Outcomes . The adult leader lists desirable outcomes , that is , he lists behaviors that will show that the objectives are being attained . In the process of evaluating he helps the children to see the ways of behaving that are desirable for them in the light of the objectives they have set themselves . The adult 's thinking might follow this pattern as to objectives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimum development in relation to the group 2 . Increased ability to face and solve problems with the group and to evaluate results 3 . Increased ability to accept those who are different ; better understanding of themselves 4 . Willingness to face unfamiliar situations which call for adjustments to change 5 . Respect and recognition for the contributions of others 6 . A sense of belonging to the group with a sharing of responsibility for what the group does 7 . Consideration for the rights of others . In this situation , these are some outcomes which will show that these objectives are being reached . The outcomes are stated in question form . 1 . A sense of achievement through optimum development in relation to the group : Does the physical examination show him free from defects ? Is there effective follow-up where defects are present ? Does he have adequate opportunities to experience success ? Does he seek fun and what forms of fun does he seek ? Is he growing in appreciation of related areas through reading , dancing or listening to music ? Is he interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity geared in terms of subsequent reward and recognition or some of it self-motivated and spontaneous ? Is he given opportunities in activities to do what is natural and highly valued for his maturity level , that is , rolling on the floor , bumping others , running , dodging , jumping or climbing ? Does he have adequate opportunity to experience many types of activities ? How many types of activities can he do well ? Has he enough skill to maintain status with his group ? Is he growing in independence of adult control ? Is he able to proceed on his own ? Does he feel important in his group in at least one function ? 2 . Increased ability to face and solve problems with the group and to evaluate results : Does he recognize a problem and then participate in its solution ? Does he react to discipline with understanding ? Deos he feel that he has been fairly treated ? Does he like to finish what he starts out to do ? Is he able to compromise in serving group interests to solve a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to list desirable outcomes in relation to other objectives . In any particular situation , with any particular group of children in mind , the listings can be much more specific than is possible here . Having clarified for himself the outcomes desired , the adult leader is on the alert for opportunities in day-by-day operations to help the individual child and the group to see the ways in which they need to behave in order to do what they want to do . Ways of being responsible then become , not just ways the teacher says you should or must behave , but ways that will help to accomplish something you want very much to do . In evaluation children are helped to consider their behavior toward others in the context of the specific objectives they have . They learn through their successes and mistakes . They learn more and best with the kind of guidance that makes for more trial with success than trial and error . Selecting or Devising Techniques . Elaborate instruments and procedures are not ordinarily called for in programs for children .  | Simple ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As often as not the children themselves may devise the technique . Examples are : listing a series of questions to be answered by each member of the group , deciding upon the items to be included in a rating scale , describing the ways a leader should act in a given situation , working out headings to be used for self-appraisal . The development of the instrument for evaluating may be in itself a learning experience directed toward consideration of ways of behaving democratically . Whether the techniques are selected or devised , there are two important bases for using them . Obviously , they must be suited to the level of understanding of the children with whom they are used . Just as obviously , they must be selected because they will provide the information sought . Making the Appraisals . Evaluation is immediate and spontaneous ? " We forgot to ask John to play , so it is our fault that he went home . " " Mary and Dora just finished this poster . Is n't it a beauty ? " Evaluation is a planned procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried out this plan of practicing the game , shall we meet back here and see how the plan worked ? " Evaluation is stock-taking from time to time on the road toward a long-term goal . " At the end of the term we want to entertain our parents at a square dance party . What have we learned so far that will help us to give a good party ? " Evaluation is final appraisal after a project is completed or a problem is solved . Estimates are made of successes and failures , what was done that could have been done better , how assignments were fulfilled and the like . Evaluation is most meaningful to children when it follows hard upon the heels of action . The following description illustrates this point and also shows that evaluation need not be a formalized procedure . It was traditional for the fourth grade to conduct a field day . Through discussion , the class agreed upon an outline for the event to which other school groups were to be invited . A central committee was set up to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of other committees according to interests and the abilities of class members to carry out particular tasks .  | Goals were set up and these were outlined in the following way : 1 . Everyone is to participate , visitors as well as hosts . 2 . All are to have a good time . 3 . Members of the fourth grade shall be individual hosts to one or more visitors . 4 . All events are to start and stop on time . 5 . Recognition is to be given to individuals and groups wherever possible . 6 . All details are to be taken care of so that no last-minute preparation will be necessary . 7 . Committee chairmen are to be alert and take care of any unforeseen situation that may develop . 8 . Each committee is to evaluate its own part in the program and make suggestions for improvement . 9 . The general committee is to evaluate the whole day and make suggestions for improvement . The main goal was : " All are to have a good time . " If this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be included in the division of responsibility . Proof of this came with evaluation . Jane , chairman of the planning committee , said , " I found that I had nothing to do except to take part in netball because everyone did what he was supposed to do . " Barbara , a quiet child , said , " This was the best day this year . John made a good leader . He saw to it that everyone had his turn , even if the time was short . " Mary , in a surprised voice , reported , " All the girls told me what a good time they had . They want us to visit them in turn . Maybe we have started something . " Harold , the snack chairman , contributed , " Everyone helped to clean up . I hope Mary 's mother makes cookies for us again . " Al said , " The umpire was late and we did n't get started on time at our court . Maybe we should have written him a note instead of just telephoning him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . Next time maybe I 'd better write . " " Write what we call a confirming note , ' " the teacher contributed . Thank-you notes from the visitors gave the class an additional sense of satisfaction in achieving the main goal . The central committee placed brief written recommendations in the teacher 's log book for the consideration of next year 's fourth grade . There are no hard and fast rules governing how to make appraisals . A free discussion may bring out all the necessary points . On the other hand , the preparation of a form for discussion or for self and group appraisal may well serve to sharpen thinking regarding the matters to be covered .  | Interpreting Findings . When a test for a motor skill is given , the good teacher is careful to see that the children understand how it is scored and discusses with them what the scores received mean for progress made and future practice . Similarly , the findings from a rating scale to self-appraise behavior in the dressing room , or from a discussion of how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . As much as possible the interpretation should come from the children . The adult leader 's role is to see the place where the children 's insight leaves off and through asking leading questions or providing specific information help them to understand more fully what the findings mean . Relating the results of one kind of evaluation to those of another is often helpful to increase this understanding . For instance , findings from observation and a self-appraisal form may be related or a sociodrama may be designed to clarify the points made in a discussion of group organization to conduct a tournament . The purpose , of course , of interpreting findings is always to clarify the base for further planning and action . Revising Objectives . When this step has been reached in evaluating , the group is back at the beginning of the process and the process starts anew . It is sometimes difficult for children to understand this , to understand that their purposes change . It is even difficult for some adult leaders to comprehend this fact , particularly when they are accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult leader who takes the children into the planning is better able to see how their needs change and their purposes are modified and changed in a situation designed to be responsive to these changes . Someone has called the flexibility in program planning required to make the program fit the changing needs and purposes of children " playing by ear . " It means alertness on the part of the adult leader to see what is really happening in a given group and willingness to abandon the security of knowing in detail for a long time ahead what activities will be undertaken . This adult , within the framework of the situation which places some restrictions on what activities may be undertaken , encourages the children to plan their own program with his guidance and to carry out and evaluate their own plans .  | Techniques for Evaluating Any instrument or procedure that helps the adult leader to understand children is an evaluation technique . Any instrument or procedure that helps children to understand themselves better is likewise an evaluation technique . The list discussed here has been delimited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to evaluate the jobs being done in developing democratic human relations . The techniques to be considered are : Observation School records Conferences and interviews Diaries and autobiographies Interest finders Self-appraisals The wishing well The sociometric test The sociodrama Observation Observation is probably more frequently employed by the adult leader than any other evaluating technique . Judgments are continually being made regarding children 's behavior . Learning to observe accurately is a first requirement of those who use this technique . A second one is to bring to the observation of any child 's behavior all that may be learned about him and the situation in which he is responding . A third requirement is scrupulous care to separate what is observed from opinions about what the behavior means . Whether the behavior is described only in the adult 's mind or is described as an anecdotal record , the distinction between what occurred and interpretation of what occurred should be kept clear . A great deal of observation is incidental , especially when beginning to work with a group of children . The technique is used to provide clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toward others . As the adult comes to know more about the children , continuously collects information about them from many sources , observation is directed toward finding out some particular thing about a child or the group . For example , a  | teacher suspects from previous observation and from other sources that a child grows angry when he can not have his own way because he has learned this behavior brings results ; he puts on an act . Observation then becomes focused on finding out how the child behaves when the anger is disregarded by the other children . Of course , judgments made through observation must be checked against findings from other evaluating procedures and verified through repeated observation . What is learned about a child through observation should be put to use along with other findings . The following story illustrates how one teacher put the findings to use . Pete lost his arm in an accident when about the age of four . He was in the fourth grade when he came to a certain elementary school . During the physical education period he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get him into activity . His class was just about to start soccer . The teacher took Pete aside one day and told him that this was a game in which the feet were used and in which the hands were of comparatively little value . Pete looked interested . She got out a ball and showed him how the feet were used in dribbling . She encouraged him to try it and he shyly and awkwardly made the attempt . Every day she spent some time with him during free play . When the group started to play soccer , Pete was already skilled in the use of his feet . There was no other player who could knee the ball as well as Pete . He was elected captain of the team . When the soccer season was over and the class was going into lead-up games for basketball , Pete had much more courage . He found that he could catch a ball using a knee and his one arm . He was a happy boy , no longer to be found alone in a corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a child who is being observed are the school records . Health examination findings , past successes and failures in school work , home background are types of information provided . The child 's pattern of growth and development since he entered the school may be studied from these records with consequent increase of insight into why he behaves as he does . The use of cumulative records is a technique familiar to all teachers , although it can not be said that all teachers make full use of these sources of information .  | Conferences and Interviews Conferences and interviews are occasions , usually prearranged , for talking over the needs and problems of an individual child in order to see possible solutions . The following kinds may be identified : Child-adult leader Parent-adult leader Child-parent-adult leader Child-psychiatrist , psychologist , doctor , dentist or school nurse **25;1962;TOOLONG person **25;1989;TOOLONG person-adult leader . In interviews with children it is well to use an indirect approach to the problem of concern , putting the child at ease and establishing rapport by talking about some activity in which he is interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing their inner thoughts and motives . To secure reliable information and help the child requires tact based on sympathetic understanding . Criticism and censure should be avoided . Whatever the child says should be treated seriously and should be accepted . What is said may not be what the adult desires the child to say . If the interview is in a friendly climate it will be the child 's own views of the problem and as such tells the adult the starting point for moving toward solving the problem . When conferences with other adults are held , with teachers or professional persons , personal reactions to individual children should be kept to a minimum . A student teacher was asked by her supervisor , " How are the bad boys getting along ? " In surprise the student replied , " Which ones do you mean ? I did not know that there were any . " Conferences among adults should be more than " gab fests . " They should be terminated by decisions regarding next steps to be taken to help the child and assignment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child as a guide . Teachers in the elementary school are urged to visit the homes of their pupils and many of them follow the recommendation . Sometimes these visits are not satisfactory to the teachers or to the parents . The success of the visit is mainly the responsibility of the  | teacher . A visit to any home requires careful planning . The booklet , Sociometry in Group Relations , gives an excellent procedure and form for home interviews . ' Teachers who have not studied this technique will find useful suggestions in this booklet . Diaries and Autobiographies In helping a child to solve some types of problems it is often a good procedure to ask him to keep a diary over a period of time in which he writes down what he does about the problem each day . This procedure is suited to such problems as eating a nourishing breakfast , cleaning up after play or refraining from teasing younger children . Sometimes a child may be asked to write a description of an incident in which his behavior got him into trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave evidence of being disturbed . Such descriptions often reveal the child 's view of the situation and his evaluation of his behavior . The adult is thus enabled to help him to see what he needs to do about it . Interest Finders The use of various types of instruments to find out about the interests of children is , like using school records , a familiar technique . A check list may be devised , giving the children opportunity to express their preferences by numbering the activities listed in the order of their choices . " Like or most want to do , " " Dislike , " " Indifferent , " " Do n't know " may be used to determine interest when the children write in under the headings their selections from a list of activities provided them . The information obtained , when tabulated , may be used with a group of children to assist them in planning their activities . It has direct usage in helping each child decide what he wants to do . Self-Appraisals Children evaluate their own behavior and that of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adult footnote'Jennings , Helen H. Sociometry in Group Relations . Washington , D. C. : American Council on Education , 1948 , p. 37-42.  | leaders may help them to do this in very strategic ways as the following example illustrates . John was twelve years old and was in the sixth grade . He was well liked by the boys in his peer group and was highly skilled in games and sports . Shortly after the fall term started the teacher of physical education noticed that John asked to be excused on the days that dancing was being scheduled . This aroused her interest and she began to observe John more closely in other coeducational activities of the program . After his team lost a volleyball game he was heard making the remark , " The girls spoil our team . " In the progress of a game it was quite usual to hear him say , " She just stands there . " In choosing committees or in electing leaders the teacher noticed that he never chose , nominated , or voted for a girl . When girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice-looking boy ) they were completely ignored or left standing there with their remark or question unheeded . Other teachers in the school said that they had not seen him participating in any activities with girls but it had not occurred to them that it was unusual . The physical education teacher found out from the mother that John had a younger sister ( nine years old ) who took dancing lessons at a private studio . When company visited the home Jane was always called upon to perform . John continually taunted and mocked Jane in what he called her " sissy dancing . " John 's problem was becoming very clear to the teacher and her next step was to help John understand it also . One day the opportunity to talk to John presented itself . The following conversation took place : Teacher : You played a very good game today , John . Is basketball one of your favorite activities ? John : Yes , I like it but I 'm also crazy about baseball and touch football . Teacher : What activity do you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly with girls . Teacher : That surprises me because usually good sports people are good dancers . John : Well , it 's sissy stuff and besides , I do n't like girls . Teacher : Did anyone ever tease you about a girl , John ? John : Sure they did and just because I showed a new girl where the library was . Teacher : Well , we 've all been teased at some time or other but usually it 's just in fun . Most boys forget it as soon n as they see that it does n't bother you .  | John : Well , anyway , girls ca n't play games . Teacher : That is one reason I wanted to talk to you , John . I need your help . I want to get three or four of the boys to help coach some of the girls in throwing and catching a baseball . Will you help us out ? John : Girls have butter fingers . How can you expect them to catch ? Teacher : Some girls are very good players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them play a better game . John : Well , what will I have to do ? The teacher provided time for three boys , including John , to work on lead-up games with some of the girls . She observed John closely and soon found registered disgust change into something like pride at the progress the girls were making . " Gee ! Mary can sure sling that ball , " he was heard exclaiming to other boys . The teacher 's next step was to invite a man instructor who taught folk and square dancing in a nearby high school to come to an after-school party for the sixth grade . A demonstrating group of high-school students came with him and one of the boys was the captain of the football team . John was n't going to attend the party at first but other boys teased him and his curiosity got the better of him . The high-school students showed some good vigorous dances that were simple enough for sixth-graders to perform . The fact that a man instructor was teaching dancing was a surprise to many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end all of the students were invited to participate . John edged to the door but not before he was pulled by Mary ( the girl he coached ) into a set . He was so bewildered that he made no move to leave the set for fear of being teased by the other boys . Although embarrassed and awkward at first he soon found that others were completely engrossed in the fun and the activity . He found himself laughing and not minding any more when he turned in the wrong direction . The physical education teacher talked again to John and was encouraged with his casual remark , " Girls are n't so bad and neither is dancing . " He was seen asking help in dancing from some of the girls just as he had given help in coaching baseball . Instead of being pulled out to dance by a girl he now asked different girls to be his partner . He began to talk about dancing at home . He told his father that someday he was going to do it just as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made through discus-  | sions centered in how the group carried out a plan . Another technique , involving more time but sometimes very useful , is to construct an appraisal form for each child to evaluate his part in the undertaking , then to compile the responses to get a picture of the group 's evaluation of itself as a whole . If the children share in constructing the form and have responsibility for making the tabulation the procedures have increased value . Rating scales , questionnaires or descriptive statements may be used in this connection . The Wishing Well A Wishing Well Test may be secured from The Ohio State University or an adult leader may construct one for use with a particular group . This instrument is designed to discover what children need and want . Eight basic needs are represented in the twenty wishes making up the Ohio State University wishing well . The needs are : The need for belonging The need for achievement The need for economic security The need to be free from fears and aggression The need for love and affection The need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation The need for a world outlook The boys and girls are asked to place an " X " before every statement which expresses something for which they wish . They are told not to write names on the papers . If there is some valid reason for wishing to know how individuals respond the teacher may code the papers . The items on the test are arranged in groupings of eight , each corresponding to one of the needs listed above . Such wishes as the following are included : I wish my class in school really wanted me there . I wish a few children would want me as their very best friend . I wish others thought my work was improving . I wish my parents paid more attention to me . The Sociometric Test This test provides a technique for understanding natural groupings in a class and for seeing an individual 's associations in the  | group pattern . The students are asked to express first , second , and third choices of other individuals with whom they would like to be associated in a particular situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee or in a play group . When the choices for an actual situation are diagrammed the result is a sociogram . Groupings may change even in the same situation depending on the time when the choices are made . It is not a test in the usual sense of the word . In some cases rejections of those not desired in a particular situation are asked for , but this technique involves great understanding and tact on the part of the teacher . The adult leader may find the sociogram useful in obtaining improved play group situations , for team work , committee work , squad work , or dance composition . It will also be of assistance in knowing and helping the children who are rejected at certain times by the members of the group . Putting this knowledge to work , he regroups on the basis of choices made , then observes to see whether the new groupings give more children a sense of belonging . ' The Sociodra na The sociodrama is a technique in which children are provided opportunities , through role playing , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A related technique is the psychodrama , used mostly by psychologists . In the psychodrama the emphasis is on the personal or private life of the individual ; in the sociodrama the emphasis is on the problem of concern to the group . Teachers and recreation leaders are rarely encouraged to use the psychodrama , since its unskilful use may do great harm to disturbed children . The sociodrama , however , is being used with increasing value as teachers gain skill in the technique . The situation or problem chosen for exploration in a sociodrama must truly represent group concern and desire to explore . Spontaneity is the keynote of success in role playing , success estimated by the insight gained into the causes of difficulty or into possible solutions . Children may volunteer or be assigned the roles to be played , but in either case , for best results they should want to play footnote a Sec Chapter 16 for a detailed discussion of sociometric techniques . See also Staff of the Physical Education Department , University of California , Los Angeles . Group Process in Physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chapter 7.  | the roles and they should be concerned about the problem under consideration . Many situations arise in health education , physical education and recreation which can be effectively explored through the sociodrama . Some examples are situations in which the children cease to have fun ; situations in which certain types of behavior on the part of one or two irritate the others ; situations in which the group becomes confused and does not see clearly what it needs to do to make progress . Through the sociodrama the adult leader may find out a great deal about the interactions among children in a group and gain insight into the behavior problems of individual children . He often obtains help , also , in improving the social climate . This is possible with a better understanding of the relations developing and changing within the group . ' In ending this survey of some of the many techniques for evaluating , it may be fruitful to re-emphasize that children 's problems in human relations are not discovered by the use of any one technique alone . Observation needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an interest questionnaire needs to be checked against his observed behavior . The situations in which the child is responding need to be studied . Attitudes , such as those in regard to accepting differences , may be expressed in positive or negative behavior , according to the emotional drives aroused in different situations . A home visit combined with the results of a health examination and a sociogram may entirely alter a judgment arrived at through observation . Teachers and leaders must bring to the guidance of children in the area of human relations all that they can discover about each child . Then comes the process of using the information to help each child and the group continuously to evaluate progress being made in working with others , in getting along with others , in belonging to the group , in all the other aspects of behavior revealing a growing understanding of democratic human relations . footnote 4 See Chapter 16 for a detailed discussion of the sociodrama.  | Bibliography ADAMS , THOMAS R.

Each youth sustains within his breast A vague and infinite unrest . He goes about in still alarm , With shrouded future at his arm , With longing that can find no tongue . I see him thus , for I am young . - BY AN OKLAHOMA HIGH SCHOOL BOY . Nellie B. Sergent 's Younger Poets : An Anthology of American Secondary School Verse .  | The Adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in education because it is a focal point in human development . It is a period of physical and emotional maturing through which youth must pass successfully before they can be considered adult in every sense of the word . During this developmental period , youth break away from their infantile moorings and face a world of reality in which they must learn to make a place for themselves . They seek less dependence on home and parents , search for greater personal freedom of expression , put aside their childish emotional attachments and set out to conquer a world of their own . Naturally , the growing dignity that comes with self-recognition of individuality makes adolescents less amenable to external authority or direct suggestion . In speaking of the adolescent 's journey toward normal emancipation , the late G. Stanley Hall pointed out that children are not small adults and that one can not hasten the development of the tadpole into a frog by cutting off its tail . Each developmental period in childhood and youth , although not too clearly defined , has a purpose in which certain developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and affection should transfer gradually and imperceptibly from the self and parents to peer friends and the common interests of the great world outside the home . As the process of maturing continues , attitudes toward life and human relations cease to be childish ; adolescents now want to think for themselves , to make their own decisions and to shoulder responsibility . The adolescent seeks diligently for opportunities of self-discovery and to gain some insight into his respective capacities to do some  | one thing well ? something that is really worthwhile , something of his own choosing . Furthermore , the adolescent desires social success . He wants to do something really significant in the social groups of which he is a member . Although he rejects adult standards and controls , he fears ridicule and loss of popularity and is very dependent upon conformity with his peer groups . In such groups , the adolescent learns to understand and to accept others and how to manage his friendships and other human relations . Oversensitive and self-conscious as a result of increasing size , skin eruptions , body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new meanings and new values by which he may define his place in relation to other human beings . In our complex culture , adolescents face many inevitable conflicts . There is the old and the new ; the ancient good of the old testament and the newer and higher good stressed by later authorities . There are the traditions and beliefs of fathers and grandfathers and the newer truths of modern science . There is the effort to inculcate a wise choice of health practices and there are the questionable " ads " extolling the practices of athletes and of " people of distinction . " Principles of Adolescent Growth In the days of G. Stanley Hall we were taught that adolescence is a period of " storm and stress . " As the difficulties of youth multiplied in our complex industrial society and these were recorded in the cumulative records of our schools and in juvenile courts , theorists were more than ever convinced that " storm and stress " inevitably accompanied adolescence and that it was chiefly biological in origin . Study and comparison of adolescents in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Concepts and principles developed by research in psychology and social anthropology suggest that the problems and conflicts of adolescents in our society , though they have a biological base , arc unnecessarily stressful because of the social factors blocking the road to adulthood .  | A Biosocial Process The term biosocial implies that something is biological and at the same time social . The adolescent as a biological organism operates in a cultural setting . He responds to other personalities as fully as he responds to food . The hunger cycle belongs to sociology as well as to biology . Murphy reminds us that " turning red is a biological event which may be due to a circulatory disturbance ; turning red at an embarrassing remark is a biosocial event . " 1 Constant interaction of organic and environmental forces makes our social world . The social order , in turn , molds personality . Neither culture nor the responses of human beings to it can change greatly without one modifying the other . The developmental growth of the adolescent is a biosocial phenomenon ; it , like personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and problems of American adolescents are , to a great extent , due not to their being adolescents but to their being adolescents in America . Situations act upon the individual , and his personality is an expression of the situation in which he is functioning . For example , Hartshorne and May found in their studies of deceit that no factor was more important in relation to honesty or deceit than the behavior of the group of which the student was a member . ' The morals and ideals of his peer group are always strong determinants of the adolescent 's behavior . What the adolescent strives for and how his efforts are expressed are determined by the culture patterns which surround him . He wants to " grow up , " to be adult , but we make it very difficult . In our culture , the adolescent in an adult world pays a fairly high emotional price for being socialized . The hampering restrictions of an adult culture , which limit opportunity for the adolescent to use his budding capacities and to be accorded a status more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The strong tendency of adolescents to set up their own clubs , sororities and fraternities gives evidence of their efforts to fill the roles we often deny them in our culture . footnote Murphy , Gardner . Personality ? A Biosocial Approach to Origins and Structure . New York : Harper and Brothers , 1947 , p. 139 . Ilartshorne , Hugh and May , Mark A. Studies in Deceit . New York : Macmillan Co. , 1928.  | Nonfunctional high-school curriculums , the lack of opportunity for work experience and for finding a job after graduation , the conflicts between standards and philosophy prevalent in one decade contrasted with another , and therefore between parent and adolescent , the rapid changes in our physical environment and the resulting " cultural lag , " are all cases in point and sources of adolescent conflict . Research studies based on adolescent interviews , problem check lists and similar devices suggest the sources of conflict . Among the problems listed are the following : 1 . Lack of practical work experience . 2 . Uncertainty of a job after graduation. 3 . Ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Parents too strict about permitting attendance at evening affairs and in use of the family car . 5 . The absence of " dates " ; the behavior on " dates " and the degree that they should physically express their feelings . 6 . The failure of parents to discuss sex questions . 7 . The concern about making the world a " better place in which to live . " 8 . Inadequate facilities for wholesome recreation and play . The cultural inconsistencies youth face are the causes of many conflicts . We as adults help to create the conflicts by encouraging in youth high levels of aspiration , then failing to make available the resources through which the aspirations might be attained . This is aptly described by Murphy and Newcomb when they picture our culture as one which , in turn , asks the young person " to be the center of attention , to get out of the way , to accept absolute authority , to show his independence of authority , to sacrifice himself for the larger group , to be self-sustaining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The adolescent , as an organism trying to make adjustments , uses what is biologically relevant or of value in the environment to relieve tension and maintain internal equilibrium . If the environment provides goal resources in the form of activities , space , facilities , equipment and trained sympathetic leadership , basic drives and tensions will be resolved by integration into wholesome situations . footnote 8 Murphy , Gardner ; Murphy , Lois Barclay ; and Newcomb , Theodore . Experimental Social Psychology . Revised edition . New York : Harper and Brothers , 1937 , p. 327.  | Acceptable social behavior should result . Conversely , if the environment is " delinquent " and devoid of socially approved goal resources , the organism seizes upon whatever resources are available . In the search for excitement and adventure , being chased by the " cops " for tampering with the gum-vending machine might take the place of " Run , my good sheep , run ! " It is a fact that delinquents appear for the most part in the " delinquency areas " where there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tend to indicate a similar relationship to the cultural setting . A Unified Organism Does the Growing Personality evolves as a whole around a central plan or goal and is not a summation of traits . The synthesis of values , purposes and desires with respect to a goal or life plan is an important factor and determinant of personality . On the playing fields we speak of physical growth , emotional development , absence or presence of dynamic drive , sociability and other components of personality , but the really important factor is the dynamic organization within the individual , the interrelationships among these components . Considering any one item , out of its relationship to others , at its face value is a questionable practice , for these relationships are always evolving and changing . Any one aspect of development in isolation from other aspects brings little understanding of either the part or the whole . All aspects are interrelated in the total developing personality . This principle of growth is the source of the conviction that no matter what the field of education , there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory shifting the center of attention from subjectmatter to the needs , interests and goals of the child or youth being educated . Even though growth is a unified process , different aspects of growth show variations in rate . Emotional growth may lag behind physical . Physical maturing may be slower than intellectual growth . Different parts of the body grow at different rates and change at different periods . During childhood , collars and shoes are constantly becoming too small but caps wear out ; in adolescence shoes wear out but trousers and skirts become too short . Personality is a " whole " and evolves as such . Yet it must be seen as being made  | up at any given time of parts that have not developed at the same rate . We must expect different aspects of development to show differences in stages of maturity . Just because an adolescent boy is six feet tall does not mean he is sexually mature or emotionally adult . Each Boy 's and Girl 's Growth is Different In any group of adolescents of the same chronological age we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group we likewise find an individual growth pattern . The processes of **32;2016;TOOLONG growth are unique in each adolescent . The term " average " never refers to any one individual . Social values of the group and the importance and meaning that the group in any given culture attaches to marked deviation from the average or central tendency in height , weight , adipose tissue , or ways of thinking and behaving , often give the adolescent a warped image of himself . One of our educational functions , therefore , is to aid him in developing scientific understandings about individual differences . He must be helped to see that to be different is not to be abnormal or either superior or inferior . Because of their insecurities adolescents are afraid to be different . It is often difficult or impossible for them to accept others who differ from them . With a secure place in their age group and the emerging of an adult self , it becomes possible for them to " be themselves " and at the same time to grant to others diversity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the democratic way of life . Maturity Is the Goal Growth is thought of as progress toward maturity . Maturity may be seen as the type of behavior appropriate to the chronological age of the individual . The two-year-old who still crawls rather than walks is immature in this particular respect . The adolescent who feels that he can never make a move without first asking " mama " is still dependent and emotionally and socially immature . Aspects of maturity , like those of personality , are relatively easy to detect , . but it is difficult to define maturity as a total concept . The chief  | criterion of maturity as it applies to human relations lies in the ability of the individual to exhibit sociocentricity , interest in others , rather than egocentricity , the focus of attention upon the self . Absorption in causes and goals unrelated to self-seeking and vanity is a favorable sign . The ability to be smilingly objective about himself , to weigh his personality assets and liabilities in comparison with what his classmates say of him , is a test of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some integrative factor best represented by a unifying philosophy of life , made up of intellectually formulated principles controlling thinking and actions , which represents the individual 's conception of his place in the scheme of things . An adolescent with long-range purposes and a plan to achieve them , plus the actual use of the goal resources available to start him " goalwise , " is showing progress toward maturity . Qualities of maturity are implied in certain behavior patterns which become aims of education in a democratic society , such as : 1 . Considering the rights of others . 2 . Cooperating with others . 3 . Discovering and accepting one 's own inadequacies and improving upon them if possible . 4 . Assuming responsibilities inherent in democratic freedom . 5 . Solving problems by thinking them through rather than resorting to emotional solutions or escapes . 6 . Accepting individual differences without assignment of superiority or inferiority . Arrested development may occur at any stage in the life of the individual . Many adolescents live the emotional lives of children , and many adults live the emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional and social maturity more closely involved in human relations may be suggested in terms of behavior as shown in the chart on the following page . Defining a New Self The self or ego usually refers to the individual as he is known and understood by himself . To the young child , the self is localized as the physical body and the social controls are something external to him . Gradually and in time the self is referred inward and he learns  | figure  | that he is a " person " able to exert some controls over people and events . He learns what people are in contrast to things . Since the self becomes a source of satisfaction and dissatisfaction , self-criticism becomes possible . The self-image becomes a value , judged by and formulated largely by values expressed in the world about the child . His successes and disappointments , his conflicts , desires , hopes and ideals begin to shape his personality . In zero weather the child puts on additional clothing to protect his body . Similarly , he employs many protective devices such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalizations in order to guard his inner picture of the self . Educationally , our task is to provide goal resources conducive to the achievement of wholesome personal values and self-realization in harmony with the broader social goals of democracy as a whole . Self-realization for the adolescent means the formulation of a plan which will produce the wished-for self . Leaving Childhood Behind In the various poorly-defined stages or periods of emotional growth , the individual 's center of affection and interest shifts gradually and imperceptibly . The picture of the self is strongly influenced by the early and vague conceptions of those with whom the child is closely identified . In the immediate family , the growing child assimilates the feelings of those about him . Later , in other primary or face-to-face play groups , the picture and value of the self grow . Finally , the secondary group , including the world of television , radio , movies , political organizations , clubs , fraternities and causes which make deep impressions on the adolescent , storm and attack his value systems as he becomes aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The adolescent 's experience of his own developing self , emerging from the interaction of a growing , changing organism with its environment , is often perplexing . The fact that the individual is identified with his group and accepts its structured pattern of values gives him a picture of himself which is largely defined by the values prescribed by his group . The acceptance of himself as a person  | depends , to a large extent , upon how others accept his personal variations , his physique , his ideas , his behavior traits and various ways in which he may differ from the expectations of the group . Physical Development Rapid and uneven growth is characteristic of adolescence . The girl by 16 years and the boy by 18 years are attaining very nearly mature height and weight and maximum muscular coordination . For girls , the maximum increase in the rate of growth occurs about six months before the menarche and increments of growth practically cease at two and one-half years after the menarche . Data for boys show similar results when the onset of pubescence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year behind the girl shows itself in factors related to physiological maturity . Physical growth , social interests and value systems in both sexes appear related to and dependent , to a certain extent , upon the instigation of hormones accompanying sexual maturation . Since in any given high-school grade there are apt to be some individuals in the beginning and some in the end of the puberal growth cycle , and since much doubt , worry and concern evolve around the individual 's pattern of growth in relation to classmates , friendly guidance and understanding with respect to youth and physical development are required of parents and teachers . Growth anxieties often appear in adolescence as a result of physical maturation coupled with social pressures and the cultural importance unduly attached to temporary physical variations . In girls , menstruation , the development of the breasts , the broadening hips , a growth spurt which often makes them tower over the boys in their classes , their interest in boys and dancing and the disinterest of the boys in them all lead to the conclusion that the boys do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by a new " hair do , " lipstick and other subtle techniques . Since in any given age group there are many different stages of physiological change represented , there is much worry about being " normal " when comparisons are made . The girl whose breasts have not begun to develop and the boy who has not yet experienced his w growth spurt become much concerned when others of her or his age  | group have given evidence of already achieving these stages of physical maturity . The patterns in body type , skill , skin , dress and the like which his peers accept as appropriate determine the degree of individual frustration of the adolescent 's self-ideals and his emotional reactions to new situations . Temporary body disproportions may cause temporary anxiety , and may even be the source of persisting deep-seated emotional disturbance . Ignorance and lack of understanding may lead to serious misconceptions of growth changes and their resultant effects upon the pattern of the self-concept . Perceptions of the physical self as a male or female and the meanings attached to these perceptions before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adolescent is self-depreciating , unduly humble , feels inferior or is confident and self-assertive will depend upon his actual or imaginary experiences in the past . Like other concepts , the self-concept is capable of change and it is the function of education to change it in the directions compatible with wholesome personality development . Since , in adolescence , youth observe the differentiation of personalities as female and male , the attitudes of one sex toward the other , as well as the acceptance of one 's own sex , are strongly influenced . The implications for coeducation for satisfactory heterosexual development and the development of understanding in human relations are here evident . Changing Relations with Adults As the adolescent recognizes himself as a unique personality with distinctive characteristics , he drops the " nest habits " of the young child and the ready acceptance of the judgment of father or mother . Struggle toward autonomy and self-determination , with tendencies toward achieving , dominating and mastering the environment are characteristic of the normal development of the human being . Life and the process of growing up involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new means and methods of achieving autonomy . The over-aggressive and the rebellious adolescent at school is sometimes the child of the overly strict and authoritarian parents .  | Finding no place to assert his independence at home he uses the school as a place for asserting the independence denied him in the family . When conformity and unquestioning obedience are asked , the adolescent is blocked in his struggle to grow up and rebellion and defiance , delinquency and anti-social behavior are apt to appear in his relations with others . At the other extreme , his responses may take the form of fear of all assertiveness , surrender of personal autonomy , defeatism , feelings of guilt , insecurity and neurotic illness . Rebellion and argument are unpleasant symptoms of the blocking of adolescent strivings to escape from childhood dependence , but both are normal and hopeful signs . By protesting parental decrees , by arguing and by questioning authority , the adolescent announces that he is growing up , does not want to remain dependent , but desires to think for himself and stand on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let others live his life for him , his mental , emotional and social development will be arrested ; he is prevented from moving in the direction of normal independence and then on to interdependence in his relations with others . There are ways for adults to meet the adolescent 's need for autonomy and minimize expressions of rebellion and frustration . An allowance , a chance to earn , to budget and select one 's clothes , being included in family and school planning are modified and socially acceptable expressions of autonomy . Specialists in psychodrama speak of " restructuring " the situation , giving the adolescent a chance to act out a part , to liberate himself in arranged situations which permit him to be himself and to grow . The physical educator and recreational leader consciously using such techniques on the playground and in the gymnasium may also provide situations in which the adolescent may fulfil his desire to grow up . Much of the reluctance of adults to meet the adolescent 's demand for independence is created by the ambivalent behavior of the boy or girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time , shy and retiring at another . One day the adolescent demands the rights and privileges of an adult ; the next day he asks mother what tie he should wear , what time he should get up , whether , or not he should go out for track . The next evening the same adoles-  | cent may claim the right to decide for himself where he shall spend the evening , with whom he will go out and at what time he expects to return . Another source of the reluctance is the inability of some adults , parents particularly , to give up the power and control they have exercised hitherto over the child 's comings and goings . Their need to dominate causes them to fail to meet the adolescent 's need to get free , to learn to decide for himself , to take control of his own life . The adjustments of parents to their adolescent sons ' and daughters ' changing relations to them are not nearly so difficult if the adults have always encouraged their children to make decisions with understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in other words , treated them as persons who must learn to take responsibility for themselves and for others as well . Even so , there are adjustments to be made . More than this , there are steps to be taken in helping adolescents to overcome social blocks to adulthood , steps that will aid them to become economically independent and able to assume responsibilities of establishing homes of their own . Creating a Self-Image . The kind of person the adolescent idealizes and accepts as a model or ideal gives some indication of what he as a self is trying to become , how the world looks to him and what he is trying to achieve in his struggle to fill the role of an adult . Adolescence finds the girl in close identification with her mother , the boy with the father . Then comes the necessity to reject the parent in the struggle to establish an independent self . Other persons are selected as models for the personality the adolescent seeks for himself . He prefers persons he knows such as the athletic coach , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie stars , athletes , scientists or characters in novels . The selection may cause important changes in his personality as he strives to be like the ideal . Emulation may be so inclusive as to affect dress , speech , choice of profession , personal habits , attitudes toward others . The need of adolescents for a model , a hero or heroine to emulate , makes clear how important it is to them for developing democratic human relat ions that the adults they associate with , who might be these models , be democratic and mature persons .  | Entering a Peer Culture The adolescent 's experiences in his own age groups as he is socialized by the different value systems operating in his peer group at various stages of development are powerful preparatory factors in readying him for an adult world . Research by Tryon4 indicates how the adolescent group 's behavior , its objectives , its standards of values , its rules of behavior and methods of securing conformity , its relation to the adult society , all undergo change as development progresses from late childhood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable or sought after , represent way stations on the march toward that intangible goal of adult maturity . Values , in Tryon 's study , were represented by those characteristics which pubescents and adolescents considered desirable in each other . For example , seventh-grade boys admired skill in games , daring , ingenuity in leading and directing games , boisterousness and rough and ready appearance . As ninth graders , they still admired skill , courage , strength and aggressiveness almost as much , but personal untidiness had become unpopular . Boisterousness and seeking the center of the stage were looked upon as " childish . " Social ease and personableness began to share honors with strength and skill and aggressiveness . At the twelfth grade , the outstanding athlete needs little else to retain his position . Brains minus social skills are not admired , but a socially poised or mature boy with a good academic record is popular . Being honest and capable in what one undertakes is a mark of acceptability . The seventh-grade girls who are demure , prim , ladylike , pretty , friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buoyant . " Tom-boys , " daring and jocular , are accepted but not especially admired . The ninth-grade girls who are good sports and attractive to boys are very acceptable and the girls who were most admired as seventh graders for being ladylike may not now be the group 's ideal of social attractiveness . The socially active girl with many friends , popular in large groups , is now admired . As twelfth graders , the girl who is well groomed and has achieved footnote ' , National Society for the Studv of Education . Adolescence . Forty-Third Yearbook , Part I. Chicago : University of Chicago Press , 1941. p. 217-39.  | fully her feminine role is the model . Sophistication and glamour , plus attractiveness to boys , plus poise , polish , and consideration for others , place the girl high in social acceptance . Belonging to a special clique having prestige and being popular with a desirable boy bring her reflected prestige and admiration . The Herd Period . Despite the fact that standards of qualities which make for acceptance vary from culture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , group approval is the most powerful influence in adolescent behavior . Strong pressure to conform to the value system of the upper group is evident , side by side with the desire to be independent of adult standards and controls . This trend , in contrast with autonomy , has been called " homonomy " by Angyal5 and is based on the experience of being a part of meaningful groups such as family , social group and a meaningful world order . The tendency to conform , to unite with and participate in and fit into such groups is a powerful motivating force in human relations . The school and neighborhood , as social laboratories for youth , find them learning the ways of adult behavior , organizing their own athletics and social activities , selecting their own leaders , dancing , enjoying " bull sessions , " playing social games . By such means do adolescents set up a peer world of their own which they may control and in which they assume the roles and independence denied them in the world of adults . Childish loyalty is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young child and the immature youth are loyal to those individuals and groups which satisfy their immediate needs and gradually give them a feeling of individuality and security . Individuals and groups , in this sense , are used as instruments in establishing independence . At this stage the attitude is still quite egocentric . The social status and the confidence in one 's own power and importance which one seeks , can be given only by others . The resultant good is a social good because it represents valuation by members of a group . In this sense people in groups are used as tools and invoke loyalty only as they may be used as such . footnote 5 Angyal , Andras . Foundations for a Science of Personality . New York : The Commonwealth Fund , 1941 , p. 172.  | The growing active loyalty of maturity begins to make its appearance in adolescence . At this stage , other people are . recognized as values in themselves . The other person or group , or an ideal for which the group stands , may have greater motivating power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the adolescent regards as greater than his individual self is a big step in human relations . Loyalty to the family , the little play group , the team , the school , the state , the nation and finally to humanity , are crude examples of gradation in social attitudes . The concrete ideal of the hero or model gives way to abstract ideals or principles . The adolescent no longer sees himself in the part of another . He has found himself . He has learned to live with others and still retain his personal integrity . To get along with others , be able to adjust to them , and at the same time be unafraid to be a unique personality , indicate moving out of the " herd period " and of having successfully achieved one of the developmental tasks of adolescence . Relations with Own Sex . Early adolescence is the period of intense friendships . In earlier years , through experience in the primary or face-to-face groups , boys and girls have played different roles in different groups . They have been leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group reaction and their respective status roles , they have come to create a self-image which leads to feelings of various degrees of inferiority and degrees of self-acceptance or self-rejection . Strong friendships among adolescents reflect some desire to choose as friends those who are like themselves and of the same sex . Most psychologists would consider this " buddy " and " pal " stage a normal period through which adolescents pass in our culture , and consider it a transient phase in the development of the child 's love growth . The degree of harmfulness lies in the intensity of the feeling of possession which one person has toward the other . It has been suggested that " The meaning of intense love-friendships and crushes for adolescents is not yet entirely clear ; they may reflect both the projection of the child 's needs for affection and the sublimation of growing emotions that in another culture might have more immediate sex expression .

Boy-Girl Relations . The results of anonymous opinion polls and problem checklists , when the respondents are adolescents , show how strong is the desire to " get along with others " ; over half of all adolescents " wish they were more popular , " " want to make new friends , " " want people to like them more . " Each sex is concerned about " not having dates . " Girls are concerned about " not having boy friends " ; boys are concerned about " not having girl friends . " Boys are bashful about asking girls for dates . Both sexes are concerned about how far they should go in love relations , about " going steady , " whether they must " pet " to be popular .

In our culture , in practically all instances , young people select their own marriage partners . The large numbers of marriages which fail suggest that education for family life has not been adequate . Delayed marriage , due to the heavy economic responsibilities of marriage , the ideal of " rugged individualism , " long periods of courtship , the automobile , the " drive-in " theater , the romantic love idealized in our movies and soap operas , and general lack of friendly and understanding supervision place unduly heavy responsibilities of control on the sexually mature adolescent . The degree of failure in marriage among Americans seems to indicate that a rather immature system of values frequently surrounds the marriage relationship . We do not seem to understand what is involved in building social awareness and mutual respect for a relationship which should enhance the personalities of each partner .

Often special help is needed which the school should attempt to supply genetically , not only in units related to education for family life , but in the way youth live in the school as reflected by its over-all educational purposes for meeting the needs of life in America . Paths to Adulthood The protracted period of infancy in the human gives a longer period of role playing . Out of this role playing there gradually develops the integrated self of self-consciousness . The different roles a youth takes in an organized game have a relationship to one another and each player must know something about the role of the others in the scheme of things . Were this not so , it would never be possible for a team or other cooperative group to become an integrated social group ? one whose members are bound together by the integration of numerous individual abilities searching for achievement of common goals and purposes . Mead mentions the importance for youth to develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team ? a " generalized other " ? and in terms of which he sees and defines his own place in the group . ' In a highly-organized team game such as the activities of life the same process of development of the self is involved . Team work is a term we apply to many life situations in which a self is developed and expressed in cooperative enterprise . Social sensitivity and social awareness are learned gradually in a social structure in which these qualities of human relations are considered social virtues . As the social setting provides conditions and stimuli for cooperative undertakings , youth have opportunity to assume the attitudes of groups and communities and see their own responsible attitudes in their social relations . As developmental social tasks of greater complexity are gradually faced by boys and girls , a broader base of social awareness and social feeling is built . Gradually they develop concepts of their relations to the whole of human striving and a clearer picture of their respective parts in the melody of common social purposes .

Self-Understanding . As indicated earlier in this chapter , there are changing patterns , not only of physical growth , but also in the conceptions of the self . The self-concept created in early childhood is worked over and changed in numerous ways ; self-regarding attitudes and social attitudes toward others are in a state of flux and become strong factors in the motivation of behavior . This behavior as exhibited in school and society is understandable to the student , parent or teacher only as the source becomes known . Plant suggests that we see the personality as a river . . . " and at any point its currents , its debris , its power are known only as one understands the sources from which these spring . " ' As the growing organism perceives , thinks about , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the self-concept results . It is no wonder that the adolescent feels queer , new and different . As the adolescent notes changes in anatomical patterns and stature in himself and others ? as he notes the disproportion , the awkwardness , the new signs of power , his new perceptions change greatly the meaning pattern of the self-concept and what he himself means to himself . An important educational function for parents and teachers is to clarify for adolescent boys and girls the wellsprings of their actions , and to indicate that sometimes faulty interpretation of their perceptions of themselves accounts for peculiarities in social behavior and for their unhappiness . Parents and teachers must understand the structure of selfhood and build wholesome self-concepts . This is important at a period when changing meanings in the self-concepts , self-feelings or self-regarding attitudes are particularly subject to distortion as a result of the seemingly erratic course of physical development . It is important in a culture which is both demanding and inconsistent in what it values and what it rewards with social recognition . Economic Independence . Growing up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the ability to work . " Plant , James . Personality and tlrc Cultural Pattern . New York : Commonwealth Fund , 1937 , p. 8.  | Havighurst speaks of this developmental task as achieving assurance of economic independence in which the goal is " to feel able to make a living , if necessary . This is presumably a task of boys in our society , but it is of increasing importance to girls . " ' Heterosexual Adjustment . The developmental task of accepting boys as boys and girls as girls is not always as simple for the growing boy and girl as it sounds . As sex attraction becomes a dominant force in the maturing adolescent , a natural and normal development is away from predominant interests in groups of his own sex and toward the opposite sex . New feelings , interests and internal pressures have to be built into a new design for living . Into this design for boys , come girls ; for girls , come boys . Exalted desires , ideals of loyalty and devotion well up to prepare the adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the protective and nurturing feelings of parenthood . The social experimentation in choice of friends , in making tentative conclusions about what qualities one most wants in a friend or future mate of the opposite sex , is important for normal heterosexual adjustment . Possessiveness and jealousy are common outcomes of these adolescent heterosexual experiences . " Going steady " is a big issue at the high-school level , for young people do not realize that they are still finding out about people ? boys about girls and girls about boys . The design for each is still incomplete because it is based on incomplete knowledge of the people with whom each best gets along . Mutual regard , tenderness and devotion between sexes are built , tested and learned to a large extent in these adolescent years . Participation in Community Life . It is an old aphorism that " one learns to swim by swimming , to talk by talking , " yet we sometimes expect to teach citizenship by having students memorize social-science lessons . Being " mayor for a day " as the Hi-Y " takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in community life , but is a rather weak prescription for citizenship . Many research studies of observed adolescent behavior in America interpret responses as direct aggression against the hampering rc- footnote  | strictions imposed by our culture . Biologically adults , but treated sociologically as children , our young people are often robbed of their self-confidence and hindered in developing social responsibility ? retarded in their social development . Much of the adolescent behavior observable in American adults might be eliminated at the adolescent period if our high-school boys and girls could find expression in real community functions for leadership , initiative and independent planning of action . In contrast to many primitive cultures in which community education plays a major role in the education of youth , our culture is slow to recognize the ability of our youth to carry on adult duties . The result is frequent evidence of frustration , with either its accompanying aggression and cynicism or withdrawal , submission and discouragement . The little worlds which adolescents set up and in which they may " play " at being adults are important and necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real thing . During the war , many adolescents were wanted , given worthwhile tasks , recognized as valuable contributors to society and achieved responsibilities commensurate with their abilities . Educators could ease the paths to adulthood for boys and girls and advance our national social outlook and maturity level immeasurably if we ceased reminding our youth that they are " too young to know what they are talking about " and " too young for real responsibility . " A Value System . The pathway to a mature value system is determined by a number of factors . We value objects , conditions or experiences only as long as these yield satisfaction to us and no longer . Havighurst suggests six ways in which we form values . 1 . Through the satisfaction of physiological drives . We value food in relation to the satisfaction of the hunger drive . Children value climbing in relation to the satisfaction of the activity drive . 2 . Through satisfactory emotional experience . Certain forms , patterns of color , melodic patterns and rhythms are pleasant for some people , unpleasant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have learned . 3 . Through concrete punishment and reward . One values the act which brings money or a treat and if consistently so rewarded . However , " this method is apt to be ineffective in turning an initially unpleasant act into a pleasant one . "  | 4 . Through association of something with the love or approval of persons whose love and approval are desired . Game skills bring the approval of one 's age mates and therefore come to be valued . Dressing neatly and having well groomed hair is appreciated by the girls , therefore the boy of 15 comes to value these things . At nine , grooming holds little or no value for him . 5 . Through inculcation by someone in authority . " The Ten Commandments are handed down from the supernatural or fearsome authority , or the catechism may be impressed upon the child by the stern pastor who is a surrogate for God . " 6 . Through reasoning or reflective thinking . Analyses of social conditions and human behavior result in the seeing of relationships or possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , certain aesthetic principles are applied . Judgment is arrived at concerning its value . " Havighurst suggests that the fourth and sixth modes of value formation are most relevant to education at high-school and college levels . Close attachment or identification with those with whom students have close relations and who have prestige in their sight are powerful " value formers " for youth . A rough genetic sequence of these " value formers " is suggested by Havighurst as follows : 1 . Parents 2 . Teachers and parent-surrogates , such as club leaders and adult neighbors 3 . Successful age mates and persons just older than the individual 4 . Glamorous adults such as movie stars , soldiers , airplane pilots , athletes , outlaws 5 . Heroes read about , such as Abraham Lincoln , Florence Nightingale , Louis Pasteur 6 . Attractive and successful young adults within the adolescent 's range of observation . " The goal for adolescent and adult alike is a set of values , a philosophy in harmony with the best modern scientific knowledge of the nature of a Christian democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learning process . footnote 10 Havighurst , Robert J. , op. cit. , p. 56-5 ' n Ibid , p. 58.  | Philosophy ? a value system ? is a " rudder , " a determinant of human behavior and human relations . Self-confidence and sociability are alike the foundation stones of sound mental health and good human relations as well as a mark of a mature philosophy of life . The adolescent 's belief in regard to himself and his relations to his peers are the fundamental determinants of what he does , and both are strongly subject to educational influences . The Needs of Adolescence The adolescent is a biological animal in a cultural setting . As such , he is subject to two directional forces . As a biological animal he inclines unconsciously toward goals prescribed by his own internal constitution , such as activity , food and rest . As a purposeful member of a society , he inclines consciously toward goals representing social values which satisfy such motives as success , mastery , achievement , adventure , approval , recognition and love . Motivation toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value and prestige attached to them by the adolescent 's age mates . The adolescent 's success in his social relations , his success in solving problems of life , making adjustments and maintaining internal equilibrium will depend upon the success with which he meets his " needs " by finding socially acceptable channels for expression of the biological and social drives mentioned above . Schools meet the needs of adolescents when they provide the objects , conditions and experiences necessary for their satisfaction . Needs are always personal and inseparable , one influencing another . The trends of growing organisms toward autonomy or self-assertion on the one hand and toward sharing and merging into a social group on the other develop readiness to tension . The organism in its various functions is dependent for need satisfaction upon the resources of the environment . Needs , like purposes , are personal and integral with their goals or objects . In the development of human personality , it is exceedingly important that we , as teachers and leaders of youth , be concerned with the questions of how students attempt to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their egos , how they try to achieve superiority , excel , and gain security .  | The Concept of Need Needs are not abstractions , they are personalized . The goal , the purpose of the individual is integral with the need . The simplest definition of need is " the absence of something which if present would tend to give satisfaction . " A need is the immediate outcome of certain internal and external occurrences and is therefore basically related to culture . Needs vary from culture to culture and with individuals in terms of their respective levels of development . A need is evidence in behavior of certain basic drives and tensions operating within the organism . Needs are directional tensions of individuals . A need , then , in its implemental sense becomes any requisite to the normal wholesome functioning of an individual in a given culture . A need exists when the environmental factor , which is necessary to carry out a given function , is absent or insufficient . A need is a distress situation . Needs tend to put the organism into a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they provide motive power . With the attainment of the goal , the series of activities is completed or closed , tension is released through motor channels and the normal equilibrium of the organism is restored until the individual finds himself in a situation that will give rise to another need . Needs have been variously classified , but it is simplest to classify them in terms of their origins . Prescott classifies the needs of developing children into three categories representing three major aspects of life . These categories of need are : 1 . Physiological ? " When describing needs that spring primarily out of structure and dynamic biochemical equilibrium . " 2 . Social or status ? " When describing the relationships that it is essential to establish with other persons in our culture . " 3 . Ego or integrative ? " When describing needs for experience and for the organization and symbolization of experience through which the individual will discover his role in life and learn to play it in such an effective manner as to develop a sense of worthy selfhood. " 12 Between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to meet it lies a certain void . This void between where the footnote 22Prescott , Daniel , editor . Emotions and the Educative Prows . Washington , D. C .. Americus Council on Education , 1938 , p. 113.  | person is and where his goal lies represents the instrumental usage of the need concept . Here , playing basketball , having a " girl friend " or belonging to a club might be examples representing the means or instruments for making drive satisfaction possible , the implemental usage of the term " need . " We might say that " John needs to play basketball , " " he needs a girl friend " or " he needs to belong to a club . " When a teacher helps a student define his goals , helps provide opportunities and conditions as resources and suggests a path leading to a goal , he is helping the student to implement his needs . Needs in Our Culture . Cultural or normative needs are those expressing social standards or norms . They represent the demands made upon the individual by society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first type is illustrated in such statements as , " Johnny needs Latin ! " or " Johnny needs to learn table manners ! " Wright feels that this type of need exemplifies projected adult requirements and values and the absence of motive power on the part of Johnny.Y3 We think here of teacher objectives . These become student purposes when we have somehow turned cultural requirements into organismic needs . Organismic needs , on the other hand , are receiving greater emphasis as we learn about human personality from research in child growth and development and the newer findings in psychiatry and mental hygiene . The fundamental forces within the personality which are behind satisfaction-seeking behavior are being studied . Education in many places is being redesigned to meet individual needs . Theoretically , some of the tensions resulting from what Prescott classifies as physiological , social or status , and ego or integrative needs might be illustrated in the manner of the chart on the following page . Like organismic needs , purposes are within the individual , but he is not always conscious of the goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feelings of disturbance , discomfort , desire or unrest . The function of the teacher then becomes that of helping the students to define their goals clearly and to map out the path which will lead them to goal satisfaction . We must provide experiences , materials and conditions that lead to goal ' s Wright . Herbert F. " How the Psychology of Motivation Is Related to Curriculum Development . " Journal of Educational Psychology : 39 : 149-56 ; November 1948.  | figure  | realization . We must help the student create new purposes and extend or modify old ones . To reach goals , students need goal resources . Abilities , chances , opportunities , favorable conditions are necessary in order that needs be satisfied . Needs in the Area of Human Relations Adolescent needs in the area of human relations have been implied , if not named , in previous discussions . As a matter of fact , it would be impossible to name all of them . Here , instead of trying to do the impossible , it seems better to reiterate the major developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of adolescence arise out of their efforts to accomplish the tasks . The developmental tasks having direct bearing on their needs in the area of human relations are : To accept themselves To accept others and be accepted by others To win independence To create an adult value system To accept the reality of interdependence and its implications for working with others . In accomplishing these tasks the adolescent needs to develop a separate self that is worthy of respect and acceptance ; he needs to belong ; he needs to be free to learn to take responsibility for himself and others , to be self-directing and self-managing ; he needs to learn to work productively and cooperatively with others and to play with them joyously and creatively ; he needs to be helped to solve the problems resulting from individual differences centered in sex and in struggles to achieve and receive recognition so that he increasingly understands that satisfying relations with others in a democracy are built on the foundation stone of respect for personality , all personality . As he is done by , the adolescent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to ponder this fact . Leadership of Adolescents Adolescence represents a focal point of development and the last period where considerable direct educational influence is still  | possible and where there is enough plasticity of personality to make major changes in the direction of behavior . The adolescent rebels at domination but is constantly looking for goal resources in himself , in others ( age mates , parents and teachers ) , in materials , in conditions and experiences which will help him find answers to his problems and meet his needs . He wants help in establishing clearcut goals , but before this he needs and wants help in understanding himself and becoming aware of what his needs really are . Once a friendly guide makes him conscious of his needs , helps him find the resources with which to establish goal satisfactions , helps him see the paths toward his goals , the most important function of educational leadership has been performed . Qualities of the Leader A Mature Person . Considerable has already been said in previous sections concerning maturity and the criteria for maturity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-control , to stand on one 's own feet , to be economically competent and independent , to take responsibility , to cooperate with others , to make one 's own decisions , to have a wholesome heterosexual attitude and a point of view on life ? a philosophy characterized by unity and consistency ? are the marks of a mature and adequate adult . Suggestions and models are eagerly sought by adolescents as they grope for some sort of self-image of the kind of person they idealize or want to become . The conscious selection of the traits to imitate and the devotion to the ideals embodied in a given personality are very potent forces in the developing self and in behavior . The adolescent is fortunate who has good models in parents , teachers and leaders . The courage , skill , honesty , democracy , friendliness and other traits and principles represented by these virtues and in these people might well be generalized and accepted by the adolescent as guide lines as they become objects of desire and pin ? - pose and come to represent what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable personality . One lives hygienically , not by specific habits , but when hygienic living has become an ideal , a generalized habit . Democracy as a way of life will function only as it becomes an ideal . A few very old proverbs  | exemplify this : " Character is caught , not taught , " " What the parent is speaks far more loudly than the techniques which he employs , " " Most values are caught ' from other people . " An Understanding Person . Understanding refers to the fund of meanings one has built up . The leader in health , physical education or recreation can be effective in changing the behavior of people in the direction of desirable goals to the extent which he : 1 . Understands the culture in which he lives . Culture is the system of ways in which people behave , defines what is " proper " or " improper , " including knowledge , beliefs , values , art , morals , law and custom or any other capabilities of men acquired by social inheritance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values , interests and standards for satisfying his needs and attaining prestige and acceptance . Since adolescent behavior is in large part the result of the society in which youth grow up , we must become interested in the social structure as well as the individual if we are concerned with human relations . We are part and parcel of the culture in which we live . How various biological impulses become socialized by the provision of satisfactory channels for this process is one of the chief concerns of physical educators and recreation leaders functioning as applied social scientists . 2 . Understands the nature of the individual ? in this case , the adolescent . The validity of what educators do depends upon the validity of the principles by which they determine their procedures . Science , the search for functional relationship between facts , has established principles and has enabled us to base our beliefs and practices on facts rather than on superstition , tradition and hearsay . From research in growth and development ; from psychiatry , mental hygiene and human biology ; from social psychology , sociometrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the study of the learning process come principles which if applied in education would help immeasurably in improving mental health and human relations . The function of schools is to close the gap between what science has found out and the application of the principles . This is our job as teachers . 3 . Understands his own field . Professional understanding of one 's job implies the ability to understand and apply principles . The sources of many of these have been mentioned in the preceding statements . These are applied to understanding the nature of the individual and the nature of society . In addition , we must underitancl and be able to apply principles of organization and administra-  | tion and principles of method ? how learning experiences are organized . Whatever we do will be free from error only to the extent to which we employ tested and verified principles . Without them we can not really understand our jobs . Those working in the fields of health education , physical education and recreation should understand the potentiality of these areas for leadership of youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contacts and the consecutive periods of contact with the same students . Leadership can not operate in isolation ; people must be in association with each other . 2 . The nature of the activities in which students , teachers and leaders engage . In physical education and recreation these are biologically and socially " prepotent , " representing strong individual and social values to the adolescent . They seek to satisfy their needs in human relations by means of them . They use them as goal resources . 3 . The informality of the student-teacher relationships in these activities . 4 . The physique , the athletic and craft skills , the vitality and the values stressed tend to cause adolescents to identify themselves with the teacher having prestige in their sight . The idealized hero or heroine with educational insight may be very effective in guiding youth toward maturity . 5 . At one time , all that was asked of the educator was that he know his subject . Sometime later he was , asked to know his subject and also to know Johnny , the pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject and to know Johnny but to know himself as well . Most problems of adjustment in school are bipolar one pole the teacher , the other the pupil . We as teachers tend to interpret what we know in terms of what we are and what we feel . If the teacher feels insecure and must compensate for this insecurity by demanding obedience , showing authority and other signs of immaturity , the circular reaction of human relations begins and in this case it will not be a happy one . Strong , independent , stable and well-socialized men and women are invariably those who as children were accepted and secure and who had parents and teachers who were well integrated personalities and were neither too dominant nor too submissive . Teachers who do not understand themselves can hardly understand their pupils . Schools are therefore rightfully concerned with the kind of teachers who are , in considerable measure , responsible for the development of democratic human relations among children and youth .  | The skilled leader in human relations is one who is sensitive to the needs of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a common goal . The good coach does exactly this ? develops an integrated social group . Individuals have various abilities but each member contributes his ability toward the common goal . Each individual has the opportunity to grow to his full stature through participation and each develops a sense of mutual interrelationship and appreciation of the values of differences among men and women . Democratic educational administration does not imply lack of leadership . It integrates the various abilities in faculties about the common educational purposes of the school . It calls forth , uses and encourages initiative , resourcefulness and enthusiasm of every member of the school . The democratic teacher , coach or recreation leader as an administrator must be not only an originator of ideas but a coordinator of the ideas of others . The intelligent cooperation upon which the success of democracy depends must be learned in the schools . Democracy has many roots in a million playgrounds , athletic fields , gymnasia and summer camps . How firmly these roots take hold depends largely upon the quality of leadership which members of our respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Authoritarian " climate " produces authoritarian children . We now have the principles by which we may produce any climate we wish we can be our own climatologists. he Guidance Required The Leader as Friend . Pestalozzi once said , " Secure the love of the child and his education is an easy matter . " The analysis of 14,000 letters written by children in grades two to 12 in response to a nation-wide radio contest on " The Teacher Who Helped Me Most , " listed in rank order the following qualities in teachers which children found desirable : 1 . Cooperative , democratic attitude 2 . Kindliness and consideration for the individual 3 . Patience 4 . Wide interests  | 5 . Personal appearance and pleasing manner 6 . Fairness and impartiality 7 . Sense of humor 8 . Good disposition and consistent behavior 9 . Interest in pupils ' problems 10 . Flexibility 11 . Use of recognition and praise 12 . Unusual proficiency in teaching . " ' The children have here described the qualities of a mature adult ? a well-integrated individual who feels secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also value this type of teacher because he or she represents the kind of person who satisfies their needs in human relations , helps them meet their needs and solve their problems . Psychiatrists and clinicians have found that unless they can somehow get rapport with a patient and get his active cooperation . successful treatment is doubtful . Education comes from within . No one can educate another . The mental health , personality and example of the teacher are of basic importance in maximum motivation . The patterns of behavior , the attitudes developed , the value concepts and ideals crystallized in adolescents are in large part the result of the quality of human relations existing with their age mates and with their teachers . Self-Direction the Key . Guidance functions of the school , since they deal with human personalities , can not be compartmentalized . These functions are related to the curriculum , methods of instruction , the school health program , physical education and recreation , home and community relations and a myriad of others . All are concerned with the same thing , helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping them extend , create and change their long range purposes , helping them see the paths to these goals and helping them find within themselves and in their environment the goal resources to get where they want to go . The final goals of guidance are self-responsibility , self-discovery , self-realization and self-direction in a democratic social order . footnote 14 Witty , Paul " An Analysis of the Personality Traits of the Effective ' reacher . " Journal of Edon : . tional Research 40 : 662-71 ; May 1947.  | readership in Our Fields The educational aims of health education , physical education and recreation for the adolescent should not fail to include self-discovery , self-revelation and opportunity for self-assertion under friendly guidance . Distorted meanings in the concept of self , self-depreciation or self-negation due to peculiarities of physical development should be of real concern to workers in the three related fields . In adolescence , changes in size and form , together with new stimulations from developing organs , bring observable changes making the adolescent feel queer and new and different . The adolescent 's beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the fundamental determinants of what he does . The educational leader not earnestly searching for the principles of human development which help him to understand the dynamics of human personality and the structure of human relations is like the blacksmith not knowing the principles of metallurgy ; he will never get us very far . Situations act upon persons . We as leaders and applied social scientists on the athletic field , in the gymnasium or in the craft shop must study the situations that act upon adolescents as fully and as systematically as we would study internal physiological changes . Whether we observe neurotic behavior , exemplified by frustration and aggression or similar evidence of " storm and stress , " or whether we observe evidences of good mental health and personal-social adjustment indicative of satisfactory human relations , depends upon the capacity of the situations we set up to provide free expression and opportunity for the satisfaction of basic personality needs in a socially acceptable and educationally desirable manner . Powerful natural impulses can not be destroyed . Our task is to alter their modes of seeking expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Status may be achieved by contributing to a common goal through group membership . Camping may provide adventure , excitement and new experience . If we believe in the principles of mental hygiene , situations in physical education , athletics and recreation must be so structured socially that adolescent goal realization in the area of human relations is encouraged and not frustrated . This means that we must help the student find goal resources within himself , within others  | and within the situation . Goal satisfaction must become a possibility . We must create social situations so that chances , conditions , materials and experiences are available for use by adolescents seeking to meet their needs as they try to achieve real maturity . What we are as teachers speaks so loudly that the student can not hear what we say . The teacher as a leader must be a goal resource and a model for the student . The student must identify himself with what the teacher represents and the teacher must represent what he teaches . The technique of identification is effective in our fields and stresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models and ideals , as guides to conduct and achievement , to social sensitivity and democratic human relations .

From this has come insight into an important stage in the growth process , through which all pass physically but at which some become blocked emotionally , socially and intellectually . Of particular importance to the transition from adolescence to maturity is the development in concept-attitude structure which has to do with the premises on which behavior is based . Increasing maturity in the sense of the ability to function as self-disciplined and responsible persons in a democratic society is the growth-goal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes and values so closely integrated into personality that they are always discernible in behavior with and toward others . Such attitudes and values arise out of experiences with mature persons who live them skilfully . Teachers , parents , youth leaders and ministers are of major importance in this developmental aspect of adolescence ; nor are the teachers the least of these . How teachers teach , their objectives , their own relationship patterns are of the utmost importance to the maturing youth . Nowhere are these influences felt with greater impact in the educational process than in the fields dealing with persons and their basic relations with them ' selves and with others ? health education , physical education , recreation and home and family life .  | Though maturity as a dynamic concept has been described in the previous chapter , perhaps it will not be amiss to redescribe it in concepts man has developed for its description over the ages he has used language . This vocabulary is shaped by the culture out of which it is formed , and in the concepts of that particular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who knows and understands the meaning of freedom . He lives with independence and with integrity . He has honor and he is loyal . He believes and practices justice in his human relations to the best of his ability and understanding . He has a philosophy of life , a value structure which directs his attitudes and his acts . He has full knowledge of the meaning and implications of words which have become concepts in his own society . His conceptual thinking is worthy of the dignity and character of mature man . His valueattitude pattern is oriented around respect for self and respect for others as well . Conceptual Thinking of Adolescents The ideal mature man , as heretofore described , never exists as a real person . He is a value toward which persons strive throughout life . Individual man , the living functioning being , measures up in some aspects of maturity and down in others . But he does have one very important aspect in common with the never-realized ideal . His thinking is more highly conceptual than personalized . He is socially oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature , are based on broad experience and basic human understanding . Attitudes are positive and creative rather than negative and destructive . Actions have a high degree of consistency with concepts , values and attitudes . Judgments , therefore , tend to be fair and tolerance broad . Relationships , with such socially related persons , are understanding and sympathetic . Permissiveness arises from faith in fellow men and from conviction in the validity of the philosophy of live and let live . Emotion is not absent in the thinking and acting of the mature person , but he demands facts as the basis for decision . Decisions may be in error , since every human makes errors in judgment and interpretation , but reasons and emotions have balanced out in n  | decisions reached . Fanaticism is not used as an escape from problems which must be faced . Convictions are held , but they can be and are often changed . Keys to such personality integration are numerous , but one of the more important is the development of conceptual thinking out of rich , varied and broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what a thing in general should be . Concepts are " mental images " of things formed by " generalizations from particulars , " to quote Webster . The broader the experiences in " particular " from which the " generalizations " are derived , the sounder the value pattern on which the particulars are generalized , the more mature is the **29;2050;TOOLONG life of the individual . Conceptual thinking is , of course , thinking in terms of the abstract . It is thinking of a situation or an act plus . The plus side of the picture is its implications , its ramifications and its generalizations . However , to come to understand the implications , the ramifications , and to draw generalizations from a situation or from an act , demand breadth of understanding based on wide and various experience . As Harry Overstreet puts it , the knowledge links to the environment must be strong . Adolescents and Personalized Generalizations Adolescence is a period of personalized particulars . Generalizations , values and attitudes up to this period of development have been taken in large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood age-mates and those slightly older should not be overlooked in the understanding of the formation of attitudes and values even in childhood . But rarely are these questioned regardless of source . During the teen trek toward independence ? independence in action , in thinking , in making decisions , in behavior ? the individual begins to question and throw aside the imposed and often authoritarian conceptions of good and bad , right and wrong , man and woman , grownup and child . He also begins to feel his way , more than think his way , toward new concepts out of the breadth or meagerness of his own youth experiences .  | Self-Centered Adolescence . Adolescence is a period of growth where attention and concern are centered on self . Physical growth and change create a new awareness of body . Not since the person was a small child , literally in process of discovering himself , did he feel as conscious of himself as a physical being . Arms and legs seem to get in the way . New body contours , the budding promise of maturation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are equally evident to others . Concern is felt if change is not as rapid as he assumes it to be in his fellow youth , and concern is felt if development appears to be more rapid . On either hand , consciousness of physical self is a part of his years of rapid maturation . For the majority of children in the culture , childhood is a period of family-centered living . Always what the family does , what the family thinks , what the family gives is of greater importance than what any other group does , thinks or gives . Children find their play around home base and families see that play is home based . The first concern of children is primarily with acceptance by the family and security in the family . And the next is , of course , acceptance by the neighborhood play group . Protection by parents , or surrogate parents , is a part of everyday living , and it is an essential protection on physical , emotional , intellectual and social fronts . Children , no matter what their social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for emotional and social security . Adolescence is a period of peer group-centered living . Youth in the teen years is tremendously interested in and greatly impressed by the life of its own age group and the security which comes from belonging . The individual begins to take a position in his own age group similar to that which he will attain among adults when he reaches adulthood . Wise parents during this period of transition from childhood to adulthood continue their protective role , but with a difference . Adolescents still need to be guarded against the full impact of adult responsibility and the irresponsibility of immature and unhealthy adults . But protection by parents or teachers can not and should not be obvious . The more subtle the guidance toward acceptable living and away from the dangers of living , the more . accepted it is by the adolescent .  | Adolescence has as one of its characteristics a high degree of impatience . It is impatient with itself , its world and with the elders in its world . To be grown up is considered a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is both confusing and irritating . Nor does our society offer much assistance in going through this period of " neither-nor . " Adolescents do not have a place of their own in our culture . No " real jobs " exist save continuing with " the preliminaries , " as one wise young person expressed it . This leads to an increasing attention to self because of the mounting desire to " get somewhere " and " in a hurry . " Children tend to think in action words and terms . Their values and their attitudes are from their elders . They accept and they do . When childhood is past and adolescence becomes reality , concepts begin to develop in terms of expanded horizons and age-mate influences . Value judgments begin to be analyzed and new values formed . But interpretation of concepts , of generalizations , of attitudes and of values , tends to remain centered about self . These are highly personalized . Interpretations of implications are in relation to the immediate youth future and to their immediate value to youth rather than in long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Values and Personal Conflict All living is governed by the attitude-value duo . Attitudes are the tendencies of individuals to act toward a given situation or given persons in a given way . Values , on the other hand , are the directing forces toward or away from which we act . Values away from which we act are those which we deem detrimental to society . Youth learns the negatives as truly as the positives in our value situations . Values always color attitudes ; and attitudes always color values . Equilibrium between the two is essential for mature living and peace of mind . Many of the conflicts of individuals and most of the conflicts of groups arise out of disequilibrium between attitudes and values . Values may be held which are inconsistent with attitudes and actions . Attitudes may not support instilled values . As Gunnar Myrdal has pointed out in An American Dilemma , it is just such a footnote I Myrdal , Gunnar . An American Dilemma . New York : Harper and Brothers , 1944.  | conflict of attitudes and values which dominates intergroup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its basis in Christian doctrine , the brotherhood of man and the integrity of personality are accepted as essential values for " the good life . " But our attitudes toward different national and color groups and our actions resulting from our attitudes are diametrically opposed to our value structure , to our philosophy , to our faith . Until attitudes and values are harmonized , conflicts within the individual and among groups will be embittered by an attempt to justify an uneasy conscience . Adolescents find themselves in a not too different situation in relation to their attitudes and values toward their families and toward other dominant adults in their sphere of influence . Children in our society are supposed to respect parents , older relatives , teachers , ministers , group leaders and , in general , other adults . Obedience and respect have often been confused in their meaning . " Mother knows best " has been drilled into the child as a social fact . Father is respected because he is " father , " not because of his own worth . Teachers are well-informed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to " keep the group " functioning . Ministers are men of reverence . Grandparents must be treated with proper dignity because of their age . Teen age youth begin to question . . . and rightly so . . . whether " mother always knows best " ; whether father is really all his position in the family implies ; whether " what teacher says is always so , " whether all youth leaders must be supported even if they are bunglers in their human relations . But because acceptance of values given by adults has been a part of childhood , a guilty conscience over this questioning becomes a very real part of adolescence . The more common form of youth action which indicates the questioning attitude is that whatever the family does is wrong . Parents become deeply concerned over this particular phase of intellectual and emotional growth . They tend to take personally the criticism the adolescent centers upon them , not because they are all wrong , but because they happen to be immediately available , as the target for youth 's developing critical attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same attitude of " prove it or I do n't believe it , " but in a less emotionalized , less personalized and less articulate form . Difficulties in relationships arise if the adolescents themselves are troubled or made to feel guilty because of their questioning of heretofore accepted absolutes . They are troubled by their sudden ability to see the family with penetrating clarity . They are somewhat frightened at their desire to get away , to do and to live differently . Nonetheless , what they are experiencing is one manifestation of the desire for independence . Granted they express it adequately and emotionally , if not understood by parents and teachers the resulting conflict between their newly-formed attitudes and their family values , arrived at through their years of childhood , may lead to severe emotional difficulty . The adults should offer help in resolving the conflict by accepting its manifestation for what it is ? a part of the intellectual-emotional growth process . Adolescent and Mature Concepts and Attitudes An examination of positive values accepted more or less universally in our culture will illustrate the transitional state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Adolescent Wants " To Be Free " Freedom . Freedom is a fundamental value in a democratic society and a fundamental concept for mature functioning in such a society . Freedom to the adolescent is a highly desirable and personalized goal . Interpretation of freedom for him is " to be free , " " to be free from restraint , " " to be free from authority , " " to live without being disciplined . " Since the adolescent feels himself an independent being " bounded only by his own skin , " as a wise philosopher put it , his concept of freedom is equally person-centered . Adults who have grown out of emotional , social and intellectual adolescence recognize freedom as a relative , a social fact . Freedom is never freedom from authority , but freedom under the rules of the particular society . Freedom is never without discipline but with self-responsibility and self-discipline . Maturity accepts the fact that all living is social , that all personal desires are adjusted  | to desires and wishes of others . Recognition is gained that complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom controlled and limited to equal opportunity to be as free as living well with others will permit . In other words , the mature person in our society accepts the reality of interdependence and as Hearn pointed out in Chapter 2 , has achieved a satisfactory balance between his dependence and independence needs . Transition from the interpretation of freedom as the adolescent sees it , " freedom from " to freedom as the mature adult sees it , " freedom within , " is one of the major essentials of growing up . Many adults never make this necessary step in their conceptual thinking . Their attitudes , therefore , remain on the level of " fighting authority , " of " demanding freedom , " of " resentment of interference . " On many fronts in our social life we find the reality-fact of living with and doing with others in definite conflict with a value structure which holds " every man for himself " as its central thesis . Independence . Independence is one of the most desired attributes as far as the adolescent is concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master of his own fate . But many things in our society are against an early assumption of independence . The primary block is economic . Jobs for teen agers who , of necessity , must work , are limited . Jobs for teen agers who would like to work are even more scarce . Apprenticeship is almost a thing of the past , and when it remains a part of job training , apprentices are usually young men or women out of school . Educational demands have also played a part . In-school years have been lengthened by families themselves for all youth , but compulsory school age has been steadily rising farther and farther into adolescence . College training is not only considered essential for the lower middle-class and upper middle-class youth , an assured fact for the upper-class boys and girls , but is more and more becoming recognized by the upper-lower status group as a necessary stepping stone to rising in the class structure . Again , as the science of human relations becomes more and more developed , understanding is being gained that emotional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescents ti through their transitional years into adulthood .  | Independence for the adult means some measure of economic sufficiency , self-determination , self-control , and a degree of social responsibility . Independence , as dreamed of by the adolescent , is the freedom to " do as I please , " " to determine my own next steps , " " to make up my own mind . " To accomplish each of these entails economic independence , an educational level sufficient to brook stiff competition in earning a living , and emotional maturity sufficient to withstand the shock of adult social life . Adolescent independence is sensed as a highly desirable state for the individual . Little thought is given to responsibilities which go with such a state : Independence to the adolescent is somewhat feared , since it is more sensed than understood . Even though youth live with independent adults in the home , in the community and school situation , rarely do they seem to gain from such experience the full implications of freedom from economic , emotional and social protection as afforded by the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely do many adults , realize that independence in itself arises out of interdependence with others . No individual is ever successful or a failure in and of himself . His own temperamental set combined with the impact of his experiences with the people with whom he lives determines how independently he may live and how successful or how unsuccessful his independent living may be . Charles Horton Cooley , one of the great pioneers in social psychology , calls personality " our social selves , " or " our looking glass selves , " which even makes our personality a product of dependence on and with others . He says we behave or act as we think others would wish us to act . ' Social roles , therefore , are played by each in relation to the others in his life . What we are is what we judge others expect and want us to be . To gain this concept of self is a sophisticated process . To come to full realization of it is definitely a sign of maturity . Judgment of what others expect of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in satisfactory human relations on many fronts . Only in this way is consistency in behavior obtained . Only in this way is independence within interdependence really achieved . footnote Cowley , Charles Horton . Social Organization : A Study of the Larger Mind . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons , 1909.  | The Adolescent Wants Fair Play " Justice . Justice is something the adolescent usually understands in relation to his own age group , to his peers . How the rules are applied to his fellows at school , at home and in sports is important as the applications relate to himself and to those of his associates whom he respects and admires . Justice , interpreted in the light of mature democratic experience , is concerned with justice before God , justice before the law and justice in the economic and social order . If justice as an ultimate value is accepted by the culture in which persons live , then its interpretation is always in terms of justice for each person and justice for all as well . The adolescent sees it as justice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his elders . Equality . Perhaps no concept in democratic philosophy is more difficult to understand than that of equality . Adults , in chronological age and mature in many phases of their emotional development , no less than youth , find themselves confused over what equality in a democratic society really means . Equality , to the adolescent , tends to be interpreted as " Exactly the same as , " or " not different from . " Companions are " equal " if they dress alike , act very much alike , use much the same vocabulary , date in an almost ritualistic pattern , and belong to similar groups of peers . Physical differences , discrepancies in intellectual interests and attainments , and especially social variations identify one in the adolescent world as " inferior " or " beyond the pale . " Many adults find it equally difficult to accept variations in appearance , intellectual performance and social attitudes and values without judging the different as superior or inferior . Equality , as a concept of democratic living , of necessity must be based on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men are not and can not be identical . Individuals differ iii capacities , certain temperamental characteristics , as well as in physical appearance . Opportunities for growth and development vary as widely as do those of the child of the multi-millionaire and the street sweeper . In addition to social and economic status , the community and its schools , churches , recreational facilities and general emotional climate are determining factors in individual  | differences . Denial of differences as social and emotional facts does not establish equality in the meaning of identical as a fact in democratic society . As Herbert Agar has so well pointed out in Time for Greatness , mature individuals have clarified their conception of what equality means in a society based on democratic principles . Equality , Agar says , is equality in something : in opportunity to grow and develop , to learn and earn , to share in what the culture has to offer ; equality in justice and before God . ' Again , equality in a democratic society may be interpreted by the mature person as " comparable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto " the demands of living . This interpretation of equality accepts individual differences as a fact , but accepts as well the potentiality of the individual to become an emotionally and socially mature adult . Equality , thus interpreted , demands fundamental understanding of individual differences and acceptance of them . Morever , it has within it an appreciation for the minute division of labor in a democratic and technological society and the contribution of each segment of the society , no matter how small , to the welfare of the whole . Fundamental security within self is essential also to see that equality does not mean " one can not afford to be different " or can not afford to accept the contributions of those who are different as of equal importance . When the adolescent has come to the point of inner security and personal growth where he can afford to differ from his peers , he has taken a long step toward understanding equality in its social meaning . When he can afford to be seen with and have friendship for those who differ from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken . When he can accept with tolerance ideas , attitudes and behaviors which do not fit into his own little world , he has completed his transition from a personalized definition of equality as " the same " to the socialized interpretation of " comparable in performance , " " adequate in handling situations , " and " sufficient unto " the demands of living . footnote *Agar , Herbert . A Time for Greatness . New York Little , Brown and Co. , 1942.  | The Adolescent Wants To Belong Loyalty . Loyalty is a value in the teen years . The paramount loyalty of the adolescent is usually to his own age group . Many of the conflicts in this period of development arise out of conflicting loyalties to parents and to age-mates , out of loyalties to values of mother and father as contrasted to newer values being tried out by youth of similar age and development . Some teen-agers never get to the developmental task of solving such conflicts . Loyalty , as fidelity to a set of principles and to groups of persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Integrity . Outstanding characteristics of adolescents are inconsistency in behavior , fluctuating values and changing attitudes . No doubt some of the inconsistency arises out of conflicting claims of peer affiliation and adult authority . Behavior from day to day varies with mood , with current demands and with new experiences . Behavior at home with the family may be exemplary , but outside the control of family and with the peer group it may leave much to be desired . Behavior in school may be erratic and unpredictable , but behavior on the football field or in social activities may be consistent and always recognizable as stemming from the same motivating force . Adolescents have difficulty in understanding integrity as a quality of being complete , of being consistent , of being undivided in one 's attitudes , values and behavior . Integrity might be described as the " core of consistency " which identifies the personality as the same personality in each situation or which identifies the individual of many social roles as a total and consistent unit . The adolescent is in process of choosing his values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become predictable in the light of these . He can not be expected to act with the consistency of an adult . He is only coming into an understanding of what integrity means . He is in process of trying out responses to situations until he finds those which fit him more comfortably into participation with his fellow men . Integrity or consistency in behavior is desirable from the point of view of the adolescent because it offers more individual coinfort in living . It is an essential from the viewpoint of the adult  | because one can not be trusted to carry out one 's share of responsibility in living when behavior varies from day to day or situation to situation . The adolescent wants the security of integrity in behavior and sees it as a hazy goal . The adult demands integrity in his fellow men so that dependence can be placed in them for their share in the solutions of the problems of living . To obtain predictability , to obtain wholeness of personality , to acquire consistency in role playing regardless of the social situation , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process throughout living . But when attitudes become social , when values become selfless rather than self-centered , such integrity is more nearly achieved . Here again can be seen an illustration of the personalization of experience into self-centered thinking which is characteristic of adolescence in contrast to the mature value pattern of the adult . Building a Philosophy of Life A philosophy of life is nothing more nor less than a set of principles or values by which the individual attempts to live . These principles or values by which the individual attempts to live as interpreted by the adolescent have one end in view . They must be principles which assure belonging , which assure acceptance , which make for popularity with fellow teen-agers . Because the adolescent needs reassurance and assurance of himself , because he has his fears and his very real insecurities , because he feels himself neither " fish nor fowl " in the adult world toward which he is growing , he must feel acceptance by his own group . Principles of living , therefore , which make for unpopularity , which make for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age group , can not be allowed to enter into his philosophy of life . Hence " drips " are those adolescents whose behavior is more nearly in line with adult attitudes and values and in conflict with peer group demands . Adults have learned that principles or values lived by with consistency and integrity in all behavior very often do not lead either to belonging in their age group or to acceptance by their peers . Need for reassurance in maturity is less , of course . Or rather it arises from other than personalized sources . Small children are  | dependent upon their parents for their security . Adolescents turn from parents to their own age-mates , but nonetheless gain their feeling of security from others rather than from being sure of competence in self . Men and women find their security in their belief in themselves , in their ability to handle their problems , in their achievement , in their relationships with other adults . Adolescent and Mature Relations Human relations , in all their variations , have their basis in an all important concept , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sociological study has revealed , in the life of the child , is self-centeredness . The concept is that of " I " and " mine . " Association with others , the adults serving childhood needs , is association for self-gratification and self-comfort . " We-ness , " the social self , is not achieved , if ever , until the relatedness of the individual to his fellow individuals and to the society created by him and them is realized and understood . Maturity and immaturity might well be described in the pronouns of " I " and " we . " Self-centered , narrow , in-turned living identifies the individual whose concept of self has never expanded out of the " I " centered concept of childhood . Social-centered , outward turned , broadly tolerant living is accomplished by those who see themselves as related to others , as interdependent with others , as literally the products of life with others . Stages of growth , of course , are discernible in the concept of self as in any other . The infant is the complete egoist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 's . " The adolescent is still chiefly " I " centered , but is rapidly learning the importance of " we . " The mature adult sees himself always in relationship with others children , youth or adults . Family Relations Family relations , for the adolescent , are often fraught with danger as far as making adequate transition from the " I " to the " we " way of thinking and acting is concerned . Many parents tend to treat as immature and foolish the ideas expressed by their adolescent sons or daughters . Concepts of adolescents may be fully mature  | for the growth stage in which they are . This should be recognized . Maturity needs to be seen as a dynamic for growth rather than as a static condition to be gained and eternally held . Criticism of family and home should be understood as development of the ability to see the family and home objectively . A little humor instead of hurt feelings can balance negative criticism . Families are not perfect . Family members are not perfect . Insight is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths and weaknesses in the family is an equally valid measure of maturity though not so often used . When youth are learning to look at the family from an outsider 's point of view , it is definitely a sign of growth and maturation . Young people may need help to see the family 's strengths as well as its insufficiencies . They should not be made to feel guilty because they are critical . Actually it is this critical attitude toward family which makes possible the improvement of family living . If each generation accepted as perfect the behavior and practices of the last , no change would take place . Each younger generation should be helped by the older to understand family and community as they really are . Thus opportunity is offered for betterment of human relations in both these areas . Democratic families are the first assurance that adolescents will become mature adults in their conceptual thinking and reasoning . Such families live with consistency between their democratic values and their attitudes and behaviors . Boy-Girl and Man-Woman Relations Conceptual development and growth can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure surrounding boy-girl relations as contrasted with man-woman relations in adult living . Adolescent girls measure their personal success in terms of attractiveness to boys , in numbers of dates , in so-called popularity . When dates are not numerous or do not come with any degree of regularity during adolescent days , acute feelings of inferiority develop and serious problems of behavior may arise to overcome this very real feeling of insufficiency in a much desired human relation . Boys , and girls as well , find it necessary to be popular with the other sex if they  | are to " rate " in their own youth community . Timidity , awkwardness , inexperience , lack of opportunity for association with the opposite sex on an every day basis , may lead to all manner of unsocial behavior in other situations . Standards of what it takes to be popular and how popularity is defined are set by the middle class . However , as Margaret Mead has stated in Male and Female , the tendency in each class group in the culture is toward publicized , glorified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of adolescents in history , teen-agers find themselves face to face with problems of petting ? to pet or not to pet ; how far to go and when to stop ; " does one have to pet to be popular " or " to be a good scout " ; who sets the limits , boy or girl . Marriage , to the adolescent , very often appears as the way out of this dilemma . Marriage , to many adolescents , means freedom from controls in sex relations and freedom from restraints of home and parents . Nor is this concept of marriage surprising when one remembers preoccupation with physical development , with sexual maturation , with freedom and independence , which are very real developmental tasks of youth . Younger adolescents often have no real concept of the relationship of boy-girl dating and petting other than its immediate value in personal rating . Few have an understanding of boy-girl adolescent experiences as a prelude to successful marriage . Few have a positive set of values in regard to sex relations which holds them steady as they build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship of man and woman for the mutual development of personalities , as the basic relation for the creation of new life , as the mutual sharing of responsibility , as the basic social-affectional relation in all human living , has not become apparent to them . Why it has not since they have lived in families where parents are married is one of the puzzling questions of the day . Community Problems It must be recognized that a youth world does exist . In our culture , this adolescent society is too much isolated from the adult world footnote 4 Mead , Margaret . Male and Female . New York : William Morrow and Co. , 1949 , p. 281.95.  | into which it leads . Full acceptance of the adolescent is assured only by his peers , and not always by them if he follows too closely the demands of adults . Adults tend to accept him on a childhood level one day and expect him to act on an adult level the next . Too rarely do parents , teachers , ministers , youth leaders and others accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate . Goals are goals for today . Tomorrow seems a long way off . To bring tomorrow closer , chances to share in adult living should be a part of youth life . At the same time , no attempt should be made to force adolescents into adulthood with no real transition from childhood . Values desirable for adult living in a democracy are implanted in individuals from childhood . Acceptance without evaluation is the child 's reaction to them . Evaluation on the base of limited experience is the adolescent 's reaction to these values . Evaluation on the base of broad social experience should be the adult 's reaction to them . Experiences which adults may offer youth toward social perspective in living are of two different types . Associational experiences , formal and informal , real and vicarious , are extremely important . Actional or active experiences , where the immediate is interpreted in the light of ultimates , are equally important . Associations with adults which are most important to the adolescent are those with parents , teachers , recreational and religious leaders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working . At no period in living do adults need to display their own emotional balance and their own value structure more clearly than when they are working with adolescents . Children may not realize inconsistencies between attitudes and values in adults . Youth never miss the implications of the act as counter to the value expressed or implied . Objectives in the Area of Human Relations The content of concepts , the value orientation of concepts , like the adolescent himself , is in process of growth and development ( luring the teen years . The developmental aspects of **29;2081;TOOLONG pass from the direct action words and thoughts of childhood to the personalized conceptual thinking of adolescents , to the socialized concepts and values of mature adults .  | As no stage in physical growth can be skipped or eliminated , so no stage in the developmental process of use of knowledge and experience in thinking should be skipped . The important question is not what to do to make the concepts and values of adolescents less personalized , but how to be sure that conceptual thinking passes successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other-centered reasoning and thinking so necessary for successful democratic living . Determination must be made as to what kinds of objectives leaders and teachers of adolescent youth will foster which will assure this desirable development . Life adjustment education , so much in the forefront today , is stressing practical values in the school experience for youth . No longer do educators talk of " what we teach youth , " but they talk of " youth and their needs . " Youth and their developmental tasks and what teachers have to offer for more effective living are becoming the keynotes of curriculum planning . The school is a supplement to family teaching in most instances . But educators are more and more realizing that in many cases the school must be a substitute for family inadequacy if youth are to have opportunities to grow into adequate maturity . Personal and social adjustment , progression toward vocational competence , citizenship , and marriage and the family are recognized as the four main areas in living for which youth need to be educated . No small part of this education has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent generalizations from a wealth of particulars . " It makes values and attitudes easily translatable into behavior . Personalities coming under such influences tend to become integrated wholes . A first requirement in developing concepts and attitudes in the adolescent toward the accepted democratic values is maturity in concept structure of the adults with whom he must associate . An understanding of the adolescent himself by the emotionally mature adults in his life is a second essential . Still another aspect of the situation is the need for adults to realize there are progressive steps in development of the ability to think and act , as there are progressive steps in physical growth . Guidance for the child is direct . Guidance for the adolescent  | must of necessity be indirect and subtle . If youth are to take their places as adults of integrity and equality , controls of their thinking should be loosened . Opportunities need to be given for the expression of ideas and feelings . Chance must be given for concepts to be shared and socialized . A Democratic Climate Adults , whose influence upon adolescents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their own acts , by their own way of living , a democratic climate in which youth experiences take place . Teachers are no less sensitive to critical evaluation by youth than parents . Evidence of this is the effect of independent thinking on test grades . Too many times when youth fail to give back what the teacher has put out as fact , grades suffer . If youth have the temerity to question teacher-stated fact , teacher reaction is as direct from grades as it is indirect from smouldering resentment of parents . If adolescents are ever to pass through their period of personalized conceptual thinking into socialized concepts as a basis for thinking , broad experience with reasoning , criticism and evaluation is necessary both at home and at school . Too often it is at this point where " the perpetual adolescent " is developed . If he attempts to evaluate his family or school or his relationship to it , he is stifled by adult irritation and resentment and may well give up . If he is cut short by their unwillingness to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop ideas . Even more important , he may react with an intense sense of guilt . Trying to see groups , institutions and individuals as they are may become to him something undesirable or " bad . " To avoid guilt feelings , he may quit thinking . Here may develop unreasoning or passive acceptance . Here may develop acceptance with underlying aggression . Here may arise a Pollyanna attitude toward life , living and the pursuit of happiness . Any one makes for adult immaturity . Teachers , by their very position in society , represent authority . If they are insecure in themselves they can not cover it . If they are arrested adolescents in their own thinking and action , it will show through . Their authority with adolescents will be expressed in  | domination , in superiority , in arrogance , in impatience . If , however , they are secure in themselves , their thinking and actions become their authority . Their integrity , their wholeness , shows through to youth in every relation . Their controls of youth are the controls of equalitarian understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teachers can " get by " with immature behavior with youth . Recreational and religious leaders are forced to display maturity or they are apt to be left to their own devices . Mature adults have interests broader than self . Insights into themselves and into the world in which they live are objective . They have the ability to accept emotions as a normal and healthy part of living . Skill at meeting frustrations is their skill in problemsolving . Attitude-value patterns are in harmony . A philosophy of life guides actual behavior rather than verbal behavior . Youth need help to learn these facts of emotional maturity from the emotionally mature in their transitional years . Adult associates who display selfishness are of no help to youth . Those who have neither insight nor humor concerning themselves or their world are a liability . Fear of emotional experiences and attempts to repress them by grown persons who are youth leaders offer little toward sound emotional maturation of adolescents . Cynicism , fanaticism or boredom as ways of meeting frustration furnish unhealthy examples to be followed by youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When so-called mature individuals think one way , talk another and act still another , their inconsistency is evident to adolescents with whom they work . A philosophy of life , which is nothing more than verbal mouthings of well-worn platitudes , offers little as an example to be followed . Experiences where youth are given the responsibility for their own performances in action and for their own mistakes should be wide and varied during this period . Interpretation of these experiences by understanding adults in terms of value and meaning should be a part of them . Self-Direction and Self-Responsibility Implicit in the creation of a democratic climate by democratic action of all concerned is that all procedures , methods and techniques  | employed with youth lead to self-direction and self-responsibility . Instead of resentment of the desire for freedom by youth , adults should understand freedom as something every individual wants and needs . Parents should help in the attainment of freedom and independence . Action and thought of adolescents should be as free as they are capable of handling at their particular growth stage . Even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . Self-discipline is learned . The privilege of making one 's own mistakes and taking the consequences is necessary for growth . At the same time , if authority of adults over youth is handled as social control rather than as personal control , a real step forward is taken . Direct control belongs to childhood . Social control is a part of adulthood . Adolescents need to learn from adults that freedom does not mean without controls . Freedom is always relative to the authority imposed by society on those who compose it . Critical attitude on the part of the adolescent should be fostered by older persons . Positive criticism as well as negative should become understood . An objective critical attitude is expected of mature men and women . One does not and can not learn to be objective and critical unless one has the opportunity to learn how to analyze and weigh situations . Attitudes should come to be seen as directly related to values . Realization that there are negative values away from which we live as well as positive values toward which we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school and in the home should be developed out of many opportunities to do worthwhile tasks . Value in work ( lone should lie not only in what it does for the boy or girl but also in what it does for the group . Work habits at school should be under , tood as preludes to work habits on the job . They are a part and parcel of the same thing . Cooperation and Sharing Many opportunities should be offered adolescents to work and play together , boys and girls , boys with boys and girls with girls . Group projects which have as their main emphasis cooperative sharing should be many and varied . Experience is the basis of all thinking and reasoning . Persons do not think in a vacuum .  | To offer youth opportunity to pass from a person-centered world to a social-centered one , they need experience which helps them to see themselves as a part of a total social pattern . Too often adolescents see themselves as isolates in a social picture . Moreover , they need to be assisted to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to youth . Adults may offer opportunities for them to see their ultimate value . Adults may well help youth gain an understanding that " what is best for me right now " must always be seen in relation to " what is best for all of us right now and tomorrow . " Boy-Girl Relations . Opportunities for happy , normal , gay work and play experiences , boys and girls together , should be many . Dating is only one aspect of training toward mature man-woman relationships . Men and women in our society work shoulder to shoulder on jobs , in communities , at home , in parenthood . To gain respect for each other as persons , as well as members of different sexes , demands many and varied mutual experiences . Similarities in capabilities , in emotional maturities , in social adaptiveness , can be discovered through association . Such experiences help youth see sex differences in proper perspective . Sex relations are only one part of man-woman relations . Teaching of relationships between sexes has been weighted entirely too heavily from the point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative values . When emphasis is placed on growth toward emotional adequacy , sex tends to take its normal place in the scheme of things . When social effectiveness and intellectual breadth become ends for good living , positive attitudes toward men and women result . Attitudes and values in relation to sex become positive goals to be achieved in adulthood . To far too many youth , sex relations are interpreted as negative acts to be avoided in adolescence and youth . Positive values and attitudes toward sex do not arise out of knowledge of physiology and hygiene . A basic knowledge of the psychology of sex is necessary . Even more necessary to mature happiness in marriage is a set of attitudes toward men and women which have as their basis mutual respect . An understanding of the , . comparable contributions of each sex to the on-going and well-being  | of society is a necessity . Emotional stability on the part of each is essential in meeting problems of everyday living as well as the more intimate problems of marriage and parenthood . Discussions of a wide variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overemphasized . Such discussions are effective in development of attitudes and values , which make for happier relations between men and women on the job , in the community and in marriage . Sharing of ideas , points of view , agreements and disagreements do much to develop objectivity . The guidance of understanding , intelligent adults gives a broad base for concept content . Democracy in Living . To achieve for youth an interpretation of democracy as a way of living demands that it be lived every day . Family , school , church and recreational groups should offer demonstrations of equality , justice , cooperation , integrity and tolerance . Social situations in which youth are participants need to constantly illustrate skill in human relations . Democracy demands two things : respect for the individual regardless of his age or ability , and respect for the needs of individuals in groups . Teen-agers feel themselves as highly individualistic . They need desperately to have their personalities respected by adults . They need , as well , participation in groups in order that group needs may be seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family Life . Home and family life education for youth and for adults in the United States is widening the horizons of understanding of millions of parents and future parents . They are coming to see the necessity of democratic values lived every day in the family if democracy is to survive as a way of government . Moreover , this same education helps parents and future parents to understand that democracy is a way of life which offers the individual opportunity to develop to the height of his potentials for his own personal fulfilment and for his most effective social service to his community , his nation and his world . , S'chool Relationships and Social Growth . Again , responsibility for self in group participation can be practiced in every school  | situation if the teacher is alert to possibilities . Independence of action in the interdependent group is always a possibility . Freedom to plan , to make decisions , to succeed and to fail are all potentials in every health education , physical education and recreation group , in every homemaking class , in every social science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group needs is always there when the group leader has maturity to act and be cooperative in relation to youth . An understanding of self in relation to other selves can always be gained in informal , active , effective participation . Learning of physical needs , of emotional and social growth , of home and family , of the community and society offers self and social understanding . Health education , physical education and recreation in high school and in college , as well as homemaking education and the social sciences , carry a large share of the responsibility for furnishing a wealth of rich experiences to youth toward selflessness in living rather than toward self-centeredness . By the very nature of these educational areas , they treat of the stuff of everyday living . By the informal method of teaching , by the consistent use of democratic practices in relationships , through the laboratory technique in gymnasium , on the playing field , in the homemaking cottage , in the project oriented social science division , a wide variety of stimulating social and personal experiences in human understanding are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate association of youth with teachers ? more on the counselor-youth base than most classroom teachers ? associational experiences between the adult and youth world are more real and more possible . When health is understood as total health ? physical , emotional , intellectual and social ? when health is seen as the opposite of " dis-ease , " when human behavior is understood as symptomatic of underlying needs , when developmental tasks of each age group are understood , then experiences offered to youth will always be geared toward development into intellectual , social and emotional maturity symbolized by a body efficiently managed and thoroughly understood .

THOMPSON IN THE previous chapters , attention has been given to the meaning of adolescence with its characteristic rapid physical changes , problems in emotional and social growth and ambivalent and inconsistent behaviors . Growth has been discussed in terms of maturation goals as a biosocial process by a unified organism proceeding at an individual pace . The developing concept of self , the nature of the " wants " of adolescents in terms of freedom , discipline , independence , fair play , loyalty and integrity , and a philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn for the development of objectives in the area of human relations ; a democratic climate , self-direction and self-responsibility , cooperation and sharing with others were seen as essential . It is the purpose of this chapter to clarify the problem of methods to use to create a democratic climate , to help adolescents to become increasingly self-directing and responsible and to give them opportunities to share with others in cooperatively planning for and carrying on their activities in health education , physical education and recreation situations . The chapter will consider in turn the climate , the process of method in general terms , the participation of individuals in the process and possible outcomes . These discussions will be followed by applications of the methods in planning for adolescents and working with them .  | The Climate Everyone has had the experience of walking into a room in which there were a number of people and becoming immediately aware of a " feeling tone . " In one instance it may have been friendly and hospitable while in another there may have been overtones of hostility or lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who entered but rather seemed characteristic of the particular situation . Climate is very real , it exists and it can be identified . Climate affects each individual and in turn is modified continuously by everything that happens in and around it . Leaders have all experienced what happens to a study group when the fire engine goes by or when someone enters and interrupts a hot discussion . The climate certainly changes . The variety of climates that can exist in a given situation have also been a matter of common experience . The important thing is to be able to identify climates and to recognize some of the forces which are operative . One of the major jobs of those who work with adolescents is the insuring of the kind of climate in which young people may move most effectively toward maturity . Characteristics of a Democratic Climate A group that has achieved a dynamic , friendly and relaxed atmosphere is moving in the right direction . If the group is purposeful , if it recognizes and attacks problems and if it becomes increasingly self-motivated toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic climate is being made . In addition , there should be evidence of enthusiasm , zest and pleasure . In a very real sense , learning and sharing and doing are fun . In a democratic climate the feeling tone is a happy one . Participants give evidence of growth through accepting differences , maintaining individuality , sharing responsibility , cooperating in group action and of " we-ness " and high morale . This type of climate does not arise out of a vacuum and on occasion is created by accident rather than deliberation . The prnh lem is to create it and to maintain it at a level conducive to the most effective learning .  | Important Factors Influencing Climate Certain factors seem to be very influential in creating climate . Among them are the kind of leader , the kind of framework in which the group operates and the purposes of the group . The Leader . As Hearn has pointed out in Chapter 2 , the group is important to the adolescent for in it he can work out his fears and confusions and gain support during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required . But the adult working with adolescents has two strikes on him before he gets started ; first , because he is an adult and for this reason generally rejected , and second , because by the very nature of his assignment he has a status role . The resolution of these two difficulties is somewhat interrelated . The kind of person the leader is and the kinds of understandings and skills he has and uses will have an impact on the way he handles the status aspects of his role . It has been shown that at least three types of social atmosphere can be deliberately created through the use of autocratic , democratic or laissez-faire leadership patterns . ' The resultant behaviors on the part of the participants in terms of aggression , submission , frustration , irritability and idleness on the one hand and friendliness , " we " feeling , individuality and self-direction and self-responsibility on the other indicate clearly that working with young people in our society requires both the understanding of and the working toward the creation of a democratic climate . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding , fair in decisions and judgments with limitless patience and faith in people sparked by a sense of humor . He must be able to let young people struggle with a problem and make decisions , yet know when to assist if direction is not sure , when required decisions are beyond the experience of the group and when probable consequences will be unrewarding . On the occasions when it becomes necessary to say , " No , that ca n't be done , " the important thing is not that an authoritarian decision has been made but rather what happens next . Is the situation handled so that the decision is accepted because of understanding or is it a matter of " I said it and that 's it . " footnote 11. ippilt , Ronald A. , and White . Ralph K. " The Social Climate ' of Children 's Groups " in Roger Barker : Jacob Kounin ; and Herbert Wright , Child Behavior and Development . New York : McGrawHIll Book Co. , 1943 , p. 485-508.  | The latter obviously is out of place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more important ? the time required for clarification or the learning of the group ? The Framework . The expertness or inexpertness of the leader may be modified by the type of situation within which the group must operate . For example , the master teacher who operates democratically may have slow going with a group which has known only authoritative action . It might take some time to develop an easy , friendly , working climate in a formal and rigid school which places emphasis on grades and on achievement scores in terms of national norms . The skilled recreation worker might find the group slow to attack problems in a framework based on laissez faire . In other words the climate in which the group operates will be affected by the larger situation . Not only will experiences of the group be different as it comes together , but also the expectancies of the individuals in the group must be taken into account . An adolescent who has not had experience may think the teacher who acts in a democratic way " easy , " " soft " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case needs skill , understanding and forbearance . His job will be much more difficult than in a situation which itself has a democratic climate . There are secondary schools and youth centers in which all activities are cooperatively planned by the administrators , the staff and the boys and girls . There are many others in which the job is done from the top down and doing what one is told to is the most commendable behavior . Because of the influence of the framework upon the climate of a group , those who are adherents of the democratic method do well to seek out others of like mind to do what may be done to change the climate of the total situation . The Purposefulness of the Group . As has been indicated , the democratic climate consists of more than sweetness and light . I f is , rather , an atmosphere conducive to good work and progress toward goals . A common goal or purpose which all share in developing and accept as their own is essential . The effect of the common goal on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in enthusiasm , zest and effort . For example , a group decided that it , . would like to go on a hike and " cook out . " Committees developed  | as if by magic , directions and locations were investigated , recipes and menus checked , recommendations cleared with families and the leader , the actual hike undertaken with purpose and hilarity , the food cooked and eaten with humor , appetite and satisfaction . High spirits held through the cleanup and the long haul home . Contrast this with a required class in physical education or in health education in which the group comes together not by choice , with a variety of purposes and with attitudes toward the class that range from eagerness to frustration . In the one instance the climate developed with ease while in the other there will undoubtedly be some problems encountered before the group finds a common interest . It should not be inferred that all voluntary groups automatically evolve a democratic climate , but rather that in required situations the leader must assume much more responsibility , plan much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisting the group to find a common base for action . It is not the " requirement " that creates resistance but the multiplicity of interests or " hidden agendas . " This brings out the need for considering the process through which group purposes are developed and plans made to attain them . The Process The use of group process in education is consistent with the concept of democracy as it is being interpreted today . Democracy is seen as a way of life which seeks to give every person his share in the making of the society to which he belongs . The classroom , the athletic field and the swimming pool may be the laboratories where practice of democratic principles has a priority rating . Through the medium of group process democracy may become an active reality in the lives of growing youth . Group process is exactly what its name implies , progressive activities carried out for , by and in a group . Each member is entitled to share and has responsibility for sharing in the planning and carrying out of the progressive activities . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steering committee for his own program . " The group process seeks to develop the many persons within its numbers toward a given goal without sacrificing  | the suggestions , ideas or abilities of any individual through neglect or intolerance . The process seeks to utilize the combined thinking of the group toward achieving purposes common to the interests of all within the group . These purposes change as the group learns and a change in plans is dictated by evaluation of the course of action being pursued . Preplanning Any teacher who wants boys and girls to learn in his classes plans in advance for this learning . There are differences , however , in the kind and scope of preplanning when group process is to be the method of work . The differences may be illustrated by the questions two teachers or leaders might phrase as a basis for advance planning . One might ask : What are the goals these boys or girls should achieve ? What activities are good for them ? What do they have to learn in this class ? How shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might ask : What do the students want and need from this program at this time ? What do they understand about their own capacities and limitations ? In what areas can there be freedom of choice ? What can they expect from the program and how can they get it ? What do they understand about the program and their relations to it ? Where are they in ability to plan , to share and to work together ? By the very nature of preplanning both of the leaders would obtain information about the adolescents who would comprise the group . In a school situation , they would probably review school and departmental records relating to medical examinations , illnesses , family background , mental and aptitude tests , cumulative and anecdotal records of course experiences and behaviors . It is after the data are reviewed that the paths in planning would begin to diverge . This divergence would be related to the basic beliefs of the leader concerning such statements as : democratic behavior arises out of opportunities to behave in democratic ways ; young people find security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions within the boundaries of their experience and maturity ; young people should have opportunities to become in , creasingly self-directing and to assume responsibility for the results  | of their actions ; young people should become increasingly aware of the nature and rate of their progress toward goals . Probably the key to the amount and kind of decisions made in advance by the teacher or leader rests upon his understanding of the actual maturity and experience of the group . He does as much prestructuring of the program , and only that much , as is necessary to get the group off to a good start . Some preplanning is a must . Effective leadership does not operate " off the cuff . " Adolescents have a right to information as to what the program is about and what their share in it is to be . This preplanning is obviously related to the climate and the factors which strongly influence it . Criteria for sound preplanning would include : 1 . Knowledge of the experience and expectancies of the boys and girls in the group . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Acceptance of the adolescent as a biosocial unifying and unique organism . 4 . Awareness of the relation of means to ends . 5 . Expertness in analysis and use of professional " tools . " 6 . Recognition that group progress is dependent upon the understanding and acceptance of goals . Setting Goals The degree of success which may be associated with the functioning of most youth groups appears to be determined by the range of planning and organizing they themselves do under proper guidance and counsel . The first step is a statement of goals . These goals are not dead-end purposes but show the direction in which the group is moving . They may be signposts toward a more remote but desirable aim . They must be real in the sense that there is possibility of successful attainment . Successful achievement leads to further effort toward larger aims . Goals should be flexible and should not impose limitations on group action if evaluation indicates they need to be changed . They must be constantly redetermined in the light of the progress made by the group in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any group should represent the thinking of the many and be evaluated continuously in terms of their benefit to the group and to the individuals in the group .  | In determining the goals for a group , especially in a group which is newly organized , the teacher plays an important role . Students without experience in the group process often need much help in thinking through group purposes , but as the group grows in ability to determine purposeful goals by itself , the teacher becomes less prominent . As the group grows in its ability to formulate its own worthwhile goals , it is a sign that its members have become more integrated and cooperative . The members of the group have grown in consideration of the welfare of the whole group membership and , as individuals have grown in self-discipline and control of impulses and desires , changes have taken place in those to whom participation in a group formerly meant aggressive leadership , frustration or submission . In the final analysis individuals can not become a group until they have been able to develop common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point the group begins to find a " we-ness " and basis for high morale that is increased as it moves toward the achievement of the goals set . This is true whether the goal is to run a table tennis tournament , to learn about mental health or to develop skill in football fundamentals . Making Plans Once the goal has been determined , then it becomes necessary to make plans to attain it . The question becomes : " What shall we do to reach the goal ? " Subsequent group action rather closely approximates the steps taken in problem-solving , in that there is a goal and there is an obvious need for a plan . The steps would include : 1 . Identifying and clarifying the problem or problems involved in the achievement of the goal . This would entail a sharpening of focus and analysis of the goal in order that members of the group have a clear understanding of what the goal actually is. 2 . Finding the facts that relate to the achievement of the goal . For example , it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what would appear to be the outlay required in terms of human energy , time and money . 3 . Applying the facts to the problem . It might be that the goal would need redefinition and further clarification as the group reviews - the various factors involved .  | 4 . Drawing conclusions . The group would consider the various aspects of the problem and the facts obtained , and would then begin to evolve procedures for a direct attack on the problem . 5 . Acting on conclusions . Committees are appointed . All individuals share in the action , and resources of the group are continually explored in light of the needs of the group . This is the trial period of the plan . 6 . Evaluating and replanning . Action is checked to see whether or not the group is moving toward the goal that prompted the plan in the first place . The listing of the steps may be somewhat confusing as in reality the lines are not sharply drawn . For example , judgments are being made and redirections proposed throughout the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the sixth step but rather a part of the larger whole of plan making . Steps 2 , 3 and 4 may be so closely related that it is difficult to distinguish where one begins and the other ends . While there undoubtedly is a starting point as well as an ending point for the action of the group toward a given goal , it should be noted that learning just does not happen that way . One of the problems imposed upon the leader or teacher is that of considering the on-going quality of learning and the fact that objectives of adolescents change as learning takes place . A physical education teacher reported the following as an example of the introduction to group process : A boys ' physical education class was having difficulty . John , James and three or four others wanted to play basketball every class period because they excelled in it . Tom and Joe and several others wanted to spend some time practicing the skills necessary for them to become good basketball players . The remainder of the class was more interested in learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this class be organized to fulfil the needs and desires of the students ? With only one gymnasium to work in , each must compromise . Yet each should have the opportunity to participate in the activity which was most meaningful to him . To meet this problem the teacher introduced group process . Progress in becoming a group with a unified purpose was slow and at times discouraging , but with faith in the ultimate realization of the group goals , he continued to encourage the boys to set up their own goals for class activities . In doing this , the students learned that some of their individual goals had to be redirected to fit in with the goals of the group . Slowly the class developed some con-  | cepts of democratic living , cooperation , sharing and consideration of the rights and privileges of others . The planning process includes the participation of all the members of the group . It involves a consideration of the wants and the abilities of group members . It requires that recognition be given to the various roles or jobs involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus be clear . This type of process makes it necessary for the members of the group to assume responsibility for communicating their ideas to the group and for moving the group ahead . In the beginning an inexperienced group will require time to learn to work together . This involves group discussion . All members should gain sufficient confidence in the group to be able to participate effectively . This means that each person should be aware of the characteristics of good group discussion if it is to bring about the group interaction and integration needed to achieve the group goals . These characteristics are requisite to satisfactory growth of the group members : 1 . Participants should attempt to keep the discussion centered around the problem being discussed . 2 . Participants should make their contributions brief . 3 . Members of a group should be willing to listen , to consider seriously the contributions of others . 4 . Individuals should attempt to be sensitive to the group process or operation in order that they may help to solve problems by performing various roles as needed . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . 6 . Participants should maintain an objective attitude toward other personalities in the group . 7 . Members should be willing to subordinate personal motives to that which is best for the group as a whole . 8 . Individual members should be willing to compromise if they can do so without sacrificing values . 9 . The members of the group should be willing to apply selfanalysis to determine their own growth in ability to be a worthy member in and of the group . Carrying Out Plans The way in which plans are carried out may well be the most rewarding as well as the most revealing aspect of group process .  | At this stage the effectiveness of the plan is demonstrated and the ability of the group members to assign and accept responsibilities is shown . The kinds of jobs individuals volunteer to undertake or are asked to undertake also reveal the degree to which the group and its members have moved toward accepting the reality of differences and the qualities needed for a particular assignment . If the individuals have become a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion or aggression toward the plans . There will be critical evaluation of them , however . Members of the group recognize that the success or failure is in a large measure dependent upon the way in which every member performs his part in the whole . Each member of the group is responsible for contributing to the success of the entire project . Evaluating and Replanning In a real learning situation evaluation is concerned with more than a consideration of the end product . As a matter of fact , evaluation gets underway the first time the group meets . Conclusions are formed and judgments made throughout the whole process . The goals are discussed and challenged in the light of the views of the group members , each step in the planning is subject to variation and change as the group grows . This continuous checking can assist the group in its movement toward the larger goals which may not be clear in the beginning . Here the development of all within the group may become of more importance than achievement by the few , as the group explores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person a share in the making of the society to which he belongs . " That this same society or group , as it were , should not seek to stifle the opportunities for expression of those who possess unusual abilities and skill is a challenge which can be met by continuous evaluation and replanning . The group must become cognizant in its discussions that not only is the achievement of its goals important , but also the media and activities utilized in achieving the goals need evaluation . A group should not be satisfied with the attainment of specific goals , but should be continuously in the process of growth toward achieving more worthwhile ones . This leads to replanning and further action .  | The Participation The group process may be said to be functioning well when each member assumes responsibility for the success of the group activity . This acceptance of responsibility by the individual may necessitate assuming consciously or unconsciously the roles which he can best perform . These roles will vary for each individual from time to time and , as group members become skilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducive to promoting and facilitating better discussion and more creative thinking by the other members of the group . The Status Leader The most versatile participant in the group process should be the teacher or leader ; the leader , who by the very nature of his job responsibility , has a status role . This is particularly important in getting the group under way . He should be resourceful , calm , tactful , gracious , forceful and level-headed . He must have quickness of apprehension , depth of comprehension , breadth of sympathy and a sense of humor . He must be able to assume , as the situation demands , the roles of coordinator , opinion seeker , encourager , evaluator or critic . His participation in the group process is the result of reflective study of the group 's problems and needs , consideration of possible ways of meeting these needs and solving these problems , and establishing inner vision to light the pathway toward purposeful goals . The status leader 's role will change as the group develops under standing of the group process and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed by the teacher or chairman to initiate and perpetuate the group process in the class . Some of the duties which will need to be performed by the leader in the early stages of development of group discussion will be : 1 . To open the discussion with a brief statement of the problem and to stimulate contributions by directing questions to the group . 2 . To summarize or reformulate contributions to give the group tine. to rethink the point made . 3 . To supply illustrations when a member of the group states a principle .  | and to generalize when a member of the group gives specific illustrations to provide time and opportunity for understanding . 4 . To give recognition for each contribution made . 5 . To emphasize aspects of the various contributions significant to the thought . 6 . To interpret and integrate diverse contributions . 7 . To meet the pauses that sometimes occur by asking pertinent questions to stimulate discussion . 8 . To interpret and integrate from time to time and at the end of the discussion . 9 . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to monopolize. 10 . To insist that members of the group speak in voices which can be heard by all . 11 . To prevent emotional clashes and harmonize incipient conflicts . 12 . To state clearly the decision reached in the solution of the specific problem under discussion . ' Other Leaders As the group develops skill in solving its problems by the group process , the members can assume many of the functions performed by the teacher in the initiation of the method . The group may elect its own chairman and delegate the status leader to the role of participating member . However , the teacher may still need to assume the leader role from time to time . The Resource Person In solving a problem or planning a class activity through the group process , the occasion may arise when the members of the group are not experienced enough to solve the problem by themselves . Then it is that the teacher assumes the role of the resource person ; another person who is an expert in a particular field might be called into the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this capacity . The resource person is one who is able to contribute information or other assistance as the need for it arises in the group . footnote 2 Heffernan , Helen . 7'rc/rnique 7'o Be . Used in Solving an Educational Problem by the Discussion Method . Sacrruuenlo , Calif. : Stale Department of Education , 1944.  | Other Roles In the operation of group process , it is usually helpful to have a group recorder whose duties are to keep a written record of the progress of the group and to assist during discussion by restatement of the problem and by summarizing contributions pertinent to the problem . The records may be kept as elaborately or as simply as the group wishes . When a group becomes conscious of its ways of working together and a desire develops to improve , the use of an observer often helps it to define the specific ways in which it needs to improve . The person filling the role of observer is freed from involvement in what is happening to give full attention to how it is happening . Observers ' reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles , how group members filled various other roles , frequently serve to clarify for individuals and for the group better ways to accomplish what they want to do . The members of the group have various roles or responsibilities to perform in the utilization of the discussion method as a learning technique . Individuals will be needed to suggest new ideas or different ways of approaching a problem , to ask for clarification of facts which are authoritative about the problem or to evaluate the group accomplishment or proposals in terms of certain criteria . Members can learn to assume these various roles as they develop in ability to participate in group thinking and planning . The group process , if used correctly , should not provide an outlet for the individual who endeavors to satisfy some personal need which is not pertinent to the group functioning or the group purpose . Such individual roles as those performed by the aggressive individual who expresses general disapproval of all plans , the opposition booster who adopts a negative , opposing attitude without reason , the attention seeker who calls attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominating individual and the special interest advocate have no place in the group process . These boys and girls should be encouraged to take a less selfish and more democratic attitude toward the group thinking and discussions . They should not be ignored if good human relations . are to be maintained , but should be utilized for whatever special  | contributions they can make to the group purposes and encouraged to identify themselves more with the group . As group members gain in competence and confidence they will assume a variety of group roles . They will also gain in recognition of the roles taken by various members and become increasingly sensitive to such contributions . The Outcomes Advocates of group process consider that it fosters specific values conducive to worthy membership in a democratic society . Recognizing as it does the dignity , worth and talents of each individual in the group , it is a process containing values basic to democratic living . Some of the values accruing from the group process are as follows : 1 . It awakens a sense of responsibility toward others and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual can contribute to the solution of problems according to his ability and experience . 3 . People can recognize and solve problems together more effectively than can one individual . 4 . The individual is enabled to develop the fullest realization of his potentialities through the encouragement of self-direction. 5 . The exchange of ideas between group members results in progress both quantitatively and qualitatively . 6 . It presents avenues for greatest satisfaction of personal and group needs such as sense of belongingness , recognition and achievement . 7 . Decisions are more rapidly accepted and result in more effective action when they evolve through group interaction . 8 . Human relations in all areas from family to world organization can function on a higher level through group interaction . 9 . It is one of the most successful methods in creating situations through which learning takes place . ' Planning for Adolescents Many teachers and leaders throughout the country have developed ways in which they work for and with young people . In planning footnote Group Values Committee . Values of Group Process . Summer Workshop , University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Permission to reprint granted by Ilr . Carl Haven Young , Chairman of the Department of Physical Education , University of California , Los Angeles .  | programs for adolescents there is background work which must be done with administrators , parents and the community as a whole , if understanding and support are to be gained and extended . The planning for boys and girls being considered here is not so much the advance planning done by teacher or leader in preparation for meeting a group ; it is the planning which may be done to insure a more democratic framework in which particular groups operate . The cooperative planning of administrators , staff , parents , expert consultants and lay citizens is required to develop this democratic framework . Those who actually teach and lead adolescents are immeasurably helped to lead their groups toward democratic outcomes when they themselves are participants in democratic planning of all concerned with meeting the needs of adolescents . A School-Community Recreation Program There are many opportunities for the development of more democratic human relations through a school-community recreation program and there is evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more individuals participate in the project . This is another indication that common goals and group centered action can serve as powerful incentives to democratic action in the larger sense . The Advisory Committee . Where the school and community are jointly responsible for a recreation program for all age groups , the utilization of an advisory committee has been found most helpful . These committees are composed of adults representing a crosssection of the community . Such a committee serves in an advisory capacity to the staff people directly responsible for the recreation program . Community recreation advisory committees can assist greatly with the problem of meeting the needs and interests of the community . These groups , by and large , are much closer to a situation than are boards of education or other civic authorities who have broader and wider responsibilities demanding their attention . These committees will not only observe more clearly the needs eat the community in terms of specific phases of the program but will also relieve other municipal boards of much time-consuming activit required in the development and promotion of the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism of advisory committees are rather simple . The committee may advise directly a superintendent of schools or other executive bodies on matters concerning the program ; or it may submit recommendations indirectly through the director or assistant director of recreation , who in turn would pass such recommendations on to the official civic authorities . The advantages of pursuing the advisory committee plans are obvious . Those responsible for the recreation program are benefiting as a result of recommendations made , and at the same time the community can realize its part in the development of a suitable recreation program . Community and school relations are developed on a higher plane and there is better understanding among all groups . Utilizing Lay Resources . School-community relations can be measurably improved and developed through lay participation in planning and conducting programs . There is usually a great deal of talent lying dormant within a community which comes to life only upon request . Surveys and investigations will usually result in the discovery of resources which had never been tapped . These resources , when wisely used , will develop and enrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases those who possess such talents and skills are most willing to be of service to the community through serving as leaders or resource people . Volunteer lay leaders can and will be of invaluable assistance in furthering the program providing that they are familiar with the purposes , policies and procedures and understand their part in the whole . This orientation should be carefully planned and carried out through group action . As individuals contribute to the project through the investment of their own time and energy they seem to develop a belongingness that results in strong and well rounded support for the school-community program . Not only should the assistance of individuals be utilized , but the support and active aid of various community groups and organizations should be sought . Such groups already have a rallying point or purpose common to the members of the group . Here again it is possible to add a larger goal that makes for " we-ness " in the corn-  | community as a whole personnel in developing a broader and more meaningful school-community recreation program . These various organizations through group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid in ways not possible of accomplishment by the individual . They can assist with large scale projects because of the representativeness of their membership . Not only the recreation program but the entire community will gain through the action of a variety of groups toward the accomplishment of a common goal . Staff Operations . The importance attached to the part the professional staff plays in developing and maintaining better human relations is beyond exaggeration . Experience alone supplies the answer as to the value of a capable staff personnel . One poorly trained , uninterested staff member can break down more favorable relations in one day than a dozen well-trained staff members can build up in a month . Human relations in the field of recreation can best be built up by those responsible for the program through a sincere interest in the participants and the kind and quality of service rendered . The personality and attitude of the leader toward other individuals under his or her supervision are most important . It must ever be remembered that in the field of recreation participation is largely voluntary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to this field . The enjoyment which results from recreational activities , along with the opportunity for a more fruitful use of leisure time , provide a base from which professional personnel can lead toward better human relations . However , another base also is required . All staff members sharing in over-all planning of the program which they are expected to carry out leads to personal commitment , enthusiasm and effort for the success of plans . It is part of developing the democratic framework in which they serve as leaders of youth . The Youth Groups . People of all ages enjoy the experiences and satisfaction of self and group accomplishment . The need for assisting in some way to solve problems , complete projects , build and conduct programs and assume important responsibilities is inherent  | in most individuals . Particularly in the area concerned with young adults and teen-agers is it important that this feeling of " self doing " take root . Youth organizations and youth center groups in particular are very much concerned with their part in being responsible for the conduct and organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel and the participants will exist in situations where there is cooperation and where the program is definitely identified with the participants and not with an overzealous professional staff . Guidance is necessary with all age groups . However , a supporting behind-the-scenes type of assistance that comes forward as needed will be more acceptable and consequently more helpful to youth . The planning of particular programs , election of officers , setting up of rules and regulations and other activities concerned with the administration and conduct of the program should be shared responsibilities of leader and group . This democratic procedure is of value to all concerned . In order for youth programs to be successful , it is necessary to have such programs based on sound educational principles and objectives . The youth center , for example , must be more than a hand-out . There must be a challenging program , diversified in its activities so that the needs and interests of a maximum number of participants will be met . Groups which function on a democratic basis will move toward developing and maintaining better human relations among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondary School Situation Many secondary schools have set up curriculum councils , composed of administrators and staff members , which guide and coordinate the work of many other groups in planning for the various areas included in the curriculum . Some schools include students in all planning groups at all levels . The trend is away from the general telling the colonel what to do , the colonel telling the lieutenant , the lieutenant telling the sergeant and the sergeant telling the private who does the job . The development is toward fulfilling the ideal that " all who have a share in carrying out plans should have a share in making them . " The teacher who believes in using p 300 democratic methods in the classroom is immeasurably sustained and supported by the use of democratic methods throughout the school . The Administrator Needs to Know . Even in situations that involve all staff members in goal setting , in making and carrying out plans , there is need for reporting and interpreting the results of stock-taking in particular programs . Sharing works both ways . As a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher made a practice of submitting regular reports to him . In one of these reports after outlining in brief the activities and organization of the physical education program she made these comments : 1 . 203 ( 77% ) of a total of 263 girls in school have taken part in the after school program in which 229 intramural games have been played . 91 girls ( 38% ) have had opportunity to meet and play with girls from other schools . 20 girls made letters this year . 2 . Team play , team work , cooperation and loyalty have been developed . Relaxation , fun , friends , have contributed to personality integration . We believe that our program builds new interests and skills as a barrier against delinquency . Our girls who are interested in athletics are not our " problems . " Rather our problem is how to reach all girls with an " interest . " 3 . As you suggested , the real proof of growth in poise and an understanding of the body as an expression of the real self may best be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . 4 . Leaders have done a magnificent job for the benefit of all girls in Oneida and show individually the value and power of their preparation and experience . They have been an inspiration . 5 . You might be interested to know that 220 outside-of-school hours for clerical work have gone behind this year 's job in physical education . 6 . The cadet teachers tend to give breadth to our program possibilities and I believe we give them very valuable experience . 7 . Our big softball sportsday at Oneida in which 7 schools participated is a joy to all of us . You would have been proud of the job the Oneida girls did in organizing and carrying through their plans . 8 . Spring festival " peaks " the inside work . Thank you for your cooperation . Please feel free to make suggestions for improvement . ' Parents Need To Share , Too . Probably the largest potential community contribution parents make lies in their understanding and footnote Excerpt hum report of Dorothea 7 ) eitz to Principal , Oneida ' a hoot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A part of this understanding and guidance rests upon what they know and support in the school program . In reviewing the report which follows it might be said that it is only an example of good public relations technique . So it is , if by that is meant the utilizing of a variety of ways to let people know about the program and then working toward a sharing of ideas and plans . This report to parents was mimeographed in a two-column folder with an attractive frontispiece . The results were good in that parents raised questions and made suggestions . The students seemed pleased not only at the idea of the report but also at the response of their families . Oneida " Can Do " in Sports We are all agreed on one thing ? Americans want " the best " in education for their youngsters . But what will they need most , 10 or 25 years hence ? If every branch of the armed services for both men and women used sports as both morale builders and body conditioners , you can be pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two respects in our school program too . Can you think of any better way to buy insurance against juvenile delinquency ? Can you name many good athletes who turned into delinquents ? Did you ever hear of 75 to 90 youngsters staying , voluntarily , an hour after school day after day for anything other than athletics ? ( If we had two gyms we could keep twice this number both interested and busy ? off the streets , loath to go home . ) Why ? Because youngsters like " to do " ? but they have to know how . Our plan in sports is to build a broad intramural program which offers both a choice of activity , and also a challenge for all levels of performance , so that every youngster can play , with some chance of success , in competition graded to his level of ability . Then , to challenge those " top performers we like to run invitation games with " Honor teams " from some neighboring school . This kind of after school program , presupposes a sound daily instructional period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more pleasure he gets from the game . ( Judge yourself by your proficiency in either bridge or golf and the resultant pleasure from either . ) Consequently our policy is to teach skills , scoring , rules , etc. , during the class periods and then organize for each grade in this after-school program . For example , this fall Oneida boys and girls played 72 games in volleyball ; 3 leagues for boys , 3 leagues for girls , and a championship team for each . Then we  | picked the " honor team " players for the games with our neighbors . This same system goes on for each of the seasonal periods ( 2 months each ) during the entire school year ; every season has its own sports . Boys and girls who participate accumulate points toward their school letter which is awarded at the end of their third year of competitive participation . You as parents have a right to insist that your programs in physical education really produce for your children . What products ? A strong efficient body , stamina and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans kill 40,000 people annually by " mistakes " in driving ) , specific techniques for wholesome recreation , opportunities for social contacts , and training in leadership . These we try to give you at Oneida . Your child " can do " ? how well , will depend on how soon you give us that basic daily period , and the space we need to do the job right . " Can you ? " It is a pleasure to add that as we go to press , plans are under way to enlarge the scope and range of activity at Oneida . Working with Adolescents An example of group planning in which an attempt was made to provide for the variety of interests in a class group is illustrated by the following situation . A Boy ' Activity Gass A group of ninth-grade boys was selected by their classmates to serve on the preplanning committee for the indoor season of the physical education program . They meet with Mr. Johnson , the physical education teacher . The beginning discussion might run something like this : Jim : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Since we 've just finished ten weeks of soccer should we limit ourselves to another team game ? " Joe : " But we need a chance to practice basketball . After soccer a basketball will feel so different . " Fred : " Yeah . . . I could n't even make a basket right now . " Art : " I 'd like to do something besides basketball all the timehow about some conditioning exercises ? " Mr. Johnson : " We did n't spend much time on conditioning prior to soccer and basketball is another game involving running . What about all-round body development- - are there other activities that should be considered ? "  | Fred : " We could do some tumbling or some apparatus but we 'd sure need some warm-ups and conditioning . " Joe : " Maybe we could do some basketball drills along with the warm-ups . " Mr. Johnson : " Those are good ideas . What about badminton or some other activity you can do out of school . . . how should we divide up the class time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think we ought to spend some time learning to dance better . . . the freshman dance is coming up ? it 's no fun being a dope . " Art : " And maybe we could get the girls ' class so we could have partners . " Joe : " It 's sissy stuff ? but if you guys want to ? O.K. . . . we 'd still have four days for other stuff like basketball . " Fred : " How about tumbling and badminton ? " Jim : " Maybe we could start with warm-ups and conditioning every day . " Mr. Johnson : " How would it be to spend 15 or 20 minutes at the beginning of class on conditioning and skills practice . Then if we divide into squads , by using the short courts we could rotate squads . Two would play basketball , two would play badminton , and the rest could work on tumbling . Intramural basketball and badminton would provide for additional practice and playing time for anyone who signs up . Squad leaders would be responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could do this for four weeks and by then we 'd know what to plan for the rest of the season . " Art : " Sounds O.K. to me . We 'd all get a chance to do something that we want to do and we could change it if it did n't work . " Mr. Johnson was aware that basketball and other team sports had been emphasized in the school , and further that the community was interested in the team activities . He wanted to satisfy the wishes of the students to play basketball but in addition wanted them to experience a broader program of physical education . He had found out that authoritative planning did n't work so he had turned to group process in order to get more cooperation and sharing of ideas in the group . Since some class members had experience in other activities and liked them some variety was suggested . Further discussions centered about the size of the class , the best way to organize groups within the class so that each person could have an equal opportunity to participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be interested in learning to dance or to play badminton or to tumble , how leaders might be selected , etc . This was done so that a constructive plan could be  | presented to the entire group for consideration and changes or additions made according to the group needs or wishes . When the plan was presented to the large group , the class agreed to try it for the four weeks suggested . Warm-up and skill activities were to be combined wherever possible . Squad leaders were to be chosen by the class and all class members were to sign up for the squad of their own choice . The maximum number on a squad was to be 8 so that all members would have an opportunity to play each time the squad played basketball . In badminton , a rotation system was worked out so that players rotated on the court with a new person replacing a player after each four points made . In this way , the group felt that more equal opportunities to participate would be given to all class members . Dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate at the same time . However , the squad idea proved helpful in designating partners for dancing , particularly at the beginning of class since the girls ' classes also were organized on a squad basis . The boys in squad number 1 were to dance with the girls in the girls ' squad number 1 , squad number 2 with 2 . The next week , boys ' squad number 1 would dance with girls ' squad number 2 , the next week with number 3 , etc . Squad leaders were to learn how to direct tumbling activities , including safety precautions necessary such as spotting , and to assist in refereeing games . At the end of the three weeks the class as a whole met to evaluate the program . The group expressed the opinion that too many activities were being offered in one week and that it would be wiser to concentrate working on these activities in units . However , the majority wanted to continue with the social dancing for one period a week . It was agreed that the warm-up and skills practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . The combination of basketball and tumbling was to continue . Badminton was to be omitted and a three-week period was to be set aside before the end of the 10-week season for a unit on badminton skills and techniques . Additional time would be utilized in the intramural program for practice in playing the game . The group recognized the fact that badminton skills were important and requested additional time for a movie and expert demonstration over and above class time . Other areas than the one described in the above example offer opportunities for the utilization of the group process in the physical education field . A dance class is often requested to participate in assembly or other school or community programs . For example , folk dance class is requested to participate in a program . The group ,  | in order to make an effective appearance , must meet together to plan the dances most suitable for presentation , the personnel of the group taking part , the costumes to be worn , the most effective arrangements necessary , and the like . The presentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of human relations and international understanding . Few people can actually participate in dances without becoming more tolerant and appreciative of other cultures . Activities such as folk , square and ballroom dancing are essentially social . The group process could therefore tend to break down many of the tensions of the adolescent level by helping , through these activities , to make adjustments to members of the opposite sex a casual and expected experience . This will tend to help students to have a happier and more healthful outlook on life . The planning of other extraclass activities such as the intramural program , field trips , joint youth and adult recreation programs are further areas in which the group process in physical education can be used . Some teachers in schools , rejecting group process methods give as a reason the heavy teaching loads they carry . These teachers are wont to say , " It is all right at the college level ; students are more mature and the numbers a teacher has to deal with are not so large . " " It 's fine on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some other teachers have surmounted these very real difficulties , first by believing that saving time by telling students what to do instead of helping them decide what to do does not make authoritarian methods good enough ; second , by perfecting the organization of the program so that students especially prepared for the jobs share leadership responsibilities . An outline is presented which was made by a teacher for preparing students for assigned leadership jobs : The leaders come from the rank and file of class members who have demonstrated self-responsibility , cooperation , teamwork , selfdirection , desirable individual choices and work patterns , and who come closest to the behavior for best human relations , who have competency in one or more of the physical activities in the program . Leaders may be selected in a number of ways : by group vote , by arbitrary choice determined by a special ability , by rotation  --  - different one for each activity or sports season ,  | by expressed desire for such experience and with qualifications , by a rating scale for those qualities considered most important by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . Experience in effective planning for reaching goals . 2 . Methods of organization and presentation of the activities through which goals are attained . 3 . Techniques for getting groups under way , for getting attention and maintaining interest of members within a small group . 4 . Ways to work with a slow learner . 5 . Space-plans for practicing skills and playing of games ( usually by duplicator , ditto machine or mimeograph ) . 6 . Psychological " tips " on widening opportunities for self-direction , service and satisfaction for both classmates and self . 7 . Short cuts to efficient organization for intramural programs ( developed through the democratic process ) : a . Schedule for field and courts with the games schedule . b . Previous knowledge of pinny or shirt teams and direction of goal or basket . c . Assignment of referees and umpires by system of rotation to avoid delay . d . Rotation order for timers ? and foreknowledge of length of playing period . e . Direction of moving on and off field and courts to save confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . 8 . Duties of team captains and assistant captains . 9 . Methods of scoring , officiating and checking of equipment . 10 . Make-up of schedules and tournaments . 11 . Methods of representing the group ; sensitivity to needs . 12 . Practice in becoming articulate . 13 . Methods and plans for conducting discussions . 14 . Essentials of accurate correspondence and minutes . 15 . Self-evaluation as leaders ? ratings . 16 . Extras for enrichment of their own program ; leaders ' trips and conferences with other schools . Actual experience in leadership will of necessity begin slowly for new members of the leaders ' corps and should always be provided carefully so that success is assured . For example , a new leader may work as an assistant to a more experienced leader or in a simple skill situation when the primary purpose is " warm-up " and a " feel of the . fingers on the ball . " With increasing experience comes additional  | range of service . Can the teen-ager be entrusted with responsibility ? Is he willing to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be of service to the group and watch him grow in poise and stature , and begin to feel the possibilities of his contribution to the future . Adeptness in democratic human relations can be vitally interesting ! The teacher is now a leader and has time to move freely among the group , guiding in actual face-to-face situations , keeping a balance on individual choice and group pressures and increasing awareness on the part of each student of his own relationships with his fellows . The health education , physical education and recreation activities which are organized democratically are more difficult to carry out than is the traditional type of class . The group process is slow until students acquire skill in it . Students will be hesitant at first to give creative expression to their activities . However , the democratic teacher or leader is rewarded by seeing adolescents grow and develop as their needs and wants are met and satisfied . Watching boys and girls move toward developing democratic relations with others is ample reward to the teacher or leader who believes in group process as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and EWBANK , HENRY .

This means stock-taking at the beginning , numerous appraisals along the way and final estimates of progress made . Evaluation is three dimensional in a time sense ; it takes place concurrently with setting goals , planning and carrying out plans ; it takes place whenever the group feels a need to pause and see how far it has come in achieving stated ends ; it takes place when a project is completed or a problem solved . It is difficult for some persons to understand how all the steps in group process operate continuously , yet in actuality this occurs . good comparison is that of the earth rotating on its axis at the same time that it moves in a definite orbit around the sun . The general goals of a group will prescribe the direction the group wishes to go , but within that prescribed path there is a daily recasting of specific objectives , replanning and acting . Evaluation accompanies each phase of the daily operations as well as the over-all process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ways in which some of the outcomes of health education , physical education and recreation may be investigated and interpreted . The more quantitative aspects of evaluation dealing with program outcomes such as increased health knowledge , accuracy in archery or participation in a greater variety of recreational pursuits will be considered only as they relate to outcomes in the area of human relations .  | Some teachers and leaders may recall when evaluation was really simple . In physical education , for example , there was a time when students stood in straight rows and responded to commands and each lesson was evaluated by two criteria , precision and perspiration . Now it is not so simple for we are concerned with what happens to the individual in relation to " living " goals . Evaluation in this larger sense is conceived to be that part of the learning process in which the adolescent shares with the leader the responsibility for looking at , checking on and drawing conclusions from his direction , his progress and his behavior in relation to the goals which were agreed upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form judgments sooner or later and such judgments may be sound or unsound depending upon the basis upon which they are formulated . The job is to select or devise instruments or techniques which may serve as a basis for reasonable judgments . These judgments are the interpretations of where the group is , how far it has gone and how it operated . They may range from judgments formed through a study of mean scores to those based on the candid reports that the student makes at his own dinner table . While the judgments formed on the basis of a student 's comments at home might ultimately affect the program he was discussing , the problem of more immediate concern is what happened to the student himself . What did he know , how did he behave , how did he interpret the changes in himself ? Were the changes in keeping with his wants and with social needs ? Was he able to see the consequences of his own acts ? Was he able to appraise the progress of the group and his own progress with a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of learn ing as well as to the process through which learning takes pia ( e , They indicate recognition that the student does his own learning and , further , that evaluation is not something that is done to him . Evaluation is shared . Setting up Criteria for Evaluating Literally , evaluating means deciding the worth of some actiony thing or process . It is the assigning of value or lack of value in.  | some degree . Obviously , the assignment of value or worth has to be done in the light of some criteria on which to base a judgment . The way in which criteria for evaluating are derived from goals in group process is not always clearly understood . It is also not always apparent why criteria set up by one group will not be the same as those derived by another , even when both groups have the same general aims . It is essential to see how criteria for evaluating are derived from goals . Let us say that the general goals of a bowling club in a teen center have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowling tournament for the center In order to move toward achieving these aims the members of the bowling club will need to know where they are in their ability to bowl and where they are in their ability to organize and run a tournament . In the initial appraisal each goal is analyzed to deduce and list the knowledge , skills and understandings entering into the abilities involved . These might be listed as : To improve ability to bowl knowledge of rules skill in bowling To run a bowling tournament knowledge of suitable tournament forms knowledge of tournament scoring understanding how to assign responsibility skill in organizing committees skill as a participating member of a committee skill in umpiring From among the items listed in this first analysis of what elements make up the goals they wish to attain , a given group sets up its specific objectives according to the needs of that group . Needs change as planning and carrying out plans to attain the objectives go on ; objectives are changed when needs change . Carrying the bowling club example a bit further may help make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed , its members did not know how to bowl nor did they know the rules . But that was a year ago , and they have progressed in skill and in knowledge of the rules . The objectives now set call for more definitive knowledge  | and skills of a higher level . The needs have changed and the objectives have changed . In other words , the analysis of goals into specifics does not take place once for all at the beginning , but is repeated as learning occurs and new needs are understood . In several instances the need for clarification of goals and specifically in the statement of objectives has been mentioned . It has been pointed out that this careful statement of purposes and steps involved in attainment is an essential prerequisite to effective learning , in that there is less waste motion in getting under way and in knowing what to do next . Attention has also been given to the fact that the goals change as progress is made just as the bowler changes his objective from trying to hit the head pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These objectives also indicate what is to be evaluated . For example , criteria of the bowlers might be stated as skill in hitting the pocket , picking off the 1-3-7 spare or sharpening a hook rather than knocking down more pins . The how should be involved or implicit in the objective or criterion . Criteria for evaluating how the group is operating are set up through the same type of analysis as that described for bowling . When and if the group sets a goal for itself such as " good discussions , " " being effective as leaders , " " being a productive committee member , " each of these will be analyzed to see what the group needs to do to improve and the ways defined become the criteria for evaluating progress . Techniques for Evaluating Many techniques are now available for use in evaluating . They range from the simple to the complex , from the objective to the subjective and from written tests to observations of game skills and social behaviors . Techniques range from those designed for use in the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this objective really pertinent to the goal ? " The former probably would be applicable to work with adolescents only to the extent that they accepted participation in an experimental study as a goal or to the extent that such study was in keeping with the goals previously determined . The problem is to choose or devise instruments that will meet  | the needs of the group at a given time , in a given situation and in terms of the purposes that group has accepted . This means the selection of those techniques which will provide best the information required . For example : a rules test in basketball is not indicative of game ability . Nor will it give information as to skills in human relations or social behaviors . On the other hand , an instrument designed to appraise strategy in a game situation may also point to certain personality traits and to attitudes toward others . Likewise , techniques designed to estimate behavior toward others , positions in the group , fulfilment of the leader role and the like may be of aid to the leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy . Another aspect of selection has to do with the applicability of the techniques in terms of time and resources . Sometimes the best instrument in terms of a given criterion may not be usable in a given situation because the group is too large or it is beyond the understanding of the group . The actual clock time required for explaining , discussing , understanding and using the instrument may be more than the group can afford to devote to it in terms of other objectives to be evaluated . This factor in selecting techniques might be more simply stated as , " Do n't bite off more than can be chewed , " but rather stick to the essential and assist the youngsters in deciding upon those essentials . This involves the role of the leader as a resource person . Techniques should also be selected in the light of group interests . A part of the group might be vitally interested in evidence of their individual growth toward a given goal while the others might give evidence of complete boredom at the very idea . The reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal , lack of acceptance of the goal by a part of the group , the instrument itself might not be understood or might not be related to the goal which had been accepted . A further factor might be that the goal accepted might not be suitable for the group , in the sense that it might be beyond the ability of the group to achieve . Obviously an instrument devised to check progress toward such a goal would also be unsuitable . This is another aspect of the need to be sure that the goals set are realistic and possible of attainment .  | Finally , in some areas if the leader waits to select only those techniques that are known to have what is called reliability , few if any selections will be made . The reasons are two-fold , first , a reliable instrument does not yet exist , or second , if one is available it is too complicated to use in the ordinary group or class situation . The requirements for special equipment , the numbers to be tested at a given time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve to make the instrument an unwise or impossible selection . The leader can not afford to wait . The group is there and in action . The goals have been determined and the objectives set . It is the job of the leader or the teacher to work with the group in selecting or devising as sound an instrument as can be obtained . While he will work as always within the framework of his own best understanding of need and direction , it should be clear that his recommendations must be based on fact rather than " feel . " Sensitivity in or to a group is not enough . The leader must assume responsibility for a continuing review of research in his own and related fields in order that the evaluation procedures will be as sound as current knowledge can make them . In any event , findings derived from an " unproved " instrument should be interpreted with caution . The members of the group should understand the limitations and should consider the findings in the nature of clues which will entail further study , analysis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques is presented on the assumption that teachers and leaders will make use of the variety of tests that are usable in their fields as well as collect general background information that is available about the adolescents concerned . Among these would be skill tests , knowledge tests , data from health examinations , family histories and other cumulative data from the counselor 's office , school or department records . Such data may on occasion provide the verification needed in order to interpret the findings of the techniques to be described . Observers ' Reports The effective leader or teacher is continuously involved in observation and in drawing conclusions concerning the behavior observed  | The anecdotal report is an example of the effort to objectify such observations . It is concerned primarily with the behavior of an individual and used serially as a basis for interpretation can be most helpful , particularly as the process and findings are shared with the individual concerned . This technique to be sound should be carefully planned . Decisions as to what is to be observed , how much and how it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this is the fact that judgments will be made in the light of some value system , and for this reason it is advisable to clarify thinking as to the purpose of each observation and the criteria involved . The health teacher in relation to studies in nutrition may encounter problems that make it advisable to observe and record behaviors incident to the school lunch program . The coach concerned with the need for more hits and runs will observe and analyze movement ; for example , in batting and base running . Some teachers have found that students can also develop individual records with profit in terms of increased acuity in observation , and heightened incentive . The role of the leader is to aid in interpretation and to assist the student in doing something about the behavior observed . This observer technique is now applied for the purpose of assisting the group to recognize the influence of behavior on process , on the effectiveness of discussion and carrying out plans . The observer 's report in this instance would include a description of climate or " feeling tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other roles . The report should emphasize process rather than content and serve as a review of how the group operated . Even the simple observer 's report requires that the observer have some preparation and competence . The following are important facets of this role : He must be able to " see " what goes on in the group and to record it . This means that he must recognize the possible impact of his own needs on what he is able to observe and record . He must recognize that the " feed back " must be adapted to the level of the group to which he is reporting . He must be able to start with group operation and as security is gained the experienced observer may move toward reporting member roles . He must indicate progress or lack of it as indicated by getting
