When the company arrived in Manhattan last week for a return visit , Director Ninette de Valois made a politely deprecatory little speech . " We may not be as good as you remember us , " she said . " Perhaps we have come back too soon . " She had impressive evidence to the contrary . When the golden curtain at the Met fell on the ballet 's brilliant opening-night performance of Swan Lake this week , the packed house and the critics seemed unanimous . Sadler 's Wells with its faun-eyed Prima Ballerina Margot Fonteyn , its crack corps de ballet and its handsome staging , was every bit as good as remembered . <P> If the company was still in doubt about its second U.S. reception , there were other , more substantial assurances .
