The peaceable-looking third-base rookie for the Valdosta ( Ga . ) Tigers was puzzled . Every time he came to bat , opposing pitchers seemed anxious to hit him in the head . He wondered if his manager had noticed . " Sure , " said that helpful gentleman . " If I played against you I 'd do the same thing . You just look like a guy who ought to be knocked down . " <P> Last week , in the sleeveless flannels of a Cincinnati Redleg , Donald Albert Hoak , 29 , was the man whom opposing National League pitchers wished most they could knock down . He was near the top of the National League with a .358 batting average , running the bases with happy belligerence , and defending third base with almost errorless skill . Cincinnati has seen nothing like him since Third Baseman Billy Werber drifted in from the American League in 1939 and fired the Reds to two pennants in a row . <P> No Bum He . Even Don is surprised . When the Redlegs got him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did not have a good year . " I 'm not going back to the minors , " he told General Manager Gabe Paul . " I do n't want to become a baseball bum . " Some Cincinnati fans suggested glumly that Hoak was a bum already-as a Dodger in 1954 and ' 55 , he had looked poor next to Third Basemen Billy Cox and Jackie Robinson . Last year as a Cub , he was an unpopular and ineffectual replacement for handsome Ransom Jackson . He hit a piddling .215 , set an embarrassing major-league record by striking out six times in a single game with the Giants . <P> The credit for his current success , says Hoak , belongs to one man : Redleg Manager Birdie Tebbetts . Like everyone else who has seen Don play since he left the sandlots of Roulette , Pa. , Birdie recognizes the signs of greatness . But unlike Don 's earlier managers , Birdie knows how to help his man use all his talent all the time . " The big thing about Birdie , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his ballplayers build up pressure . Besides changing my stance at the plate , he cut down my swing and has me moving around more in the batter 's box . With Birdie you do n't feel locked up . You 're free to play your own game . " <P> Novel System . Free to play his own game , Hoak has shown the rough aggressiveness that the beanballing pitchers sensed beneath his solid ( 6 ft. , 182 Ib. ) frame . His novel system for breaking up a double play ( TIME , May 6 ) has forced a change in the rulebook. * Last week his timely hitting helped his team take two out of three games from the Giants ; his smooth work at third left Shortstop Roy McMillan free to team up with Second Baseman Johnny Temple in one of the best double-play combinations in baseball . The Redlegs , who started the season slowly , are all playing their own game by now , at week 's end were on top in the pennant race thanks to a twelve-game winning streak . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to disclaim credit for such crowd-pleasing play , " have to be on a winning club to do their best . " Winning certainly seemed to suit ex-Castoff Don Hoak . <P> <P> *Running from second to third , Don fielded a sure double-play grounder , was called out for interference , but prevented the Milwaukee Braves from getting another out by forcing the Redleg running from first to second . Now-such interference automatically costs the team at bat two outs .
