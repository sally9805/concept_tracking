txt The solicitor general of the United States Tuesday recommended that the Supreme court refuse to amend its 1930 decree so as to require Chicago to ' discharge the Isanitary dis- Rankin trict 's sewage effluent into Lake Michigan . J. Lee Rankin , solicitor general , recommended , however , that the court appoint a special master to " reevaluate the needs of all parties and to make recommendations as to the future pattern of development of the situation , looking toward entry if necessary of a supplemental decree . " No Change ' in Any Way ' Rankin submitted the views of the United States at the request of the court . He said the six Great Lakes states that allege they are being damaged by the loss of water taken frdin Lake Michigan and want it returned to the lake after its use , have not shown ground for modifying the decree . " The United States believes that the complainants have not .. - shown such substantial changes in circumstances since 1930 as to re . quire or justify the modification of the decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except as to the question of water power at the Niagara and St. Lawrence rivers . . . they do not show that circumstances have changed in any way at all . " Special Master Unneeded Rankin also said that no purpose could be served by appointing a special master to inquire into the allegations of the states , an alternative action they requested . He also said that since it does not appear the complainants have been injured in any way " by deficiencies , if any , in the operations of the sanitary district , there appears to be an equal lack of reason for considering the appointment of a permanent master to supervise those operations . " The complainant states are Wisconsin , Minnesota , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York . The state of Elinois and the sanitary district of Chicago are the defendants . Broader Basis Called For In recommending a special master to make d long range investigation that would narrow the issues by providing specific findings and proposals to which the states could address themselves , Rankin said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communities forming a large segment of the United States , affecting their whole economies and indeed their very lives . At issue is the destiny of , the Great Lakes , one of the nation 's greatest natural resources . " Ordinary prudence seems to us to dictate that the probe ment of that entire area , " Rankin said . The brief said the problems involved are infinitely complex " and may even appear almost insoluble . " Needs Must Be Met " There is no doubt that , as time passes , Chicago will need more water , " it continued . " So will nearby communities , whose supplies of ground water are running out ? for example , the ElmhurstVilla Park-Lombard district also involved in a case before the court . Certainly the needs of these communities must be met in some way , and some means must be found for disposing of their sewage effluent , nhich will increase corresponding with their water use . Rankin said the return of lem be approached , so far as possible , on a broader basis than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern . meat 's concern is with future developments . In a situation like Chicago 's , he s aid , changes come not suddenly but littleand are fully o little by itevei . develop much as a coral reef decut to alter afterward . " " For example , since ' 1930 the sanitary district has developed its sewage disposal system on the basis of discharging into the canal justifiably , we believe , under the decree , and it now reasonably urges the magnitude of that development as an argument against being required to change it , " the brief said . " If allowed to do so , it will continue in the same direetion , and by the time changes have become so major as to warrant reopening of the decree , their mere size will hinder any remedial action . Perhaps no alternative exists ; but we feel that if events are to move in that direction it should be the result of an informed choice and not of mere inertia . " May Be Insoluble Rankin said the appoint . ment of a special master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prao tical engineering improve ments that may result , but " for the good it may do in eliminating what has been a long standing source of ill will among the states involved . " " We believe that until a thoro and impartial inquiry is conducted and a definite conclusion established , this unresolved dispute will continue to grow and rankle among the states of the Great Lakes basin like a festering sore on the body polltic , poisoning the developeffluent to Lake Michigan , as urged by the complainant states , offers difficulties at Chicago that do not face other Great Lake cities . Chicago 's population is far larger than any other of the cities and , at Chicago , Lake Michigan is relatively shallow and the currents are slight and variable . All these factors , he said , would make it extremely difficult to assure that sewage effluent discharged into the lake would be adequately dispersed and diluted , and that it would not sometimes drift back into the city 's water intakes . One by one , Rankin took up and rejected as not sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the water taken from the lake and turned down the sanitary canal and the Illinois river , to the Mississippi watershed .
