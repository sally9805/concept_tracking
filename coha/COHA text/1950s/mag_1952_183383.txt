The important jogs and wiggles on the international seismograph last week all indicated new stirrings in Asia . <P> In Paris , Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Vishinsky accused the U.S. of preparing " new acts of aggression " against Red China . The U.S. , he said , is transporting Chinese Nationalist troops from Formosa to the southern borders of China , and preparing to use its Seventh Fleet for aggression against the Chinese Reds . " These flagrantly illegal acts , " cried Vishinsky , " will be declared to be defensive measures against China 's aggression whenever events begin to take their course on the southern borders of China , in Siam , Burma and Yunnan Province . . . " <P> Vishinsky 's words sounded uncomfortably like the noises the Communists made 18 months ago to mask their aggression against South Korea : the Reds characteristically accuse the other side of a crime they themselves are about to commit . <P> Floundering Truce . Vishinsky 's outburst came in the midst of his latest bellicose attempt to show himself a man of peace . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Foreign Ministers sitting as delegates , to lessen world tension . First item : the Korean truce , which , he said , is now deadlocked and " floundering " at Panmunjom . <P> The other stirrings were closer to the trouble scene . Premier Stalin sent personal greetings to the people of Japan . " The Soviet people , " he said , " deeply sympathize with the Japanese people , who are trapped in a serious situation under foreign occupation . " There were other tremors in Japan : members of a Soviet trade mission busily conferred with Japanese Parliament members ; a Stalin Peace Prize went to a non-Communist Japanese ; ten Japanese economists were invited to the forthcoming Communist economic conference in Moscow . <P> The Grimace . From Communist China came fresh reports of a Red Chinese buildup in the south . The southern city of Nanning is now , thanks to Soviet aid , a big Chinese army base . The Peking government announced that it had completed a rail line south from Nanning to within ten miles of the Indo-Chinese border . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders from all Southeast Asia had been summoned to a conference on " the early liberation " of Southeast Asia . <P> But the sound which jiggled the seismograph most was the voice of Vishinsky . Since a Communist 's word can neither be trusted nor disregarded , the West took note of his warnings . Western intelligence recognizes that a full-scale Chinese attack on Indo-China would undo all the success General de Lattre de Tassigny has had there , but it still has no solid evidence that a Chinese invasion is imminent .
