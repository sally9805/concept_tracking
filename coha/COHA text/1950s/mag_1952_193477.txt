Between the shores of Maine and California live some 6,000,000 Americans who have at least one thing in common : they all went to college . How have they turned out ? Is the old grad really much different from the average U.S. citizen ? <P> This week , with the publication of a new book called They Went to College ( Harcourt , Brace ; $4 ) , U.S. readers could find out . The book is the product of a five-year study , made by TIME , of 9,064 representative graduates . A Columbia University statistician , Patricia Salter West , analyzed the survey , and LIFE Editor Ernest Havemann translated the statistics into eminently readable English . The result : as complete a portrait of the Old Grad as has ever been published . <P> Who 's Who . When TIME questioned them in 1947 , the graduates had a median age of about 37 , and four out of ten were women . About half grew up in towns of less than 25,000 , and less than half came from " college families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their way through college : only about three out of ten " never turned a hand at gainful labor until they got their degrees . " <P> They chose a wide variety of majors . Three out of ten picked the humanities . ' Then came the sciences ( 15% ) and the social sciences ( 9% ) . The rest of the graduates were apparently preoccupied with their careers : 11% took up engineering , 9% education , 8% business administration , 3% agriculture and forestry , and so on down the line to the 1% who went in for pharmacy . <P> The outstanding fact of the survey is that , as a group , they have done well financially . As of 1947 , the median income for all American men was $2,200 , but the Old Grad was making well over twice as much . Only one in 200 was unemployed ; only 16% held minor or manual jobs . The rest were in business ( 53% ) , became doctors , lawyers or dentists ( 16% ) , teachers ( 16% ) , clergymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The doctors were the biggest earners : over half making more than $7,500 a year . The graduates at the bottom of the economic pyramid : teachers and preachers ( median income : $3,584 ) . <P> As husbands , the Old Grads have also done well . Of the 85% of the men who have married , 96% have stayed married , thus topping the 89% record for all U.S. married males by seven points . College women have not been so fortunate : 31% of them have remained unmarried as compared to only 13% of all U.S. women . It would appear , concludes the survey , that for many women college " amounts to an education for spinsterhood. "
