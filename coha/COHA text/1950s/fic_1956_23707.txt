He lends money to another partner in his firm , Bowles ( nicknamed A. N. Other ) whom he meets at the tables , with the provision that if Bertram wins the next day he will own Bowles ' shares in the company . Meanwhile Cary , feeling neglected , is going out with another man . To spite her , Bertram takes another woman to dinner and sees Gary in the same restaurant . 13 H 0 W I envy a life of action , " my imposing companion said and laid down her bagchinkingly  --  on the table .

" " Men are so much more modest than women . If I had deeds of derring-do to my credit I would never tire of telling them . Cheltenham must seem very quiet to you . " I heard a spoon drop at a neighboring table . I said weakly , " Oh well , L do n't mind quiet . What will you eat ? " " I have such a weeny-teeny appetite , Colonel . A langouste thermidor . . . .

She began to tell me the whole story of her life , beginning over the langouste with a childhood in an old rectory in Kent and ending over the ice cream with her small widow 's portion at Cheltenham . She was staying in a little pension in Monte Carlo because it was " select , " and I suppose her methods at the Casino very nearly paid for her keep . I got rid of her at last and went home . I was afraid that Cary wouldn't. be there , but she was sitting up in bed reading one of those smart phrase hooks that are got up like a novel and are terribly bright and gay . When I opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entrez , mon colonel . " " What are you reading that for ? " I said . " Tessaye de faire mon francaise un pea meilleur . " " Why ?

" " After what his dinner must have cost you tonight , I suppose he had to take an honorable line . " " I told him there was a temporary impediment . " You mean your bad French ? " " I mean you , of course . " Suddenly she began to cry , burying her head under the phrase book so that 1 should n't see . I sat down on the bed and put my hand on her side : I felt tired : I felt we were very far from the public house at the corner : I felt we had been married a long time and it had n't worked . I had no idea how to pick up the pieces  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Let 's go home . " " Not wait any more for Mr. Dreuther ? " " Why should we ? I practically own Mr. Dreuther now . " I had n't meant to tell her , but out it came , all of it . She emerged from under the phrase book and she stopped crying . I told her that when I had extracted the last fun out of being Dreuther 's boss , 1 would sell my shares at a good profit to Blixon  --  and that would he the final end of Dreuther . " We 'll be comfortably off , " I said . " We wo n't . " " What do you mean ? " " Darling , I 'm not hysterical now and I'n-t not angry . I 'm talking really seriously .

He meant it at the time . He looked at you and you seemed tired and he liked you  --  just like that , for no reason , just as I liked you the first time in the Volunteer . That 's how human beings work . They do n't work on a damned system like your roulette . " " The system has n't done so badly for you . " " Oh yes , it has . It 's destroyed me . I 've lived for you and now I 've lost you . " " You have n't . I 'm here . " " When I return home and go into the bar of the Volunteer , you wo n't be there .

" 1 sneered back at her , but there was n't any heart in my sneer , " You only love the poor , I suppose ? " " Is n't that better than only loving- the rich ? Darling , I 'm going to sleep on the sofa in the sitting-room . " We had a sitting-room again now , and a dressing-room for me , just as we began . I said , " Do n't bother . I 've got my own bed . " I went out on to the balcony . It was like the first night when we had quarreled , but this time she did n't come out on her balcony , and we had n't quarreled . I wanted to knock on her door and say something , but I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chink like the tokens in Bird 's Nest 's bag . 14 I DID N'T see her for breakfast , nor for lunch . I went into the Casino after lunch and for the first time I did n't want to win . But the devil was certainly in my system and win I did . I had the money to pay Bowles , I owned the shares , and I wished I had lost my last two hundred francs in the kitchen . After that I walked along the terrace  --  sometimes one gets ideas walk ? ing , but I did n't . And then looking down into the harbor I saw a white boat which had n't been there before . She was flying the British flag and I recognized her from newspaper photographs . She was the Seagull . The Gom had come after all  --  he was n't much more than a week late . . I thought , you bastard , if only you 'd troubled to keep your promise , I would n't have lost Cary . I was n't important enough for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love . Well , if I 've lost her , you are going to lose everything tooBlixon will probably buy your boat . I walked into the bar and the Gom was there . He had just ordered himself a Pernod and he was talking with easy familiarity to the barman , speaking perfect French . Whatever the man 's language he would have spoken it perfectly  --  he was of the Pentecostal type . Yet he was n't the Dreuther of the eighth floor now  --  he had put an old yachting cap on the bar , he had several days ' growth of white beard and he wore an old and baggy pair of blue trousers and a sweat shirt . When I came in he did n't stop talking , but I could see him examining me in the mirror behind the bar . He kept on glancing at me as though I pricked a memory . I realized that he had not his invitation , he had even foronly forgotten gotten me . " Mr. Dreuther , " I said . He turned as slowly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't remember me , " I said . " Oh , my dear chap , I remember you perfectly . Let me see , the last time we met . . . . " MAGAZINE " My name 's Bertram . " I could see it did n't mean a thing to him . He said , " Of course . Of course . Been here long ? " " We arrived about nine days ago . We hoped you 'd be in time for our wedding . " " Wedding ? " I could see it all coining back to him and for a moment he was foxed for an explanation . " My dear chap , I hope everything was all right . We were caught with engine trouble . Out of touch . You know how it can be at sea . Now you are coming on board tonight , I hope . Get your bags packed . I want to sail at midnight . Monte Carlo is too much of a temptation for MC . How about you ? Been losing money ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words . " No , I 've gained a little . " " Hang on to it . It 's the only way . " He was rapidly paying for his Pernod  --  he wanted to get away from his mistake as quickly as possible . " Follow me down . We 'll eat on hoard tonight . The three of us . No one else joins the boat until Portofino . Tell them I 'll settle the bill . " " It 's not necessary . I can manage . " " I ca n't have you out of pocket because I 'm late . " He snatched his yachting cap and was gone . I could almost imagine he had a seaman 's lurch . He had given me no time to develop my hatred or even to tell him that I did n't know where my wife was . I put the money for Bowles in an envelope and asked the porter to have it waiting for him in the bar of the Casino at nine . Then I went upstairs and began to pack my bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Cary to sca our whole trouble might be left on shore in the luxury hotel , in the great ornate Salle Priv  --  e . I would have liked to stake all our troubles en plein and to lose them . It was only when I had finished my packing and went into her room that I knew I had n't a hope . The room was more than empty  --  it was vacant . It was where somebody had been and would n't he again . The dressing table was waiting for another user  --  the only thing left was the conventional letter . Women read so many magazines  --  they know the formulas for parting . I think they have even learned the words by heart from the glossy pages  --  they are impersonal . " Darling , I 'm off . I could n't bear to tell you that and what 's the use ? We do n't fit any more . " I thought of nine days ago and how we 'd urged the old horse-cab on . Yes , they said at the desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . He took a long pull and watched the smoke drift and dissolve . " Still , it did n't last . A good woman lasts . Blixon is married to a good woman . She sits next to him in the pew on Sundays , thinking about the menu for dinner . She is an excellent housekeeper and has great taste in interior decoration . Her hands arc plump  --  she says proudly that they are good pastry hands  --  hut that is not what a woman 's hands should be for . She is a moral woman and when he leaves her during the week , he feels quite secure . But he has to go back , that is the terrible thing , he has to go hack . " " Cary is n't that good . " I looked at the last of my whisky . " I wish to hell you could tell me what to do . " " I am too old and the young would call me cynical . People do n't like reality . They do n't like common sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bring your hags , forget the whole matter  --  my whisky supply is large , for a few days anesthetize yourself . I have some most agreeable guests coming on board at Portofino  --  you will like Celia Charteris very much . At Naples there are several hordels if you find celibacy difficult . I will telephone to the office extending your leave . Be content with adventure . And do n't try to domesticate adventure . " I said , " I want Cary . That 's all . Not adventure . " " My second wife left me because she said I was too ambitious . She did n't realize that it is only the dying who are free from ambition . And they probably have the ambition to live . Some men disguise their ambition  --  that 's all . I was in a position to help this young man my wife loved . He soon showed his ambition then . There are different types of ambition  --  that is all , and my wife found she preferred mine . Because it was limitless . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man to prefer the desk of an assistant manager  --  that is an insult . " He looked mournfully at his long cigar ash . " All the same one should not meddle . " " I would do anything . . . , " " Your wife is romantic . This young man 's poverty appeals to her . I think I see a plan . Help yourself to another drink while I tell it to you .... " 16 I WENT down the gangplank , swaying slightly coin the effect of the whisky , and walked up the hill from the port . It was a quarter past eight , and the sight of a clock reminded me for the first time of what I had not told Dreuther . Dreuther had said , " Do n't use money . Money is so obviously sordid . But those little round scarlet disks . . . . You will see , no gambler can resist them . " I went to the Casino and looked for the pair : they were not there . Then I changed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my pockets clinked like Bird 's Nest 's bag . It took me only a quarter of an hour to find them : they were in the caf ? where we used to go for our meals . I watched them for a little , unseen from the door . Cary did n't look happy . She had gone there , she told me later , to prove to herself that she no longer loved me , that no sentiment attached to the places where we had been together , and she found that the proof did n't work out . She was miserable to see a stranger sitting in my chair , and the stranger had a habit she detested  --  he stuffed the roll into his mouth and hit off the buttered end . When he had finished he counted his resources and then asked her if she would mind not talking for a minute while he checked his system . " We can go Up to live hundred francs tonight in the kitchen , " he said ; " that is five one-hundred-franc stakes . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . I said , " Hullo , " from the doorway and Cary turned . She nearly smiled at me from habit  --  I could see the smile sailing up in her eyes and then she plucked it down like a boy might pluck his kite back to earth , out of the wind . " What are you doing here ? " she said . " I wanted to make sure you were all right . " " I am all right . " " Sometimes one does something and wishes one hadn't. " " sot me . " " I wish you 'd be quiet , " the young man said . " What I am working out is very complicated . " " Philippe , it 's  --  my husband . " He looked up . " Oh , good evening , " and began to tap nervously on the table with his pencil . " I hope you are looking after my wife properly . " " That 's nothing to do with you , " he said . " There are certain things you ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates skin on hot milk . Look , her saucer 's full of scraps . You should attend to that before you pour out . She hates small sharp noises  --  for instance the crackle of toast  --  or that roll you are eating . You must never chew nuts either . I hope you are listening . That noise with the pencil will not please her . " " I wish you would go away , " the young man said . I told them to keep my bags . Dreuther would n't want me to stay on board after what I was going to tell him . 15 D R E U T H E R had shaved and changed his shirt and was reading a book . in his little lounge . He again had the grand air of the eighth floor . The bar stood hospitably open and the flowers looked as though they had been newly arranged . I was n't impressed . I knew about his kindness , but kindness at the skin-deep level can ruin people . Kindness has got to care . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " But your wife has not come with you ? " " She 'll be following , " I said . " And your bags ? " " The bags too . Could I have A drink ? " I had no compunction in gaining the Dutch courage for assassination at his own expense . I had two whiskies very quickly . He poured them out himself , got the ice , served me like an equal . And he had no idea that in fact I was his superior . " You look tired , " he said . " The holiday has not done you good . " " I have worries . " " Did you remember to bring the Racine ? " " Yes . " I was momentarily touched that he had remembered that detail . " Perhaps after dinner you would read a little . I was once fond of him like you . There is so much that I have forgotten . Age is a great period of forgetting . " I remembered what Cary had said  --  after all , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But when I thought of Cary I could have cried into my glass . " We forget a lot of things near at hand , but we remember the past . I am often troubled by the past . Unnecessary misunderstanding . Unnecessary pain . " " Could I have another whisky ? " " Of course . " He got up promptly to serve me . Leaning over his little bar , with his wide patriarchal back turned to me , he said , " Do not mind talking . We are not on the eighth floor now . Two men on holiday . Friends I hope . Drink . There is no harm , if one is unhappy , in being a little drunk . " I was a little drunk  --  more than a little . I could n't keep my voice steady when I said , " My wife is n't coming . She 's left me . " " A quarrel ? " " Not a real quarrel . Not words you can deny or forget . " " Is she in love with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him . " Perhaps . " . " Tell me . I ca n't help . But one needs a listener . " Using the pronoun " one " he made mine a general condition from which all men were destined to suffer . " One " is born , " one " dies , " one " loses love . I told him everything  --  except what I had come to the boat to tell him . I told him of our coffee-and-roll lunches , of my winnings , of the hungry student and the Bird 's Nest . I told him of our words over the waiter , I told him of her last simple statement , " I do n't like you any more . " I even ( it seems incredible to me now ) showed him her letter . He said , " I am very sorry . If I had not been  --  delayed , this would not have happened . On the other hand you would not have won all this money . " I said , " Damn the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said it so often myself . But here I am ? " He waved his hand round the little modest saloon that it took a very rich man to afford . " If I had meant what I said , I would n't be here . " " I do mean it . " " Then you have hope . " " She may be sleeping with him at this moment . " " That does not destroy hope . So often one has discovered how much one loves by sleeping with another . " " What shall I do ? " " Have a cigar . " " I do n't Like them . ' " You will not mind ? " he lit one himself . " These too cost money . Certainly I do not like money  --  who could ? The coins are badly designed and the paper is unclean . Like newspapers picked up in a public park . But I like cigars , this yacht , hospitality , and I suppose , I am afraid , yes , " he added , lowering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had even forgotten that he no longer had it . " One has to put up with this money . " " Do you know where they will be ? " he asked . " Celebrating , I imagine  --  on coffee and rolls . " " I have had four wives . Are you sure you want her back ? " " Yes . " " It can be very peaceful without them . " " I 'm not looking for peace  --  yet " " My second wife  --  I was still young then  --  she left me , and I made the mistake of winning her back . It took me years to lose her again after that . She was a good woman . It is not easy to lose a good woman . If one must marry it is better to marry a bad woman . " " I did and it was n't much fun . " " I would rather like to talk to my wife alone . " " I do n't want to be alone with you , " Cary said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was strange how cleverly Dreuther had forecast our dialogue . I began to have hope . " I 'm sorry . I must insist . " " You 've no right . . .. " Cary said , " Unless you leave us , we 'll both walk out of here . Philippe , pay the bill . " " Chdrie , I do want to get my system straight . " " 111 tell you what do , " I said . " I 'm a much older man than you are , but I 'll offer to fight you . H 1 win I talk to Gary alone . if you win , I go away and never trouble you again . " " I wo n't have you fighting , " Cary said . " You heard her . " " Alternatively , I 'll pay for half an hour with her . " " How dare you ? " Cary said . I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out fistfuls of yellow and red tokens  --  five-hundredfranc tokens , thousand tokens , shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could n't keep his eyes off them . They covered his system . I said , " I 'd rather fight . This is all the money T 've got left , " He stared at them . He said , " I do n't want to brawl . " Cary said , " Philippe , you would n't .... " I said , " It 's the only way you can get out of here without fighting . " " Chdrie , he only wants half an hour . After all it 's his right . There are things for you to settle together , and with this money I can really prove my system . " She said to bins in a voice to which in the past week I had become accustomed , " All right . Take his money . Get along into that damned Casino . You 've been thinking of nothing else all the even-ing . " He had just enough grace to hesitate . " I 'll see you in half an hour , cherie . " I said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have something to do there . " Then I called him back from the door , " You 've dropped a piece , " and he came back and felt for it under the table . Watching Cary 's face I almost wished I had n't won . She was trying hard not to cry . She said , " I suppose you think you 've been very clever . " " No . " " You exposed him all right . You 've demonstrated your point . What do I do now ? " " Come on board for one night . You 've got a 79 separate cabin . We can put you off in Genoa tomorrow . " " I suppose you hope I 'll change my mind ? " " Yes . I hope . It 's not a very big hope , but it 's better than despair . You see I love you . " " Would you promise never to gamble again ? " " Yes . " " Would you throw away that damned system ? " " Yes . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then my heart stood still . " That was what I felt when she began to make conditions . " Have you told him , " she asked , " about the shares ? " " No . " " I ca n't go on that boat with hint not knowing . It would be too mean . " - " I promise I 'll clear it up  --  before night . " She had her head lowered , so that I could n't see her face , and she sat very silent . 1 had used all my arguments : there was nothing more for me to say either . The night was full of nothing but chinking cups and running water . At last she said , " What are we waiting for ? " We picked up all the bags and then we walked across to the Casino . She had n't wanted to come , but I said , " I promised to bring you . " I left her in the hall and went through to the kitchen  --  he was n't there . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salle Privde .

It came to rest in zero as I reached Philippe and the bank raked in their winnings . I said to Philippe , " Cary 's here . 1 kept my promise . " " Tell her not to come in . I am winning  --  except the last round . I do not want to be disturbed , " " She wo n't disturb you ever again . " " I have won I0,000 . " " But it 's loser takes all , " - I said .

There were cocktails before dinner and champagne at dinner arid I could see that Cary was getting a little uncertain in her choice of words . She went to bed early because she wanted to leave me alone with the Gom . We both came out onto the deck to say good night to her . A small breeze went by , tasting of the sea , and the clouds hid moon and stars and made the riding lights on the yachts shine the brighter . The Gom said , " Tomorrow night you shall persuade me that Racine is the greater poet , but tonight let me think of Baudelaire . " He leaned on the rail and recited in a low voice , and I wondered to whom it was in the past that the old wise man with limitless ambitions was speaking .

He turned and said , " 1 am speaking that to you , my dear , from him , " and he put his arm around her shoulder , and then gave her a push toward the companionway . She gave a sound like a small animal in pain and was gone . " What was the matter ? " the Gout said . " She was remembering something . " I knew what it was she was remembering , but I did n't tell him . We went back into the saloon and the Gom poured out our drinks . He said , " I 'm glad the trick worked . " She may still decide to get off at Genoa . " " She wo n't . In any case we 'll leave out Genoa . " He added thoughtfully . " It 's not the first time I 've kidnapped a woman .

They are getting up the anchor now . " When I went down I wondered whether Cary 's cabin would be locked , but it was n't . She sat on one bunk with her knees drawn up to her chin staring through the porthole . The engines had started and we were moving out . The lights of the port wheeled around the wall .

They have a Casino there . But do n't let 's have a system . " There was a promise I 'd forgotten . I got up and took the great system out of my jacket pocket and tore it in little pieces and threw them through the porthole  --  the white scraps blew back in our wake . The sleepy voice said , " Darling , it 's terribly cold . It 's snowing . " " I 'll close the porthole . " " No . Just come back . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
