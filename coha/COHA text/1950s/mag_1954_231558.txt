Paul Klee ( rhymes with fey ) was one of the greatest artists of the 20th century , and he knew it . But the calculated modesty of Klee 's art had the world fooled for a long time . Not until his death in 1940 ( at 60 ) did it become apparent that Klee had raised the curtain on a thousand new ways of picturing things . Klee 's ways are reassembled in a definitive study of his work by German Critic Will Grohmann ( Paul Klee , Harry N. Abrams ; $12.50 ) , in U.S. bookstores last week . <P> <P> Trouble at Four . Born into a cultivated music-teacher 's family near Bern , Switzerland , Klee thought of making music his profession . He chose painting instead , simply " because it seemed to be lagging behind , " and undertook rigorous formal training . Klee 's chief means of advancing art was to let his unconscious whisper through his brush . At four , he would rush to his mother for protection from the " evil spirits " that appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel at home in his dream world of huge , dim forces , and was able to say , with none of the smugness of the dispassionate , that " evil must not be a triumphant or confounding enemy , but a constructive force , a co-factor in creation and development . " <P> At 22 Klee knew the course of his life and art precisely . " I have to disappoint at first , " he confided to his journal . " I want to be as though newborn , knowing absolutely nothing about Europe ; ignoring facts and fashions , to be almost primitive . Then I want to do something very modest , to work out by myself a tiny , formal motif , one that my pencil will be able to encompass without any technique . . . Pictures will more than fill the whole of my lifetime ... it is less a matter of will than of fate . " <P> Splotched Fantasies . From that point forward , Klee produced a frosty torrent of little dream pictures ( there are some 900 in U.S. collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being quite satisfied with just a feather , he was able to produce an almost endless variety . Some of his works resemble children 's squiggles , others the splotched fantasies of the mad . Still others are made entirely of dots , or squares , or crosshatchings , or Oriental arabesques . Some of his pictures are composed simply of illegible script-foreshadowing Cartoonist Saul Steinberg . He illustrated Candide with raggedy stick figures of the sort Giacometti and George Grosz were later to employ , and created telling juxtapositions ( e.g. , a bird engraved on a cat 's forehead ) that inspired the surrealists . He drew and painted on everything , from glass to burlap , and always with iron control . Klee 's demons almost never failed him ; he had them under the yoke of wit and taste . <P> By taking his own amoral unconscious as a point of departure for half-romantic , half-eclectic labors Klee followed a great German tradition which began with Goethe . Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , mystic Rudolph Steiner and Psychologists Freud and Jung all worked the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vanishing point . " Not even Klee 's closest friends , " Grohmann recalls , " could tell what manner of man he was . " <P> For a time he made a living teaching art at Germany 's famed Bauhaus , but he would lecture almost inaudibly , sitting hunched over with his back to the class .
