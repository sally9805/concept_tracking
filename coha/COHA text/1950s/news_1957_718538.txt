txt Governor Furcolo today faced a widening split in Democratic legislative ranks over his proposed 3 per cent limited sales tax . Senator John E. Powers ( D ) of Boston , Senate minority leader , has burst into the open with his opposition to the sales tax as a solution to an admitted state and municipal financial crisis . The Powers split could be particularly serious to the Furcolo fiscal program because of the South Boston senator 's proved ability to rally Democratic senators around him . So sharp has been the Powers break that he has left no avenue of possible return to the Furcolo fold to support the sales tax . Other Support Claimed At the same time , he claims seven other Democratic senators have already volunteered their opposition to the sales tax , with others likely to do so . If Senator Powers should actively campaign throughout the state as an ardent sales tax opponent , he might scuttle the Furcolo plans , despite its support from influential business and industrial groups , many Republicans and even some labor leaders . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a campaign , although he added he will accept " any invitation , anytime , to go anywhere in the state to express my views . " " This is not a battle between the Governor and me . It is a conflict over differing beliefs in what should be done . " I do not believe a sales tax is necessary . " Self-Help Advised Senator Powers asserted the financial needs must first be determined . He expressed the belief that only about 20 million dollars in new revenue is needed by the state at this time . This , he added , could be obtained through a general upping of all tax rates , right across the board ? corporation and personal income tax , inheritance taxes , and others . While such a program would leave unsolved the accompanying municipal problems , Senator Powers said , " I am interested in helping the cities and towns , but first they should help themselves . They benefited by a sub , stantial increase in state distributions last year . But what happened ? The money is all gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged that Democrats are courting political disaster in the sales tax issue . " The Republican Party , " he said , " will urge us to adopt the sales tax and in 1958 will Campaign on the issue and blame the Democratic Governor for putting it over . " Receipts Tax Urged Meanwhile , it is becoming apparent that if a sales tax is to be adopted , many of its more ardent supporters will insist on some definite legislative curbs on how municipalities shall apply their 75-million-dollar share of the annual anticipated 112.5 million-dollar yield . There is a growing belief that unless such curbs are stated clearly , the revenue will be swiftly absorbed in pay raises and other expenditures with little relief to the payers ' property taxes . While the sales tax controversy was building up , Representative George W. Porter ( R ) of Agawam trotted out an alternative proposal which he believed would produce 112 million dollars with far less financial impact on the individual taxpayer . The Porter proposal is a 2 per cent tax on gross receipts of retailers . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indiana , would be easy to administer and would produce as much revenue as the 3 per cent limited sales tax because there would be no exemptions . Dane View Withheld At the same time , he explained the retailer would be able to take as much as 52 per cent of the tax from his federal tax . As a result , the retailer would have to pass on to the consumer only about one-half the 2 per cent tax . Although John Dane , Jr. , State Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation , would not at this time publicly offer his views on the tax issue , he explained that the federal tax on corporations is 30 per cent on corporations with less than $25,000 income and 52 per cent on all other corporations . So incorporated retailers here would be in a position to deduct from 30 to 52 per cent of the proposed gross receipts tax , he explained . As yet , he said , his department has made no study of the proposal . Governor Furcolc , when asked about the Porter proposal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any proposal which would raise the revenue needed .
