In the midst of the journalistic battle among the liberals , the weekly Nation last week suffered some crippling casualties . Executive Editor Harold C. Field , righthand man of Editor Freda Kirchwey for the past two years , quietly resigned , effective the end of June . Two longtime contributors already had pulled their names from the Nation 's masthead : Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr , for 15 years a staff contributor , and Political Writer Robert Bendiner , contributing editor and onetime ( 1937-44 ) managing editor . <P> The resignations followed close on the charges of ex-Nation Staffer Clement Greenberg ( TIME , April 2 et . seq. ) that the writings of Nation Foreign Editor <P> Alvarez del Vayo usually ran parallel to the Soviet line . Nation staffers were shocked when Editor Kirchwey , who had refused to let Critic Greenberg have his say in the Nation , filed libel suits against him and the anti-Communist New Leader , which printed his story . <P> Said Theologian Niebuhr this week : " The libel suit . . . brought to a head my disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I did not want the continued use of my name on the masthead to imply support of the suit against the New Leader ... a tragic mistake . " Gossip in liberal circles said that Editor Field , too , disapproved of the suit , although he insisted he was leaving for " mostly personal reasons . " But it was apparent that most liberals seemed to think a liberal publication should be a forum where differences of political opinion could be aired and debated , and that a court of law was only for people who have no other way to talk back .
