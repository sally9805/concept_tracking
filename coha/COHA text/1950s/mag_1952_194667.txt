Hans Christian Andersen ( Samuel Goldwyn ; RKO Radio ) is an unusual cinebiography in that it candidly disclaims having anything to do with the facts of its subject 's life . A foreword to the picture announces : " Once upon a time there lived in Denmark a great storyteller named Hans Christian Andersen . This is not the story of his life , but a fairy tale about this great spinner of fairy tales . " <P> Moss Hart 's scenario follows Cobbler Andersen ( Danny Kaye ) from the village of Odense , where he lures the children from school with his beguiling stories , to Copenhagen , where he falls in love with a beautiful ballerina ( Jeanmaire ) . In time , Andersen comes to realize that the ballerina is really in love with her ballet-master husband ( Farley Granger ) . So he returns to Odense to continue telling his tales to tykes , but not before he has written a story for a ballet , The Little Mermaid , and Jeanmaire has danced it with crashing success . <P> As big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories were simple , direct and unadorned , the picture is Veteran Producer Goldwyn 's 88th film in 38 years of moviemaking . It is also his biggest and most expensive ( 109 shooting days , $4,000,000 budget ) production . The picture has mammoth sets-e.g. , a Copenhagen square complete with shops , canal , bridge , market and opera house . It has four lavish ballets , among them the 17-minute-long Little Mermaid number , danced by lively , poodle-topped French Ballerina Jeanmaire , Choreographer Roland Petit of the Ballets de Paris , and a chorus of mermaids among $400,000 worth of underwater caves , fish netting , giant shells , ship spars and Technicolored jetsam . Frank ( Guys and Dolls ) Loesser has written eight catchy songs , among them three based on Andersen tales , Little Thumbelina , The Emperor 's New Clothes and The Ugly Duckling . <P> For all this movie magnificence , the film 's most genuinely affecting moments are in Danny Kaye 's performance in the title role . Looking a little like a Danish Walter Mitty , Comedian Kaye foregoes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing and restrained characterization . Whether he flies a kite , sings to an inchworm , talks to a dog or transforms his thumb into a little girl , Kaye succeeds in conjuring up something of the charm of a child 's storybook world : that magical realm of slippered kings , pouting princesses , dragons and serpents , flowers that waltz , and porcelain figures that fall in love . <P> Bloodhounds of Broadway ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a good-humored cinemusical about a few of Damon Runyon 's guys and dolls : Lookout Louie , Curtaintime Charlie , Pittsburgh Philo , Ropes McGonigle and other such gruff but likable Times Square characters . <P> As a result of having to skip town because of a crime investigation , Bookie " Numbers " Foster ( Scott Brady ) and his hypochondriac sidekick , " Poorly " Sammis ( Wally Vernon ) wind up in Georgia backwoods country , where they adopt a hillbilly girl ( Mitzi Gaynor ) . In short order the pretty hillbilly becomes a dancing star at Dave the Dude 's nightspot and horse parlor on Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spurred on by Mitzi 's affection , to decide to go straight .
