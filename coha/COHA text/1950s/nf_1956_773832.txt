txt // independent and more able to tell us things that are useful . It is perhaps natural for each generation to fear its products , but surely it is more satisfactory to welcome their independence and the new information that they provide as an aid to the continuation of the whole system . Through these lectures I have tried to trace the way in which change in communication systems has been a central feature of the changes that have come over human societies . The change is not steadily in the direction of increasing transfer of information , but the biologist and historian alike must recognize that the whole organization of our system today involves very much more detailed inter-communication than there was , say , 10,000 years ago . Moreover , there has been an accelerating change in this direction during the last three hundred years , following the adoption of a new system after the Middle Ages , and especially with the rise of science . Quite recent years have seen further great advances , not only in mechanical aids to communication , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , such as the radio , is bound to produce further big changes in the way we talk about ourselves . The rise of classical physics after the seventeenth century produced the habit of speaking about ourselves as machines , having ' structure ' and functions . ' This has allowed enormous improvement in the control of ourselves through medical science . But classical physics dealt mainly with the work that men and machines do and paid little attention to their organization . The new physics and engineering differ from the old in that they deal with complicated organizations and the way that they change . When we have learned to speak of our own organization in these terms our methods of controlling it should become much better , just as , by speaking of the body as a power machine , medicine has given us far greater control than did the animism and astrology of the Middle Ages . The method , of classical physics is to postulate a system whose behaviour is completely known and whose future can therefore be determined . Physics has recently // discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe can not be described in this way . We have to start with an initial organization that we can describe only imperfectly and whose future we can not forecast exactly . We can , however , determine the probability that it will behave in any given way . The new sort of physics is therefore said to be statistical and it employs a type of mathematics suitable for forecasting probabilities . This deveiopment of methods for describing complicated organizations and forecasting their future brings the techniques of physics closer to those of biology . The biologist also can not yet control exactly the conditions of the system he observes , because he can not reproduce its past history . He has therefore developed statistical methods for forecasting as nearly as he can what organisms will do . These methods are related to those of the statistical physicist and the two sciences converge most closely in the study of communication , where neither can do without the other . The two techniques together provide us with a language in which we are gradually coming to speak in new ways about ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the puzzles and obscurities that have arisen by the use of words based on the older comparisons . Throughout the lectures the inadequacy of many of our familiar words becomes apparent . I try to show that we can do better than by speaking of I myself ' , of my mind ' , soul ' , consciousness ' , ' knowledge ' , will ' , and many other such terms . Similarly in speaking about our surroundings the physicist no longer speaks of a world ' of ' matter ' or of force ' . Finally there is not much sense any more in speaking of beginnings and endings , or of ' creation ' . All this may seem disturbing to many people ; others will give the verdict that it is unnecessary and even silly . We need not be dogmatic or expect sudden changes of practice ? but changes are certainly going on , as they always do . Probably we could not stop them . The discovery of new tools // and new language is altering society , and in the last lecture I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no need to be unduly alarmed about them . Probably they will be fundamentally less radical than they may seem in prospect . Those who are not accustomed to the language of behaviourism are apt to consider that it is in some way derogatory of human status and values . Certainly the behaviourist refuses to conduct all his descriptions with reference only to man ; he tries to make comparision between man and other aspects of nature , and he holds that this increases rather than decreases our range of vision and hence our dignity . A more serious difficulty is the suspicion that in refusing to use such words as mind ' , will ' , and pleasure ' , the behaviourist wishes to take away altogether the experiences associated with these names and to reduce man to a mere machine ' . To make any such attempt would of course be ludicrous ? we all have the experience ' of living . The behaviourist is particularly anxious that we should enlarge the scope of our lives . He believes that we can do this best by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other natural phenomena . In particular he believes that we shall gain , not lose , by close investigation of the words that we use . Such investigation should specially pursue the problem of what we mean by speaking of our experience ' and the nature of the entity we call our life ' . The method insists that we should approach these problems as we should others in semantics . For example , when we say that the centre of life is the soul , we should ask exactly what observation it is that we wish to convey to each other . Doing this might lead us to alter our use of the word soul ' , perhaps even to abandon it . But this would only be because we believed that it was possible in some other way to convey more than the old word covers . The whole purpose of new words and comparisons is to enlarge our experience , not to reduce it . Behaviourist language is often labelled as materialist ' . If a materialist is a person unwilling to talk about indescrib- // able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label . It is also true that he believes that we shall gain rather than lose by comparing man with material ' objects . But this does not mean asserting that we know all about matter ' and have nothing further to learn about the universe . The scientist is in a better position than anyone else to see that we are set about with mysteries . It is his business to grapple with ghosts every day of his life and he must refuse to allow them to be laid by the process of labelling them with a primitive nomenclature . The mysteries of the universe are too great to be expressed by such simple comparisons as are implicit in either the words . spirit ' or matter ' . On the other hand , the scientist agrees with other sensible men that our system of words must use some conventions if it is to be useful and ensure stability . Throughout these lectures I am feeling the way towards definition of a sure basis for such convention . The biologist has the advantage of looking at millions of organisms spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly : first that each particular individual or type of organization seldom survives for very long . Nevertheless , he sees that living organization is one of the most stable things upon the earth : it changes , but only slowly : its continuity is the best reference point that we can see . Second Lecture BRAINS AS MACHINES I HAVE already suggested that it would be possible to conduct our affairs somewhat better if we gave more consideration to the processes in the brain that accompany speech and thought . We have a great deal of information about these matters that was not available fifty or even ten years ago , but it would be misleading to suggest that we can yet provide a complete picture of brain action . Recent discoveries have shown enough , however , to give us hints as to how much we could do if we knew rather more . This lecture is an attempt to give an introduction to the ideas that scientists use to describe these discoveries about nerves and brains . In the seventeenth century people began to make comparison of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French philosopher Descartes compared the body with a clock . In a clock one describes each of the parts as having a function in the working of the whole . This led Descartes to an idea that was quite novel at the time , namely that one could proceed to find out how all the parts of the body interact , investigating it as if it were a machine . Comparison of living things with machines may seem at first to be a crude , even rather childish procedure , and it certainly has limitations : but it has proved to be extraordinarily useful , Machines are the products of our brains and hands . We therefore understand them thoroughly and can speak conveniently about other things by comparing them with machines . The conception of living bodies as machines , having , as we say , structures ' and functions ' , is at the basis of the whole modern development of biology and medicine . Let us consider what happens in the nervous system in // a typical case , such as blinking when a hand is waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stimulus , the waving hand , which activates a receptor , the eye . From this receptor messages , known as nerve-impulses , pass along the nerves to the brain and from there other impulses are reflected back to the muscles of the eyelids . Such circuits are known as reflex arcs , and they ensure that the body shall do something appropriate when there is a change in its neighbourhood ? the change being known as the stimulus . All the parts involved in the reflex arc are made up , like other parts of the body , of cells that can be seen with a microscope . Each cell is a separate little system , closed in , as the name implies , by a surrounding wall . This wall regulates everything that goes into or out of the cell . The nerve-cells are very long threads , drawn out to make nerve-fibres , which reach from , say , the toes to the spinal cord in the middle of the back . Each fibre is very thin , less than a thousandth of an inch across , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres run in bundles , tens of thousands of little thin threads , making up the nerves that connect the outer parts of the . body , say arms or legs , with the brain ( Fig. 1 ) . Some of them are sensory or as we may say input threads ; they carry impulses from the skin upwards to the brain . Others are motor or output fibres , carrying impulses down from the brain to the muscles . Each ingoing fibre is connected at its outer end with some part of the surface of the body ; it will therefore be made to carry impulses only when a certain small area , say the tip of a finger , is touched ( Fig. 7 ) . The thousands of fibres together thus serve to bring to the brain a traffic of information about what is happening all over the surface of the body . A great deal is known about the changes that happen in the nerve-fibres when they conduct . The whole process depends on the fact that there is a difference between the inside of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of the walls of the cell to maintain the difference . Often when different things are separated by boundaries there // occur the phenomena that we call electrical charges . The drops of rain in a thunder-cloud are like this , and so are the plates in an accumulator . Everyone knows that such electrical charges may be discharged , with all sorts of effects from flashes of lightning to the starting of a motor-car . The nerve-fibre , because of the difference between its inside and outside , carries such an electric charge . What the stimulus does , say in the skin when a pin sticks into you , is to start a minute electrical discharge . This little discharge then makes the neighbouring part of the nerve-fibre discharge , and this in its turn the next part , and so on . That is how the nerveimpulse travels along the nerve-fibre , at a speed of about 200 miles per hour . All this is very interesting , but it clearly does not tell us everything about how the nervous system works . It tells us how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses reach the central nervous system . We know that there are special outgoing or motor nerve cells that carry nerve-impulses to the muscles and make them act . But what decides which muscles shall act ? If each ingoing nerve-fibre was connected with one outgoing fibre the body would work like your front-door bell . Once the button has been pressed only one thing can happen ; if the system is in order , the bell must ring . But the body is not nearly so simple : it does not do the same thing every time it is stimulated . For example , if your son has got under the table without you knowing it and tickles your leg you will draw it away . Perhaps you will do that a second and even a third time . Then you will put your hand down to find out what is wrong . At about the fourth or fifth time you will catch him at it , and your response will be quite different from the first one . Your nervous system can not be exactly like the bell system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button is pressed . Sir Charles Sherrington has done more than anyone else to enlighten us in these matters . After prolonged study of the reflex responses of cats and other animals , he and his // colleagues came to the following conception . Each muscle , say one of those that draws away the leg , is controlled by some hundreds of outgoing nerve-fibres ( Fig. 2 ) . It only exerts its full action if these are all set off together . Obviously the strength of its action will depend upon how many of the motor cells start to send out impulses along their fibres . Each motor nerve-cell gets connexions not from just one input source , like the front-door bell , but from several ( Fig. 7 ) . Whether a given motor cell sends out its impulses or not depends simply on whether it receives impulses from a sufficient number of sources . It is like a bell that only rings if a number of buttons are pressed at the same time . The first time your son tickles you a few impulses are sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knee ; you draw away so that the stimulus ceases . The second time likewise . These first movements involve only a simple reflex action , all the connexions are made through the spinal cord alone . But impulses also go up to the brain each time , because there are side channels leading to it from the input fibres . Each time these inputs reach the brain they disturb it a little more , and at the third or fourth tickle the brain begins to send back impulses that reach to other muscles , probably to muscles of the arms as well as the legs , and produce a new set of actions . Our next problem is now to try to see whether we can make out how the brain produces these more complicated actions . This is difficult in man and it may help , therefore , to describe first the case of an animal , for example the octopus , which Mr. Boycott and I have studied at Naples , where they are plentiful and can easily be kept in the tanks of the great zoological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home for itself in a corner , using any bricks or stones that may be lying about . If the octopus is outside its home and is stung by a sea-anemone , or given a small electric shock , it will retreat back into its home . It also retreats if a large object , say a dogfish , suddenly appears . On the other hand , if you put a crab into the tank , the // octopus will come out of its lair and hurl itself upon it , seizing it with its arms and returning home to eat it ( Fig. 3 ) . What comparisons can we use to describe the nervous mechanism by which the octopus steers away from a dangerous object but moves towards a source of food ? Descartes , you remember , compared the body with a clock , the best self-regulating system that he knew . Today we have a large range of mechanical self-regulating devices , and therefore we can make much more interesting comparisons . The ball governors of steam-engines and the regulators of gas ovens and refrigerators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the gas oven close to some particular state . This is obviously very much what living things do . Their life consists of a series of acts of regulation tending to keep the body in a certain state ? to keep it alive . When there is some change , either within the body or near it , a reflex circuit goes into action to restore the status quo . Each of the reflexes is a kind of governor . It may make the body do something faster or slower , for instance by quickening the heart-beat when we run , or it may start an action that alters the outside world so as to abolish the source of change , as when we brush away a fly . In recent years engineers have gone a lot farther in the design of self-regulating devices . They have produced a great variety of direction-finders and distance-finders , culminating in guided missiles and guided rockets . These devices do very much what the brain of the octopus does , they aim the missile at a target . Until not very long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aiming system consisted of relatively crude plans for sending back information about a target ( say from a balloon ) , working out the appropriate ranging on paper or with a slide rule , and laying the gun by hand . But , gradually , calculating machines were devised that received the information , automatically computed the range and laid the gun on the target . From this it is only one stage to placing the whole apparatus for reception , calculation , and aiming within the missile itself , which is // thus able to follow its target around and hit it . To be effective the machine may have to pick up information about a lot of things , not only the position of its target but also the direction and velocity of the wind and other such factors . Quite an elaborate calculating machine may then be needed in the missile , its brain as it were , to predict the correct course from all this information . What is the value of comparing an octopus with a guided rocket of this sort ? Clearly the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in which we can say that an octopus is a guided missile . People who have not thought carefully about the use of analogies are apt to take them too literally and to think that by comparing something with something else you can in a subtle way grasp , as they say , what it really is . This belief in the magic of comparison and of words has indeed a certain justification because , as will become increasingly clear in these lectures , man is so much a communicating animal that when he has put his experience into words we can say that it becomes more real ' for him . The point is that comparing something unknown with something already known makes it possible to talk about the unknown . The value of making the analogy is that it facilitates communication . We still can not describe exactly how the nervous system // works in the octopus , but we find it helpful in trying to do so to speak of the actions of its brain as an engineer would describe the parts of a guided missile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the octopus we say that the retina of the octopus ' eye , acting as a receiver , sends information , in the form of nerve-impulses , along tens of thousands of nervefibres . These impulses then set up activities among further thousands of cells in parts of the brain that are called the optic lobes ( Fig. 4 ) . We know all too little about these activities , but comparison with the machinery of the guided missile is helping us to analyse them . The process is essentially one of using the information provided by the eyes for selection of a correct response , then predicting the course of the crab and steering towards it . The most difficult part for us to understand is the selection of the right response ; what makes the octopus steer towards a crab but away from a shark ? Some of the most recent calculating machines come close to making such decisions . I shall show in later lectures what hints we can get from the way that they do it . It is quite possible for us to imagine that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are set into action . The octopus turns its head so as to fix one eye on the crab and then its arms and funnel are brought into play to propel it through the water and to steer it correctly until it hits its prey . On the other hand , when a large object comes into the field of vision of the octopus the nervous system makes a different calculation . and steers the animal back to its home . If the object , say a dogfish , comes nearer still , a further calculation is made and the octopus suddenly flattens , spreads itself out , and turns white except for the edges of its arms and the area around the eyes , which go very dark ( Fig. 6 ) . This pattern that it shows is a very striking one and would make an attacking animal retreat . Our guided missile analogy can help us to understand this too . The octopus system is such that when a large object appears in front of its eyes the action that is called for by the brain // computor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . No doubt ideas of similar systems have occurred to the designers of weapons . In modern war one guided missile will be set to chase another ; it should be possible for a rocket fired in London against an enemy rocket to act upon the attacker so as to turn it around and send it home again . This is just what the octopus does when it puts into action its device for , as we say in another idiom , frightening away the attacker . So the guided missile analogy gives us some good terms with which we can usefully talk about the changes in the brain that ensure that the octopus will attack a crab or frighten away a big fish . Are there other aspects of its behaviour that are even harder to describe ? There is the fact that the animal may change its behaviour in the light of past experience . In other words , the octopus can learn . Boycott and I were able to show this by putting in front of the animal a small white square together with a crab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so arranged that when it did so it received a small electric shock and withdrew quickly to its home . The next time that we put the crab and the square in front of it , the octopus came out much more slowly . Instead of hurling itself on the crab it put out its arms gingerly , as if to try to get the food without touching the white square ( Fig. 6 ) . When it finally attacked , it received another electric shock . After two or three such experiences the octopus remained at home when the white square was presented to it with the crab . But it continued to come out and eat crabs put in alone , without the white square . If we are to compare the octopus with a machine , it must therefore be with one that can change its behaviour as the result of a memory that acts , as it were , as a store of past events . In recent years there has been a great development of calculating or computing machines that can store their results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . There is nothing essentially mysterious about such 6335 D // machines . Indeed , storing information is really quite a familiar process . The painter does it in his picture , the writer in his book , the photographer in his photograph . A card index , again , is a store of information . Imagine a machine that can put information into a card index and later take it out again . The cards wiih holes punched round the edges , which are used by some businesses , are devices for doing just this . One machine punches the cards according to a plan , in order to make them carry the information . Another machine can select all the cards punched in a certain place , corresponding , say , to all names beginning with the letter A. These are the cruder sorts of information stores , they are only partly automatic , like the hand-laid gun . Engineers can do much better now . Photographs and cards are bulky , they take a long time to make and to find and can only be used once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be used over and over again , are quickly marked , quickly found , and if necessary quickly erased . In modern calculating machines there are various systems , but they mostly depend not on making any permanent physical mark but on setting up some electrical action or process . Information can be stored just as easily by starting up some continuous process as by photography or by punching a card . What is needed is some arrangement that sends messages that ultimately come back to their starting-point , and then sends them out again , and so on . For instance , you could store a piece of information , say your name and address , by turning it into a code of dots and dashes , like a telegram , and then arranging that it was sent on the wires from London to Bristol , Bristol to Birmingham , Birmingham to Edinburgh , Edinburgh to York , York back to London , and then on again to Bristol and so on round and round for days or years if necessary . All that is necessary for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient delay time , so that the sending machine has finished transmitting the message before it comes back to it . You might say , What an absurd method of storing ? much better // write it down and be done with it . ' Actually , with suitably designed delay circuits ( of course using other methods than sending telegrams all round the country ) large amounts of information can readily be stored in this way . It has the great advantage that the information is readily available for reference or can be wiped out of the system , leaving no trace . No files of used photographs or cards remain . The apparatus is ready to store some more information . But ' , you may say , surely you do n't expect us to compare the brain of an octopus or a man with a card index or a cycle of telegrams ? ' Only in a general way . It is the method of talking about things that matters , not the details . With the aid of such comparison we may be able to discover what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can look to see whether there is in the brain any sign of arrangements that could either print information or store it on continuous circuits . In the case of the octopus we have been able in our experiments to make one further step forward by finding a part of the brain that is necessary for the storing . There are two lobes on the very top of an octopus 's brain that I have not yet mentioned ( Fig. 4 ) . A lot of nerve-fibres carry impulses to them from the optic lobes , and they send impulses back to the optic lobes . There is here therefore a circuit that could keep going in the way I have suggested . Boycott removed these uppermost lobes from some octopus under anaesthetic after they had learned not to attack when the white plate showed . After such an operation it was found that the animals no longer remembered the lesson . Each time that the crab and plate were shown the octopus came dashing out from the home and received a shock . So far as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce any other defect . The octopus eats well and appears perfectly normal , except that it has lost its power of memory . It seems therefore that these lobes are essential for storing information received . How do they do it ? We do not know for certain , in the octopus or in any other animal , but it seems likely that the method of storing // involves in some way the setting up of continuous processes such as those suggested in the telegraph analogy . However it is very difficult to believe that in man all our memories depend only on keeping up some kind of race like this , year in year out , around our brains . If that was the method , anything that stopped the cycles would destroy all memory completely . Yet we keep our memories , not only in sleep , but under anaesthetics . After severe changes in the brain action , such as are produced by concussion , epileptic fits , or electric shock treatment , the memory is usually disturbed , but is not completely abolished , except perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiologists have supposed that memory can not depend on circles of activity and must be more like that provided by photography or punched cards in that some kind of image is left printed , as it were , on the brain tissue . Our recent research has indeed shown some basis for supposing that activity does leave its mark on the brain . There is evidence that the cells of our brains literally develop and grow bigger with use , and atrophy or waste away with disuse ( see p. 83 ) . It may be therefore that every action leaves some permanent print upon the nervous tissue . Although we must admit that we do not know exactly how the memory is stored it seems possible that both the suggested processes are involved . It can hardly be an accident that the parts of the brain concerned contain , both in octopus and man , circular chains of action . It is conceivable that such circuits serve , as it were , to carry the memory for long enough to allow slight changes in the sizes or other features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory to be printed on the brain . To use our analogy of the telegrams going round the country , we might imagine a teleprinter device , say in London , that made a punch card or photograph of the morse code message , but that needed several exposures to do it . Each time the message came round to London it would make the record a little more definite , so that finally the message would be retained even if the circulaBRAINS // tion stopped . Perhaps it is significant , in this connexion , that concussion or other shocks upset the memory of things that were going on just before the shock ? the ones that were half printed , as it were , at the time . The worse the shock , the longer the time before concussion that is forgotten . Incidentally , the memory recovers also in a time sequence ; if the forgetting reached back two weeks , then memory will gradually return from that point onwards to the moment of concussion . Even if we do not yet know all about the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basis in the activities going on in certain particular parts of the brain . It is a fascinating problem searching out the exact details of the changes that go on as we learn . One further point should be emphasized : enormous numbers of separate units , the nerve-cells , are involved . All animals that show good learning powers have large numbers of short nerve-cells in their brain . We do not know what the system employed for storage may be , but it seems to depend on the presence of great numbers of small cells . The latest mechanical calculator in America has 23,000 valves . But the cortex of the human brain has nearly 15,000,000,000 cells . A computor with so many parts is beyond the dreams of the engineer . A huge building would be needed to house so many valves and all the water of Niagara would not be enough to work and cool them . Yet all that such a machine can do , and much more , goes on gently , gently in every human head , using very little energy and generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to make you familiar with the approach of the biologist , who tries to study animals by finding out how they work . It has often been objected that this is only one way , a partial way and even , it is sometimes alleged , a poor way of studying them . Let me at once admit that it is certainly not the only possible way . Anyone who wishes is at liberty to start discussing the behaviour of the octopus with such phrases as It wants the food ' , It feels the shock ' , It fears the square ' , It remembers its pain ' , and so on . These may even seem to be more // natural ' ways of speaking about such matters . They make use of a method of speaking that is very ancient , depending on the assumption that in every octopus there sits some sort of person at least vaguely like a man . This way of talking therefore depends on comparison and analogy , just as much as does the machine talk . The scientist would say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are inefficient . They do not tell us anything about the inner workings of the creature or how to correct them if they are out of order . It may not matter much if with talk about the mind ' of an octopus we are not able to cure its neuroses . But it does matter when we are talking about men . Comment on the Second Lecture T xis lecture more perhaps than any of the others suffers from the limitation of trying to provide too much information in a short time . In it I have tried to give the essentials of our knowledge about how the nervous system works . It would be hard enough to compress in this way all that we know about the units involved , the nervefibres and the impulses that they carry , but I had to force far more into this lecture . It also tries to provide a conception of how the nerve-fibres are arranged to provide the functioning units ? the reflex arcs ; then , in order to show how these operate in life , I hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to that point the lecture had at least a reasonably familiar basis in showing how the physiologist describes the working of the body as he would a machine . But the final section tries to trace how the nervous system changes its characteristics by the process of learning . The machines with which we are most familiar have a fixed performance , they do not learn . I was therefore bound to introduce here some description of the newer types of machine that do learn , and to show how we may compare animals with them . This great condensation may have made the lecture a difficult one to follow , but nevertheless I do not regret having concentrated so much into it . Indeed to do so was part of the plan of the whole series . I did not want listeners at any time to feel that they were hearing only details about this or that narrow scientific subject , but to try to make them see how scientific language can be used to study every aspect of man . The theme of this second lecture therefore is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about such aspects of life as memory , which we are more accustomed to think of in other ways . The comparison with the octopus was not introduced only because I am personally familiar with the nervous system of // that animal . There was a more subtle reason . We do not find it easy suddenly to change our ways of speaking about ourselves ? say about our memories . But to speak of the memory of an octopus is already so absurd ? almost laughable ? that it is hardly a more unnatural step to compare it with the memory of a machine . The whole point of our new scientific way of speaking is that it does not describe everything only in terms of man , as we are accustomed to do . Therefore it is easier to learn this habit by applying it to two unfamiliar things , such as octopuses and guided missiles , than it would be to try it straightaway on ourselves . In speaking thus of the memory of an octopus one does not have to unlearn first all the familiar ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak scientifically about the memory of man . The details of the behaviour of the octopus may be intriguing , but they are not essential to the argument . I shall resist the temptation to expand on them here . But the compression in this lecture has inevitably made the account of the basic functioning of the nervous system a somewhat sketchy one and it may be worth while to amplify it here by saying more about nerve-impulses and reflex arcs . The greater part of our knowledge about how the nervous system works has come from study not of the brain itself but of the nerves that lead to and from it . These nerves are relatively firm structures that can be pulled about and experimented on easily . One can get some notion of this from the fact that nerves look so much like the tendons that the name nerve ' is actually an adaptation of the Greek word for a sinew or tendon . Pieces of nerve can be removed completely from the body and yet retain their ability to conduct nerve-impulses . Physiologists have therefore preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain tissue , which is difficult to handle and changes its characteristics when its supply of blood is interfered with . Further , the action of the nerves is fairly simple , whereas that of the brain is immensely complicated . It has been very profitable to begin the attempt to find new scientific language // about a subject by looking at the simple things first and finding the units with which the system works . The unit of action of peripheral nerves is the nerve-impulse and physiologists hope that after having learned a lot about nerve-impulses in the nerves they will be able to go on to study how these impulses interact when they reach the brain . This is a good programme only up to a point ; it requires two reservations . The first is that we must not wait too long before getting to work on the brain . A glance through any learned physiological journal shows that most of the work still deals only with the nerves . The second reservation is that we must not assume that we shall understand the brain only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The function of nerves is to carry impulses ? like telegraph wires . The function of brains is something else ? later lectures try to show what . It would probably be wiser now to get to work on brains even more than on nerves , and many physiologists are doing this . Certainly studies of the nerves have been of the very greatest value , because they have shown us a great deal about the way the nervous system works by transmitting information in a code of nerve-impulses . It would be relevant to the theme of the lectures to follow the progress of knowledge on this subject , which has developed hand in hand with improvement in methods for studying small electric currents . The battery that the surface of each nervefibre provides ( p. 26 ) gives a difference of potential of about Both of a volt ? compared to the 2 ? 4 volts of small electric torch batteries . This is not a very small voltage , but it has not been as easy as might be expected to study it . Nerves are not well-insulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watery and it has been no easy matter to find ways of attaching recording instruments to them , as we do to the terminals of a battery when we want to examine its voltage . The difficulty will be very apparent when you remember that the electric potential difference is between the inside and the outside of a nerve-fibre , a structure that // in man and most animals is only 1/1,000th of an inch across . To measure the difference properly , therefore , we have to connect one of our terminals actually with the inside of this very narrow thread . There are various ways of doing this indirectly , but the only really satisfactory way is to push a wire along inside the nerve-fibre . This would be very difficult to do with human nerves , but we have been helped by the fact that a few animals have much larger nerve-fibres . The squids are relatives of the octopus and like these latter move along by squirting water from a sack ? in fact by jet propulsion . The muscles that produce the jet are put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inch thick ( Fig. 1 ) . These large fibres are , of course , much easier to work with than the very narrow fibres of mammals or frogs . Hodgkin and Huxley first showed that it is possible to push a wire inside such a fibre without killing it , and so to measure the voltage and the way it varies when the nerve conducts impulses . Moreover , one can actually squeeze out the inside part and analyse its contents , which are found to contain far more of the substance potassium than does the liquid outside the fibres and far less sodium . This is the difference that was referred to in the lecture as making the fibre into a battery . Hodgkin has now gone on to prove that as the nerve-impulses sweep along the nerve-fibre some potassium leaks out and some sodium leaks in at each point . If the nerve is made to conduct a great many impulses its battery gradually runs down , but in life of course it is continually recharged by an elaborate system that pumps the sodium out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , involves doing work , the energy for which comes from the food that is eaten and combined with the oxygen taken in during breathing ? a process analogous to the burning of coal in a fire . These details may give some idea of how far the physiologist can go in talking about the action of a part of the body by comparison with processes that occur outside the body , and especially in man-made machines . // However , for the purposes of the present discussion it is the way that the impulses carry information along the nerves that is important . The whole animal depends on these messages to ensure that its actions are appropriate to the events in the world around it . Obviously one requirement is that the speed of conduction should be adequate . Electric currents travel along wires at a tremendous speed , but the method of propagation used in nerves is for each stretch of the fibre to discharge and for the current so produced to fire off the next stretch , and so on . This provides conduction at a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . One of these is to increase the size of the conductors . The big nerve-fibres of the squid conduct at about 50 miles an hour , which is much faster than small fibres in the same animal . In this way messages can travel quickly to the animal 's muscles and enable it to dart away from danger or towards its prey . Large nervefibres are found in many other animals that perform quick movements . When you tread on a worm and it retracts with a sudden jerk it uses a giant nerve-fibre for the purpose . Anyone who has tried digging for marine worms on a beach knows how quickly they withdraw . The obvious disadvantage of large fibres is that they take up a lot of room . Big fibres are quite suitable for initiating mass actions , such as the jet of a squid or the withdrawal of a worm , where one nerve-fibre can carry impulses to a great many muscle-fibres and cause them all to shorten at once . Such actions are simple and they can be controlled by single fibres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be impossible if all the musclefibres contracted at once . For such movements it is necessary to have many thousands of nerve-fibres , each controlling only a small amount of muscle . If each of our nerve-fibres was is inch across , like those of the squid , the whole bundle of them necessary even to control the fingers would be thicker than the arm . Fig. 1 shows that in a mammal or man the nerve-fibres are very much smaller , but each one of // them is surrounded by a layer of fatty material that acts as an insulating sheath . This sheath has the effect of making the conduction faster , so that these small fibres conduct at up to 200 m.p.h . Since they are small we can have many thousands of them to carry impulses up from the receptor organs to the brain and down again to the muscles . The fact that a great many nerve-fibres are needed gives us at once an important insight into the system of coding with which the nervous system works . In a telephone system a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human voice . This is because there is a great range of fluctuation in the pulses of current that the wire carries . A single nerve-fibre could not possibly carry the human voice because it has only a very simple way of acting , it can only either respond , or not respond . One way of expressing this is to compare the nerve-fibre with a train of gunpowder : it can either fire or not at each point . If it carries along a message at all it carries its complete message . Nerveimpulses pass either wholly or not at all , and they can not , therefore , become larger or smaller or vary in any way so as to follow the stimulus applied to them , as the pulses in a telephone wire can do . Physiologists call this the all-or-nothing law of conduction . When any receptor organ is stimulated , say by a pinprick in the skin , or a spot of light on the retina of the eye , the nerve-fibre connected with it carries a series of impulses , each exactly like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear as in Fig. 7 , where each spike means that an impulse has passed a particular point on a nerve-fibre . Notice that they are all of approximately the same height , like a series of little equal explosions . A single fibre conducting in this way can only carry a small amount of information , just as one can only signal very imperfectly if all the messages you can send are a series of identical taps on a drum . The nervous system works only with dots , not even with dots and dashes as does the morse code . But suppose you had ten thousand drums and that the rhythm of taps on each of them meant something different , // then you could transmit quite a lot of information . This is how the nervous system works . All over the surface of the body are tens of thousands of receptors , each sensitive to one sort of change , such as touch or rise or fall of temperature . In the eyes , ears , and nose there are millions more . For example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million sensitive cells , known as cones , each connected with a nerve-fibre . When the amount of light falling on any cone changes , the number of impulses passing along the nerve-fibre connected with it is either increased or decreased . All the cones and fibres together thus send to the brain detailed information about the pattern of light and shade that is focused on to the retina . We have therefore a considerable knowledge of the way the whole system works . It uses very large numbers of receivers and of conductors . Each conductor operates in a rather simple way ; it sends impulses of only one sort , varying the number sent per second , but nothing else . Throughout the nervous system we shall find the same plan , very many nerve-fibres or cells , each working in a simple way . In order to describe how a system like this works we have to use language that is rather different from that suitable for our ordinary machines , which have much fewer parts . Unless we are careful we shall forget that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for conveying the information . We have to find ways of speaking about the action of whole populations of cells , as well as about the individual ones . We are helped in this by the fact that science has already developed the mathematical language of statistics for other purposes , including that of describing human populations . In later lectures I suggest that we may be able to advance a long way by applying these statistical methods to the nerve-cells and their traffic of information . The small amounts of information carried by each individual nerve-fibre only add together if at some point in the brain it is possible for the impulses in the different nervefibres to interact with each other . A great part of our problem // be an input from a considerable number of fibres , firing approximately at the same time . In fact the firing of the output cells depends on suitable spacing and timing of the information carried by the input fibres . The cells and their synapses provide as it were the detector or recipient that puts together the information arriving along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherrington was able to show that not all of the input has the effect of exciting the cells to carry impulses ; some input fibres have the opposite effect of quietening the cells down , of inhibiting them . Each cell , therefore , is influenced by a balance of excitatory and inhibitory states ; whether it sends impulses to its muscles depends on which influence predominates . In order to complete our picture we have to think of all the tens of thousands of nerve-cells in the spinal cord and the input converging upon them from millions of receptor fibres and fibres coming from the brain . It is not easy to imagine so many channels ; it is no wonder that we can not describe even what the spinal cord does as exactly as we can describe how a clock works . Some of the connexions are such that the input produces a rather fixed and definite response , which we speak of as a reflex action . A hand waved in front of the eye nearly always produces a blink ; a foot that treads on a tin-tack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibited by the brain , however , and most other actions are controlled in a very elaborate way by input from various sources . The remaining lectures are concerned with trying to show how we can study all the influences that come into play between input and output in a complicated organism such as a man . Third Lecture THE HUMAN CALCULATING MACHINE I rr order to have some picture of how the brain works it is useful to think of it as a gigantic government office ? an enormous ministry , whose one aim and object is to preserve intact the country for which it is responsible . Ten million telegraph wires bring information to the office , coded in dots . These correspond to the sensory or input fibres reaching the brain . In the office one must try to imagine nearly 15,000,000,000 clerks , that is to say more than six times more people that there are at present in the whole world . They correspond to the cells of the brain , and we can imagine them sitting in closely packed rows , as the brain cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone and receives coded messages either from outside the office or from some other part of it . So each nerve-cell of the brain receives nerve-impulses , either from the sense organs or from other brain cells near to it or far away . Each clerk spends most of his time sending code messages on his telephone to some other group , which may be near or far . So every nerve-cell has an out-going fibre , which may be long or short . But the clerks can also influence their neighbours by whispering silence ' ; obviously if a group of them starts doing this then a wave of quiet will pass over that area and it will send out no messages for a while . In this way most elaborate patterns of activity will grow up between the huge numbers of clerks throughout the building . There are circuits by which messages are sent from one department to another and then back to the first and so on indefinitely . Messages will go round and round , but be influenced by incoming messages and by the waves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of the // telephones eventually transmit instructions to workers outside , directing them how to run the country and bring food , drink , and other necessities to the government office . So some of the brain cells carry impulses that control the actions of the muscles , especially those of the hands , tongue , and lips . How would this office be organized , how would it convert the information it received into orders for the governing of the territory it controls ? Everything , surely , would depend on its having arrangements by which all relevant information could be brought together to produce the right answer to every question put to it . This is just what happens in the nervous system . The sense organs transmit information to whichever departments of the brain can use it . But how does the brain bring this information together , so as to send out the right orders to the territory it is responsible for ? the body ? To find this out we may return to the comparison of brains with calculating machines . Information reaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impulses passing up the nerve-fibres . Information already received is stored in the brain either by sending impulses round closed circuits , or in some form corresponding to a print . This is just what calculating machines do ? they both store old information and receive new information and questions in coded form . The information received in the past forms the machine 's rules of action , coded and stored away for reference . When asked a question , it puts it into code , and , by a process that is essentially one of adding and subtracting very fast , the machine can then refer the question to the rules that are already stored in it , and so produce the right answer . Similarly , the brain is constantly relating the new impulses that reach it to the information already stored away in its tissues . To show the closeness of the parallel , think of a machine that would act as a cricket umpire . The wicketkeeper has whipped off the bails and called How 's that ? ' A camera , rather like a television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dots and dashes . The machine // already contains the rules of cricket , also in a code of dots and dashes . The machine could now proceed to fit together the coded report of the situation and the rules and answer with the word Out ' . No such machine has in fact yet been built ? but it might be . Its action would depend on being able to fit together the input from the camera with the rules . Modern calculating machines can do this sort of thing because the code is all in a simple form like dots and dashes , actually 0 's and l 's , and therefore involves adding and subtraction , though an enormous number of calculations may be necessary to determine the answer . The brain has an even greater number of cells than there are valves in a calculator and it is not at all impossible that it acts quite like an adding machine , in some ways . In the second lecture I showed how the information was put into a code of nerve-impulses , and how there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we still do not know exactly how the brain stores its rules or how it compares the input with them . It may use principles different from those of these machines . It is convenient to consider that in the brain the calculations are done at a series of different levels . The part of the brain just above the spinal cord , known as the medulla ( Fig. 9 ) , contains centres for regulating internal functions , such as breathing . These centres are vitally important for the working of the body . Even the smallest damage to them causes death within a few minutes . The surgeon , who is sometimes prepared to remove some of the so-called highest parts of the brain , avoids even the sight of these lower centres , and the thought of touching them fills him with alarm . It is correct , however , to call them lower ? not because they are without importance , but because they are regulators of a rather simple type . The responses that they produce are reached by the combination of information coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain , regulating such activities as breathing , the action of the heart , of the kidneys , of the amount of sugar in the // blood , and so on . For these simple calculations relatively small numbers of nerve-cells are enough . The next level of the brain that we may consider performs rather more complicated calculations . It is known as the hypothalamus and lies near the centre of the head . What goes on there has a profound influence on the well-being of each one of us . Injuries in this region produce changes of some aspect or other of the basic internal functions of the man or animal concerned . Thus one part of the hypothalamus controls temperature : injuries there may produce fevers . Another part controls appetite , and hence the amount of food consumed and whether we get fat . Still more elaborate functions controlled from here are the degree of activity or of sleepiness . One of the earliest clues to the action of the hypothalamus was that these centres are especially frequently damaged by the infectious disease known as sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altered and periods of days and perhaps weeks are passed in sleep . Even the most complicated of our activities are affected by the hypothalamus . It has been noticed that patients who have recovered from sleepy sickness often develop a marked change in their moral character ? usually for the worse . Thus Professor Kennedy , among others , has recorded that a high proportion of children get into trouble with the police after sleepy sickness . Some of them seem to lack all moral sense . They may be restless , bored , or liable to sudden outbreaks of cruelty and aggressiveness , and are without a proper feeling of responsibility for others . We must not jump to extreme conclusions and say that every delinquent is just a person with a diseased hypothalamus . Things are not nearly so simple as that . Other parts of the brain have a great deal to do with social behaviour . Indeed , the hypothalamus does not by any means work as a separate isolated unit . Professor Le Gros Clark and his colleagues have shown that there are numerous nerve-fibres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the brain . This corresponds to Motor cortex Touch input Larynx Speech centres Auditory input Auditory mixing areas " ' ? Touch and optic mixing areas Association areas Optic mixing areas Optic input Cerebellum Output to muscles f L Lowest centres " Look out . ( Medulla ) Fred ! " red ! input from muscles Flo . 9 . Diagram to show some of the pathways involved in a response such as shouting a warning to a child seen about to cross a road . The inverted image thrown on to the retina of the eye causes a discharge of impulses in the optic nerves , which end in the thalamus . From here further impulses are sent to the cortex at the back of the head . The cells of this optic receiving area send impulses to the optic mixing areas and from here they go to many other parts of the cortex . The complicated activity thus set up fits with the existing brain rules to produce impulses in the output fibres of the cortex , such as those shown leading to the motor cells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements for providing feed-back at various stages are shown , including the receptors in the muscles . Many other parts of the cortex would be involved besides those here drawn , and of course instead of the few cells shown millions would be active . // a fact which all of us know , that such conditions as aggressiveness or irritability , though partly independent of our intellectual life , yet both influence and can be controlled by it . The hypothalamus , therefore , is a place that receives nerve-impulses from the internal parts of the body . From this information its calculations establish the general attitude or direction of much of brain action ? the emotional tone , as we might say . But it does not control the details of what we do . That is the function of the great sheet of nerve-cells occupying the top of the head , the cerebral cortex . With its associated parts this makes our main calculating machine , containing thousands of millions of nerve-cells . This is the chief section of our great government office , and employs 99 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brain that sifts the more complicated sorts of information sent in from the outside world and calculates what we shall say and what we shall do . Receiving the nervous messages sent in from the eyes , ears , and touch , it calculates suitable action by the hands and by the larynx and tongue in producing speech . In fact , if we could discover the patterns in which the cerebral cortex acts we should be well on the way to our aim of recognizing , as biologists should , the special means that man uses to obtain his living . Recalling our model of the government office , we shall be warned that the task will not be simple . Imagine trying to understand how an organization including several times more people than there are in the whole world is planned ! Somehow or other the activities of all these millions of cells ensures that suitable actions are performed . Consider the case of the eyes . Nerve-fibres carry impulses from the retina to the centre of the brain . From there other fibres reach to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Input produced even by a tiny spot of light on the retina ? say from a star ? will first influence a tiny area of cortex , but from that small area impulses will be sent far and wide through ' the cortex and eventually , if appropriate , will influence the fibres that make the voice muscles say star ' ( Fig. 9 ) . // The major problem is to understand the pattern of the activities in the brain by which the input is fitted with the memory and produces the action . Consider , for instance , what happens when you call a friend by name across the street . The image of your friend on the retina of your eye sets up a disturbance in the brain , which results in speech . Our problem is to describe that brain disturbance . It is not a disturbance of a previously passive system , but of one already fully active . There is an elaborate pattern of activities going on in the brain . When a sense organ sends input that fits in some way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cortex , therefore , is our great calculating machine for fitting together the parts of the sensory input at any one time and comparing them with previous inputs . Experience has left its mark on the brain , giving it the rules with which it operates , giving it in fact a system of law , of certainty . We can imagine how the circles of messages between the clerks in our government office would control the manner of proceeding , depending , of course , on past experience . The pattern of this activity , together with the filing system of the office , would provide its memory . If the laws embedded in the brain machine are efficient they will enable every input produced by a disturbance outside to be fitted into some pattern that will produce an effective action . That is to say , they will make the muscles do something that will restore the body back to its steady state , the state , you remember , that all organisms tend to preserve . This perhaps gives an inkling of the layout of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving only the very roughest outline ; the details are of hardly imaginable complexity , and we have only begun to unravel them . We do not know much yet abput what goes on in our brains and therefore can not expect educators to educate them properly , psychologists to help us to correct their workings , or surgeons to know whether it is wise to cut pieces out of them . How can we find out more ? We have a lot of apparently // unconnected facts about the brain . We are seeking for a clue that will show how the facts are connected and will give us a good general scheme for understanding the plan of brain action . I believe that we shall find that clue by consideration of the nature of these patterns within the cortex . That is why I have spent so long giving analogies that may at least vaguely suggest what sort of patterns to look for . Meanwhile , what are the different sorts of evidence that we have to use as our clues ? Being an anatomist , I have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arrangement of the cells . We have , however , all sorts of further information about the brain ? for instance , of its electrical activities . In 1929 it was discovered that if you make proper electrical connexions with the surface of the head , then you can show , with a suitable apparatus , that small changes of electrical potential are going on throughout the life of every person ( Fig. 7 ) . The activity of nervous conduction is accompanied by electrical changes , and there is no doubt that the electrical brain waves are in some way a sign of the activities of the brain cells . Probably , as Professor Adrian and others suggest , they are the result of many cells acting together . It may be significant that the waves are most clear when the brain is idling ? for instance , when a person is asleep or daydreaming . Then , apparently , large masses of cells are working in unison . When the person wakes or begins to think , the electrical changes become more complicated . If only we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much nearer to understanding what goes on in our heads . At present we can tell from the brain waves whether a person is awake or asleep , and detect some useful things about the brain ? for instance in relation to epilepsy . But we can not be said yet to be able to read a person 's thoughts from his electrical brain waves . Another whole set of information comes from experiments in which the brain is made to work by electrical stimulation . This is a great help in some cases during brain operations . // A pair of fine wires is placed on the brain surface , and small electrical charges are applied , which have the effect of starting the activity of the brain cells . In some brain operations it is best not to put the patient to sleep , but to use injections of local anaesthetics to prevent pain during the cutting of the skin and bone . The brain can thus be exposed while it is still in its normal waking state , and the person is sensible enough to stay still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time that electrical activation of some parts of the cortex produces movements of various muscles . Sir Charles Sherrington had shown this by experiments on apes . Professor Penfield of Montreal confirmed that , in man , electrical stimulation of points on a strip of tissue down the side of the brain produces movements of the body . When the part of his body moves , the patient feels as if he has to move it ; he does not say that he wills to do so . For instance , when the wires are on the part responsible for speech he may cry out rather like a baby . He is not in pain ? stimulation of the cortex is never painful ? he just feels , to his surprise , that he must cry out . If asked to try to stop he is unable to do so , and he is most intrigued by the whole business . The area of cortex controlling each part of the body is by no means proportional to the size of that part . Thus , the area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than the whole of that controlling the legs . The area for the lips and tongue is very large . There are also large areas whose stimulation stops the patient speaking . He later describes his experience by saying , My tongue suddenly felt paralysed ' , or , I just lost control of my lips ' . In other cases he will say , I could not think any more ' . Evidently the rather crude stimulus is not able to produce the complicated movements of speech ; indeed it actually seems to disrupt the fine patterns of action of the nerve-cells that are responsible for speech . The extent of the cortex connected with each motor function is therefore proportional to the intricacy of the actions it performs . This fact , that such large areas are concerned with the muscles of speech , // is direct confirmation of the thesis that man is primarily a communicating animal . From stimulation of various areas there are reports of sensations ? for example , flashes , balls of white or coloured lights or other vague dancing lights , seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area responsible for hearing produces reports of sounds ? buzzings , ringings , and knockings . These observations , therefore , confirm that the cortex deals predominantly with the receiving systems for touch , vision , and hearing . But the areas that respond in this way occupy less than half of the whole cortex . The remaining parts are of two sorts . First the silent areas , the frontal lobes of the brain , whose stimulation produces no response at all . Secondly there are certain parts known as association areas , whose stimulation sometimes produces complicated sensations and memories . Further insight into the functions of the brain can be obtained from seeing what are the effects of the removal of the various parts , as a result of injury or surgery . I can only outline a few points of this fascinating story . Removal of part of the motor area produces severe paralysis of movement on the opposite side . Thus if a certain part of the left area is removed , the patient 's right arm and hand will be completely paralysed at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruder movements of the whole arm , and then , gradually , some finer movements , though never his full original range of skill and dexterity . Severe damage , by an accident , of the receiving station in the cortex for messages from the eyes results in total and incurable blindness . Damage to the association areas mentioned above produces variable and complicated results . Sometimes the person is hardly changed by their loss , but in other cases there may be most curious defects . The patients may be able to recognize objects but not to name them , to name them but not to read their names , to read but not to write or vice versa , and so on . Injury in certain areas produces complete loss of speech . Evidently damage to these association areas // upsets the pattern of action by which the brain produces communication . Evidently , also , this pattern varies , as we should expect , in different people . The rules by which the brain works are not inborn , they have in the main been learnt . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain are removed have been those in which parts of the frontal lobes are severed from the rest . These lobes lie in front of the motor part of the cortex , and are the region of the brain that is very much bigger in man than in any animals . That is why we have a higher forehead than the apes . Yet separation of this front part produces neither loss of sensation nor motor paralysis . There are , however , slight changes of personality , changes that are usually in the direction of making the person more docile , often more communicative . The exact effects vary a good deal , however . Usually , after the operation there is no loss of any actual function or power , but there is not quite the level of performance and efficiency that is necessary for perfect conduct of the business of life in our society . We can not say that we by any means fully understand the functioning of this most characteristically human part of the brain , but it seems that in some way it operates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Its actions are therefore connected with what may be called the highest levels of communication . Their loss does not involve any alteration of the power to speak or to understand words . Without the frontal lobes a person can still enunciate words properly , but he uses them in socially wrong ways . After such operations patients sometimes became embarrassingly frank , even rude in behaviour . We have therefore a mass of information about the functioning at various levels of the brain system that controls our behaviour . The information is quite new , and could hardly even have been imagined a hundred years ago . Yet it is still very scrappy , and it is important not to get the idea that we understand all about the brain . The information from // different sources is only beginning to fit together . We can not yet say that we have a clear model by means of which we can speak of how the cortex works . The electrical changes going on in it suggest that when it is at rest large numbers of cells beat together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unison . Professor Lashley of Harvard , one of the ablest students of the brain , has suggested that we may compare the complicated waves of action thus started with the pattern of disturbances set up when stones fall on a sheet of water . This analogy , like that of the government office , which I used earlier , has the advantage of reminding us that we must concentrate attention on the patterns of action set up among the millions of cells of the brain . But we are only just beginning to be able to imagine what they may be like . We are still searching for analogies to help us to understand this enchanted loom ' , as Sir Charles Sherrington has called it . From the very number of the analogies I have mentioned , you can see how doubtful we are in this present phase of scientific research . I have compared the brain with a government office , a calculating machine , and with the waves on the surface of water , and one could go on with many more analogies . This whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . It is , however , one of our chief aids to exploring the world and hence to getting a living . Indeed , I hope in later lectures to show that it is a tool we have been using in essentially the same way for thousands of years . For many purposes we have no other means of communication . It is not a question of whether or not to make comparisons but of which comparisons to make . We must use the rules ? the certainties we have established by past experience . It is by comparison with these that each of us shapes his future . We must compare things , because that is the way our brains are constituted . Fourth Lecture THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CERTAINTY I N one of his poems A. E. Housman expresses a feeling we sometimes have ; a feeling of being lost in the Universe , of not belonging there : I , a stranger , and afraid , In a world I never made . A world I never made ? But the researches outlined in the last two lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally create his or her own world . To explain this we must answer the question : How does each brain set up its own characteristic rules ? How do those regular patterns of activity in the cells of the brain described in the last lecture develop ? This is the process that I call the establishment of certainty , and it is a process that we may consider as beginning in each human being at the moment when , as a newly born baby , his eyes open on to the world . He will have received some stimuli before this , but now his brain begins to receive a flood of information from all the senses . From that moment the incoming stimuli begin to leave their mark on the brain , its rules begin to be established . We have no means of examining and recording all that happens in the brains of babies and very young children . But we can learn a great deal that is helpful from the reports of people with certain rather rare forms of blindness who , though born blind , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a specially favourable opportunity by which we may examine , as it were , the phases of childhood being passed through in a person who can talk . What would such a person see ; what would he say , on first opening his eyes on a new world ? During the present century the operation has been done often enough for // systematic and accurate reports to be collected . The patient on opening his eyes for the first time gets little or no enjoyment ; indeed , he finds the experience painful . He reports only a spinning mass of lights and colours . He proves to be quite unable to pick out objects by sight , to recognize what they are , or to name them . He has no conception of a space with objects in it , although he knows all about objects and their names by touch . Of course ' , you will say , he must take a little time to learn to recognize them by sight . ' Not a little time , but a very , very long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained in the rules of seeing . We are not conscious that there are any such rules ; we think that we see , as we say , naturally ' . But we have in fact learned a whole set of rules during childhood . If our blind man is to make use of his eyes he , too , must train his brain . How can this be done ? Unless he is quite clever and very persistent he may never learn to make use of his eyes at all . At first he only experiences a mass of colour , but gradually he learns to distinguish shapes . When shown a patch of one colour placed on another he will quickly see that there is a difference between the patch and its surroundings . What he will not do is to recognize that he has seen that particular shape before , nor will he be able to give it its proper name . For example , one man when shown an orange a week after beginning to see said that it was gold . When asked , What shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and I will tell you ! ' After doing so , he said that it was an orange . Then he looked long at it and said , Yes , I can see that it is round . ' Shown next a blue square , he said it was blue and round . A triangle he also described as round . When the angles were pointed out to him he said , Ah . Yes , I understand now , one can see how they feel . ' For many weeks and months after beginning to see , the person can only with great difficulty distinguish between the simplest shapes , such as a triangle and a square . If you ask him how he does it , he may say , Of course if I look carefully I see that there are three sharp turns at the edge of the one patch of light , // and four on the other . ' But he may add peevishly , What on earth do you mean by saying that it would be useful to know this ? The difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work it out . I can do it much better with my fingers . ' And if you show him the two next day he will be quite unable to say which is a triangle and which a square . The patient often finds that the new sense brings only a feeling of uncertainty and he may refuse to make any attempt to use it unless forced to do so . He does not spontaneously attend to the details of shapes . He has not learned the rules , does not know which features are significant and useful for naming objects and conducting life . Remember that for him previously shapes have been named only after feeling the disposition of their edges by touch . However , if you can convince him that it is worth while , then , after weeks of practice , he will name simple objects by sight . At first they must be seen always in the same colour and at the same angle . One man having learned to name an egg , a potato , and a cube of sugar when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yellow light . The lump of sugar was named when on the table but not when hung up in the air with a thread . However , such people can gradually learn ; if sufficiently encouraged they may after some years develop a full visual life and be able even to read . It takes at least a month to learn the names of even a few objects . Gradually the patient leaves out the laborious counting of the corners and comes to identify things so quickly that , as in an ordinary person , the process by which he does so is not apparent . So it is not that all along the eyes or brain were incapable of acting normally . What these people lack is the store of rules in the brain , rules usually learnt by the long years of exploration with the eyes during childhood . They have no models with which to compare the input , no mould or filter that can be used to select the significant features of visual experience and produce appropriate words and other motor responses . A normal person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // sensory input with motor acts that lead to satisfaction , for instance , naming and the fulfilment of communication . We do not know exactly what happens in the brain as it learns to react to shapes during that period of training . At first the eyes wander at random over the visual field . Probably learning to move the eyes in certain ways is an important part of the process . Compare this with a very young animal wandering at large in the woods , with no clue as to where to find food . Each time he moves in a direction that results in satisfaction of his hunger a link is formed in his brain . This link makes him tend to repeat the movement on a later occasion . Similarly , when the once blind man is told that what he has so far seen as only a patch of light is in fact an orange , he learns that the movements of running his eyes round its outline are useful . His brain subsequently makes his eyes follow outlines , he becomes able to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . So we can believe that the brain gradually comes to act in certain special ways . One of the earliest of these habits gives us the tendency for the eye to sweep along lines instead of in all directions at random . Connexions between the cells in the brain are built up , such that each time the eye rests on a point it tends to follow any lines away from that point . Thus we come to pick out and name the significant objects in the field of vision , neglecting vague shadows . Certain difficulties familiar to everybody give hints of the way the brain is organized . There is no difficulty in learning that the words right ' and left ' refer to horizontal and up ' and down ' to vertical directions . But every child has some difficulty in distinguishing up ' from down ' . On the other hand , in ' and out ' are easily learned . Even as adults many of us have trouble with left ' and right ' , and incidentally also east and west . These difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that although our eyes readily - sweep either from side to side or up and down , yet these two sets of movements are quite distinct . We never confuse // up ' or down ' with right ' or left ' , but there is no such deep distinction between sweeping from left to right and from right to left , and therefore we have difficulty in correctly naming these directions . We do not know what arrangement of the brain cells makes us select lines in this way , but we are beginning to suspect that there is such an arrangement ( see p. 84 ) . From following lines an early step is to learn to attend to circles . There is certainly something about a circle that very readily attracts our eyes . We pick it out from a mass of other input reaching us . On advertisement hoardings the pictures often contain one or several circles ? those who produce advertisements have excellent reasons for finding out what patterns attract the human eye . Designs of circles have played a prominent part in many art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , for example . Evidently there is something about lines and circles that fits easily into the rules of our brain . When we see a line that makes three parts of a circle , or even less , we at once complete it and call it a circle . The brain cells are so arranged that their rules make a model or mould , which selects certain parts of the input for attention and naming . The man born blind , when first given sight had only a lot of colours to look at , but no rules , no models to help him to abstract , to select significant features . Like all those who have not learned the point of abstracting , he could not believe that it was worth while trying to work out anything significant about these coloured patches . They did not seem to mean anything to him . So the paintings of Picasso mean nothing to his angry critics . The once blind man was like all of us in this . He already had his own rules , his own ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was content with these ways and could not see the point of trying to find others . And why not ? ' you may say . Why must anyone seek for new ways of acting ? ' The answer is that in the long run the continuity of life itself depends on the making of new experiments . As we go on with these 5335 F // lectures I hope that it will become plain how the continuous invention of new ways of observing is man 's special secret of living . There is a limit to the extent to which this invention can go on in any one head , but the continuity of life of the whole race will only be preserved if the individual contributes his new invention to the rules that he passes on to others . These most interesting observations on the difficulties of people born blind show that we have to learn from others how to see . The visual receiving system in its untrained state has only very limited powers . We are perhaps deceived by the fact that the eye is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eyes and brain do not simply record in a sort of photographic manner the pictures that pass in front of us . The brain is not by any means a simple recording system like a film . Recognition of this fact of our relativity is one of the most **26;659;TOOLONG of the thought of the present time . Its importance is only now dawning upon us very gradually , and it is a main purpose of these lectures to show what the change means . Many of our affairs are conducted on the assumption that our sense organs provide us with an accurate record , independent of ourselves . What we are now beginning to realize is that much of this is an illusion ; that we have to learn to see the world as we do . These ways of acting that we learn give us a rhythm of behaviour . The brain of course is not a passive mass of tissue , through all waking life it drives along . Woken in the morning by some stimulus , it immediately begins to run through sequences of activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These sequences produce the actions by which the body lives . They are partly touched off by outside stimuli , but , once started , they may run by themselves as independent trains in the brain , each combination starting another one . The life of the new-born child consists largely of sleep , of periods , that is , in which numerous brain cells are firing in unison . We know this because electrical records show that // in a baby there are very large and regular brain waves . This unison or synchrony becomes broken up by the nerveimpulses arising from the receptor organs , internal or external . The receptors are so arranged as to alert the organism that its needs are not satisfied ; it must be up and doing . The hungry baby wakes and cries , giving the sign stimulus that brings the mother 's attention . At first it kicks and clutches at random , until it obtains the milk . When the stomach.is filled , the hunger impulses from it stop , the brain returns to its simple synchronous activity , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each waking episode there are changes going on in the brain . Actions , at first random , develop into little sequences , according to patterns developed during previous wakings , and these become printed or otherwise recorded in the brain . Meanwhile the world does not stand still . The mother becomes gradually less co-operative and the child has to learn to get what it needs by ways other than crying . The eye movements are used to discriminate between faces , cups , and other objects , so that the output of the brain leads to the making of appropriate noises , the giving of names that produce satisfactory actions by others ? that establish communication . The effect of stimulations , external or internal , is to break up the unison of action of some part or the whole of the brain . A speculative suggestion is that the disturbance in some way breaks the unity of the actual pattern that has been previously built up in the brain . The brain then selects those features from the input that tend to repair the model and to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretend to be able to develop this idea of models in our brain in detail , but it has great possibilities in showing how we tend to fit ourselves to the world and the world to ourselves ( see p. 86 ) . In some way the brain initiates sequences of actions that tend to return it to its rhythmic pattern , this return being the act of consummation , or completion . If the first action performed fails to do this , fails that is to stop the original disturbance , then other // sequences may be tried . The brain runs through its rules one after another , matching the input with its various models until somehow unison is achieved . This may perhaps only be after strenuous , varied , and prolonged searching . During this random activity further connexions and action patterns are formed and they in turn will determine future sequences . As the child grows , therefore , the brain acquires a series of ways of acting , of laws as it were , for dealing with the situations that occur to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night succeeds day , and night is a poor time for an animal that mainly depends on its eyes . Therefore we normally sleep by night and wake by day . But notice that this rhythm has to be learned by the child and can be modified and if necessary reversed in the adult . The actual process of association between two inputs to the brain is probably performed rather rapidly in all animals . It was mentioned earlier that an octopus learns after only one or two trials to avoid a white square from which it has received a shock . In birds there is a process of quick learning just after birth by which a young animal learns to react properly to members of its own species . Some feature of the earliest object seen can be imprinted upon the brain of the newly hatched chick and never thereafter forgotten . A German scientist , Dr. Heinroth , found that a young goose , freshly hatched , who saw the doctor before it saw any other goose , thereafter acted in every way as if Dr. Heinroth was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of learning , therefore , a rather elaborate pattern must be printed somehow on the brain ; this pattern thereafter acts as a model and moulds behaviour . The way in which the system of rules is built up in the brain is also shown in the famous experiments of the Russian Professor Pavlov on what he called conditioned reflexes . By ringing a bell just before giving meat to a dog on several occasions Pavlov found that the bell alone soon came to produce a flow of saliva , which did not occur before . In further experiments it was found to be possible to use the // method to train dogs to discriminate between two notes by giving meat after one note but not the other . If the difference between the notes was made too small the dogs became very excited and they refused to stand still and attend to the experiments as they usually did . Pavlov compared this condition with neurosis in man . The doctrine that learning is all of a conditioned reflex type has had an immense vogue in Russia and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet education . Like all systematizations it has some advantages over no systematization at all . But somehow we feel that Pavlov 's analysis leaves out some essential feature of learning as it occurs in man , or at least man as we know him . Because of the limitation of his method , Pavlov actually took elaborate precautions to rule out the very phenomenon he should have studied . He did not include the random trial-and-error behaviour by which an animal or man searches for actions that shall produce satisfactory solutions for its needs . The ? Russian Government built him a wonderful laboratory with every room sound-proof and complicated arrangements to ensure that the dogs should stand quite still and be educated . With his outlook this seemed the right thing to do . It was the right thing to do to get that sort of result , but study by this method alone will not include the most useful forms of human behaviour . If the attempt to show how patterns of action grow up in the brain has been successful , you may now , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the search for the nature of scientific inquiry . I hope to be able to show in later lectures that in this system of brain action lie clues for understanding the development of man as a communicating , family , social , religious , and scientific animal . At all stages we find first random behaviour , as we call it experiment or doubting . Then through observations of connexions between features that occur repeatedly , there is the recognition of similarities and recurrences , the establishment of laws , of certainty . // But we must notice that this process of replacing randomness by law may be a one-way , non-reversible process . The cortex of the new-born baby has perhaps few innate traits , it is in the main a blank sheet of possibilities . But the very fact that it . becomes organized minute by minute , day by day , throughout the years , reduces progressively the number of possible alternative ways of action . Learning the laws of behaving in certain ways makes it increasingly difficult to learn others . We know surprisingly little about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in our brains . They can certainly be to some extent reversed by new circumstances . We may forget , or learn new ways of speaking about the world . Some people manage to go on learning new ways much longer than others . Probably a part of their secret is that they constantly seek new circumstances . The temptation to go on relying only upon the rules already used year in year out is very strong . A really useful and interesting brain is always starting off on new ways . But it is a common experience that this gets more difficult as we grow older . Every night when we are asleep we certainly receive some relief from our rules and wake up that much more alert and ready to observe in new ways . Within limits the longer we sleep the fresher we become . We do not know how far the unison beating of the nerve-cells during the night breaks up the patterns of action of the day . The basic patterns are probably laid down , as already described , in the sizes and connexions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps also be changed , but only with some practice . There seems to be a limit beyond which new patterns and new connexions are no longer easily formed . As we grow older the randomness of the brain becomes gradually used up . The brain ceases to be able to profit from experiment , it becomes set into patterns of laws . The well-established laws of a well-trained person may continue to be usefully applied to situations already experienced , though they fail to meet new ones . Here we see with startling clearness the basis of // some of the most familiar features of human society , the adventure , subversiveness , inventiveness , and resource of the young ; the informed and responsible wisdom of the old . At each stage of the development of our brains we have a special contribution to make , particularly if at each stage we realize that this is not the only stage : that doubt and certainty must be properly balanced . In this lecture we have seen that each brain has to learn its rules of acting . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifying them . In man the brain rules are largely concerned with providing means of communication ; we each learn the accepted way of communicating and this determines our view of the world . We also contribute to the evolution of the race if we improve that system and pass on ways of observing and describing that are a little more powerful than the ones we received . If it is true that each brain has a limited store of randomness , then clearly this process can only go on indefinitely for the race as a whole . To recognize the implications of this evolutionary process is perhaps to see a deeper meaning in the rhythm of birth and mortality . Comment on the Third and Fourth Lectures I N these two lectures I have tried to complete the presentation of how the nervous system works , and especially how it learns . The difficulty here has been different from that of the second lecture , which dealt mainly with the nature of nerve-impulses and reflex action . We have abundant information about those subjects and the problem was to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fourth lectures was that study of the workings of the higher nervous centres has developed much less far ; physiologists themselves have no generally accepted way of talking about how the learning process takes place . Many valuable observations on brain functioning have been made by clinicians and experimentalists , but they remain to a large extent isolated and not joined to form a satisfactorily coherent body of knowledge . However , the fact that it is beginning to be possible to talk more fully about brain functioning is so important in its general implications that I have tried to put some of the ideas that are now being developed into non-technical language . A great deal of the science ' that is described for the layman is so well accepted that the scientist himself is already bored by it . Part of the object of these lectures has been to show the uncertainties that arise as scientists venture to talk in ways to which they themselves are not yet fully accustomed . The thesis is that this extension of communication is often the prelude to entirely new discovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out how that organ functions to control our very elaborate behaviour . They start from the simple notions I have already explained ? that the nervous system consists of a series of governors or regulators . Every time anything happens that // tends to upset the balance of the living system impulses are sent to the brain and actions are set up that tend to restore the balance . Examples of reflex actions that remove the source of a change in the surroundings are familiar enough ; we brush away a fly , or quicken our heart-beat when we run . On the other hand , the behaviour of , say , a writer at his desk or a teacher in her class does not seem to follow the same pattern as these simple reflex actions . Most of the interesting things that human beings do seem at first sight not to conform to the pattern of simple responding to stimuli . Human beings , as we put it , are not simply reactors : we say that they act , they decide , and they exercise will ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much more fully than we have been accustomed to do . Most of our actions are directed towards the maintenance of the integrity of ourselves ? especially if we interpret ' ourselves ' widely enough . The difficulty in describing our actions biologically comes from the fact that the brain uses extremely indirect ways of ensuring this continuity . The things that a new-born baby does are mostly of the type of simple responses to stimuli . But the baby is also provided in its cerebral cortex with an extremely plastic system for learning complicated and indirect ways of behaving . The cortex , after it has fully matured , ensures by a most elaborate system of living that the balance of the organism is maintained . Even primitive man does not wait until he is stimulated by the sight or smell of food : he sets about obtaining it , by hunting or agriculture , hours , days , or months ahead . He uses indirect means such as observing the moon and stars , sowing seeds , or undertaking all the elaborate procedure that is necessary to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modern times he has acquired the habit of getting a living by co-operating with others . It would be easy to multiply examples of the indirect means that we use to satisfy our needs . They seem to be so far from reflex responses that nothing could be gained by trying to speak of them in the biologist 's language . This is // probably the attitude of most people today , because biologists have not shown that their way of talking is powerful enough to be useful for describing the actions of , say , philosophers , parsons , or physicists . Admittedly we are far from happy about our abilities ; it is the attempt of these lectures to show that we can at least do a little more than is usually supposed . An initial point that I hope was well established in the third and fourth lectures is that to an unsuspected extent our brain has to learn before we can even see things . Perhaps we hardly realize how as we grow up we acquire a set of rules that constitutes a way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we rely on for the satisfaction of our needs . It is a commonplace that we all have our habits of thought and action : do we appreciate the extent to which they control the whole of our life ? The biologist seeks to discover how these habits are built up and how the brain controls their performance . We are still far from being able to say clearly all that we should like about this , but what we can say is already useful in all sorts of fields , from surgery to education , psychology , and , I venture to say , philosophy and politics . Perhaps the chief difficulty in speaking about the system that controls our actions is that the brain is such an active organ . Our ordinary language is framed for description of relatively simple sequences of events ; we expect to be able to speak about the cause of each event in terms of what went immediately before . When we can not see simple agents at work controlling a man 's behaviour we invent them . For example , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier history and some action we give up the attempt and say , it was his will ' , inventing the will because we are not competent to analyse the situation more fully . If we are to be able to understand and control ourselves better we have to be prepared to examine the actions of an extremely complicated system . We shall only be able to forecast its future if we look not merely for an immediate // cause , but far into its past history . Moreover , our forecast will always be of its probable behaviour , not of exactly what it will do . Some further details about the various parts of the brain and the way that they act may be helpful in achieving this end . The cortex is first and foremost the store of the rules that a person has learned from past experience . It fits the events that occur in the world around to these rules , producing some solution that shall ensure continuance of life . To perform this function the cortex has arrangements to receive input from the receptor organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these is the vast system of cells that constitutes the store of the rules and provides for the fitting-together process . The input all reaches the cortex through a region known as the thalamus , which lies at the centre of the brain . Large numbers of nerve-fibres run to this region from the eyes , ears , and receptor organs in the skin . From the thalamus other fibres pass to receiving areas in the cortex , as shown in Fig. 9 . Each of these fibres of course carries trains of nerve-impulses of the sort already described . When a pattern of light and shade falls on the retina , say the image of a circle , information is projected from the retina to the thalamus and from there on to an area of the cortex . It must be remembered that each nerve-fibre can convey only a simple sort of information ? like a series of taps . But the whole system can convey complicated information , provided that the great number of simple pieces of information can be brought together . The cortex is so arranged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth while taking a somewhat closer look at how it does it . The individual cells of the cortex are essentially like those already described in the spinal cord . They have receiving processes ( dendrites ) and an outgoing fibre or axon ( Fig. 10 ) . The fibres coming from the thalamus , which bring the input of information , end in complicated branches among the receiving dendrites of the cortical cells . Unfortunately , we 7 ( ' 1 1 1 1 . I STAB ( 1 1 I I M I N I n i @#@ i U I A I N I Y know remarkably little about the details of the ay these incoming fibres end . In Fig. 12 they are shown quite diagrammatically ending close to the dendrites of the cortical cells ; a synaptic relationship similar to that provided by the knobs on the dendrites of cells of the spinal cord ( p. 47 ) . Such knobs have indeed been described in the cortex , but it is probably safest at present to regard the essence of cortical synapses as produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cells . Presumably the actions of the input fibres on the cortical cells are very like the actions of the fibres that reach the spinal cord , especially in that each cortical cell is influenced not by one but by many of the input ? fibres . This provides the essentials of the arrangement for collecting the information together . For example , impulses arriving from the retina along a number of widely separated fibres will activate only a few cortical cells , or none at all , so that no massive cortical process will be set up . But similar impulses coming along suitably grouped fibres will co-operate in starting off a number of cortical cells , which will initiate action in the cortex that ends , for example , in saying Give me that apple ' . Perhaps it is not too difficult to imagine how interaction is possible in this way , but it is hard indeed to follow all the details of the system . The cortical cells are arranged in layers , about 100 deep , and the receiving dendrites are interlaced in an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been activated impulses are sent along its output nerve-fibre either to some nearby region or to a distant part of the cortex . For example , around the area to which information from the retina is projected there is another large area also concerned with vision ( Fig. 9 ) . Each point in the first receiving-field connects not with one but with many parts of this second visual area . And from there connexions reach sooner or later to many , perhaps all , parts of the cortex . The impulses arriving at any one point in the first visual cortex therefore have a chance in the second visual area , and subsequently , of interacting with messages coming in from other parts of the retina. // This is exactly the plan that we should expect if the brain is to be able to react not to simple flashes of light but to objects seen , as we say , as a whole . Clearly what we mean by saying that a person reacts to a pattern of light as a whole is that somehow the rays of light coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must therefore be some mixing-place , as it were , in the brain where the effect of the light from each point can interact with that from others . We find this mixing-place in the second visual area . It may be that a great part of the secret of the brain 's powers is the enormous opportunity provided for interaction between the effects of stimulating each part of the receiving fields . It is this provision of interacting-places or mixing-places that allows us to react to the world as a whole to much greater degree than most other animals can do . We have , that is to say , a machinery that allows for all the different influences impinging upon us to interact and thus to weigh up the situation . This is the great doubting machine , the machine for fitting together the parts of the sensory input at any one time and comparing them with previous inputs . For , in some way , previous experience has left its mark on the machine , giving it rules with which to operate , giving it its system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wiring of the brain are efficient they will enable every sensory input that disturbs the rhythmic beating to be fitted into a pattern that will produce an effective output ; that is to say , will make the muscles do something that will restore the system back to its steady state , the state that all organisms tend to preserve . To be able to understand all this more fully we should like to know much more about how the output of the cortex is controlled . Unfortunately the exact way in which the cortical output originates from the different parts of the great sheet of grey matter is still a matter of some dispute . Many long fibres arise from the strip running down the side of the head , above the ear , known as the motor cortex ( p. 57 ) . Fibres arising from this region certainly run to the motor // neurons of the spinal cord , the ones that control the movements of the muscles of arms , legs , tongue , and so on ( see p. 47 ) . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cortex , perhaps from al parts . This account gives some idea of the basic plan and arrangement of the brain . Each of the main input systems has a similar projection plan , first to the thalamus and then from there to some area of the brain . There is thus given , as it were , a representation on the surface of the receiving parts of the cortex of all the events that are influencing the surface of the body . For example , when a point on the finger-tip is touched , an appropriate part of the cortex becomes active ( Fig. 7 ) . When a particular note sounds , impulses are set off by the sensitive cells in the ear , and are transmitted , through the thalamus , to a particular part of the auditory receptive area . It is important to notice that the receiving systems that have this cortical projection , those of the eyes , ears , and organs of touch , are the very ones that we rely on to give us our picture of the world of objects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There are no true cortical areas for smell , taste , pleasure , or pain . Smell is in a special position because the part of the brain connected with it is very close to the cortex ; indeed the study of animal brains shows that the cortex has grown as it were out of the smell brain . There is still a definite smell cortex , but this has quite a different plan of organization to the rest , and has a very simple structure with relatively few nerve-cells . Man is an animal that computes rather little with smells ; they have a strong effect on determining the general course of his behaviour , as we say a strong emotional effect , but he does not use them to determine the details of his behaviour . This all agrees with the fact that the smell centres are connected with the hypothalamus . We must not , however , dismiss smell as unimportant . We have a mechanism that enables us to discriminate by smell between a very large variety of substances ; also a smell may evoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be conORGANIZATION // nected in some way with the memory system of the cortical computor . We can learn much from these hints . Evidently the true cortical structure must be connected with the special types of computing that are appropriate to sight , hearing , and touch , producing especially the movements by which the animal or man learns to obtain a living . The method by which the computation is performed seems to depend on the fact that from each of the primary receptive cortical areas impulses are conducted first to a surrounding secondary or mixing area , where the exact arrangement corresponding to the body surface is lost . From these secondary areas there is then further conduction to many if not all parts , including to the motor cortex and other areas whose output controls the motor centres of the spinal cord . Each part is thus connected with the one ahead , as it were , in a chain from the outer world , through the sense organs and brain back to the world again through the muscles . A significant point is that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fibres that carry impulses from the thalamus to the cortex there are others from the cortex to the thalamus ( Fig. 9 ) . The occipital cortex sends fibres to the area around it and this area sends fibres back to the occipital cortex . Probably the motor area , besides sending messages down to the muscles , also sends them back to the other parts of the cortex . And the muscles themselves contain sense organs of their own , which send messages up to the nervous system , recording how the muscles are acting upon the world . We have seen already that this so-called feed-back plan runs through the whole organization of animals . It is the characteristic plan of regulators or governors , serving to keep the system in stable action . It is therefore very interesting to find it throughout the details of brain connexions . This account gives an inkling of the layout of the whole thalamo-cortical system , enough perhaps at least to suggest that study of the brain is likely to be worth while and to tell      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
