In the front room of a sprawling , neo-Tudor house in the English village of Burgess Hill one night last week , a husky young man &; woman from the Soviet zone of Germany , a coffee-skinned youth from India , a trim girl from Finland and a swarthy boy from France were hard at work studying the Bible . In the chapel at the rear of the house , a music class was in progress ; a Berliner was at the piano , an English girl played the viola ; a boy from Silesia whittled away at the violin . In a small side room a pink-cheeked Yugoslav and a chubby Hollander were boning up on the Epistles . The International Bible Training Institute was beginning its fourth year . <P> Young , Healthy &; Devout . The institute 's purpose is to train missionaries , but not missionaries to the outposts of civilization . Most of its graduates go back to their homes to reclaim backslid Christians and to evangelize those whom Naziism or Communism have deprived of the barest knowledge of Christianity . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the institute 's founder and principal , Frederick H. Squire . Evangelist Squire , 46 , began saving souls at the age of ten as a soprano cornetist in the Salvation Army . He spent twelve years in the Army , and in 1930 , he set out to tour Britain as a free-lance evangelist . As a welfare worker on the Continent after World War II , Squire was shocked at the spiritual as well as physical deprivation the Nazis had left behind them ; when he returned to England he set up a school especially to train European workers . <P> Candidates for the institute must be young , healthy and devout , with some musical ability ( to back up hymn-singing ) . Those who are unable to pay the $400 all-inclusive fee for a two-year course are taken free of charge , with pocket money included . So far , only two of the institute 's 60 alumni have strayed from the evangelistic fold . <P> What is Wrong . Principal Squire is making a special effort to get students from behind the Iron Curtain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three Soviet-zone Germans are currently enrolled . Said one of them last week : " You can still go to church under the Communist regime , but it 's not the same . . . Many of us have begun to realize under Communism what is wrong with the church . It is this : the church retains its trappings of old , but it has lost much of what goes on beneath them . . . In these circumstances , Communism finds little real opposition . " <P> Evangelist Squire , who has made 15 trips to the Continent in the past two years , will soon head for Berlin to find other young people for his institute . Says he : " We 've only begun to fight for Christianity behind the Iron Curtain . "
