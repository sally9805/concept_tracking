Smiling , venturing a word or two of high-school Spanish , and shaking thousands of hands , Vice President Richard Nixon last week turned his tour of Central America into an unaffected show of friendship among backyard neighbors . To the official ceremonials that stretched his days to 16 and 18 hours , he brought an old political campaigner 's grinning stamina ; to the warmly human situations that arose as he made friends with humble people , he brought good-natured aplomb . <P> In Guatemala , when Nixon asked a market woman about her husband , she rocked him by answering , " I have no husband , just babies " ; he did n't bat an eye . In El Salvador , children sang The Star-Spangled Banner in quaint English and proudly confided that they were from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt School ; he grinned . In Honduras hundreds of swooping bicycle riders turned the Vice President 's dignified motorcade into a happily disorganized parade ; he was delighted . <P> Reluctant Peacemaker . When he reached feuding Nicaragua and Costa Rica , Nixon found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months before January 's Nicaragua-based invasion of Costa Rica , had not been aimed at ending tension between the countries . But Nixon found the role of peacemaker forced on him by 1 ) the understandable U.S. desire to see the little cold war ended ; and 2 ) the persistent belligerence , impossible to ignore , of those two articulate , extrovert Presidents , Nicaragua 's Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza and Costa Rica 's Jose ( " Pepe " ) Figueres . <P> Nixon 's Constellation had barely landed in sweltering Managua before Tacho wheeled him into the presidential palace to see an exhibit of arms ; they were captured , said Tacho , from Costa Rican-based thugs sent to assassinate him last April . Vowed Tacho to accompanying newsmen : " I will not shake hands with the man who hired assassins to murder me and my family . " Later , in private , Nixon tactfully persuaded Tacho to promise that there would be no further disturbances on the Nicaraguan-Costa Rican frontier . <P> Figueres similarly initiated Nixon 's visit to San Jos by telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somoza , " but he also wound up by assuring Nixon privately that he would " go more than halfway " to head off any more tension . The publicity Nixon turned on them may well keep them peaceful-for a while . <P> Final Surprise . Nixon finished his isthmian tour by listening to a startling opinion and delivering two of his own . In Costa Rica and later in Panama , he : <P> Heard Pepe Figueres , long a critic of the U.S.-owned United Fruit Co. ' s operations in Costa Rica , passionately defend the firm from a pending U.S. Department of Justice antitrust suit . Figueres argued that United Fruit 's " bigness . . . has led to the stability of our banana production . " <P> Defended U.S. Information Service libraries abroad as the " backbone of our propaganda program , " said the attacks they suffered in 1953 from McCarthy Investigators Roy M. Cohn and G. David Schine were " undeserved . " <P> Urged that the 3,200-mile Texas-to-Panama section of the Pan American Highway be finished in a U.S.-sponsored speed-up that would close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
