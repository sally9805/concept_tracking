Full Circle A Story by Bentz Plagemann j IM and Lois Andrews and their twelveyear-old son , Jimmy , were sitting in their living room after dinner when they heard the crash on the road in front of their house . It was such an overwhelming noise that at first Jim did n't know what it was . But little Jimmy seemed to know at once . " An accident , " he said , and rushed toward the front door . Lois , with the impulse of a mother , that complex reaction composed of many things all realized at once , as if a darkened landscape were illumined by a flash of lightning , called to him to stop . Jim knew afterward that it was not fear for Jimmy 's safety alone that made her call , but fear of what he might see there . But he was gone . Jim followed his son . It was a night of early spring , unseasonably warm , and as he crossed the veranda and vaulted the low rail he could hear in the terrible silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marsh across the road . He ran over the lawn under the dark shadow of the maples and pushed his way through the hedge . The car was there on the other side of the road . It had sheared three fence posts and broken a telephone pole at its base which still hung , however , by its wires . The car , an old sedan , was tilted crazily to one side , supported by the front door which had apparently sprung open . Under the door was the body of a man . Two cars had pulled up behind the wreck and their drivers hurried forward . Together they were able to raise the car to an uprightposition . Dust still hung in the air , which seemed to echo with a clamor they could almost hear . The man groaned and Jim was astonished . If he lived it was a miracle ; the door had seemed to bisect him where he lay . " I 'll telephone , " said Lois , who had followed behind , and she turned and ran back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim said . Jimmy did not move . He stared at the man in the road with wide , blank , fascinated eyes . Jim went to him and shook him by the shoulder , roughly . " Go with your mother , " he said . Jimmy turned away reluctantly and went toward the house . There was no blood on the road , no exterior sign of injury . Jim stooped and loosened the man 's clothing and looked for hemorrhage . The man still breathed heavily , each breath ending in a groan , but still Jim could see nothing requiring immediate first aid . He had learned about that in the war , and he turned to the circle of people who had now silently gathered in the road and said quietly , " We 'd better not touch him until a doctor comes . " Lois ran back . " I called the police , " she said breathlessly . " An ambulance is on the way . " She had snatched up a blanket as she came , the plaid carriage robe which lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the man with this . It was amazing , Jim thought , with some private part of his mind that still seemed to function normally , how all of them remembered the lessons of the war . They all stood and waited . " He was doing seventy when he passed me , " one of the men in the group said . " He must have lost control . " " Who is he ? " " Is he dead ? " Lois knelt by the man , shielding his face with a corner of the robe , and Jim knew that she must know how futile this was , but he was grateful to her for appearing so competent and composed . A thin stream of mucus and blood trickled from the man 's mouth and nostrils , and Jimmy stood there again , beside his mother , his hands in his pockets , his face expressionless and cold , his eyes fixed on the groaning man . Jim repressed a sudden impulse to go to his son and thrash him , shake him by the shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Jimmy is beginning adolescence , they said . It is difficult to understand your child in adolescence . Jim dutifully reminded himself of this and restrained himself . He had taken to reminding and restraining himself a great deal lately , at what seemed the alien behavior of his son . " Oh , why do n't they hurry ! " a woman in the crowd said , and as she spoke another figure joined them , a man who stepped out of the shadows of the road . Jim recognized the Reverend Mr. Campbell from the village church . He had never met him but he had seen him once or twice at the post office . The Reverend Mr. Campbell wore a clerical collar and that expression of careful repose which Jim imagined all ministers must practice before a mirror . But now he was surprised at the feeling of relief which came to him with the appearance of the minister . The Reverend Mr. Campbell looked at the man in the road and at the group about him . " If there is no doctor here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do as men , then we must pray . " The men in the group who wore hats removed them , self-consciously , and the Reverend Mr. Campbell folded his hands and inclined his head . " The Lord is my shepherd , " he began . " I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters . He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake . Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death - . . " ( There was a siren now , distant but growing clearer , its wail rising and falling on the night air. ) " / will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me . Thou preparest .. . " The doctor . the nurse , the attendant who jumped from the ambulance almost before it had stopped brought a note of brisk efficiency and the consolation of action to the scene . They flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stretcher , but when they had gently turned the man in the road , to raise him to the stretcher , he exhaled on a last rattling sigh and was dead . B ACK in the house they stood uncertainly in the hall at the foot of the stairs . Lois ran her hand absently over the folded robe across her arm and Jim lighted a cigarette . " Who was that man ? " Jimmy asked . His hands were still in his pockets , his face still wore its clear , untroubled look . When Jim met his eyes he tried to withhold himself ; he tried not to read into that expressionless glance the things that troubled and frightened . him . " I do n't know , " he said . " I hope he did n't have a family . " " Oh , not that man , " Jimmy said . " I mean the man who stood in the road and said such funny things . " Jim and Lois looked at each other quickly above his head and in Lois 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll go up to bed now , " Lois said in her mother 's voice , the voice that said all was well , mother will take care of everything , the family is together , the family is safe . And hearing it Jim pushed down the thought that her reassurance was unnecessary , a sop to their own feelings and reactions , an adult annoyance to be endured by their cold , strong son . " He was almost cut in half , " Jimmy was saying clearly , going up the stairs . " The door was right on top of him . " " Yes , dear , " Lois said . " Do n't talk about it , dear . I 'll read to you from the Russian story book so you can go to sleep . " Jim turned into the living room . He got the whiskey bottle from the cabinet , and he went into the kitchen for a glass and some ice , He poured himself a stiff drink and sat down beside the fireplace in which the log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable and shaken . The accident was a terrible thing , surely , but the tragedy was the tragedy of the man in the road and his family . He , Jim Andrews , must not relate it to his own concern . It was a kind of neurosis , was n't it , if all external thought and action related back to one 's own private Gethsemane ? The world was increasingly a place of disorder and violence , and he must find a place for them to live in it , and a way to bring up his son , but it seemed to him they had been approaching that place since they moved , and he must sit there now and think about that . He must resolve and bring into proper perspective this incident which had opened up his negative reflections , like a wound that had not quite healed . I T WAS almost three years after the war was over before Jim Andrews began to talk seriously about leaving New York City . " I thought it would settle down , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where they came from . But they do n't . It 's getting to be impossible to live here . Even the taxi drivers are going to psychiatrists . " " Yes , dear , " Lois said . " You want to go to the country , I want to go to the country , and even Jimmy thinks he wants to go to the country . You do n't have to sell it to us . " The Andrews ' friends , the other editors from publishing houses , the writers of fiction , the writers of non-fiction who wrote about the state of the world , and what would happen when the atom bombs fell , were not surprised by this sort of talk . It is possible , since most of them were rather better at talking than listening , that they did not even hear it . Almost everyone in New York talked about moving to the country . It was a staple of conversation at cocktail parties ; but in moving to the country there was a pattern to be followed . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commuting range , or on the far reaches of Long Island , and you went there weekends in the summer , or sent your family there if you had one . No one they knew commuted daily . If you commuted that meant you lived in a suburb , a fate worse than death . In the suburbs they had things like garden clubs and churches , and they still played bridge , like colonists not quite aware of the changes taking place in the central civilization . It would have astonished these articulate people , the friends of the Andrews , if they had known the Andrews meant business . That they meant to move away to live , giving up their apartment . This decision had come slowly even to them . Jim had begun by saying that things did n't seem to " add up . " " It 's pressure all the time and I 'm damned if I see where it 's taking us . " There were a few signposts , however , of this direction , and Jim thought about them often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance . How was he growing up ? They sent him to a private school in mid-town , not because they were against public schools , as they said , and their friends who had children said . It was just that the public schools were n't any good . You heard stories about not enough textbooks to go around , and the buildings were poisonous and old , and your children were thrown into all sorts of things that you could n't cope with . The influences were subtle and difficult to discuss because if you voiced them you might be accused of snobbery or intolerance . They wanted Jimmy to go to college and few of the students at public schools in mid-town Manhattan went on to college . Their thoughts were geared differently ; they matured more quickly , like the central Europeans who were their parents ; they took up with girls at an early age ; they formed gangs and got into trouble with the police . No , the public school was out . At the vaguely progressive private school where Jimmy went instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could almost persuade yourself that your family and their families formed a community within New York similar to the one in which you had grown up . You called on each other , and maybe you put your boy into the Grays , or sent him to dancing class , and the girls went on the Cotillion list , and if you did n't think about it very closely you could think that all of it was fine . But sometimes at night Jim Andrews wondered about this . This community within a city was a narrow world and some of the influences you were exposed to there were almost as subtly wrong as the influences you would have had to deal with in a public school . For instance in the town where Lois and Jim had grown up they knew the " right people " certainly , but they also knew many good people who were not in this classification . Jim 's best friend , as a boy , had been the grocer 's son , who later won a scholarship to the same college Jim had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football team , a friendly , popular boy known as " Spud , " had been the son of a day laborer . Jim , senior , he decided , had grown up in the nearest thing to a classless society that possibly the world could produce , but his son was growing up in a world quite different , where boys had dinner jackets at fourteen , and went to theater parties , and often came in from play in the late afternoon to find their parents and their parents ' friends all slightly drunk around the cocktail table . While they were still as young as Jimmy the children lived a kind of subterranean existence in a world whose boundaries were defined by apartment house superintendents and park attendants . Once Jim had discovered that Jimmy and his friends had found a way to enter a deserted brownstone house , by crossing from the roof terrace of one of their homes and going down the broken skylight . Two of the boys had air rifles and they shot at rats in the old house . The thought of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , the rats and the dust , made Jim shudder with revulsion , but he had no sooner put a stop to these forays by getting the city to board the house up more completely than he learned that all of the boys were gathering in the basement of another apartment to play " murder " and " doctor " with the little neighbor girls . Jim reminded himself that he had gone harmlessly through the sex experiment stage , and certainly Jimmy was with the " right people " while doing this  --  the apartment house was one of the most expensive and " restricted " in the neighborhood , and two of the little girls involved lived there  --  but there was something wrong about it . Something that contrasted jarringly in his mind between the picture of the dark basement ( and the smirking superintendent who told him what went on there ) and the memory of the clean-smelling hayloft behind the Brown 's house where lie and his childhood friends had tickled thegiggling little girls they knew . No , Jimmy 's life was as wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I never thought I 'd hear myself saying I wanted to leave New York , " Jim said to Lois . " We came here by a long road , and I 've enjoyed it , but now it 's driving me crazy . I must be getting old . I find myself asking questions about what kind of life I want , or what I want from life , or where it 's taking me . " " What do you want from life ? " Lois asked gravely . When she said this and Jim looked at her he remembered the girl she had been and the passion which had drawn them together , passion which had mellowed but sustained itself . " I do n't know , " Jim said . " It is a crazy world , but sometimes I think it ought to make some sense . Maybe it is falling apart at the seams . " " When you figure it out , " Lois said lightly , touching his face , " tell me about it . I depend on you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home from the office , that blessed time of day with the sun 's glory touching the end of each west street and softening all contours , the lamps would be lighted in the apartment , reflecting on the glass and silver array of cocktail things on the coffee table , and then , indeed , it was home and a graceful and charming place . This was what the visiting writers and their other friends in the publishing world saw . Lois had accomplished her everyday miracle ( she had Thelma only three afternoons a week ) , and dinner would be on its way , and if there were more than six to sit down at table the silver and china would be set out buffet style on the table in the foyer , with the large wooden salad bowl , and some kind of casserole brewing . They would have cocktails and the telephone would begin to ring again , and every night , no matter what they planned , there would be some minor emergency . An editor 's working day ends only with bed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer asked to dinner would bring a friend , or forget to bring his wife , or call to say that he would be late . Editors were rather like the poles around which a form of life gravitated ; they were supposed to be intelligent and calm and con-sistently good-humored ; they were there to be visited and to listen . Fiction writers talked of themselves , and non-fiction writers talked of themselves and the world . All the familiar names and keys and references would be trotted out and bandied about , taken up or dismissed . Kafka and Kierkegaard , Sartre and Tennessee Williams , Gide and Proust ; or Toynbee and Einstein , Freud and Adler , Laski and Marx . If the writers were young and clever there would be wicked and witty talk about Capote and Vidal and McCullers and John Horne Burns . Everyone knew everything . Period . Sometimes that depressed Jim Andrews more than anything else about his life . Everyone was so knowing and articulate . Once , in a kind of reflex , he looked up the latter word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Jointed ; segmented . " That amused him , for no apparent reason . All the people they knew were jointed and segmented ; they fitted together into some kind of vast , neat , crazy pattern which appeared to mean nothing at all , except possibly that nothing meant anything at all . When you knew everything existence became pointless . If you knew all about the myth of God and the science of the id and atomic energy and communism versus Catholicism and the fallacy of democracy and the future of civilization there was hardly anything left to live for . And all of these people , of course , all of these bright , witty , charming , attractive people were desperately unhappy in some way or other . Each had his rock and chain , each his own private eagle tearing at his vitals . They talked entertainingly of their analysts and of all the secrets of their disordered lives . The room would be full of their laughter and despair . So the evening would go on . There might be more people than had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last-minute shifting in the time of dinner or the number of forks and plates put out , and sometimes Jim or little Jimmy would be sent on a quick errand to the corner delicatessen for a tin or glass of something to augment the menu . Jimmy himself would be alone during most of this . If he brought a friend home with him from school the friend would have to return to his own home and dinner before the cocktails were finished . Jimmy might make a brief , shy appearance at the doorway and be greeted effusively by alcohol-stimulated people who had no children of their own , but then he would retreat to his own room ( How lucky he is to have a room of his own ! And how lucky for you when you entertain ! ) and there he would listen to murder mysteries on the radio or read comic books until it was time for bed . " At least , " Jim would say , " we do always manage that . We do get to bed . " Lois would murmur something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall quickly asleep , her saving virtue . But Jim would lie awake , his nerves overstimulated , his spirits depressed . Writers always hated to go home ; they did n't have to get up in the morning . Jim knew he must sleep . The city streets were filled with night sounds , the scream of sirens or ambulances or fire trucks , the rumble of street-cleaning equipment . There would be occasional drunken shouts from below , and across the courtyard a baby would cry fretfully , or there would be the sound of laughter and music from a party still going on somewhere . He slept after a while , however , in the grimy , still air , and soon it would be morning , with all of it to do over again . And where was it getting them ? Where did it lead ? The trouble was Jim Andrews really liked his job . He would n't want to do anything else . " But in the old days , " he said to his wife , " writers seemed to live somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they had an idea they could n't call you on the telephone or come to see you , they had to sit down and write it to you and I think that helped develop the idea and saved time in the end . At least it saved my nerves and let me have some life of my own . " " Well , " Lois said , " if the writers have left the country for New York , maybe we 'll have to go to the country to get away from them . " T HEY made the usual circuit in their early search for a house , driving out on Sunday or Saturday afternoon to nearby Connecticut , Long Island , New York state . " There must be some place Helen Hokinson does n't know about , " Lois said . And finally in New Jersey , quite unexpectedly , they found what they were looking for , just as if it had been waiting for them . An old house , a kind of combination Dutch and Greek revival , with an arched barnlike roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Starling . " You might have found the town and then looked for a house , " Lois said , because the town seemed so perfect , a small but complete unit , with a school , church , general store and post office combined . It seemed almost ridiculously easy . The house was fairly sound and unoccupied only because of an estate settlement ; after some minor alterations and repairs they were able to move in in early spring . ( It was only after%yard that things began to catch up with them , the fact that they had moved to Starling without knowing who any of their neighbors were , the change of pace from city living to country living . ) But after his first day at school , Jimmy came home with the news that " Howler " Jackson was in his class ; they had started to school together . Lois went to the telephone at once and asked for their number . " Dears ! " Sally Jackson said . " Why did n't you let us know you were moving here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lois said . " I do n't suppose I really knew this was where you lived . " " Why , you 're surrounded by old friends , " Sally said . " The Claibornes are here , and Tony March , and Catherine and Buck Thompson , and Carl Ruppert . " " Oh my God , " Lois said . " We call it the house of exile , " Sally went on . " It 's the retreat from the city . " When Jim came home from the office that evening Lois told him about it . ' ' / said we 'd go for cocktails , " she explained , a little doubtfully . " At least we can take Jimmy along . They can play outside . That 's one advantage of the country . " The living room at the Jacksons was filled with people when they got there . They sat on the chintz-covered sofa by the shelves filled with books ; they stood in front of the fireplace ; they overflowed into the kitchen . Paul Jackson went around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , the same faces , voices , inflections , and topics of conversation . There was a magazine editor among the guests , a public relations man , a young , unpublished writer talking about the atom bomb . " I think you are outside of the danger area , " he was saving , " al-though the actual radius of activity has not yet been determined . And , of course , the bomb is being improved all the time , and there will be other things . Biological warfare and that sort of business . " Jim went over with his drink and joined the group around Tony March , whose last book of poems was being spoken of as the probable Pulitzer Prize winner . " I 've lived here three years , " March was saying , " and sometimes I think it was a misguided idea . A newcomer is always a stranger here , even after a lifetime . It takes two or three generations to belong . " " But why do you want to belong ? " someone asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I began to be frightened of the isolation I had tried so hard to create for myself when I was younger . After my analysis was over with last year , you know , I could n't even write . I was free , but I might as well have been dead . I thought I ought to get back to fundamental things . " - " You did write again , " the same man , whom Jim did not know , said . " Oh , yes , " March said . " I found my isolation again . I found it , oddly enough , in the church here in the village . " " What do you mean ? " " It was while I was trying to belong , " March said , " I thought if I went to church I might be accepted as a part of the community . There 's a man named Campbell there , an unctuous sort of man , good but unimaginative . What I call a red-letter version of a minister . Knows all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I discovered myself looking at him like that , and at the other people around me in the pews , I knew I never could be a part of them . You ca n't go home again , as Tom Wolfe said . I began to compose my last poetry , right there in the pew . " Jim looked down into his glass which Paul had just refilled on his circuit of the room . He was tired and the drink had affected him quickly , so that he felt detached and alone . He began to think of the church of his childhood , which he had n't thought about in years . It had been a simple structure , of white frame , with the square base for a steeple which had never been built . When he had been old enough to leave Sunday School and attend service he had sat there between his mother and father on the flat tufted cushion in the odor of piety , which had seemed composed of the smell of varnish and the scent of faded flowers . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father said , and Dr. Robinson , their own Reverend Mr. Campbell , had been a sensible man who knew about investments and mortgages as well as the red-letter words of Jesus . He had bored Jim almost to madness and while sitting there , unable to follow the meaningless words , he had entertained himself by looking at the small , stained-glass trinity window behind Dr. Robinson , which shed its violet light on his carefully combed , thin hair . There was a representation of a small boy 's head surrounded by an aureole pressed into the colored glass ; Jim never knew whether it was meant to be Jesus or one of his angels . But he had finally decided that it was Jesus himself , and that Dr. Robinson kept him imprisoned behind the glass . He was keeping Jesus out because he was not welcome there . There was no room for the whole disordered violence and beauty and meaning of Jesus ' life in that neat little church with its white pews and carefully stained floor , where the trustees met solemnly to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front steps . That was the church Jim had gone away from and his going away had been a symbol . It had meant a departure from the faith and the values of his father 's world . Lois broke into Jim 's reverie by coming to him with a troubled face to say that Jimmy was in trouble . He and Howler had been playing ball outside and they had broken a window in a car belonging to one of the guests . Jim located the owner ; it was the public relations man , a Mr. Fiske . Mr. Fiske laughed and said not to worry , boys would be boys . He clapped the two of them on the shoulder and drew them together and said that he had broken windows in his time and they should forget it . " It was n't my fault , " Jimmy said , looking down at the ground . Jim could feel his temper rising and he cautioned himself to take it easy . " It is n't a question of fault , Jimmy , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll save the money and pay me , and I 'll pay him now . " " Howler threw the ball , " Jimmy said . " It was n't my fault . " " Do n't say that again , " Jim said sharply . " Forget it , forget it , " Fiske was saying . " I would n't know how much it cost , anyway . " " Send me a bill , " Jim said . " Send it to the Jacksons and I 'll pick it up . " " Forget it , " Fiske said again . " Let 's go in and have a drink . " Jim heard Jimmy mutter something as he turned away , and he grasped his shoulder and whirled him about . " What did you say ? " he demanded . " Nothing , " Jimmy said . " It sounded to me as if you said something about somebody being tight . " " Well , he is tight , " Jimmy said . Mr. Fiske walked away , and Jim took his son by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in and got Lois . On the way home he did lose his temper . " It seems to me you do n't respect grownups , " he said . " It seems to me that you think all big people are stupid . " Jimmy said nothing . When they got home he sent him upstairs and Lois took his supper to him up there . Jim did n't spank him . It seems you did n't spank boys these days . It was a part of that world of his father 's which he had left ; he had never spanked Jimmy but once . And there was a worm of doubt eating away at his conviction . Fiske had been a little tight , and so was he . All of them were usually a little tight when their children saw them in the evening . Jim thought of all those evenings ; Jimmy alone in his room in the apartment with a lot of chattering , tipsy people in the next , and the lonely years before , while he was away . You could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be some other way . " I suppose we ought to pass up invitations for a while , " he said to Lois when she came downstairs . " Let 's get ourselves settled here first . Let 's make a family . " " Yes , dear , " Lois said . She came to him and kissed him , pressing herself against the ache and bewilderment in his chest . T T NIGHT the old house creaked and groaned , and sometimes it seemed to Jim to sigh , in an almost human way . He had thought to sleep better in the country , but at first he found it even more difficult . 1411111161111111111111,1 moTwommigiumprolwilp FULL CIRCLE At night he was aware that the house did not belong to them , even though they owned it ; like the townspeople , it did not accept them . The house belonged to those who had lived there and died there before they came . There had been children born in this house who grew up to beget other children , and then went on to old age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had wearied of the passage of life within its walls , and now in its sighs it seemed to be warning them of the transitory nature of life . But the house reminded Jim also of something else , of his responsibility as its head . In a city apartment it was easy to forget fundamental things ; the superintendent cared for the furnace , the hot water , the functioning of the plumbing ; while the owner of the building was responsible for its upkeep and repair . In an apartment you were insulated from these details in a way that was quite civilized ; your mind was free for other concerns . Now the small sounds of the house at night disturbed Jim and kept him awake . If he thought about them he could trace most of them to their source , but half asleep they mingled with fantasy and started him awake with alarm . That scraping sound in the eaves was undoubtedly the maple tree at the corner of the house , and the sound of running water , which wakened him with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seepage of his own heart , was probably the tank of the water closet refilling itself . Often a board clacked sharply somewhere , an old plank or rafter settling , but it would sound like a cautious step on a loose stair , and Jim would find himself straining his eyes in the darkness toward the door . In the country they were down to fundamentals , and Jim often recognized these ridiculous concerns for what they were , a covering for more serious problems , which the new simplicity of their life revealed to him . Jimmy was so much in his mind , " the problem of Jimmy , " as he had begun to call it , and now he knew that what had merely seemed the unsatisfactory conditions of jimmy 's life were only surface difficulties . There were many things far more seriously wrong , just as possibly there were in his own lik . Everything had been fine when Jim first came home from the Army . It had been like aholiday . " F " Day , as Lois called it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the movies together and had sodas afterward , and even sitting down to dinner or break . fast had seemed like a special treat . Jim had been away almost five years and in those five years there had been moments when he thought he might never see Jimmy again . In between those moments he built up an image of his son , compounded of a love made more fiercely possessive by the thought of loss , and of the natural desire that his son should be many things which he had not been . Sometimes there were snapshots from Lois , and in her letters she tried to keep him informed of Jimmy 's development ; all of these things went into the image . It was a shock to discover on his arrival home that his son was really quite different ; an individual , a person in his own right . It made Jim awkward with him at first , too bluff , or too hearty , or too sentimental . He was filled with such love and wonder for this son of his that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own failures and shortcomings stood between them and made his efforts seem blundering . " Maybe I did n't do as well as I might have done , " Lois said , " but I tried awfully hard . It is n't easy to be a father and a mother together . " Jim laughed at her serious expression . " I think you 've done fine , " he said . " I just need a refresher course in how to be a father . " Jim 's first efforts at discipline brought him up against a blank wall . If Jimmy was told to be home at five in the afternoon and he came in at half past he would merely remark cheerfully that he had forgotten . If Jim sent him to his room he would go in calmly and pick up a comic book and sit down on the bed , and if Jim would take the comic book away and explain that he was there because he had merited discipline , Jimmy would look at him blankly . There seemed to be no anger or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There seemed nothing but indifference . He would regard Jim with wide , clear , cold eyes ; his hands in his pockets . He seemed to be saying that all adults were strange and inexplicable and rather absurd . They had to be humored , but real life was somewhere else . Jim suspected that his son did not respect him at all ; that there was no one in the world whom he respected . Was this normal in a twelve-year-old boy ? Jim was plagued by that thought ; perhaps he was being unfair to his son , resenting normal behavior . He went to several books of popular child psychology , but they did not seem to help him ; their evidence always seemed too particular . And Jimmy appeared to be such a normal boy . He was active and good at street ball , he had many friends who called at the house , and he laughed a good deal and , in fact , seemed to be a kind of leader among them . But once , coming home from the office , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates , a shy boy with glasses , and Jimmy had been the loudest , the instigator , the shouter of the cruelest insults . Jim had lost his temper . He took Jimmy upstairs and whipped him in his room and left him there with the door shut . Jimmy had not even whimpered . He merely looked at his father coldly when it was over , even though the palm of Jim 's hand stung from the effort , and then he walked to his window and stood there with his hands in his pockets , his feet apart , his back to his father . " Why did you do it ? " Jim asked . " Did n't you know you were hurting him ? " " We always do it , " Jimmy said . " It 's fun . " It had n't been a pleasant evening . They had guests , an English publisher and his wife , and they had to wait until the evening was over to talk . Jimmy was asleep then and Lois had cried . " You 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move away . " J immy had adapted himself well to the country . He fell right in with Howler and his friends , but he was the same boy , the same Jimmy . His real life was somewhere else , somewhere Jim did not know about and could not learn about . " Where have you been ? " Jim might ask , and his son would say , " Oh , around . " And if he asked what they had been doing , Jimmy would say , " Nothing . " He seemed to possess no words to express his world to his father ; there was nothing in his voice but surprise that he should ask . Had he , Jim , been like that when he was a boy ? At night in bed in the old house , listening to the night sounds and the occasional car that went by , he would try to remember his childhood ; he would try to relate that past world to his present world , to their problems , their unrest . It would all be confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would fall into a dream in which he ran in the sunlit fields of his boyhood , and saw his father , and heard his father 's voice . He had been a deliberate and kind man , rather distant with most , but comfortable to be with , and always confident and staunch . He had never doubted anything as far as Jim knew , neither God , nor his business ability , nor life itself . " Boy , " he would say to Jim , addressing him in those dreams as in the past , " that is not an honorable thing to do . " Or , " Boy , always remember you are a gentle-man . " Jim had never used either of those words with his own son . Neither " gentleman , " nor " honorable . " Perhaps those words belonged to a dead world in which there had been gentlemen with honor ; they had not talked of mass psychology in a classless society . Even the discipline those words suggested was outmoded . Children nowadays were brought up by reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of a reactionary father who whipped him and sent him to his room . Jim enjoyed those dreams in which he heard and saw his father . He took refuge in them , but they began to disturb him when he discovered that he had begun unconsciously to assume the attitudes of his father . In the evening , now that they had decided to pass up invitations and remain at home , he would settle himself by the fire with a book or paper , wearing the bedroom slippers Lois had bought for Jimmy to give him at Christmas , and he would find that he was wearing his father like a garment he had put on . He had begun to smoke his pipe again , which he had not done since the war , and if Lois spoke to him , or lie found occasion to speak to Jimmy , working at his homework on the floor , his voice was deliberate , deeper , his father 's inflection . It was a little frightening , and certainly ridiculous , but neither Lois nor Jimmy commented about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier than they had been in a long time . They sat in a drowsy and satisfying peace . They had been sitting there like that , the three of them , when the accident had happened in front of the house , but when Jim got up to follow his son outside he had dropped the cloak of his father ; he realized FULL CIRCLE 9l that now . Whatever he was searching for in the past , whatever they were all reaching for , some remembered felicity or security , had deserted them in that moment of violence and they were left when it was over in their sharper world with its different dimensions . N 0 , JIM thought , getting up from his chair , beginning to go about to lock the doors and turn out the lights , I am not my father , and my son is not what I was at his age . He has different values and a different morality . He breaks things and he lies , Jim thought harshly , stirring the bitterness twisted with the love inside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment , the environment his parents give him . What was so wrong in their lives that made their son a stranger to them ? With his hand on the stair rail , starting up to Lois , Jim remembered Jimmy standing there , saying , " Who was the man who said those funny things ? " and suddenly the realization of what that implied arrested him there in the darkness at the foot of the stairs . After a moment he went on up the stairs , up to their room where Lois lay propped up on pillows in the bed , smoking a cigarette , her sleepy face thoughtful and concerned . Jim sat down in the chair beside the bed and looked at her . " It just came to me , " he said , " just now , that my son is a stranger to me . " " Do n't , " Lois said . " Please do n't let 's talk about it . " " This is different , " Jim said . " This is im-portant . " Lois looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and I were brought up as Christians , " Jim said . A muscle beside his mouth moved involuntarily , and he lighted a cigarette for himself . " We left Christianity , you and I , " he said . " We left it for other things . For science and reason and intellect . But I think all of those things were a sort of reaction . We live a kind of negative life . Christianity was a kind of baffle against which we developed ourselves . " " Please , " Lois said . " It 's so late . That man 's death disturbed me , too . I 'm trying to get over it . " " I 've got to say it , " Jim said . " / may never understand it again . And I 'm not talking about religion , or God , or anything like that . I 'm just saying that there is a whole area hi our son which is completely alien to us because , you see , he is n't a Christian . " Lois went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette in an ashtray on the table beside her . " What are you trying to say ? " she asked . " I 'm trying to say that our boy knows nothing of right or wrong , or good or evil , or honor or justice because no one has ever told him that he has a soul . " Lois put her hand across her eyes and Jim could see the tears begin to slip down behind it , but he went on . " When that man died there tonight in the road it was a purely mechanical thing to Jimmy , even though it raised in us all kinds of subconscious reactions . Our boy , who has never heard the name of Jesus except in profanity , is really the child of tomorrow , but we 're living in yesterday . " Jim had begun to undress , automatically , and now he put on his pajamas , and turned off the lamp beside the bed and got in beside his wife . He could hear her crying and he spoke softly . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be discouraged . It will be easier now . We 've got to remember that he was brought up in science , and we were brought up in something that was called the spirit . We wanted it that way for him ; we chose it to be that way , and now we 'll work it out . " They were silent for a moment , and then Lois reached over and tucked her hand inside Jim 's , and moved closer to hith . " Can we go to church on Sunday ? " she asked . Her voice was diffident and shy , as if she half expected laughter or scorn . " Can we go to Mr. Campbell ? " she said . " Certainly , " Jim said . " We can do that if you like . " But suddenly he felt cold and frightened . He remembered the church of his boyhood , the window against which the face of Jesus was pressed . What would Jimmy make of that , who could look at anything without fear ? They had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim was cold and frightened because of that thought . They had come full circle , and if they failed they were lost . There was n't anywhere else for them to go .
