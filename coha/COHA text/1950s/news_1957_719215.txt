txt The United States District Court today found twenty-six Eastern railroads , including the Pennsylvania and New York Central , guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Law . The ruling was made by Judge Thomas J. Clary in the $250,000,000 treble damage suit brought against the railroads by the Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association and forty long-distance trucking concerns . The judge also dismissed a counter-suit in which the railroads had sought $120,000,000 in treble damages . The countersuit accused the truckers of having conspired since 1945 to I restrain trade and commerce in violation of the antitrust law . The individual trucking companies were awarded nominal damages of 18 cents each , triple the usual nominal damages of .6 cents under Federal practice . The truckers ' association , the court said , would receive damages , counsel fees and costs in an amount to be set after a hearing . A date for the hearing is to be set later . The truckers also were granted an injunction against continuation of the practices complained of in their suit . Judge Clary said the damages would be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads ' campaign of destruction of goodwill . " When assessed , the court said , SO per cent of the damages are to be paid by the railroads and the balance by Carl Byoir &; Associates , Inc. , a New York public relations company . Railroads To Appeal The Byoir Company and the Eastern Railroads Presidents Conference also were named as defendants in the truckers ' suit . The Byoir concern , the plaintiffs charged , conspired with the railroads to slander and vilify the trucking industry . In New York , David I. Mackie , chairman of the conference , made the following statement : " The Eastern Railroad Presidents ' Conference and the other defendants thoroughly disagree with Judge Clary 's opinion . Appeals will be pressed promptly after the entry of an order from which an appeal may be taken . " Gerald F. Swinehart , chairman of Carl Byoir , said in a statement that his company would join in the appeal planned by Mr. Mackie . James M. Symes , president of the Pennsylvania Railroad , said he was " astonished at what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment . The New York Central Railroad , when asked for comment , referred to Mr. Mackie 's decision . Edward Gogolin , vice president and general manager of the Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association , issued a statement hailing the court 's opinion as a " signal victory for the trucking industry . " " We hcpe , " Mr. Gogolin said , " that as a result the two great arms of American transportation will be able to work harmoniously in the best intejests of this country 's economic future . " Trial Lasted 4 Months During the four-month trial , which opened last Oct. 1 and ended on Jan. 28 , each side accused the other of trying to damage business in violation of the antitrust laws . In a 200-page , 45,000-word decision , Judge Clary found the railroads guilty of such action and cleared the truckers . " It is clear that the counterclaims pled are without merit , " the jurist said in dismissing the railroads ' counter-suit . Specifically , the railroads were accused of having established false-front organizations to influence antitruck legislation in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that although legally injured by the conspiracy , the truckers could not recover actual damages flowing from Gov . John S. Fine 's veto of Pennsylvania fair truck legislation in 1951 . That legislation would have raised the gross weight limit on highway trucks from 45,000 to 60,000 pounds . This , the court noted , was because as a matter of law , damages flowing from the Executive act are not recoverable . In 1955 the weight limit on highway trucks was increased to 60,000 pounds in Pennsylvania . In ruling that the railroad campaign had damaged the truckers , Judge Clary said : " This was a carefully calculated plan under the guidance of competent legal counsel which sought to choose a means of injuring and , if possible , destroying interstate trucking competition that would afford the greatest amount of constitutional protection and thereby seek to render it immune from the antitrust laws . " A further inference to be drawn is that the plan was to be cast in the guise of a gigantic legislative campaign in order to attempt to surround it with the protections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature and freedom of speech . " Techniques Analyzed In pointing out that public relations techniques were closely interwoven with the case , Judge Clary observed : " The chief device used by the railroads and to a lesser extent by the truckers , which latter did not involve violation of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts , is one long known to political experts under the term ' the big lie . ' " This technique , as it appears from the evidence in this case , has been virtually adopted in toto by certain public relations firms under the less insidious and more palatable name of ' the third party technique . ' " Its sole means and its effectiveness is to take a dramatic fragment of truth and by emphasis and repetition distort it into falsehood . That was the technique employed almost without exception by Byoir and the railroads throughout the campaign . " The Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association and the longdistance trucking concerns filed the suit in Federal Court here on Jan. 17 , 1953 . It charged that the railroads has started a drive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business .
