The Cauca River rises in the mountains of southern Colombia , foams furiously down their steep slopes , then runs placidly northward through a balmy ( average temperature 78 ) , verdant valley . The Cauca Valley , twelve miles wide and 125 miles long , is the country 's most bounteous food producer-bananas , sugar , potatoes , coffee , rice , beef , milk . Its center is the warmhearted city of Cali , whose 500.000 inhabitants manage to combine plenty of industrial zip ( in tires , leather , drugs , textiles ) with a pleasant , semitropical way of life that still reserves the time from noon to 2:30 for lunch and siesta . Yet the valley 's people believe its development has hardly begun ; last week they were taking the first steps to turn the Cauca into South America 's most impressive replica of the U.S. 's Tennessee Valley Authority . <P> Concrete Commitment . Two years ago Cali industrialists persuaded the government to invite David Lilienthal , onetime chairman of TVA , down for a look , and frankly tapped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without fee ) , Lilienthal briefly studied the valley and recommended the creation of a developmental agency . Since then , the Cauca Valley Corp. , working closely with a mission from the World Bank , has been gathering the engineering data needed to fix its own goal and methods . The objective , as finally visualized , became nothing less than a quick and dramatic boost in the standard of living of the valley 's 3,000,000 people , to be achieved mainly by power production and control over crop-destroying floods , but also by related programs of education , road building and better farming . <P> <P> Last month , with planning far enough along for construction to begin , C.V.C. asked President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla , chips down , whether it could have the heavy grants needed to get going . The President unhesitatingly pledged the government to spend $64 million . <P> Powerful Plans . Work started immediately at Calima , a power dam on the Pacific-flowing Calima River needed to supply 120,000 kw for electricity-starved Cali by late 1959 . Next year another dam will begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate 60,000 kw of power and curb the yearly floods that cover a quarter of the valley 's million acres . Transmission lines will go up to tie the dams and a newly completed plant at Anchicaya ( begun before C.V.C. was conceived ) to power users . Work will start in 1959 on the system 's biggest dam at Sal-vajina . Other projects : flood channels , levees , irrigation ditches , and enough steam plants to bring generating capacity to 660,000 kw ( v. TVA 's 9,000,000 kw . ) . <P> Once C.V.C. is in business , it will become selfsupporting , but the initial investment in dams , power plants and transmission lines will require $187 million in all ( including last month 's governmental commitment ) . A favorable report by the World Bank mission was a hint that the bank would lend a reported $20 million to $27 million for imported equipment and machinery . As for the rest . Finance Minister Carlos Villaveces has promised that " the government will see this through , come what may .
