 | on the ridge road again . The road was the same as it had always been , yellow hardpan clay with only saw briers and wild wood grass able to survive . The road ran straight to where timber grew on both sides . There it went into a tunnel covered by the interlacing branches of white oaks and yellow-pine boughs . He watched for Lucretia to come from this tunnel . I 'd like to know what 's a-keepin ' her , he thought as he walked back into the cabin to look at the bread . I did n't want her to go with that Doshie and Hootbird Hammertight , nohow . When Op opened the oven door and looked at the corn pone , it had not begun to brown . He thought he needed to put more wood into the firebox . He opened the door , and the firebox was filled with wood and the fire was roaring . Not anythin ' ever ust to bother me , Theopolis thought , as he walked to the three-cornered cupboard to get dishes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never looked fer anybody . Now , I have a woman in this cabin . I have a worried mind . Lutie is a purty girl , he thought , comparing her to Beadie . She 's too purty fer that Hootbird , whether she 's my daughter or not . I hope she 'll never give him the second look . Theopolis set a plate for himself and one for Lucretia . Then he stood looking at the big bowl filled with wild flowers in the center of the table . He was afraid he might upset this bouquet of redbud and dogwood blooms , mixed with whippoorwill flowers , blue and white violets , and trillium . Lutie has fixed this cabin until it 's nice , in a way , he thought . But it 's not as handy as it used to be when I did the work and Jerry and I lived here alone . She 's got me puzzled , he thought as he looked at the wild flowers . I owe ' er somethin ' fer what she 's done fer me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Honeywell with the ornery Hammertights . She 's a woman old enough to know right from wrong . I 've told ' er about the Hammertights . She does n't haf to  | have old Doshie a-tryin ' to find ' er work in a store or a restaurant or a house . But she 's not one of our people , he thought as he worked getting supper on the table , or she 'd know how much Laurel Ridge provides , free . All ye have to do is watch the plants and the trees when they bear fruit in their seasons . She 's been ust to buyin ' from the stores . I know the places to find everythin ' . I know where the berries grow and the trees that bear nuts . . . . Jerry lay sprawled on a gray rug watching Op . I 'll have supper ready fer ' er if she does come back , he thought . She 's done a lot fer me . Then he wondered how she would like the bread he 'd baked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had picked and cooked . He 'd searched until he found enough poke for a mess . And he knew how to cook poke better than Lutie . But the place was not the same . Dishes were neatly arranged in the cupboard . Cabin so clean and well arranged he was most afraid to sit down . This was n't the way it had looked when he kept the place himself . Then he was n't afraid of dropping a piece of bread , a spoonful of potatoes , or spilling soup beans on the floor and letting Jerry clean them up . Jerry 's job had been to keep the scraps picked up , but now Op was careful about letting anything fall . Lutie 's living in his cabin had made the difference . The change was hard on him but harder on old Jerry . He lay there on the rug looking up with his sad brown eyes from under little roofs of grizzly brows . Supper was finished and Op had it on the table . And he 'd not spilled a thing . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food on the table , he went to the window again . He pushed the curtains back in time to see Hootbird holding Lutie 's hand , trying to pull her close to kiss her . That was where the tunnel of leaves began on the Laurel Ridge road . He stood there watching while Lutie pulled away and hurried toward the cabin alone .  | He saw Hootbird standing there watching until Lutie was on the porch . Then Hootbird turned and walked back into the tunnel . 11 " Well , ye finally got here , " Op said . " I was n't shore ye 'd come back . I was a-thinkin ' that atter I got supper on the table , I 'd put Jerry up in his chear like I did before you cone . Give account of ycrself , young woman ! " " Oh , I 'm too tired , " she sighed as she sat down . " I 'm even too tired to cat . " Op pulled himself up a chair and sat clown in front of Lucretia . He eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " While they cool , I want to know about yer trip to Honeywell . " " Dad , I 've never walked so much in my life , " Lucretia groaned . " This morning when we left here , Doshie took the lead around Laurel Ridge . I believe she can walk faster than you . She said she was in a hurry to get to her work . And when we got to Honeywell she did n't work at all . She just walked the streets all morning and we followed her . " " Did n't old Doshie work in the courthouse ? " " No . We went over there but they were holding court . Some trial over who owned a half an acre of land down in Big River Valley and there were three lawyers on each side and four surveyors and over fifty witnesses . The sheriff had a hard time keeping order . Courthouse was filled until there was n't standing room . I stood until I thought my legs would go from under me . Finally Doshie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs . "  | " What did Hootbird do ? " " He stayed beside me and wanted to hold my hand on the street . We must have walked up and down Main Street a hundred times from the Palace Theater to the courthouse . He wanted to go somewhere and make love to me . Said I was the prettiest girl he ever saw . " " I 'm not surprised at that , " Op replied , frowning . " He told me he 'd been practicing his whistling so he could perform for me . " Lutie laughed . " But those flowered boots blistered his toes halfway down the ridge and then he had troubles . " " Did ye walk all day up and down the streets ? " Op asked . " What did ye do about somethin ' to eat ? " " Doshie said she had some housework to do for a Mrs. Shales . " " That 's Blanche Shales , " Op interrupted . " She 's secretary for her brother , Odder Timmons , attorney , undertaker , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for food Mrs. Shales was . Mrs. Shales had given Doshie the key and turned her loose in the house . The first thing Doshie did was go to the refrigerator and find enough for our lunch . She set the table for us and we ate about all the food there was in the house . Then we helped Doshie do a little work in the house , a very little , and then we left . " " That sounds like Doshie all right , " Op said . " She loves to raid the pantries . I 've picked up that much about ' er just a-talkin ' to people on the streets . Men and wimmen I know in Honeywell ust to come up to me and say : ' Op , there 's a woman by the name of Doshie Hammertight livin ' out yer way . She wants to work in my home . What about ' er ? ' She never worked fer me , ' I 'd tell ' em . ' Ye 'll have to try ' er to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ast me about ' er and he would n't speak about it . No one she 's ever worked fer will tell the next feller . He wants  | the next one to have the same experience he had with ' er . She never leaves much grub when she gets through a-feedin ' Hoot and herself . " " Then in the afternoon , " Lucretia continued , " we went to the picture show . Doshie pulled a roll of bills from her purse and paid our way . I wanted to pay my own but she would n't let me . When we went into the Palace Theater , Doshie sat on one side of Hootbird and I sat on the other . In a few minutes Doshie sort of disappeared and Hootbird wanted to put one arm around me and hold my hand . But his blisters were aching him so that he had to take his boots off to massage his feet . I was just as glad . " " That 's Hootbird all right , " Op said . " When the show was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket office . " " I did n't stay , Lutie , honey , ' " she said . " I 've seen that Western twice . I know it by heart . I come out to look the manager up to see if I could n't make a bargain with ' im to sweep the theater for free tickets but he already has somebody . ' " " Did n't she try to find work fer ye ? " " She never said anything more about that , " Lucretia replied . " When we left the theater , we went to a nice-looking home where some woman gave her a bundle of clothes . We went to another home and she picked up a bundle there . Then we went to two stores and picked up groceries . Iootbird carried the lighter load . Honest , Doshie carried a load too big for a mule . I offered to help but she would n't let mc . And we never stopped walking . It 's getting late , ' Doshie kept saying . I 've got to get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' this ridge at night with so many strange people a-hidin ' on it . ' " " Did n't ye stop to rest on Seaton Hill ? " " Never stopped anyplace , " Lucretia replied . " When we got to the path that turns from Laurel Ridge road , Doshie told  | Hootbird to come around the ridge with me . I told him I could come alone . But he hid his sack of groceries back in a huckleberry patch . I would n't let you go around that dangerous ridge by yourself , ' he said . Then he limped along with me to the cabin . " " Come on and eat a supper I 've cooked . " Op changed the subject . " I 've been eatin ' the grub ye 've cooked , now try some of mine . " " Dad , if you had n't cooked supper , " Lucretia sighed as she went to the table , " we just would n't have eaten . I 'm too tired to cook , but I 'm hungry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Op told her . " The earth will provide us everythin ' to eat , and wood to burn . That is , if ye do n't want a lot of fancy vittals . " " I do n't want any kind of work in Honeywell , " Lucretia said , dropping in her chair at the table . " I do n't want that ten-mile walk ever again , much less every day . But you should have seen Doshie running along the ridge bent double like a hairpin under that load . She 's not human ! " " Well now , I 've said some mean things ' bout Doshie in my time , but I do believe she 's human . " Op scratched himself thoughtfully . " Nope , Doshie 's no speret. " 12 The sun had gone down on Laurel Ridge . The calico clouds were spread like thin sheets above the Sandy Valley . They were held up in space with props of bright evening wind . Theopolis and Lucretia sat on the porch and watched these clouds while a whippoorwill sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards away in the direction of Pawpaw Gap . On a  | finger ridge on the Sandy Valley side , in the direction of the sty , another whippoorwill sang . Lucretia and Theopolis sat watching the clouds and listening to the whippoorwills . " A whippoorwill makes a nest on a leaf on the ground , " Op explained to Lucretia . " The hen bird lays only a couple of eggs . I 've never found three eggs in a nest in my life and I 've found over a hundred in my time . I 've seen their red eyes shinin ' in the moonlight like wind-fanned embers . I 've walked right up to ' em on their nests . They set on the eggs , hatch the young on the ground . The whippoorwill is a strange bird . They can sing as purty as any bird I 've ever heard but they 're too lazy to build a nest . They take life easier than any birds I know . Sorta like me , I guess . " " Their singing has such a lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about how much smarter some birds are than others , " Theopolis went on , talking as much to himself as to Lucretia . " I know every kind of bird that lives on Laurel Ridge . But I do n't understand how the whippoorwill is able to keep his kind a-goin ' with so many snakes crawlin ' over the ground lookin ' fer young birds . Foxes , possums , and terrapins like young birds too , but the whippoorwills keep a-comin ' like sassafras sprouts . " Just then the whippoorwill stopped singing in the direction of the sty . Seconds later he flew about ten feet above the ground , fanning the bright wind in a hurried flight . " Somethin ' disturbed that whippoorwill , " Op said . " The other one 's stopped singing too , " Lucretia said as Op looked on the ridge in the direction of the sty . " I see somebody a-comin ' out of the tunnel , " Op said . Lucretia did n't answer . The whippoorwill that had flown past changed his course and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two birds wheeled in their flight over  | toward the feathery clouds in the Sandy Valley . Op watched the pair get smaller until they disappeared . Then he peered at the man who was getting closer . " Somebody is comin ' , Lutie , " he said again , turning to her . But Lucretia was looking in the other direction and there was a new light in her eyes . Op looked the way she was looking and saw another man coming . He was farther away than the man Op had seen first , but both were walking in the direction of the cabin . " This place is a-gettin ' mighty full-up with people , " Theopolis muttered . " Good evenin ' , Op , " Hootbird said when he walked up to the gate , shouldering a guitar and a rifle . " Good evenin ' , Lutie . " " Hootbird , what are ye a-doin ' with that rifle ? " Op asked . Lucretia did n't speak . Her eyes followed the other man as he left the ridge road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . He , too , was carrying a rifle . " Oh , good evening , Hootbird , " Lucretia greeted him on second thought . " What did ye see up that way , Lutie ? " Hootbird asked curiously . His eyes traveled up and down Lucretia 's yellow dress , making a slow trip of it . " Oh , just a man , " she replied . " I thought he was coming here but he did n't . " " Which way did he go ? " Hootbird asked . " Over the ridge and down among the cliffs , " she replied . " Op , ye asked me why I brought this rifle , " Hootbird said . " What Lutie jist saw is the exact reason . It 's dangerous on this ridge nowadays . " " Are ye comin ' in , Hoot ? " Op said , without enthusiasm . Hootbird came through the gate and leaned his rifle against the porch . 57  | " I keep this rifle near me , " he said , " but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got me a twenty-two pistol ordered that will shoot eleven times . " " Not anybody 's a-goin ' to bother ye , Hootbird , " Op said . " Ye 're the biggest coward that ever walked on Laurel Ridge . " " I ai n't so shore about that , " Hootbird said as he stood in front of the porch and looked up at Lucretia . " The other day when I was a-walkin ' the ridge with my rifle , I looked down into the arc and a man was a-layin ' sprawled on a big flat-topped rock . He was behind a yaller poplar that 's grown up beside the rock . But I could see his legs behind the tree . He was dressed in brown and his heels were up , a-showin ' his brown shoes . And I saw somethin ' that seemed to be leanin ' against the tree , shinin ' like a bull black snake in the sun . When I looked closer , it was a rifle barrel , and the stranger had his sights leveled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to back-back on legs a-tremblin ' so they would hardly hold me up . I was afraid I was a goner . And when I backed to a tree , I jumped behind it and with the oak betwixt me and his rifle I made a beeline down under on the Little White Oak side . " " Did you say he was dressed in brown ? " Lucretia asked . " Yes , he was , " Hootbird replied . " When I moved , the bright thing agin the tree moved . When I discovered it was a rifle with somethin ' on the barrel that shined like a piece of silver in the sun , I was skeered stiff . I would n't walk on this ridge agin without a piece of hardware . We 've got two pistols . Poppie carries the autermatic wherever he goes . And Mommie carries the little twenty-two in her bosom when she goes to town . She got the life skeered out'n her when she come from Honeywell the other night . She saw a strange man run across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand out there at Six Hickories . " " I do n't believe anybody would harm old Doshic , " Op said . " That 's another one of ' er big tales . To hear ' er tell it , there 's  | allus a young , fine-lookin ' man after ' er . Shucks , I do n't believe it . There 's not anybody after ' er , or ye either . " " I 'm not takin ' any chances , " Hootbird said . " I come around here tonight to play my geetar and sing some to ye and Lutie . But when I think of the man that had his sights leveled on me at the arc , it gives me the weak trembles . " " But you 're not too weak to play the guitar and sing , are you , Hootbird ? " Lucretia asked . " No , but I could 've done a lot better , " Hootbird apologized as he began to tune his guitar , " if ye had n't told me ye saw a strange man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go home . He might be a-waitin ' behind a tree to bushwhack me . " Hootbird tightened one string . Then he plucked it and held one big ear close . " When I go back tonight , I 'm not a-goin ' around Laurel Ridge , " he said , plucking at another string . " I might not even take a path at all , not even a fox path . Think I 'll go back through the brush . " " Ye 'd better watch as ye go through the woods , Hoot , " Op teased . " A big terrapin might get ye by the toe . If one does , he wo n't let loose till it thunders . " Hootbird ignored Op . " I 'll sing The Little Rosewood Casket , ' " he said . " It 's awfully sad but Poppie and Mommie like it . I 've been a-practicin ' on it . " In a little rosewood casket , That 's a-restin ' on the stand , There 's a package of old letters , Written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guitar to the lonesome tune . He sat on the edge of the porch looking up at Lucretia , then down at her toes in barefoot sandals . He almost forgot the words , looking at her red-painted toenails . The night wind in  | the horsehairs on the cabin walls had begun to make strange sounds too . Wo n't ye go and git them , Mother , And read them o'er to me ; I 've often tried to read them But fer tears I could not see . " It 's a sad song , " Hootbird sighed after he 'd finished . " It brings tears to my eyes . Maybe I should n't a-played anythin ' so sad a-comin ' out here to see ye , Lutie ? " " Ust to hear that song when I 's a young buck a-kickin ' up my heels , " Op said . " But that geetar of yers sounds like it 's been a-sittin ' out in the rain , Hoot . " " Now here 's another one that we like down home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye might have heard it . It 's an old ballad . " Hootbird sat a moment , remembering the words . Woke up this mornin ' Before the break of day , Thought about my darlin ' A thousand miles away ... Some says I wo n't And some say I will Go back to Lickin ' To get my bottle fill 'd ... . Standin ' in the depot , And I seen a train go by ; I thought about my darlin ' And hung my head and cried . .. .  | I 'm goin ' back to Lickin ' , I 'm goin ' back today ; I 'm goin ' back to Lickin ' And there I 'm goin ' to stay . Hootbird patted his foot on the grass and strummed his guitar energetically , his arm moving like a brown piston through the evening dusk as his long fingers plucked the strings . When he finished the song , Hootbird looked up for approval . " That 's not too bad , Hoot , " Op admitted . " I ai n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I like it , " Lucretia said very politely . " I know the words and the tune to another song , " Hootbird said as he began to strum again . " The Hoot Owl Song . ' Mornmie and Poppie like this one special . " Oh , when you hear that hoot owl callin ' It 's gon na turn cold , it 's gon na turn cold ; And when you see my teardrops fallin ' , I 'm thinkin ' of the days of old . I do n't know why I love you , darlin ' . Hootbird looked straight at Lucretia on the porch . It 's plain you never cared for me ; But still my mind is on you , darlin ' It makes no difference where I be . I 'm goin ' down to the deep blue river , Down where the cool sweet waters flow ; Gon na lay me down and sleep forever , Down where the snow-white lilies blow . 61  | Oh , bury me beside the river Where the nightingales sing sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down where the cool sweet waters flow . Where the fog is on the deep blue river And the mist is on the mountain high And the nightingale sings in the twilight , There let me slumber when I die ... . When you hear that hoot owl callin ' , It 's time to plant corn , it 's time to plant corn ; And when you wake and hear sweet music , It 's the nightingale at the break of morn . When Hootbird had finished , he wiped a tear from his eye . " What 's the matter , Hoot ? " Op asked . " Ye did n't play and sing it purty enough to make yerself cry , did ye ? I 've heard rain crows a-tryin ' to carry a tune that teched me more . " " I think it was real pretty , Hootbird , " Lucretia told him . She thought Op was being unnecessarily mean . " But I 'm still not so good as that man ye heard on the ridge ' r ye would have said so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoot Owl Song , " the whippoorwill had come back to Laurel Ridge road near where the fox had been killed and started singing . Just beyond the sty on the Sandy Valley side of the ridge another whippoorwill burst into song . It was eleven o'clock and the winds had risen and strange sounds were coming from the cabin walls . Hootbird arose from the edge of the porch and got his rifle . He gripped the rifle at the trigger guard , holding it close to his side as if his life depended on his having this weapon . " I must be a-goin ' home , " he said .  | " Come back again when ye have n't got as long to stay , " Theopolis said . " Which way are you going , Hoot ? " Lucretia asked . " Down the fox path to Shinglemill , " Hootbird replied . " Down Shinglemill to Little White Oak . Up Little White Oak to the Wince Leffard Gap . " " If there 's any man about ye , ye 'd walk out the ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five miles outten yer way ! " " This ridge is dangerous ! " Hootbird spoke heatedly . " When I go into the woods with my rifle , I believe strange eyes are a-watchin ' me from behind every tree and cliff . Laurel Ridge is not the place it ust to be when we lived here in peace and went where we pleased without totin ' a gun . " " I 'd go home on the Laurel Ridge road , " Op called , as Hootbird walked toward the gate . " Remember , I 've seen snakes down on White Oak big enough to swaller ye ! " " Good night , honey , " Hootbird said to Lucretia . " If the old scratch gets ye tonight , " Op said as he watched Hootbird disappear into the semidarkness , " he 'll turn ye loose when daylight comes . Ye 're jist like old Doshie . " He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a big burley leaf . It was dried and cracked and crumbled where he 'd been sitting on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got all the guts of a grasshopper , " he mumbled . 13 When Theopolis reached Six Hickories , he rolled the heavy sack from his shoulder to the ground . He took a red bandanna and wiped the sweat from his good eye . Sweat got in his eye again as he climbed the Seaton Hill with his load of supplies , 63  | but he put down his head and doggedly kept on going until he reached the top . The cool breeze from the yellow poplar tops dried the wetweather springs of sweat on his furrowed brow . He stood beside his sack , resting as he looked at the world down under in all directions but one . That direction was Laurel Ridge , which curved around the vast arc beneath him and then ran in a beeline toward the cabin . While Theopolis stood resting at Six Hickories , he looked at the foundation stones where the church had once stood . A low cluster of sapless , shriveled , wild-rose vines grew from the hard , dry , sterile clay . There was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , soft as satin with one layer of petals . Op wondered how a flower so beautiful as this could come from such worthless earth . This is the place where lumberjacks , ore diggers , and oxen and mule skinners ust to bring their famblies to church , he thought . Now the wild-rose vines , saw briers , and the wood grass have taken over . Maybe there 's a black snake or a copperhead among the foundation rocks . Suppos'n the ghosts of the speret world come back to this place , he thought . Maybe they come back here every Sunday night and have church , and when a big lumberjack gets under conviction and shows signs of repentance , the two strong moderators , who allus kept a watchful eye in the church during services , go back and get ' im and carry ' im to the altar a-kickin ' and a-squealin ' . That 's the way they ust to do it . Then everybody watched ' im as he laid his sins upon the altar . They lissened to his confession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ore digger , or a collier confessed . He shouldered his sack again and was on his way around the arc with his load of supplies . His dogwoods and redbuds had shed their blossoms . Ile looked once across the Sandy Valley to see where the sun was . When he saw a red path of sky over  | the Allcorn Hills that looked like a brush pile afire in the sky , he knew it was time for him to be getting back to the cabin . It was never this way when I lived alone , he thought . I never heard singin ' , whistlin ' , and geetar playin ' in the woods at night till Lutie came . I could spit my terbacker where I wanted and drop scraps fer old Jerry . I never had that Hootbird to sit on my porch and croak ballads fer me . I lissened to my own music . Laurel Ridge is not the same . I 'd a-never believed , if the cataract had n't been taken from my eye , that I could beget a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be good to me now fer they 'll be eye'n ' Lutie . She 's as purty as a speckled pup . But why did she leave Dayton and come to me ? I ca n't understand her woman ways , he thought as he shifted the sack to his shoulder . But I do know a woman is an expensive thing , and he remembered the two lists Lutie had written down for him to get . He had to go to the Honeywell post office to post letters for her and to call for her mail . He had one list for the grocery store and one for the drugstore . Lutie had given him the money to pay for everything in the sack on his back . He 'd never spent ten dollars at one time before . Lutie could n't have too much left , and what would happen after she 'd spent the last of her savings ? Maybe Doshie Hammertight was right when she warned him about the winter days when the snow would be deep on Laurel Ridge . Out of the ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her some pocket change . He pulled the bandanna from his pocket and wiped his face as he kept on walking with his load . He wanted to get home to Lutie . Somebody might come from the woods . Hootbird might slip back there . She does n't like his playin ' and singin ' . She 's polite to him but she knows he ca n't stay on the tune . Hootbird is wild about Lutie ! It 's better never to leave her alone on Laurel Ridge . I ought to have brought her with me , only she did n't want 65  | to walk the ten miles . Hammertights are thin and hungry and they run the ridges like lean foxes . Begad , life is a-gettin ' complicated . Op had determined not to stop until he reached the cabin . Just before he reached the sty , he had to put his sack from his shoulder to the ground . He rested while the cool wind hit his face . Between puffs of wind when the rustling leaves were silent , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupped his hand and held it behind his ear to catch the sound better . Guitar music and singing ! Hootbird 's there again ! He 'll be a pest all spring and summer . He 'll be a-hangin ' ' round as long as Lutie is with me unless we run ' im off . The little coward ! Afraid of his shadder at night . A-goin ' around with a rifle ! When I leave the cabin , he sneaks in ! Op walked faster . IIe passed the sty and reached the first grove of yellow pines on his left . He put the sack down again . He put his cupped hand behind his ear , turned it toward the cabin to listen . The singing and guitar playing had stopped . There was talking and laughing . It was Lutie 's laughter all right . He had never heard her so happy ! He could hear her words but he could n't tell what she was saying . And he could hear a man 's voice . It was Hootbird 's too . He 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun was down behind the Allcorn Hills . The moon was in the sky . He was not home and somebody was at the cabin with Lutie . Op went a few steps and stood there listening . Was the man 's voice Hootbird 's ? He was n't sure . He was n't close enough and the wind was blowing from the Sandy side toward Little White Oak and it carried their words from him . He would have to get closer . If he would only start playing the guitar and singing again , he could tell . He took a few more steps toward the cabin . He did n't want to walk out of the tunnel where the moon 's rays , shining down through the open spaces between the oak  | leaves and the pine needles , left little pencil-size lines of dim light against the semidarkness . If he walked out of this tunnel , they might see him . " Honey , I 'll have to leave you , " said a voice . " I 'll see you soon ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Soon as I can , " was the reply . " Soon as it 's safe . Might be just any time . " It must be Hootbird all right , a-sneakin ' around like a lizard . When Op reached the clearing near the cabin , he saw a man walking away from the gate in the direction of Pawpaw Gap . He carried a rifle on his shoulder , and a guitar in his hand . Op could see them in the moonlight . Lucretia was standing beside the gate watching him hurry along the ridge . 14 " Did ye take advantage of my bein ' away to have yer company , Lutie ? " Op asked as he laid the sack from his shoulder onto the porch . " No , I did n't , " she replied . " He just dropped in and I would n't tell him to leave just because you were n't here . " " I 've warned ye about that Hootbird , " Op said , pointing his finger at her . " That was n't Hootbird . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow . " Ted Newsome . " " Oh , Ted Newsome ! " The expression on Theopolis 's face changed . " That 's a lot different . I do n't feel bad about ye a-seein ' Ted ! He 's not a flesh-and-blood man ! " Lucretia said , " Why would a spirit fall in love with me ? " 67  | " That 's not hard to understand , Lutie , " Theopolis replied . " He remembers what happened to ' im once over the Dortch gal . Lucinda Dortch put ' im where he is today . Now he yearns fer a happy love affair . He 's not content in his long home in the Freewill Baptist Churchyard . And he would n't be afraid of Hootbird 's rifle . Hootbird could shoot at ' im all he pleases and it would be like shootin ' at the wind ! " " Dad , I do n't want to fall in love with a spirit , " Lucretia smiled . " And I 'm afraid I am falling in love with Ted New-some ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Better a speret than Hootbird Hammertight . I do n't want Hoot to come around when I 'm gone . Yell lam more about Hammertights after ye 've been here awhile ! " " Dad , do you really believe in spirits ? " " Believe in ' em ? " Op said , looking strangely at her . " I hope to tell ye I believe in ' em . I know there 's a world of ' em on Laurel Ridge . Too many people have seen ' em . Too many reliable people , includin ' myself , have heard ' em . Ye believe me , do n't ye ? " " Well , I 'm not sure , " she replied . " I never heard tell of so many spirits until I came to Laurel Ridge ! " " Laurel Ridge is a land of the sperets , " Op explained . " So many people ust to live here . They died the natural deaths . But their sperets have come back . I believe everybody who ever lived on Laurel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back here ! The way ye described Ted Newsome to me , I know he 's the Ted I ust to know . I just ca n't understand why he 's a-goin ' around with a rifle . That 's the only thing that plagues me . Op picked up the heavy sack and Lucretia opened the cabin door for him . Inside he drew up his favorite chair while Lucretia lit the lamp .  | " Has Ted been here before when I 've been away ? " he asked , as Lucretia began unloading the sack . " Yes , Dad , he was here one day when you went to cut wood , " she confessed . " He brought me a bouquet of wild flowers for the table . You remember , you thought it was very pretty . " " Well , ai n't it wonderful he 's so thoughtful of ye ? " Theopolis was pleased . His lips spread in a big smile . " I think so , Dad . " Lucretia took her cosmetics from the sack . " Ted Newsome is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want ye to bring ' im home while I 'm here . I want to sit down and have a talk with ' im about the old times when he was a young fleshand-blood man and I was a saplin ' of a boy ! I want to talk with ' im about the old people who ust to be around here then . You tell ' im not to go a-hidin ' but to come while I 'm here . " " I 'll tell him , Dad , " she said , " but I doubt if he will . He might not want to talk about the past . He might not want to remember . You 've already said he was bushwhacked over the Dortch girl . He might think Hootbird would bushwhack him over me ! " " Lutie , he ca n't be bushwhacked now , " Op said in a serious tone . " Hootbird nor no bird can ever hurt Ted agin . He 's paid the price of love once and he 'll never haf to pay agin . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorely did n't have much enjoyment before . Not when he was shot square betwixt the eyes ! I want him to love ye and ye to love him . Anybody that would bring all these nice flowers and be so good to ye , it pays to be nice to ' im . And I do n't want ye to get too close to that Hootbird I Iammertight . " " Dad , I 'm not interested in Hootbird . " She laughed . " I 'm not quite as nasty to Hoot as you are , that 's all . " " But sometimes wimmen change their minds , " Op said . Beadle changed her mind when she married me . She 'd told  | everybody she would n't have me on a Christmas tree , but I kept on until she changed ' er mind and then I married ' er jist as soon as she was in the notion . If I know anythin ' about men , Hootbird 'll keep after ye like a hound-dog . " Lutie took her cosmetics to the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every move she made . " What 's all that stuff ? " he asked . " Oh , just some lipstick , powder base , cold cream , and nail polish . This is wind-and-weather lotion . " She opened a jar and started rubbing some cream on her face . " What 's the matter with yer face ? " Op asked , alarmed . " Looks all right to me . Never saw Beadie do that to herself in all the time I knowed ' er . " " This is the way I clean my face of rouge and powder . " " What 's wrong with soap and water ? " " Oh , Dad ! That makes your skin rough and dry , " Lucretia answered . " All girls my age use cosmetics like these . I need them on Laurel Ridge the same as I did in Dayton . " " What 's that red stuff your 're a-puttin ' on yer fingers ? " Op leaned forward , squinting . " Why , it 's nail polish , Dad . Surely you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance , " he admitted gruffly . " But the only reddenin ' Beadie ever did was to bite ' er lips and pinch ' er cheeks . To bring out a little natural color , she usta say . " " Well , nowadays girls use rouge and lipstick to do that . You liked the color in Mother 's cheeks and lips , did n't you ? " " Are ye a-fixin ' up fer Ted , Lutie ? " Lucretia smiled and nodded , " Yes . " " That 's the way I like to hear ye talk . " Op was smiling . " Lutie , keep on a-seein ' Ted . Let him fetch ye new bouquets . Ted lives on Laurel Ridge and probably knows where every patch of wild flowers grows . I 'll bet he knows Laurel Ridge better'n I do . "  | He stopped suddenly , frowning . Then he smiled again . " Course he no longer has need of vittals . I do n't haf to worry about his a-pickin ' the berries and shootin ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell ' im when ye see ' im agin that I want ' im to come to this cabin when I 'm here and sit down and talk with me . " I 'll tell him , Dad . " Lucretia hid her smile . " I feel much better , Lutie , " Op told her . " I can go to bed and sleep without worry . I ust never to worry about anythin ' . But a woman in the house and now I 'm a-frettin ' like a hen . " 15 Over the Sandy Valley the white mists formed a cloud floor from Laurel Ridge to the Allcorn Hills . Down under , the Sandy River , the turnpike , and all the valley were hidden . And the sun shone brilliantly on this cloud floor . Op was standing in his front yard looking at this scene when Doshie and Hootbird walked up . " It 's a pretty mornin ' , Op , " Doshie cackled at him . Doshie always reminded Op of a bow-legged underfed hen , a-pickin ' and a-scratchin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to walk straight over to the Allcorn Hills , " Op said . " I 'd love to try cloud walkin ' . " " Yep , the clouds are awful purty . " Doshie smiled , and her long loose mouth looked a foot wide . " Hootbird just said it would be wonderful if the valleys in this county could be spanned by cloud bridges and people could walk across ' em from hilltop to hilltop . And Looten County could be a level county , part clouds and part land . Sure would save a lot of walkin ' and the use of a body 's legs . " 71  | " Looks like ye 're a-goin ' to pick some berries this mornin ' , " Op said suspiciously . " Where ye pickin ' ? " Doshie was carrying a bucket in each hand , although Hootbird had come empty-handed . " Hootbird found a patch of wild strawberries yesterday , " Doshie said . " Thought maybe ye and Lutie would like to go with us and pick this mornin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on in Honeywell and I ca n't scrub the courthouse floors . So I thought we 'd get out and pick somethin ' from the floor of the earth . Thought maybe ye 'd like to go since ye can see agin . " " Hoot , ye found my berries , " Op said . " Ye found ' em in Shinglemill on the right-hand side of the little fork that branches off toward Coonden . " " How did ye know , Op ? " Hootbird asked . " I ought to know , " Op told him . " I picked strawberries there this time in May before ye was born . Big clusters on the vines , red as blood and sweet as sugar , with terrapins a-crawlin ' amongst ' em . Yes , I 'd better go if I want to get any from that patch . But I know where there 's more patches , Hoot ! " " The sun has pulled up the dew by this time of day , " Doshie said , looking up at the sun , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to pick . The berries will be fresh , clean , and sweet atter they 're washed by dew and dried by the sun . " " I 'll go ask Lutie , " Op told them . " Do n't suppose she 's never picked any kind of berries . " When the party started out Laurel Ridge , they paired off . Hootbird and Lucretia led the way . Doshie and Op walked behind . " Hootbird , ye fergot somethin ' , " Op called to him . " What did I ferget ? " Hootbird said , stopping to look back . " Ye do n't have yer rifle . "  | " But I 'm not alone this mornin ' , " Hootbird said . " I 'm not afraid . That stranger in the woods would have enough respect fer ladies that he would n't shoot amongst ' em . " Hootbird turned and hurried on to catch Lucretia . " He 'd better have respect fer us , Op , " Doshie whispered . " I 've got somethin ' here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him respect us . Ye let anybody try to pull anythin ' on us . I 'll tell ye a body 's patience can be tried jist so long . This ridge woman will jist take so much . " Theopolis let Doshie walk in front of him . He let Doshie lift a greenbrier from across the fox path so she could go on . Hootbird walked in front of Lucretia to practice his good manners , pushing the greenbriers aside with his body so Lucretia could pass unmolested . Op watched Doshie fighting the briers , a glint in his eye . She was wearing a red skirt and a purple blouse . It hurt Op 's eyes to look at them worse than it did when he stared straight into the sun . On her fingers , as usual , were all kinds and descriptions of cheap rings . Most of them she had collected out of popcorn and crackerjack boxes . Hootbird and Lucretia led the way , walking down the slope between the sumac clumps and the patches of wild-blackberry briers . They walked under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hootbird set his buckets down and lifted Lucretia across the Shinglemill Branch , though it was a narrow stream and she could have easily stepped over . Doshie looked at Op and smiled . Op saw where there was a tooth missing in front . Doshie hesitated at the bank , but Op stepped over and left her standing on the other side . When Doshie saw everybody walking on , she hopped across too and ran to catch up with the others . 73  | 16 " Look at the berries , " Lucretia said , " and they 're growing wild . Here for anybody to pick ! It does n't seem true ! Not after you buy them at stores all your life for fifty cents a box ! " " They 're here where I found ' em all right , " Hootbird bragged . " There are still pockets of the earth left as God made ' em , " Op said . " Fruit , nuts , and wild game left as they must have been in the beginnin ' . Laurel Ridge is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild strawberries . Little plants with three leaves to the stem , tiny brown specks on the leaves , with a handful of clean red berries growing from a little leafless stem on each plant . And the berry plants were tied to one another by tiny runners . The steep bluff from the stream to the timber was covered with these plants . In the middle of a slope on a little oak sprout , a catbird sat and quarreled with them . " He thinks these berries belong to ' im , " Op said . " We 'll show ' im in a minute that ten fingers ' r worth more than one beak . " " Look at that old terrapin a-goin ' up there , " I-lootbird said . He pointed to a terrapin that moved slowly on his outstretched scaly legs . His long black neck was thrust from his brown-andblack-checked shell and his nose was angled toward the sky . His little beady eyes glistened in the morning sun . " He 'll never go fast enough to wear his legs out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catbird ? " Op mused . " I 'd like to know what they think of each other . " " This is the way to do it , Lutie , " Hootbird showed her . " Pick four and five at the time . Put yer hand under ' em and lift ' em from the stem . Not one at the time . " " But I 'm afraid of mashing them . "  | " Not with your purty soft white hands , " he said . " Not when I do n't mash ' em with my big hard ones . Use both hands at once , too . " Op and Doshie were picking , not far apart , each trying to outpick the other . Op had often bragged that he was the best berrypicker on Laurel Ridge , and Doshie claimed she was the fastest woman berrypicker among the Looten County hills . This was the first time they had ever picked berries together . They listened , never looking up , for the sounds of the berries dropping into each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering where he saw the last plant and reaching down and getting the berries with both hands while he looked ahead for two more plants . Op had trained himself to do this . He could remember the spot he had last seen and put his hands on two different berry plants while he looked ahead for the next . Hootbird picked beside Lucretia , dropping a handful of berries into her bucket now and then . Op listened to the words he murmured to her , but he could n't tell what Hootbird was saying . Hootbird was as close to Lucretia as he could get , speaking softly . While the berrypickers dropped strawberries into their buckets , a yellowhammer , with blotches of red on his head and body , zipped over their heads and alighted on a dead white oak . Only Lucretia and Hootbird took time to look up . They watched him bore into the sap rot of a dead white oak and take a worm from the tree . Then he climbed to the big hole a few feet above and dove in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the hole . " Ai n't fambly life wonderful ? " Hootbird smiled like a halfmoon , only sillier . Lucretia moved away . " Jist be keerful about snakes , " Doshie warned . " Look out fer the copperheads ! " She spoke without raising her head . " Snakes are like people , " Op broke in . " If there was a snake  | in this berry patch when we came here and started talkin ' , it 's crawled away . A few of the old bull copperheads wo n't move fer nothin ' nor nobody ! They 'll even fight a forest fire , a-strikin ' and hittin ' at the flames till they 're burned to death , and their ashes leaves a little white strip on the dark-brown wood ashes . " ' Wild honeybees hummed slowly over the strawberry vines hunting for dogfennel , sheepshower , and the wild-rose blossoms . They bent the trillium , loaded with blossoms , near a rotting stump . " Bucketful , " Op shouted suddenly , rising to straighten his back . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doshie said . " Same-size buckets , " Op argued . " Let anybody look at ' em . " " Yourn is a two-gallon water bucket and mine is a two-gallon-and-a-half ! " " Dist to show ye , Doshie , I 'll set my bucket beside yourn . " Hootbird and Lucretia stopped to watch the measurements of the buckets . " See , the rims are even , " Op said . " But my bucket is bigger around , " Doshie argued . " We 'll see about that , " Op said . He broke a weed and measured the diameter of his bucket . Then he laid the weed across the top of Doshie 's bucket . Its length was the exact diameter of her bucket . " I knew ye 's a-tryin ' to beat me , Doshie , " Op said . " Ye tried to slow me down by a-talkin ' about snakes and ye kept on a-pickin ' . But I fooled ye . I 'm still the champion berrypicker . " " We 've not got our five-quart buckets filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' more talkin ' than pickin ' up there , " Op told him . " But people are only young once , Op , " Doshie simpered , " and in the wild-strawberry patch there might be a lot of love a-goin '  | into their buckets with each strawberry . I like to see young people in love . When my girl Daisy meets a young man on the streets in Honeywell and he brings ' er home , I 'm allus at their heels a-listenin ' . And when he takes ' er to the house and kisses ' er good night , I pretend to be lookin ' away but I watch from the corner of my eye . I love to watch young people kiss . Ben 's awful slow about his kissin ' . " " If old Ben kisses ye at all , Doshie , he 's a-doin ' all right . " Op pretended he was joking . The very idea of anyone kissing Doshie made him weak in the knees . He glanced at Hootbird and Lucretia . Hoot 's big Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries from his full bucket into hers . Op was wishing that the Lord had never invented strawberries . Then a shot rang out that echoed and re-echoed across Shinglemill Hollow . 17 " Spat " ? the bullet hit the soft butternut tree above Hootbird 's head , leaving a little light-colored hole where it entered the bark , and splinters where it came through on the other side . The shot was fired from the hilltop behind them , down into the little valley . When the shot rang out and the bullet hit the tree ten feet above Hootbird 's head , he dropped his bucket of berries on the ground . They rolled down the steep slope like red marbles , lodging behind clumps of flowers and weeds . Each one stood rigidly in his tracks . Even Hootbird stood for a moment , but not rigidly . He was trembling like a hickory leaf in the evening wind on Laurel Ridge . Then Hootbird moved off on wobbly legs , his face pale as a frosted beech leaf in October , his hands shaking like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope toward Shinglemill Hollow until he came to the timber line and then he turned up the hill , clawing the ground with his fingers as he pulled himself up . He went up the slope on his all fours until he was fenced in again by the timber line , then he rose to his feet and started back on his wobbly legs toward Lucretia . He had staggered full circle , his eyes glazed . " He 's not hit , " Op said . " Hoot 's gun shy . He 's skeered . " Doshie had not spoken , but she put her hand down in her bosom , pulled out her twenty-two automatic pistol , turned , and shot seven times in the direction from which the rifle shot had been fired . Each bullet spatted leaves and branches , and two bullets hit trees and sang into space . " Hot lead is the only answer to this business , " she said , blowing smoke from the barrel of her pistol . " He did n't try to hit Hoot , " Op said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the center of a tree , he could 've hit Hoot if he 'd a-aimed at ' im . " " Then I 'd like to know what he was a-tryin ' to do ? " Hootbird croaked with a trembling voice . " He was a-tryin ' to skeer ye , " Op said . " It 's a poor way to skeer a person , " Doshie retorted as she took cartridges from the little pocket on her skirt and reloaded . Lucretia had not moved from her tracks . She had not spoken a word and she stood there still holding to her bucket of berries . She stared in the direction from which the shot had come . " I believe it 's somebody a-tryin ' to take my son 's life , " Doshie said . " It 's that strange man that 's been seen on this ridge ! " " Maybe he 's jealous of ye , Hootbird , " Op cackled like a hen , " a-pickin ' berries with Lutie . " Lucretia spoke to Op sharply . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I 'm too nervous . " Op walked up the hill to the butternut tree . IIe looked up the  | side where the bullet had gone in . Then he twisted his neck like a terrapin around on the other side and looked up . " Ye 'd better stay down here in the hollow , Op , " Doshie warned . " Ye might get a bullet plumb through ye . " " That 's a bullet hole all right , " Op said , turning and coming down the hill . " It went clean through six inches of soft butternut wood . He 's got a powerful rifle . Must be a Krag-Jorgensen . " " I 'll never come back here agin , " Hootbird said . He picked up his empty bucket with a shaking hand . " The catbirds can have these berries fer all I keer . " When Hootbird and Lucretia walked down the slope , he did n't walk close to her and he let Lucretia carry her own bucket of berries . His empty bucket jingled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody 's skeered , " Op said , " ' ceptin ' me . I 've heard bullets fly through the brush in this ridge many a night as I walked along it . I 've had to run backward and forward to dodge the bullets , but I was n't skeered . That was when I was a young man and people still traveled this ridge . " " Were they trying to kill you , Dad ? " Lucretia asked . " No , jist a-shootin ' fer the sport of it , " he admitted , walking over the berry patch . " We ust to go huntin ' with single-barrel shotguns on this ridge , and if the foxes had ketched all the rabbits and birds and we did n't have anythin ' to shoot at , we got off a safe distance and shot at each other . It was a game we played . The man that had the most shot in him after we each had shot six times was Simeon Girty , the traitor . The man that had the least shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girty once . And twice I was Daniel Boone . " " I do n't believe that , Op , " Doshie said , as the party continued down the little valley toward Shinglemill Branch . " I do n't keer what ye believe , Doshie , " Op sputtered . " It 's  | the truth . I 've got shot still in me to show . And I 've got little white scars all over my shoulders and back and a lot below . " " I would n't play a crazy game like that , " Hootbird said . " If ye 'd a-played it ye would n't be so gun shy , " Op told him . Hootbird did n't offer to lift Lucretia across the creek when they came to it . Each one stepped over it in single file . When they started up the hill toward the fox path , Hootbird walked close to his mother . " Wo n't ye walk on the other side of I-Ioot ? " Doshie asked Lucretia . " We 're out in this open field and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely wo n't shoot a woman . " Lucretia calmly moved up beside Hootbird . Theopolis led the way up the hill , around the clusters of blackberry vines , over the saw briers , under the sumac fronds , the persimmon , and pawpaw boughs . " Hidin ' behind wimminfolks ! " he muttered . Then his tone changed , a note of admiration creeping in . " Ole Ted 's got himself some rifle . Allus was a smart one ! " 18 " Beadie , Beadle , " Op screamed . " That 's ye , Beadle ! Ye 've come back to me ! " Theopolis jumped from his bed onto the floor dragging the cover with him , He stood shaking in the darkness like a lean saw brier in a February wind . " Where are ye , Beadie ? " he asked . The shooting of a rifle and the bullet 's going harmlessly through a soft butternut tree had not bothered Op . But now his legs shook until he could hardly stand . He stretched his long arm and fingered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down .  | " Beadie , " he wept . He could feel the warm tears flowing down his cheeks . " It 's fer a purpose that ye 've come . Tell me the reason ! What is it ? What have I done ? " There was not a sound in the cabin . " Answer me , Beadie ? " Theopolis heard himself cry out . There was no other sound . " I 'm not dreamin ' , " he said . " I know I saw ye . I saw yer brown eyes and brown hair . Saw yer smile , Beadie , the way ye looked thirty years ago ! Beadie " And they tell me people do n't come back to earth from the speret world , he thought as he wiped tears from his stubbly bearded cheeks with his hand . They come back but they do n't stay long enough . " Beadie , come sit down on the bed beside me and talk , " he said in a trembling voice . " I 'm not afraid to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ast . There 's a lot of things I 'd like to know . Come sit down beside me agin ! I 've been as good a man as I know how to be all the years since ye 've been gone , Beadie ! It 's not been wimmen , Beadie . And I stopped a few years ago fermentin ' the pawpaws and the ' simmons and a-layin ' on the ridges on my back with my eyes upturned to the rain ! A-lyin ' dead to the world with the empty brandy jug beside me ! Ye know that now , Beadie , because ye 're amongst the blest . The crave of drink is no longer with me ! I 've repented a thousand times , Beadie , I did n't quit it while ye were with me on this earth ! Hear me , Beadie ! If ye do n't sit down beside me and talk , I 'll jist talk to ye . " There 's somebody here with me now , Beadie , " Op continued . " She come to me in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's here . She lies in this room , Beadie ! Is she our daughter ? " Theopolis sat in silence while a chill went over his body . His teeth chattered and he fought vainly to control his shaking .  | His body trembled until he rattled the bed . Finally the chill began to leave him . " Lutie , wake up , " Op cried . " Beadie 's appeared to me . She put ' er face down agin my face and my eyes were opened . I saw ' er , Lutie , plain as I ever saw ' er . Young and purty as she ust to be and she looked at me with her brown eyes without sayin ' a word . She 's come to me fer a purpose , Lutie ! Maybe it 's because of ye ! " Lucretia did n't answer Theopolis . He arose from the side of the bed , fumbled for the matchbox on the little table . With a shaking hand he struck a match and lit the lamp . He reached for his pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoes but did n't lace them . " Lutie , Beadie has appeared to me , " he cried again . Then Theopolis walked around behind the sheet partition and found Lucretia 's bed was empty . He almost dropped the lamp he was holding in his hand . " Lutie , Lutie , where are ye ? " Op shouted as he stumbled to the cabin door . " Have ye left ? " He unlatched the door . The wind flicked the yellow lamp flame but the lamp globe would not let the wind blow it out . He held the lamp to one side as he looked down the road toward the sty . He heard voices . Op turned quickly and looked in the other direction toward Pawpaw Gap . He saw the dim outline of a man disappearing in the semidarkness of Laurel Ridge . And Lucretia was walking quietly toward the cabin . When she came within the lamplight , she looked up at him . She was dressed in her best , but the lipstick was not all on her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed up on one cheek .  | 19 " Lutie , where 've ye been ? " Op asked . " In the yard most of the time , " she replied . " Sitting on our bench watching the moon rise up and sink down ! " " Who was that man , Lutie , I saw a-walkin ' over toward Pawpaw Gap ? " " Not Hootbird , Dad , " she replied . " That was Ted Newsome ! " " Oh , it was Ted agin . " Theopolis spoke in a softer tone . " Did ye tell ' im I wanted to have a long talk with ' im sometime about the past ? " " Yes , I told him , " she said . " Ted said he 'd try to drop in to talk with you sometime . But tonight he did n't want to disturb you . " How did he wake you without wakin ' me ? " Op asked . " Dad , it was a sound like the fanning of wings against my window when Ted came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Ted 's face against my windowpane . He beckoned to me and I got up and dressed quickly and went to him ! " " That 's the way they come , all right . " Op nodded vigorously . " I 'd like to get next to ' im too , Lutie . He 's a good speret . " " I think he is , Dad . " " But ye ca n't marry with a speret , remember . He 'd never want to marry , anyway . Atter what he got betwixt his eyes , he 'll want the enjoyment of a peaceful love affair right here on Laurel Ridge . He 's come back to the scene of his mortal death to have his love affair . Maybe he 's a-doin ' this to spite Lucinda Dortch who two-timed ' im . That 's why he 's back here ! " Then Op stopped short , peering at the smudges on Lucretia 's face . " He shore messed yer paint some and he did n't do it from no distance . Now I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've heard their voices myself , but I do n't know a soul who 's ever been kissed by one . " " Well , Dad ? " Lucretia seemed embarrassed , and uncertain as to how to answer . " But Ted 's a speret all right if he waked ye with his wings fannin ' against the winder , " Op mused as he walked back onto the porch with Lutie following after . " He 's probably dropped down from the thin air . If he 's to sail over Hootbird on his wings spread like a big chicken hawk , " Op said , " he 'd skeer Hoot to death . We 'd haf to make a coffin fer old Hoot . How I 'd love to see him glide above Hoot , kickin ' his feet in the air like he was a-swimmin ' in the water ! If I ever get close to Ted I 'll put a few things into his mind ! " " Dad , Ted does n't fly , " Lucretia said . " He prefers to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Op stared hard at her in the yellow glow of lamplight , " I do n't think ye believe in sperets ! Be keerful about that . It 's dangerous not to believe . Ye 're sparkin ' a speret and I 'm glad , but ye 'd better believe in ' im . " " I do believe in spirits , Dad , " Lucretia told him . " I know since I 've come to Laurel Ridge that they are here . I know they 're real . " " Now ye 're talkin ' right , Lutie , " Op said . " Ye should know it when ye 've been beneath the moon a-spoonin ' a speret . I 've been right in this cabin with one , too . Beadie is disturbed about somethin ' . Ted Newsome waked ye up and Beadie waked me . She 's been here , Lutie , in this very room when it was dark . I never heard a sound of wings fannin ' against the winderpanes either . When I opened my good eye , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day I married ' er . I spoke to Beadie , loud enough fer ye and Ted to hear if ye were a-sittin ' out there on the bench . I told ' er that I was a much better man than I was when she lived with me .

I 'm not afeared of any animal or flesh-and-blood man that walks , Lutie . But when it comes to the sperets , I weaken . I 'm humble , Lutie . It pays to be . Beadie was back here fer a purpose and if ye 're our daughter it might be because of ye . " Then , does Ted Newsome come to see me for a purpose ? " she asked Op . " Ye bet he does , Lutie , " Op answered quickly . " Ted Newsome has a purpose . " " But what could it be , Dad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammertight , " Op replied . " I think old Hoot 's intentions are evil . Ye 're a purty gal , Lutie . No man will ever look at ye jist once . " " Oh , Dad , you 're wonderful , " Lucretia said . " If you have the least suspicions about me , forget them . When Hootbird is with me , he stays in his place . And when Ted Newsome is with me , you know you do n't have to worry . I can take care of myself . " Op held his big gnarled hand above the lamp globe and blew louder than the wheeze of a horse with the thumps . The tiny golden flame disappeared and left the room in darkness . " I 'll always be on Ted Newsome 's side , " he said . 20 " Hello ! Is this where Theopolis Akers lives ? " Op lifted his hoe and turned to the direction of the sound . " Yep , this is where he lives , " he said . " Ye 're a-talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman standing by the garden gate . The man was slender and of medium height but stooped over . He 85  | was fanning his hot pale face and his thin blond hair with his hat . The woman beside him came almost to his shoulder . She was a plump , attractive , black-headed woman . And she was fanning too , with a little paper fan , the kind passed out by the funeral director , Oddis Timmons , in Honeywell . Op could see , between the palings , three suitcases on the ground beside them . " Mr. Akers , it 's some climb up this ridge , " said the man , fanning his hot face with his crumpled straw hat . " We 've been since early this morning coming from Honeywell . " " Do ye live in Honeywell ? " Op asked as he walked toward the garden fence . " No , we 're from Dayton , Ohio , " said the man . " This is my wife , Julia , and I 'm Alfred Pruitt . " " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked over to the palings and eyed the strangers suspiciously . " How 'd ye know about me ? How 'd ye know to come here ? " " Will and Corrinne Day are my uncle and aunt , " said Alfred Pruitt . " My mother is Aunt Beadie 's youngest sister . You 're my uncle by marriage . Your daughter Lutie is my cousin . " " Shucks , I ai n't so shore she 's my daughter , " Op said . " I 've doubted it all the time . " " She 's your daughter if you 're Theopolis Akers , " Pruitt said . " She 's my first cousin and you 're my uncle . Where is she ? " " She 's in the cabin , " Op said , looking strangely at the couple . " She 's workin ' the cabin instead of helpin ' me hoe this patch of corn . I got it planted late on account of my eyes . I was blind as a bat when Lutie come down here ! " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , smiling at Theopolis . " Lutie 's been writing her uncle and aunt about you and Laurel Ridge . Aunt Corrinne read some of her letters to us . They were simply marvelous . " " And we decided Laurel Ridge was the place for us , " Alf said . " Say , what 's all this about ? " Op asked , his gnarled fingers  | scratching in his long hair . " I do remember Beadie had a sister Alice . I 'd fergot all about ' er ! So ye 're her son , are ye ? " When Lucretia heard Op talking she came out onto the porch . " Cousin Alf ! " she cried . " And Cousin Julia ! What are you doing on Laurel Ridge ? " " Your letters brought us here , " the thin stooped man said emphatically . " We 've come to stay ! Laurel Ridge sounds like one of the safest places left in the United States ! We 've come to be with you and Uncle Theopolis ! " " Do n't call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Call me Op ' if ye got ta call me at all ! " " And you call me Alf ' too , " Pruitt said , friendly-like . Lucretia hurried through the front-yard gate and ran down beside the garden palings . She shook her Cousin Alf 's hand and hugged and kissed her Cousin Julia . Op stood on the other side looking over at the suitcases in disgust . " It 's wonderful to see you , Julia , " Lucretia said , smiling . " You and Alf on Laurel Ridge ! I ca n't believe it . " " I ca n't believe it either , " Alf said , fanning again . " I never got as hot in my life as I did carrying two suitcases up that hill and out this ridge . I thought I 'd faint , though I stopped and took a rest every few minutes . We 've been since seven this morning getting out here . " Op shook his head sadly . " City folks fergit even how to walk . " " I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But nothing would do Alf after Aunt Corrinne read your letters to us but to come to Laurel Ridge ! That 's the place for me , ' Alf said to me one night last week . I 'm going to that country . I 'm going to spend the rest of my days there . I 'm getting away from this dangerous spot . ' So here we are . Alf got a leave of absence . " " And I think it 's going to be a long leave of absence , " Alf said proudly . " I spent ten years working up to my position there . It took me ten minutes after I heard your letters to decide to 87  | leave it . I 'd rather be a man without a job . I do n't want to be blown up . I do n't want to be consumed by fire ! " His voice began to shake . " Now , let 's do n't start all that again , Alf , " Julia said . " Yes , you tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her . " But I consider my life worth more than eight thousand a year . And what did we have after taxes ? We do n't have any dependents . We did n't have any way to cover up . We had to pay it all back to the government . And after we made payments on a home , bought a car and food and clothes , it was all we could do to live ! And to live in that awful fear ! " His voice kept rising like wind in the trees . " It was too much for me . It was getting on my nerves . I believe that Wright Airfield will be bombed one of these days ! I 've been reading in the papers about this atom bomb and those terrible explosions . I could n't take it any longer . One of these days planes will cross the Atlantic and Pacific with atom bombs and wipe out our industrial cities and airfields . The only safe places in America will be the mountains and the rough spots where nobody lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " What 's all this ye 're a-talkin ' about ? " Op said , staring at the intruders . " I never heard tell of the adam bumb ! " " Now , listen to that , Julia , " Alf said , wetting his sun-andwind-dried lips with his tongue . " This is just what I 've been telling you . Lutie 's own father does n't know anything about the atom bomb ! Look at the peace of mind he has . He 's not a nervous wreck ! He goes on about his daily living like people used to before science brought on this monster to destroy civiliza-tion ! " Alf could n't hold his arms still while he talked . His lips twitched and he blinked his eyes rapidly . " Dad does n't read , " Lutie explained . " And he 's never had a  | radio up here . That 's the reason he 's not up on all this atomic stuff . " " What does he do for music ? " Julia asked Lucretia . " What did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to live with him ? " " Make my own music , " Op replied . " Look over there on the cabin walls . Talk to my dog , old Jerry , and he tries to talk back . Now and then I talk to one of the Hammertights . Guess I even talk to myself and then answer . But I like it . " Alf could n't stop talking . " I rented our house and put our car in the garage . I would have sold both of them if Julia had n't raised such a fuss . " " Hammertights are the only people who live near Laurel Ridge , " Lucretia explained . " They live down under at Wince Leffard Gap . " " I guess we 'll be getting acquainted with all these places with the quaint names . " Julia smiled at Op . " Maybe ye will , and maybe ye wo n't , " Op told her . " The minute I saw yer suitcases there on the ground my mind started workin ' . Our cabin ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , Op , " Alf interrupted . " I plan to build us a little one-room log house with my own hands ! And if there is a big rock cliff close that 's good and dry , I would n't mind living there till the cabin 's finished . I want to live from the land like Lutie said you did . I want to rough it . " " Ever use an ax ? " Op asked . " No . " " Some cabin yell build without an ax ! " " I 'll learn , " Alf said , fanning nervously again . " But where 'll we live until then ? " " I 've got a smokehouse out there that might suit ye , " Op said reluctantly , pointing to the squat little one-room log house . I  | " What I started to say , one house ai n't big enough fer two famblies . I 've allus had that smokehouse ready if my cabin burnt so I 'd have someplace to go . " " That 's wonderful , Op , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impose on you . Are there any other houses on Laurel Ridge ? " " That cabin and smokehouse are the only two buildin 's on Laurel Ridge , " Op said . " It looks like the smokehouse will have to suit us , " Julia said . " It 'll be quite a change after the home we built in Dayton . " " Then the smokehouse is where we 'll live . " Alf was enthusiastic . " Let 's be on our way ! " " Not now . It 's not ready , " Op said . " I ca n't get outten keepin ' ye in the cabin fer one night . We 've jist got two beds . Maybe we can make out . Alf can sleep with me and Julia can sleep with Lutie . " " Thanks awfully , Op , you 're a real brick . " Alf pumped Theopolis 's calloused hand and slapped him on the back . Then he picked up the three suitcases and staggered toward the cabin . Julia and Lutie followed , chattering like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his burley leaf . " A real brick , eh ? I 'll give ye five days on the Ridge . Gon na build himself a cabin without an ax ! " 21 Op 's mood brightened somewhat during the evening meal , and Lutie felt relieved . After they had finished , Op pushed his chair back from the table , put his hand in his pocket , and pulled out a long root . He held it to his mouth and bit off a big chew . Alf , who was sitting beside Op , looked on curiously .  | " I do n't mean to be too inquisitive , " said Alf , " but I 'd like to know what that is you 're chewing ! " " That 's my medicine , " Op told him . " It 's calmus root I find in the swamps along the Sandy River . Ever hear of calmus root ? " " Never did , " Alf said . " Is it good for you ? " " I ust to see blind spots before my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings that looked like the sun and I 'd break out in a sweat . And I wanted to run all the time like a wild turkey . But the calmus weed took away the spots before my eyes and it slowed me down . It made me feel like a new man ! " " How did you know about this weed ? " Alf asked . " Did a doctor recommend it to you ? " " I never was to a doctor but twice in my life , " Op told him . " Lutie took me twice to Doctor Turnbo fer my cataract . Calmus root was an old medicine in our fambly . Pap ust to chew it all the time . No doctor ever told him about it . Some Indian chief down in North Carolina told his father , my grandpa Powatan Akers , about it ! " Op leaned forward excitedly . " And , Alf , there 're roots , stems , and leaves that 'll cure ye of all that nervousness ! There 's a weed a-growin ' on Laurel Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a purpose fer every weed and flower He 's created ! " Op ground the calmus weed slowly with his perfect teeth , and took tiny swallows . Alf took a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket and handed them across the table to Julia . She offered one to Op . " Never smoked one in my life , " he said . " I sometimes thaw a little light burley . But cigarettes is coffin nails . Allus believed it . " " Is that the only medicine you have to take , Op ? " Alf pointed at the root . " No , I 've got a good supply of roots , stems , and leaves over  | in the smokehouse , " he said . " Ye 'll see ' em tomorrow . I 've got to lay in my medicine fer the winter same as I lay in a good pile of stovewood . After the plants die and the snows fall , a body ca n't find the roots . The only time my yarbs ever failed me was on my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No doctor bills to pay ? " Alf said , blowing a cloud of sweetsmelling cigarette smoke across the table . " Some people left in the world still know how to live , Julia . " " Yes , but are you willing to try root remedies yourself ? " she asked Alf . " I 'm ready to try anything , " he said . " I 've been to doctors and osteopaths , then psychiatrists , and even chiropractors ! I 've never been helped . I 've still got this nervousness . " " Cousin Alf , what 's the matter with you ? " Lucretia asked . " Oh , he 's just nervous , " Julia answered blowing a wisp of smoke from her full red lips . " Alf 's had too much responsibility at Wright Airfield . He 's over a crew of men and he worries trying to get things done . " " I worry about everything , " Alf said . " When I park my car on a street in autumn and the leaves are falling , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked : What if some irresponsible smart aleck comes along smoking a cigarette and throws it down with fire in the butt and it catches the leaves on fire ? And the fire burns under my car and catches the gasoline and it explodes and blows my car up and sets a dozen houses on fire ! ' I have thoughts like these all the time . I do n't know how many times I 've gone back to my car and driven it away and parked it where there were no leaves ! " " That 's easy , " Op said . " Ye should n't own a car . Use yer legs ! " " And just recently , when there was a dark cloud in the skv , Alf got to unplugging all the light cords in the house before we went to bed , " Julia said . " He was afraid lightning would strike  | the house and set it on fire and we would n't be able to phone the fire department . " " That 's too bad , " Op said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarb medicine . There 's a remedy fer ye . " " Will you be afraid of an oil lamp ? " Lucretia asked . Alf 's attention was drawn to the oil lamp in the middle of the table . Since Theopolis always raised both windows in the cabin when Lucretia started cooking , the wind was bending the golden flame forward . But the flame clung tenaciously to the oil-soaked wick which fed it . " You might lower the windows so there would n't be any danger of the wind blowing the flame into the oil , " Alf warned . " I 'm not too concerned about it but that 's just a precautionary suggestion . " " I 've had the wind to blow the lamp out many a time , " Op said , " but never the fire into the oil . I 've allus loved the fresh air on Laurel Ridge . Haf to haf it same as a fish hast to haf water . I do n't like the smell of vittals . I 'd rather haf the fresh wind . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I go to my long home in the Freewill Baptist Graveyard where I wo n't get all this good , fresh Laurel Ridge air . " " I think what started all of this for Alf was the discovery of the atomic bomb , " Julia said . " He was n't very nervous when I married him . When this bomb was used in the Second World War , Alf read the reports and could n't sleep for days . Now , every time we have an atomic-bomb test , I have to hide the papers . He thinks we 're going to be bombed . He thinks the world is going to pieces and ... " " It is going to pieces , " Alf interrupted as he dubbed the end of his cigarette on his plate with nervous fingers . " The Bible says this world will be destroyed by fire ! And what is the atomic bomb but fire ? We do n't have a monopoly on the atomic bomb and we do n't have the fastest and best planes . If we figure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to bomb us too . And when we 're bombed , the only safe places left in this world will be places like Laurel Ridge ! Did n't I read in the papers with my own eyes about our large cities having a hundred thousand shrouds ready for our ashes ? How can an undertaker put a shroud on a handful of wind-blown ashes ? I 'm not the only one worried . Others are thinking about it too ! " " When Alf started unplugging the light sockets every time there was a dark cloud in the sky , I agreed to leave Dayton with him , " Julia said . " So here we are on Laurel Ridge ! You do n't have a radio up here and we wo n't get a newspaper ! " " I 'm sure we 've found the right place , " Alf said , unconsciously lighting another cigarette with stiff white fingers . " When I heard this country had a million coffins stored for an atomic attack , I said to myself : Not one of these coffins is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' When I read about a chain of air defenses to protect us from an atomic blitz , I could n't sleep . Why are we building air-raid shelters ? Why is our government building places underground to house our valuable documents ? What about all those Shelter ' signs ? " " Alf , ye talk like the end of time is near , " Op told him . " It 's skeery talk . " " These are scary times . " Perspiration was running down Alf 's forehead . " These might be the last days of what we call civilization . I hear we 've got bombs a hundred times more powerful than the ones we dropped on Japan . Do n't you believe our enemies have ' em too ? " he asked , leaning forward toward Op . " And I 've heard about a death dust that might even blow from Dayton to Laurel Ridge . It kills every living thing . And what about these flying saucers ? And this new bomb we got that 's a thousand times as powerful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crack the face of the earth . " " I-goalies , I 've never heard a thing about all these bombs ,  | saucers , and pizen dust , " Op said . He looked suspiciously at Alf . Then he said , " But I 'm not a-runnin ' from nothin ' . " Theopolis dug into his pocket for another chew of calmus root . Many times in the past he had had this same feeling ? that the world was a-movin ' too fast fer him . So he took a chew of root and thought about the things he understood . 22 While Lutie and Julia washed the dishes , Op and Alf sat on the bench under the tall pines . The bright moon was rising up over the green clouds of wind-fluttering leaves in Little White Oak Valley . A whippoorwill was singing down in Red Bird Hollow near the spring . And a cool early-June wind was blowing over Laurel Ridge . " Now , this is the life . " Alf exhaled two wisps of thin smoke from his nostrils and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've looked forward to for a long , long time ! " Op chewed his calmus weed . A fox barked on Laurel Ridge near the sty . " Op , have you ever been out of the state ? " Alf asked . " Nope , I 've never been outten Looten County . " Op 's dark heavy eyebrows came down over his eyes in a frown . " In fact , I 've never been over very much of this county . I 've just walked to a few hills I could see from this ridge . I got curious about ' em and wanted to see what they were like . I looked these hills over and found the grass and the pine boughs were greener on Laurel Ridge . So Jerry and I walked back home . " Jerry had followed Op around the cabin . Now he was standing on his hind feet with his forefeet on Op 's lap while Op stroked his head with a big hand .  | " I 've been in forty-four states , " All told Theopolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't done me much good . " " Ye 've not been planted anyplace , " Op said . " Ye 're like our mistletoe and love vine . They do n't grow from the ground and they 're soft . I 'm rooted right here as much as any oak on Laurel Ridge . And a Laurel Ridge oak has to be deep-rooted in the ground to stand these winds ! " " I just wonder why you 've never left Looten County , " Alf asked him . " Alf , when I was a young man on Laurel Ridge , I ust to watch the spiders in the spring , " Op said . " When I ust to go out bright and early on a warm spring mornin ' a-huntin ' fer wild strawberries , I 'd come upon a whole city of spider webs in the woods . I 'd stop and look ' em over and hunt fer a web that had the initials of my name . It 's good luck to find one . There 's more good luck in findin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-leaf clover . Find yer initials in one on a spring mornin ' and then make a wish and a body 'll about get his wish . " " What did you wish for , Op ? " " Mostly to be left alone . ' Course if I was out a-huntin ' wild strawberries I made a wish to find a patch red as a September sourwood leaf with berries . I wished fer a patch where I could sit down in the middle and pick enough berries to fill my stummick within my arm 's reach . Yep , whenever I found a city of spiders where all the webs had different writin ' in ' cm , I 'd look till I found the letters T.A . " " Sounds wonderful . " Alf , leaning back against a pine tree , seemed to be relaxing for the first time . " Now let me tell ye the nearest I ever come to leavin ' Laurel Ridge , " Op said . " One mornin ' I was lookin ' fer my initials among the spider webs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a bee tree . I 'd found the bees a-waterin ' down on  | Little White Oak Branch but I could n't course ' em only a short distance fer the bushy tops of the white oaks . So I found a neighborhood of spider webs and in one I found T.A. , and I made my wish . But I saw somethin ' else there that started me to thinkin ' . I 'd offal wondered if spiders were in other parts of the world like on Laurel Ridge . Since the sun was as hot as a brush-pile flame it soon dried the dew . And a warm wind was risin ' and shakin ' the webs like white clothes on a line . Then I saw somethin ' I 'd never seen before . Young spiders a-throwin ' out ropes of silk and a-risin ' up on the warm winds and ridin ' away to other places beyond Laurel Ridge . " " When you talk about spiders I get the creeps , " Alf broke in , sitting up straight . " I 'm always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've read so much about the black widow spiders and . .. " " I 'm a-tryin ' to tell ye why I never left Laurel Ridge , " Op said sharply . He turned and looked curiously at Alf . Then he continued : " I thought if spiders left that way , I had a good pair of young strong legs and I could leave , too . If spiders wanted to go beyond Laurel Ridge to find a new world and build their cities and beget their kind , I might leave , too . " " Op , what is so important about a spider , anyway ? " Alf asked . " They catch flies and spin ugly webs . What else can these poisonous things do ? Why are we talking about them ? " " Spiders were put here fer a purpose , " Op said . " What would the mud daubers eat ? " " What 's a mud dauber ? Is it another poisonous pest put here to annoy people ? What 's it like ? " " Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find ' em in the smokehouse and ... " " Wait a minute , Op ! " Alf interrupted . " Are these mud daubers dangerous ? " 97  | " Shucks , they do n't sting , Alf . Yell find ' em under cliffs , in holler trees , houses , and about every place . They build a mud finger and the old she-dauber starts a-layin ' eggs in it . The old he-dauber starts ketchin ' spiders and a-puttin " em with the eggs . When they get enough spiders fer their young , they seal the end of the finger . When the eggs hatch , the young daubers have plenty of fresh spiders and they eat ' em and get so fat they bust the walls and fly away . " " But I 've never read about mud daubers , " Alf said . " I never knew they existed . " " Mud daubers and spiders make wonderful friends . They do n't worry people . Instead of talkin ' to a lot of folks I do n't know , I watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was something Alf could agree with . " At least they do n't have this know-how to invent ways of exterminating one another . The spiders spin their own ropes and fly on the wind . We spend millions for metal wings to carry our weapons of extermination ! What fools we are ! Tell me more about the spiders and ants , Op ! " " Well , there 's a fambly I call sour ants , " Op began . " They look a lot like these big sour gnats that 're allus a-tryin ' to get into a body 's eyes . These sour ants are the only ones the Master gave wings . When I was a boy , I rooted over an old dead sourwood to get some peckerwood eggs . I did n't know ants could fly till a swarm left this sourwood and got betwixt me and the sun . " Where did they go ? " Alf asked . " Flew till they lost their wings , " Op replied . " That 's the Master 's plan fer scatterin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a trembling voice : " Are there any maneating ants out here ? " " Ye do need yarb medicine , " Op said , staring at the stranger beside him . " Shucks , I never heard tell of ants that big ! "  | " But I have , " Alf said . " I 've read about ' em . " " Must be a lot of funny things in books , " Op sighed . " Good thing I ca n't read . " 23 " I want you to get an ear and an eye full of this night , honey , " Alf said to Julia as she and Lucretia came from the cabin . " This will be a little different from the honking of cars , the screaming of whistles , and the racket of a city all night long . In the morning I wo n't have the early paper thrown on my doorstep to read while I gulp coffee and eat a doughnut . I wo n't be disgusted with the new scare headlines and read where somebody 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somebody murdered . Somebody robbed . Not even a radio to get a fiveminute summary of the latest international atrocities . Not anything to scare the hell out of a man out here . Only the four of us on this whole ridge ! " " Only four flesh-and-blood people on Laurel Ridge , " Theopolis corrected Alf . " What do you mean , Op , by flesh-and-blood people ? " " Sperets , Alf . No one has ever left Laurel Ridge . A hundred years ago there was more than eighty shacks on the ridge . All the people that lived here then are dead and all that 's numbered with the blest are back here ! " " Let 's do n't get off on the spirits , Dad , " Lucretia said . " Cousin Alf and Julia wo n't believe in them . " " Ye 've larned to believe it , ai n't ye ? " Op retorted . " Ye ought to believe it when ye 're a-sparkin ' a speret ! " " What 's that ? " Alf asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with a speret , " Op told him . 99  | " What a joke , " Alf sputtered . " That 's not a joke either , " Theopolis warned . " Be keerful how ye laugh about the sperets . They 're allus a-listenin ' . They 're around us and over us every hour , night and day ! Bad luck might come to ye , Alf . If ye and Julia laugh , it 's an insult to the sperets . I had to warn Lutie about it . " " Who is the spirit , Lutie ? " Julia asked . She looked at Theopolis as if at any minute he might climb straight into the air , hand over hand . " Why do n't ye answer , Lutie ? " Op said . " Do n't be ashamed . He 's Ted Newsome . " " Who is this Ted Newsome ? " Alf asked . " He 's a good speret , " Op answered . Lucretia remained silent , looking off into space across the valley . " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick ' em . " " Have you seen him , Op ? " Alf asked . " I say I have , " Theopolis answered quickly , " but only at a distance . I never got close . I 've tried to . I 've told Lutie to get ' im to come to the house so I can talk to ' im ' bout old times . I remember Ted back when I was a saplin ' of a young man . Ted fit through the First World War , never got a scratch and come back here and was bushwhacked over Lucinda Dortch . Buried in the Freewill Baptist Churchyard , he is . " " Have you been seeing this Ted Newsome , Lutie ? " Julia asked , staring hard at Lucretia . " Yes , " she admitted . " And if he 's not a speret , why wo n't he let me see ' im ? " Op said . " Why does he come when I 'm not here ? The flowers on the table ye noticed tonight were picked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here named Hootbird Hammertight and he 's fallin ' in love with ' er , too . " " Tell us about Ted Newsome , Lutie . " Alf laughed . " And Hootbird Hammertight , too . What a name ! "  | " Hootbird lives down at Wince Leffard Gap , and Dad does n't care for the Hammertights , " she said . " He 's warned me about Hootbird and prefers that I go with Ted Newsome . " Lucretia turned away , frowning . It was obvious that she wanted a quick change of subject . " Where does Ted Newsome live ? " Alf persisted . " If the boys back in Dayton could only hear this one ! " Op cut in , annoyed . " He lives in his long home in the Freewill Baptist Graveyard . There 's a stone out there a-showin ' where he lives . And I would n't be a bit surprised if he ai n't close here a-listenin ' to us right now ! " " I once had an aunt who used to go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about moving tables and hands in the air and the voices of the dead . But I never believed a word she said . " " That 's dangerous talk , Alf , " Op warned . " Fox hunters on this ridge have seen the old ore diggers back here a-diggin ' ore . They 've seen tall wagons a-goin ' around this ridge loaded with charcoal and the drivers a-sittin ' on the little seats a-crackin ' their whips and yellin ' at their teams . Ye do n't know this country ! I 've heard General Morgan and his men pass this cabin many a night when they spurred their hosses and yelled as they rode by . I 've heard their hoofs beatin ' against the ground like thunder and I 've jumped up and run to the door ! " Jerry , who had been lying at Op 's feet , climbed up into his lap . The wind was rising , and mournful sounds were coming from the horsehairs on the cabin walls . " Onct when I 'd been out on a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin at about two in the mornin ' , " Op said . " That 's just been two years this comin ' November . The moon was down and the night was black as an old ground hearth where the colliers ust to burn the cordwood into charcoal . I 'd hold up my hand and could n't see it before me . But I made it to the Laurel Ridge road from down under before the oil in my lantern was 101  | used up . And I felt my way with my feet along the ridge road to this cabin . When I got here I heard all sorts of noises in the cabin . I pressed my face against a winderpane and I saw white dishes all around my table . I could see the forks a-goin ' up to their mouths and coming back to their plates . And I could hear their laughin ' and talkin ' same as I 've heard all of ye here tonight . But I could n't see a person around that table . They were men 's voices around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boardin ' - houses that ust to be on this ridge back in the ore-diggin ' days . I knowed it was the ore diggers back fer a meal together like they ust to eat a hundred years ago on this ridge . But why do they haf to eat my grub ? I thought . Why do they haf to use Beadie 's dishes ? So I went over and opened the door and rushed in . There was silence as I felt my way across the floor till I found a matchbox and lit the lamp . There was not a dish on the table . There was not a speret in the cabin . My grub had n't been teched . I always hated it that I broke up that party of men that had got together in my cabin ! " " Op , that 's your imagination , " Alf told him . " You must have dreamed it . I just ca n't believe that there are ghosts or that dead men return . " " Alf , ye 're a-talkin ' to the seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some night over in that smokehouse , I 'll haf to convince ye . Some sperets are seen . Some only knock . Atter the way ye talk , I doubt that a speret will show hisself to ye . But I 'll raise the knockin ' sperets fer ye . I 'll raise old Red Jacket , the king of the knockin ' sperets . When ye hear , I guess yell believe . " " I will when you convince me , Op , " Alf said , stretching sleepily . " Now if I could only get into a tub and take a good hot bath , this evening would be perfect . " " But ye ca n't do that here unless we put a fire back in. the stove and heat water in the teakettle and pour it into the washtub , "  | Op said . " We 'd haf to carry more water from the spring , too . " " Why did you bring that up , Alf ? " Julia asked . " Are you thinking of home ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Instead of can-yin ' the water up here , it 's better to carry yerself to the water down in Red Bird Holler , " Op told him . " That 's where I go . The water 's not exactly hot down there . It 's shaded by the green leaves and the ferns , and the sun never shines on it . But atter a body takes a bath in that water , he feels like a new man . Think ye 'd like fer me to take ye down there tonight ? " Alf shivered just thinking about it . " I 'll wait for my hot bath , thank you . I 'm ready to lie down for a night of good rest . " " Yep , ye 've got to get into the smokehouse tomorrow , " Op said . " What time have ye been gettin ' up ? " " About seven-thirty , " Julia said hopefully . " Ye 'll haf to be up by five in the mornin ' , " Op told them . " That 's our gettin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I 've never gone to bed , " Alf muttered as he followed Op across the garden . Op was swinging the lighted lantern as he stepped across the planted rows . The sky was full of stars and the wind cool . " I do n't know when I 've ever got out of bed this early before . " " It makes a body feel good to get up early , " Op said briskly . " I 've allus made it a practice to rise before the sun . I ust to rise at four . " Op pulled a little stick , which was fastened to the smokehouse 103  | with a string , from the staple . Then he pulled the hasp from over the staple and yanked on the door . It creaked on rusty hinges as it swung open . " That 's certainly a rustic door , " Alf said as he stepped into the smokehouse . In the yellow glow of lantern light , Alf looked about him at the little piles of roots lying in the cracks . Ile looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hickory bark . There were joints of stovepipe tied with hickory bark . Over in one corner were the tools , axes , frocs , handsaws , and mauls . In another corner squatted the body of a rusty stove . And across the far end of the smokehouse , opposite the door , was a threefourths-size iron bed with springs attached . " Say , that stove 's not got any legs , " Alf said , looking it over . " That wo n't matter , " Op told him . " We ca n't let it set on the floor , can we ? " " Nope , we ca n't let it set belly-buster , " he replied . " It might burn the smokehouse down . We can make it some legs ! " Alf was silent . Ile looked strangely at Theopolis . " Ai n't that a nice bed , Alf ? " Op bragged , turning to the bed . " It 's not too bad , " Alf said , shrugging his shoulders . " It 's a little narrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I would n't have two beds in the house if I 's young as ye , Alf . " Op spoke to him in a somber tone . " What 's the matter ? Do n't ye love yer wife ? " " C-certainly , " he stammered . Op 's words had taken him by surprise . " But a man can be in love with his wife and sleep in another bed . " " When Beadie and I kept house , we slept in a double bed , " Op said . " There were cracks in our shack back in them days . I was a little keerless and Beadie complained about the wind a-blowin ' in . But every time she complained about gettin ' cold , I 'd hug ' er close and put ' er feet with mine . Her head would  | use my arm fer a piller and her cheek would touch mine and we 'd get warm as young redbirds in a soft-lined nest in late May . Often I 'd dream of gatherin ' peaches on a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Beadie and me . A man should sleep with his wife , Alf . It 's good fer nervousness , too . This three-quarter bed will be the thing fer ye . Solve all yer problems . " " But we 'll want these cracks closed for the winter , " Alf told Theopolis . " This would be just a little too rough  --  on Julia , I mean . " Ye 'll be surprised what a woman can stand , " Op answered . " They 'll complain at first . But it will be the real test of love . If Julia loves ye she 'll stay with ye , cracks or no cracks . If she wo n't stay with ye , then she do n't love ye . Do n't be afraid to try this test of love . I tried it in my young days with Beadie . She loved me then . Poor Beadie , long dead and gone , but she thinks of me . She still loves me , Alf . Jist the other night she appeared to me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was back to see me , " Op said , his voice softening . " She looked into my face in the cabin . I saw her plain as I see ye now . It made my knees tremble when I got outten the bed . I thought it was a token of some kind , her a-comin ' back to see me . I thought somethin ' might be a-goin ' to happen to Lutie ! Thought somethin ' might 've happened to Jack ! " " I 've heard Aunt Corrinne and Uncle Will talk about your son Jack , " Alf said . " Ye never heard ' em say anything good about Jack . " Op 's voice got angry . " I 've stuck to that boy . I 've raised ' im . And I worry about ' im . " " Where 's Jack now ? " " Ye know as much about ' im as I do , " Op said sadly . " Jack 's been in as many states as ye have , Alf . He 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's like the spiders that the warm air lifts toward the sun on little silver ropes . He 's somewhere on a farm , I 'd think , a-drivin ' two big hosses . I 've been lookin ' fer ' im since butterflies have come back ! " " Butterflies ? " " He 's raised up with ' em , " Op replied . " Little feller ust to hunt with me in winter . And he got acquainted with wild animals . And when I 'd start to kill one , he 'd cry . I 'd haf to get away from Jack when I broke a possum 's neck with my ax handle over it and my two feet down on the ax handle and a-pullin ' on the possum 's tail . Jack always loved for the huntin ' season to be over and spring to come so he could chase the butterflies . He 's a big strong boy with the heart and mind of a child . He never had any young uns to play with ' im when he 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtles and even little harmless ground snakes . " " I never heard that about Jack , " Alf said . " Nope , ye heard he 's simple-minded from Corrinne and Will , " Op snapped . " Jack 'll be roundin ' in here one of these days soon , if he 's still alive , with his butterfly net . He never kills ' em , allus turns ' em back on the wind . " Op walked over to the corner of the smokehouse and picked up an ax . " We 've got to get ye into yer new home , Alf , " he said . " Now , as I whack the bark that 's holdin ' the stems to the rafters and let ' em fall , ye ketch ' em . " Op reached overhead with his ax and whacked the bark holding a bundle of stems . Alf stood under it with his hands far apart , and the stems bounced off his shoulder . Op went around the smokehouse , cutting them down . When he came to the stovepipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the doublebitted ax overhead with one hand and cut the hickory bark that  | held them . The pipes came tumbling down with a clatter , and Alf jumped for the door . Since daylight came to the ridgetop early , stars had now set for morn . Theopolis blew the light from his lantern and glanced at Alf . " Ye 're so skeery I 'm afeared ye might burn yerself up with a lamp . Ye can help take some of these things to my cabin now . I 'll give ye a light load so ye wo n't break down . " 25 Op and Alf carried the tools and bundles of stems from the smokehouse and put them under the cabin floor . Op laid his stems away carefully in the little dry pockets where the sills fit onto the sleepers . His short-handled tools he put here too , while the long-handled ones he left on the ground . He was even more careful with the roots he had gathered . He took them inside the cabin and put them in a dresser drawer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarbs , " he said . " Here 's enough medicine to cure all the ailin ' people in Honeywell . I 'm a-takin ' keer of these yarbs and a-gatherin ' more this summer . A body must have plenty of ' em when the deep snows fall on Laurel Ridge and the winds drift the snow . I 've seen drifts up to my ears in the little hollers . " Op was taking a half dozen meat rinds from the warmer above his stove when Lutie and Julia staggered in under a load of mops , brooms , pails , and dust rags . Each had a bandanna tied over her hair , and on Julia 's face there was a comical expression of unbelieving . " I 've never done much mopping , " she said . " I have it done in Dayton. " 107  | " Ye 'll do it yerself here , if it 's to be done at all , " Op said . " It wo n't hurt ye to use a little elbow grease . " The four of them walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss each little pebble and clod and frowned in disgust . " So this is my new home ! " Julia stood in amazement , peering into the smokehouse . She was trying to sound happy and excited but not quite making the grade . " This is it all right , " Alf told her heartily . After staring in disbelief for another moment , Julia grabbed a broom and began sweeping the cabin floor feverishly . " From the looks of these cracks , our new home might be a little airish , even on warm nights . " She laughed shakily . " Sleep close together 's what I told Alf , " Op retorted . Julia stopped sweeping . She looked strangely at Theopolis . " Even the stove 's not got legs , " she said , changing the subject . " We 'll fix that , " Op said . " We 'll make it some legs . " Then Op started applying one of the meat rinds to the stove . " A meat rind is a wonderful thing , " he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ketch ' im a mess of fish fer meat rinds enough to last me the season . Old Fidis ai n't much of a fisherman and he loves fish . So I trade ' im fish fer meat rinds . I grease my bread pan with a meat rind . I grease my rifle barrel to keep it from rustin ' . I use ' em on my stove in the cabin to make it purty and shiny . I use ' em to grease my boots so the water wo n't soak into the leather when I walk in the November rains and the deep snows in winter . There 's not anythin ' more valuable to me on this ridge than the meat rind . I even use ' em fer animal bait and fish bait . You 'll haf to get ust to a meat rind , Julia , if ye stay here . " Julia looked at the greasy rind in Op 's hand and changed the subject again . " Where did you buy this bed , Op ? " " Did n't buy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? "  | " Yes , it 's  --  it 's very good looking . " " Ye did n't come past the junk pile yesterday where Honeywell hauls its garbage , did ye ? About a half mile this side the town beside the road and just above Sandy River ? I come along there one day and found this bed , so I toted it up here to use in the smokehouse . Thought if ever my cabin burnt down I 'd have myself another bed . " When Op finished greasing the small flat-topped stove , it looked like new . Then he used the meat rinds on the stovepipes to remove a few dots of rust . And while Lucretia wiped dust from the bed and Julia swept the floor , Op and Alf went outside the smokehouse and found four flat stones . Op placed the stones on the floor and he and Alf lifted the small stove upon them . " Dad , where 'll you put the stovepipe ? " Lucretia asked . " There 's not a flue in this smokehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Op put his toes in the cracks between the logs and climbed carefully up to the top of the window . Holding on with one hand , he took his knife from his pocket , removed putty and tacks that held the pane in the sash . He lifted the pane from the sash and handed it down . Then he arranged the stovepipe , while Alf watched helplessly . He used the elbow and directed the pipe through the open hole where he had removed the pane . " That 's got it , " he said . " Just as good as a flue . " " But how 'll I raise the window ? " Alf asked . " Ye can raise the bottom sash up to the pipe , ca n't ye ? " Op said . " If ye ca n't , have Julia to raise it fer ye . If she ca n't , call on me . " " We wo n't need to raise the window , honey , " Julia smiled . " We 'll get plenty of fresh air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mopped one corner of the smokehouse , Op and Alf heaved on the iron bed to set it in the corner . 109  | " I do n't see how you ever packed it from Honeywell , " Alf grunted as he strained to lift one end . " This ai n't heavy , " Op said . " When ye pack as much as I have , yell get ust to it . That 's the only way ye can get anythin ' up here . Remember that . Ye got ta be a good pack boss , Alf ! " They worked until noon getting the cabin ready . Op had a spare bedtick filled with bright oak leaves he 'd gathered in sunny October . " I do n't think I raked up any snakes in these leaves , " he said . " I 'll loan ye this bed to sleep on , leaves and all . " Then Op fetched Alf a large water bucket . Alf and Julia had brought a change of sheets and blankets , and such as drinking cups , towels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they unpacked , Theopolis 's face grew longer and longer . They were really a-movin ' in . " Here , All , " Op sighed finally , " if ye 're bent on a-stayin ' , I want to loan ye this most useful tool on Laurel Ridge . " He reached for a double-bitted ax . " It 's the dullest one I got . Wo n't cut hot butter . There wo n't be any danger of ye a-knickin ' yerself. " 26 After lunch , Op and Alf , with axes across their shoulders , went out Laurel Ridge toward the sty . After they had walked a few hundred yards on the level ridge road , Op turned right into the deep green wood . " Follow me , Alf , " he said . Op waded up to his knees into the deep pea vine that covered the dark loamy earth like a green plush carpet . Alf sniffled the fragrant smell of the pea vine as he followed Op 's broken path deeper down the slope .  | " What kind of ground is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Op said . " Is this green stuff any good for anything ? " " Wonderful pickin ' fer cattle . " " It 's a shame to waste land like this , " Alf said . " This ought to be cultivated . I 'd sure love to own about two hundred acres . " " What would ye do with it ? " Op asked curiously as he looked this way and that for a small dead tree . " Ye could n't do anythin ' with it , could ye ? " " I 'd cut the trees , make meadows , grow corn and tobacco , " he said . " Then ye 'd ruin it . " Op was disgusted . " The loam on these slopes would all wash down into the valleys and soon the hills would turn yellow and be gully-streaked . " " But it does n't produce like it is ? " " It does produce , " Theopolis answered quickly . " Look at these trees . Look at these yarbs . Ginseng under my feet . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but it does n't produce anything that will make you money . " " It does if ye know the right roots to dig and where to find the nuts and the berries , " Theopolis replied . " It produces all a body needs ! " " But would n't tobacco be more profitable ? " Alf persisted . " Say you raised an acre of tobacco . Would n't that make you money ? " In his mind , the green acres had become a long string of digits for adding and depositing in a bankbook . " Calmus weed is better'n terbacker , " Op told him . " Ye want to ruin this land , Alf ? " Theopolis stopped in the green carpet of pea vine which was up to his thighs . Above the pea vine stood the tall yellow poplars , their first limbs twenty feet up and the wind rustling their soft soap-bellied leaves . " Did ye say ye 'd Ill  | clear this land and farm it if ye had it ? What would ye do with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for timber ! " " I hope ye never buy any land near me , " Op told him . " I hope Snake Blue keeps it as long as he lives and his son takes over and keeps it like old Snake has . Ye hunt a safe place in the world and first thing ye have in mind idears that would destroy it . " " But if you 'd clear some land , you could raise cattle and hogs and be self-sufficient here when the rest of this country is destroyed by the bomb . " Alf was getting excited by his vision . " I 'd dam one of these little streams and have a small electric plant built so I could have refrigeration and lights and heat and everything . " " If ye know where to find the old pine stumps and dig ' em up and split ' em into kindlin ' with an ax , yell have plenty of light , " Op said . " Pine torches make wonderful lights and they 're cheap . All a body has to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks close and finds a pine log rich with resin , then he has somethin ' . That 's the kind of kindlin ' I store fer winter . Ye ca n't beat rich pine . " He looked around at the rich green carpet covering the land . " And , Alf , ye do n't haf to raise corn and have cattle here . There 's enough wild game to furnish a body meat . Enough nuts on these trees to take the place of corn . The kernels from the black walnut and butternut are sweeter'n the kernels from corn ! Why work and dig and tear up somethin ' God Almighty has made , when there 's no use to it ? This wo n't be my land any more when it 's torn up and destroyed . " " But it 's not your land now , " Alf reminded him . " You told me it belonged to Snake Blue . " " He 's got the deed on paper , " Op said . " I 've got the deed fer it in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Op turned disgustedly and started breaking a path through the pea vine .  | " But I 'm thinking farther ahead , " Alf said as he followed . " I know we 're in for trouble in the future . Each family ought to establish itself on a little spot where it can be self-sufficient . That 's more important than pea vine and tall trees when the atomic bombs rain down and destroy this earth with fire . " " I do n't believe all that , Alf . " Op shook his head and his long uncut hair waved in the breeze . " This earth wo n't be destroyed . Not by any kind o ' bumbs . They might burn the cities and scorch the earth , but there 'll be people left to start it all over agin . I do n't think ye ought to worry like ye do about the adam bumbs . Shucks , I ai n't a-worryin ' about ' em . I never heard ' em mentioned before ye come out here ! " He turned suddenly and bumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got somethin ' to worry ' em . " " What could possibly worry them more than atomic bombs ? " " All the bottoms are a-fallin ' outten their wells , " Op said . " Not a well in that town with a bottom in it . That town might sink . Shucks , I never did trust a valley ! " " What ? " Alf peered at Theopolis . Perhaps the old man was kidding him like the boys back at the plant used to do . " Do you mean that ? ? " " Are ye right with Him on High , Alf ? " Op interrupted . " Why , I think I am , " Alf stammered . " Then it 's safe ye to go to Honeywell , " Op said , looking up at the trees . " If a body is right , he do n't think . He knows it . He 'd better be numbered with the blest if he wants to live ferever and soar back over Laurel Ridge . There 's a lot of people I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . A lot of people I want to float over like a big chicken hawk , pumpin ' my wings jist a little and kickin ' the bright air with my feet like I 'm a-swimmin ' up there above ' em . Yep , I want to skeer the mortal hell outten a few people . Old Doshie 's one . I 'll make ' er think ' er little short legs are a-ailin ' ' er . When 113  | I get through floatin ' above ' er , a-fannin ' the wind and kickin ' the air , she 'll take off faster'n she 's ever run in ' er life . I 'll dive at ' er all the way from Honeywell to Wince Leffard Gap . Make ' er even drap some of that good grub she 's begged in Honeywell . I 'll have old Hootbird a-runnin ' , too . I 'll be better to Ben . I always liked old slow Ben ! " " Are you sure , Op , the bottoms have dropped out of the wells in Honeywell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going back there for the rest of our supplies we sent by parcel post . " " Do n't let it worry ye , Alf , " Op said . " But I do n't know of a well in the town with a bottom in it . All of ' em are tiled right down in the sand . They never could wall one up with rocks like I walled my spring so the good freestone water could ooze in from the old dirt . And a long time ago when Pap was a boy , there was a break clear out to Lonesome Hill  --  that 's the Honeywell Graveyard . It went out from Big River in the shape of an oxbow and then went back to Big River . All of Honeywell was inside that break . It was so deep ye could n't see the bottom . I 've heard people could walk up and look down and sniff the brimstone . " " Did the people move ? " " How could they ? " Op asked . " They 'd a-had to 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . They stuck to that island and prayed . The strong men trembled and the wimmen with pride lowered their faces till the rain stopped fallin ' into their nostrils . " " Then what happened ? " Alf asked shakily . " I did n't see a break or any sign of one when Julia and I walked out here . " " That break closed up in a single night , " Op said . " And fer a long time after that , the merchants in that town started treatin ' the country people right , they were that skeered . Yessir , the Old Master takes keer of his own . That town is jist a-sittin ' there  | on a ledge of ground with all the underpinnin ' gone . The Master can spring the trap any time . He 's warned ' em by lettin ' the bottoms fall from their wells . It 's a token . " Alf followed slowly in silence as Op crossed a deep ravine and climbed a steep bluff on the other side . " I see good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead dogwoods . " Theopolis walked up to one and laid his hand on the naked , dry , seasoned body where the dead bark had fallen . " Why have these dogwoods died ? " Alf was glad for a new topic of conversation . " It 's Nature 's way , " Theopolis explained . " Diseases kill people and thin ' em out . Big trees grow up and smother the little uns . Trees thin themselves out . But nothin ' can squeeze out the tough-butted white oaks . These tall poplars squeezed out the little dogwoods . All of ' em are dead around here . But they make wonderful stovewood . I 'll let ye cut this tree , Alf . I want to see how well ye can use an ax . " " First , I 'll get myself squared away , " Alf explained . He backed away from the little tree like a crayfish backs in water . " Then , I 'll let the tree have the works ! " Alf planted his feet firmly on the bluff as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant poplars , and then sighted down the ax as if he were looking down a rifle barrel and lining up sights . Then his thin body bent backward and he came down with a stiff-armed swing . The axhead struck the wind beyond the tree , the ax handle hit the tree and broke . The ax mowed a path through the pea vine and then sank into the soft loam . " I missed the tree , " Alfred said , surprised . " What do you think of that ? " " Not much . " Op groveled down in the soft loam for his double-bitted ax . " That 's the reason I gave ye a dull ax . I was 115  | afraid ye might hurt yerself . " Then Op turned to Alf who was holding the broken ax handle . " Alf , I heard ye say ye made eight thousand dollars a year in Dayton . " " I certainly did , " he answered quickly . " Why ? " " I 'm a-thinkin ' of that big money , " Op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer own and let ye scratch fer a livin ' , I believe ye 'd starve to death . " He came up with the axhead . " I 'll chop down these dead dogwoods . Ye watch me . And this afternoon , I 'll put a handle in yer ax and I 'll larn ye how to chop wood on a block . Ye 're a-livin ' in my smokehouse , but I ai n't a-goin ' to chop yer stovewood . Yell haf to lam to work ? ' r starve . " 27 The sun was still high above the Allcorn Hills . Laurel Ridge was a place , the fox hunters had often said , where the sun never set . But the day was done for Alf and Op . Op had shown Alf all afternoon how to stand near his chopblock and swing his ax . And when Alf had tired of swinging the ax , Op had chopped a few sticks of wood for his stove . Lucretia had helped Julia with the final cleaning up in the smokehouse , knowing how Op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence made Lucretia wonder about his attitude toward her . Would he prefer to be left alone again , now that he could see ? Julia , working hard with her hands for the first time in years , wondered about Ted Newsome , the " good speret . " She and Lutie had returned from the cabin after lunch to find another bouquet of fresh wild flowers on the little table they had borrowed from Op . It had been a very long day for all of them and a very strange day for Alf and Julia . Back at the cabin , Alf complained  | of being sticky and that he had to have a bath . Op led the way to the water . " One of the things I miss here is my good hot bath , " Alf said as he carried soap and a cloth in his hand and a towel across his shoulder . " I like a bathtub filled to the top with soapy water so hot it nearly burns me . I like to sit in it and soak myself and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole of water down here , too . " Op pointed down the path toward the spring . " More water down here than ye can get in a tub . I can take ye to holes under the tall poplars where the water 's thigh deep , navel deep , or neck deep . Give ye yer choice . ' Course it 's cool water , good cool water that fills up a bathtub made of dirt and ringed with ferns . Think if ye take a few baths down here , yell never want another manmade tub . " " I do n't know about this cool water , " Alf grumbled . " Now back home ? " 01 ) interrupted him , looking down at Alf 's shoes . " After this ye 'd better have on boots like I got instead of them low-cuts . I 've got a lot of snake teeth in these boots ! " " What kind of snake teeth ? " " Oh , copperhead , rattlesnake , water moccasin , " Op answered . " A lot of copperhead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give warnin ' and I go some other way . I do n't keer too much about goin ' the same way with a rattlesnake . " " Did a snake ever bite you , Op ? " Alf walked closer on Theopolis 's heels . " First time a snake ever bit me I was six-years old , " Op said . " That was back in the days when I ust to spend my Sundays a-wadin ' up and down the Little ' White Oak creek , carryin ' a club about the size of a mattock handle , a-killin ' water moc-117  | casins fer fun . I 'd slip up on one and let ' im have it across the head . If he saw me first and fell offen a rock or overhangin ' limb into a hole of water , I 'd muddy the water . A water moccasin ca n't stand muddy water very long . After I muddied the water , I 'd wade into a hole and stand with my club over my shoulder ready to strike . When the moccasin stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a goner . I 'd let ' im have it right on the bean and I can jist see that stuff spread over the water like the juice from a milkweed stem . It was a lot of fun . I was n't old enough then to tote a pistol on Sundays and shoot at lizards a-runnin ' up the scaly-barked oaks . That was the sport of the older fellers like Ted Newsome . I was n't twelve yet . So I had to play along the creek and find my own way of havin ' fun . " Op walked past the spring in Red Bird Hollow . The path narrowed beyond the spring and the long wild-blackberry and raspberry vines lapped over . They would soon cover what had once been a path . Op parted the wild-berry vines so Alf could follow . " The first un that bit me , " Op continued , " was a big , old , rusty-colored water moccasin , fat on creek minners , ' r heavy with young . It was a-sunnin ' on the bank , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the snake did n't get outten my way . It quiled , ready to strike . I stepped back and I said , Ye would n't fight me . ' Then I stuck my big toe up to the snake and when it was ready to strike , I was too quick for it . I 'd jerk my toe back . So we played a little game fer a half hour or so . I 'd stick my toe up and it would wiggle its big rusty-colored body back and get ready to swaller my toe and I 'd disappint it . When I got my toe back , I 'd do a powerful lot of laughin ' . You know a water moccasin is the illest of all snakes . It 's a lot of fun to tease one . So I kept on and if I had n't a-got so tickled it would n't have bit me . I got to laughin ' till I could hardly stand up and I did n't get my toe back in time . So it swallered my big toe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . It stung like fire . I did n't even know whether one was pizen ' r not . I run all the way home and told Pa . Dadwrought it , Little Op , ' he said , ' ye 'll go out in the world a weaklin ' . Ca n't ye take a water-moccasin bite ? Ai n't any more than a bumblebee sting . ' Pap made me ashamed of myself and it quit hurtin ' . " " But I thought water moccasins were deadly poisonous . " Alf 's voice had a little shake in it . He was walking so close to Op he was almost climbing his back . " Nope , not the long , lazy kind we have around here , anyways . They just sting ye a little . Now with a copperhead , it 's different . " " Did you ever have a copperhead bite you ? " " I shore did , Alf . " They had reached a quiet pool of blue water . It was under the tall poplars and shaded by a fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , feathery eyelashes around a big blue eye . Theopolis stopped beside the pool . " We 're at the bathtub , Alf , " he said . " There are other holes on down the creek but this is the best one . It 's about navel deep on ye . " Op started unbuttoning his shirt . Then he threw his hat on the pea vines . " About that copperhead that bit me , " he talked on . " One evenin ' late we young uns were a-sittin ' in the front yard with Pap and Ma . We 'd hoed a little corn that day and in the evenin ' we were a-sittin ' there takin ' it easy a-lookin ' up at the sky every now and then . We always looked fer signs in the skies . And once when I looked up , I saw a star leave the sky . It was a gollywhopper in size . I thought it was a-comin ' smack down on us . There was a big gold streak right down through the blue evenin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ma saw it jist in time . It lit on the bluff in a locust patch across the creek from our shack . And when it hit , I started runnin ' toward the very place 119  | a-keepin ' my eye on the spot . I stuck up a stick on the very spot where it fell . When my brothers started claimin ' part of what I was goin ' to find , Pap said : Boys , I allus teached ye decency and order . And the finder here will be the keeper . The finder is Little Op . ' " So I went to bed that night dreamin ' of the pot of gold I 'd find where that star fell . " Theopolis sat on the ground to unlace his brier-scratched boots . " I knowed the fallin ' of that star was a token . It would n't ' ve come down there without a purpose . Gold in the ground not a-doin ' anybody any good and we 'd as well have it . I even dreamed about the money . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-gallon size , the kind Ma ust to cook green beans in with a big hunk of jowl pork . I dreamed I 's right down to that pot , and it took Pap and Brother Beany to help me lift it from the ground . And when we raised the lid and saw the shinin ' gold , that was too much fer me and I woke up and did n't get my hands on it . Thinks I , I 'll have my hands on ye in the mornin ' . ' " I 's up bright and early , four in the mornin ' , when Pap got up first to fire the cookstove . " Op talked on , undressing all the while . " And jist atter breakfast when the first light streaks popped over Cornponc Hill , I had my mattock across my shoulder and I took off up the hill past the well to the locust thicket . I found my stick and I started diggin ' . I did n't see a movement of any kind around the place . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hit from behind . I wheeled around , and somethin ' long and almost the color of the gold I was a-diggin ' to find swung around like a tail on a dumb brute . Soon as I got a glimpse , I let out a scream and Pap was on his way from the yard . He started runnin ' toward me , but I 'd pulled my pocketknife and reached around and got it right by the neck and choked him to pry his mouth open . He was a-tryin ' to let loose because that 's the way a copperhead bites . Lets loose and  | lets ye have it agin and agin . I choked ' im good so he would n't leave a fang in my rind , and he let loose . I put the knife to his neck first thing I did . I knowed he 'd never bite anybody else . By that time Pap was to me . And it 's a rule around here when a body 's bit by a copperhead , first person to ' im bast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spit it out . Pap was a-shavin ' when he heard me first let out a scream and he fetched a long black-handled razor . Pull yer pants , Little Op , ' he said to me . And that 's what I done in a hurry . Pap laid a cross on my rind . What a copperhead , Little Op ! ' he said to me . ' It might be the last of ye . Biggest un I 've ever seen yet . And powerful it must 've been to strike uphill and jump that high to get ye . ' Pap worked on all the pizen he could . " Op had removed his long white drawers and stood naked on the brink of the pool . Is Op a varmint or a man ? Alf wondered . He had taken a fleeting glance at Theopolis to see if he bathed often . But he could n't see Op 's skin . He was wooly from his neck to his toes except for the tops of his feet . His back was covered and his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was visible , for the long hair parted in different directions like a part on a man 's head . A picture of Op ought to be on every bottle of he-man skin bracer , Alf thought . How could a snake bite him ? Op leaped into the water with a washcloth and a bar of soap in his hand . He kept right on telling Alf about his copperhead bite . " Now there 're remedies we ust to have fer a copperhead bite , " he said as he began laying down the wool on his body with water and soap . " I said to Pap : Do n't give me the black-powder cure ! I do n't want it , Pap . ' If Pap had a-given me the blackpowder cure , I 'd a-had to 've turned my naked starn end to ' im and let ' im a-shot me seven times with cartridges without bullets . I 'd seen Pap do it once to old Ike Strickland when he 's 121  | bitten on the foot by a copperhead . Every time Pap burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild scream and kick like a mule until Pap would haf to place his foot back just right on the ground and let ' im have it agin . I did n't want to be burnt no seven times and Pap a-standin ' right up close with his thirty-eight special . So said I , Tap , I want the black-cat cure . ' " Alf stood naked in the slow-moving wind with his teeth chattering . He looked at the pool and Op looked up at him with his good eye . There he stood , a lean , hairless man , his skin pink and his bones protruding against the skin like the ribs of a willow basket . Op stopped talking and watched while Alf took hold of his nose with his thumb and index finger on one hand and with the other held his cloth and bar of soap . He closed his eyes , shuddered all over , and made a wild leap into the pool , hitting it belly buster and splashing water in all directions . He let out a scream . Wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Alf finally got his feet on the bottom and straightened himself up . " That 's the only way I could do it , Op , " he said , his teeth rattling like pebbles washing over rock cliffs in a spring rain . " Go on with your story . " " Shoot the cat , ' Pap yelled to Brother Beany , " Op said . " Do it in a hurry ! ' And not much sooner said than done , I heard the shotgun go off . Shoot that old black minarky rooster too , ' Pap screamed , as the old black tomcat lay on the yard a-kickin ' . K-boom , ' I heard another shot down by the stable . Now fetch ' em to me in a hurry , ' Pap said . Fetch ' em while they 're still a-kickin ' . ' Alf said shakily , " I 'd rather die of the bite , I think . " " I walked like a stringy haltered hoss down the bluff from the locust thicket , " Op said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he give it to Brother Adger . Start diggin ' , ' he told ' im . Right out there in the garden where the ground is soft .  | Dig in a hurry . ' Brother Adger knowed exactly what to do . He knowed how deep to dig , fer he 'd done it before . Take off yer pants agin , ' Pap said to me . We 've got to work fast , boy . ' Ma come with a sheet and Pap split that old black tomcat right down the stummick and slapped his warm entrails and blood right on the bite . While Ma , who was a-sheddin ' tears , held the tomcat on , Pap split the rooster and laid it on over that cat . He tied the chicken and cat around me with strings . Then they put the white sheet around the whole thing . But the sheet was n't white very long . It soon turned red . That 'll fetch the pizen if anythin ' will , ' Pap said . Come sit down in this hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , but he went right on . " Brother Beany had dug a hole big enough in the soft garden dirt to bury me in . I got down in that hole and Brother Beany started shovelin ' the dirt around me till I was buried well above my navel . And all that day , old friends , a-hearin ' about the token I 'd seen that baited me on fer gold and the kind of gold I 'd discovered , come to see me . I guess that 's one of the reasons I never had a hankerin ' fer gold in my lifetime . That teached me a lesson . When I think of the people who come to see me ! They looked so tall a-standin ' up there a-lookin ' down , I felt awful small . I had to haf my dinner carried to me in the garden . I felt like half a man . " " Did n't it make you sick ? " Alf splashed in the cold water , trying to keep his circulation going . " When the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shined down on me half buried alive there , my head dropped over to one side and then the other like a sunflower head wilted in the sun . My neck would hardly hold my head up . But atter twelve hours I 's all right . Never got real sick . That black-powder cure would have burnt me till I could n't have sat clown fer a month . Black powder is shore a rough cure , Alf . I 've seen both 123  | of ' em used many a time among the old people . Both good remedies but I 'd rather have the copperhead bite than the blackpowder cure . I 'd take the black-cat cure every time . " " Are there many copperheads around here ? " " Woods are full of ' em . " Op lifted a leg from the water and soaped it down to his foot . " One night I 's out to Six Hickories a-possum huntin ' with old Jerry and I carried a blanket with me and laid down on it at about three in the mornin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about who all was up in that land beyond the blue and I begin to feel somethin ' wiggle under me . I could n't see too well then . That was when I was losing my sight . But I jumped up when Jerry got back from a long hunt . I raised the blanket and old Jerry grabbed somethin ' and begin to shake it apart . One of the biggest copperheads ever kilt on Laurel Ridge . Longer than a fence post and big around as my forearm . He was an old residenter that had crawled from the Artner rocks down under . Jerry spiled his a-tryin ' to get me . " Alf pulled himself up by the ferns until he could hold onto a poplar root . Then he clawed his way to the top of the bank . He turned his back to Op and rubbed his body with a towel to an early-turning sassafras-leaf pinkness . Op played in the cool water , enjoying every minute like a native speckled-bellied water dog . When he was ready to come out of his earthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the strength of his one arm leaped up like a fish out of water onto the bank in a squatting position . Then he rose and shook himself like a wet , heavy-feathered rooster . " You 'll feel like a new man now , Alf . Cold water will soothe yer nerves and make ye want to sleep . Hot water will keep ye awake all night . I never tried hot water but once in my life . That done me . " " I never had a bath like this one , " Alf said . " I 'll remember it as long as I live . "  | Op was back in his clothes already and lacing his second boot . " You 've got me scared to death of copperheads . " Alf was jittery again . " I 'll be afraid to walk back up this path . " " Ye walk in front , " Op said , rising up . " I 'll walk behind . " " What ! You send me in front and you wear your boots ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front stirs the snake and gets ' im ready to bite , " Op explained . " Ye walk in front and if there 's a copperhead , he 'll get ready and when he strikes , he 'll hit one of my boots . I 'll be over ' im about the time he 's quiled and ready ! " " That s-sounds logical , Op . " " A lot of people do n't know about snakes . Like birds . I 've kilt many a black snake when he was a-charmin ' a bird so he could climb up and swaller it . Bird jist sat there bound by the charm and could n't flutter a wing . " Walking up Red Bird Hollow , Alf was in front and Theopolis followed . Alf pulled back the wild-berry vines and hurried along . " At least the bomb would finish one instantly . But to be bitten by a snake might mean a slow , painful death . " " I do n't want to be burnt up , " Op chuckled . " I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , once when I was a-walkin ' from Honeywell , jist along about where the dump pile is beside the Sandy , Sallie Artner come along there a-drivin ' one of old Fidis 's gray bosses hitched to the buggy . I looked up and I could tell somethin ' was the matter with ' er . She was as white as a milkweed furze . When she did n't speak to me , as friendly a gal as she was , I knowed somethin ' was the matter . I ran over and held the hoss , put my foot on the buggy stirrup , and went up into that buggy jist in time . Sallie was about to breathe her last . A big cow snake had planted itself in the buggy when it was in the barn entry . A snake 's got a lot of sense . It planted itself there to get Sallie . It had crawled up under ' er dress ' n ' 125  | wrapped itself around three ' r four times ' n ' was a-squeezin " er to death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the snake , cut it in two in nine places to get it off . Figured she 'd rather be embarrassed than dead . Saved ' er life . She 'd tell ye if she 's here now , but she lives in Baltimore . " Alf let out a long sigh when he reached the broad worn path at the spring . He increased his pace as he climbed the hill with Op still behind him . " But the bigger a snake the more harmless he is . " Op talked on as Alf continued climbing , getting his breath like a tired horse . " Right betwixt the spring and where we took a bath , I once laid down across a log to drink from a purty little spring where the water biled up from the ground . I was jist beginnin ' to drink when the log started movin ' . I guess that was the biggest snake ever seen in these parts . He made a path up the hill through the pea vine , like where a boss had pulled a small log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get too close afeared he 'd turn and swaller me whole . He went down among the Artner rocks and went back in his den , a big cliff over there . That 's one reason I thought it might be better fer ye and Julia to live in my smokehouse instead of on Artner cliff . I 've never heard of anybody ever a-killin ' that big snake . Boy , there 're some gollywhoppin ' snakes on Laurel Ridge ! " Alf reached the cabin out of breath . Op walked up beside him and stood listening to Alf breathe . " Anythin ' else I can do fer ye tonight , Alf ? " Op asked . " Yes , Op , just wait here and see that I get to the smokehouse safely . " He started across the garden path in a wobbly trot .  | 28 " Yep , now 's the time , Alf , " Op said proudly . " The turtle season is on . I 'm hungry fer turtle meat ! " The two men were barefooted and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tender and he looked down at the path and chose the smooth places to step . He walked as if he were stepping on eggs . " Ouch , I stepped on a rock , " he fretted , holding up his white , tender foot . " Put yer feet down and get ust to it , " Op growled . " Grit yer teeth together and tell yerself it do n't hurt to step on a little rock barefooted . " " But I 'd be lying to myself . It does hurt . " " The water will be soft , " Op said , " when we get into the creek . There will be soft mud on the bottom and it will be like a-walkin ' on cool winter moss . " Theopolis carried his hunting knife in a sheath on his hip . That was all he took with him for hunting turtles . When the two men walked from the well-worn path that led to the spring onto the narrow path down to the hole where they bathed , Op stopped beside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached high above his head and peeled down a strip of hickory bark to the ground . Then he peeled another strip down the same width and length and then a third and fourth . " What are you peeling that tree for , Op ? " " Look on now and lam later . " The man was always askin ' questions . He never jist watched and lamed for himself . Op used his knife and peeled away the coarse bark , exposing the long thongs of inner hickory bark which was both durable 127  | and pliable . He wound these around his elbow and between his thumb and forefinger into a little bundle . " That 's neat work , " Alf told him . " I ought to be able to do it neatly , " he said . " I 've peeled enough hickory bark in my day to bottom chairs and use fer ropes . I 've tried about everythin ' . But a body ca n't get anythin ' to tie with he can trust like hickory bark . " Then Op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I jump in . Carry the bark . " He jumped into the deep hole where the water came up to his navel . Alf fidgeted nervously along the edge of the bank while Op waded around in the pool and fingered under the bank with his bare hands . Where the water had splashed against the dirt walls it had left overhanging turf matted with the roots of ferns and wild snowballs . Op circled the pool , putting his hand back into every crevice . " You mean you catch turtles with your hands ? " Alf said . " And there 's a possibility of finding one where we 've been bathing ? " " Yep , " Op replied as he fingered under the turf . " We might find one here . " " Wo n't a turtle bite ? " " Yep , they 'll bite all right . " " Ever have one bite you ? " " Nope , never have . " He fingered another spot . " Never want one to bite me either . A turtle is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't let loose till it thunders . If it do n't thunder , he 'll let go when the sun does down . " " Are n't you afraid one will grab you by the hand ? " " Nope , " Op grunted . " When I want turtle meat I go ketch me a mess of turtles . A body bast to eat . And up here if a body do n't go atter his grub , he wo n't eat . That 's the way it 's allus  | been with me . It 's a lot of fun to ketch turtles but I do n't do it exactly fer fun . I do it to eat . " Op jumped up from the hole and onto the bank , the cold blue water streaming from his clothes . " No turtle in there . " " I should hope not , " Alf sounded relieved . " Not after jumping in there naked and taking a bath . " " Now a turtle wo n't come out jist to bite ye , Alf , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to a turtle ! Do n't be so skeery . " Below the bathing hole , the stream was shallow . It trickled over the rocks leaving little clear pools , fringed by the ferns here and there , and then it flowed away again , tumbling and splashing over the rocks . Op waded into each still pool and fingered around the brink into each little crevice , between the rocks and under the ferns . " Are n't you afraid you 'll put your hand in on a water moccasin ? " Alf asked him . " Not at all , " he replied . " Water moccasins stretch out on rocks and dead logs in spots of sun this time of day and year . When one hides in a hole , he goes back into one too small fer a turtle . Turtles and water moccasins wo n't have anythin ' to do with each other . What could a water moccasin get outta bitin ' a turtle 's hard shell ? But I think if a turtle was a-mind to , he could clamp down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and cut it smack in two . See , Alf , wild things in nature get along better'n most human folks . They know their enemies and keep outten their way . And they know their friends a lot better'n we do . The turtle ca n't eat the water moccasin and the water moccasin ca n't eat the turtle . So they 're not atter one another and they make purty good neighbors . Now the water moccasins do swaller the little minners  --  I-gollies , there 's one now ! " 129  | Alf looked up in time to see what appeared to be a thick piece of rope drop from a sunlit poplar branch into the water below . " I 'd never put my big toe up to a thing like that , " Alf said , remembering Op 's story . He looked down at his own white toes apprehensively . " We 'll get ' im . " Op found a club a little longer than a baseball bat and not as large around . He stirred the sand in the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get him , " Alf said , backing away . " Be real quiet , " Op whispered . " He 'll stick his head up from the muddy water and I 'll let ' im have this club right over the bean ! " Op and Alf stood quietly above the muddied water . When there were some little bubbles , Op trained his eye on the spot . The thick , hard , iron-rimmed mouth rose first and then the lidless eyes came above the surface just as Op came down with his club . There was splashing and writhing and a cream-colored substance spread over the surface of the muddy water . Op lifted the dying snake from the pool with his club . He tossed it writhing upon the bank and finished killing it with a few more strokes of his club . " See , it did n't try to bite us , " Op said . " It tried to hide . But I kill every kind of a snake . I ca n't say I like a-one . I 've never lamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to thin out the minners . " Then they started down the stream . " I 'm not surprised we did n't get a turtle in Red Bird Crick , " Op said . " When we git down here where it empties into Little White Oak , then we 're a-gettin ' into the turtle country . Turtles love sand and more sunshine than a body will find up here under these tall poplars ! " Op fingered around in the pools where the two streams joined .  | " I found one , " he said . " The shell feels like a rock , only it 's smoother . Come outten there ! " The undercurrent of water had washed away the land and left a little room where it was dark and cool . Op pulled the turtle from his resting place . " Ye 're too small , ye little devil , " he said , holding it up for Alf to see . The turtle was n't as large as a saucer . His four legs stuck out from under his shell , clawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving this way and that on his long , scaly , black neck . " Ye grow up and I 'll be back in a couple of years and get ye , " Op laughed , throwing the kicking turtle into the stream . " I would n't want to handle a little turtle , let alone a big one , " Alf muttered . He watched the turtle swim over the water and crawl up the other side of the creek bank and hide under the overlapping turf . " Ye wo n't be afraid atter ye handle one , " Op told him . They started down the stream again , Alf lifting his cold blue feet quickly from the water whenever he stepped on the little sharp upturned slate rocks . His teeth rattled from the cold water . They came to a bed of sand , and a cloud of butterflies flew up , frightened . " Jack would like to see these , " Op said , smiling and nodding at the multicolored fluttering wings . " He 'd love to be here with his net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sand where the sunlight filtered through the sycamore and willow leaves . " There 's a good place fer a turtle , " Op said , looking the place over carefully . He got down on his knees in the water . He put his hands back in a hole under the roots of a water birch . He reached back to his elbow . Then he pulled and grunted and finally fell backward in the water . 131  | " He was pullin ' one way and I was pullin ' another , " Op grunted , holding on to a turtle large as a four-gallon crock . " He 's a big booger and he 's heavy . " The turtle was snapping at the wind . His head was thrust out on his scaly neck which was larger around than a hoe handle . His legs were pulling and his toes were scratching the air . Op held grimly to the turtle while he lay in the hole of water on his back with his head sticking up . " Help me , All . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I help you ? " Alf said sharply . " I 'm afraid of that thing ! " " Take this turtle , " Op commanded . " Take ' im before he takes me . " I ca n't do it ! I wo n't touch it . " " Take a thong of the hickory bark then , and tie a loop in it , " Op instructed Alf as he lay there in the water . " Put the loop over the turtle 's head . Ye can do that , ca n't ye ? " " Yes , I guess so , " Alf admitted as he took a thong from the bundle . He tied a loop in the bark and ran the end of the thong through the loop . Then he dropped it over the turtle 's head . " Now pull on the thong , " Op said . " Do n't be afraid of chokin ' it . Ye ca n't choke a turtle . And one 's head is jist enough bigger'n the neck to make the loop hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hickory bark and it tightened around the turtle 's neck . " Hold ' im now , Alf , " Op shouted . " I 'm lettin " im loose . " " I 'll try . " Alf braced his white feet against the bank . Op turned the turtle loose on the sand , and Alf held to the hickory thong . Op got up , and the muddy water streamed from his clothes . " Take it , Op , " Alf grunted , as the big turtle dug his feet into the sand and started pulling away .  | " Lift ' im up and get his feet offen the ground . Ye can tote ' im then . " " It 's a heavy thing , " Alf said as he lifted the turtle by the neck . " He 'll weigh thirty pounds ! " Alf followed Op down the stream , swaying to and fro under the weight of the turtle . " Is this a mock turtle , Op ? " Alf asked . " I do n't know what ye 're a-talkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Op , the kind in mock turtle soup ! " " Mock turtle soup ? " Op retorted , training his good eye on Alf . " Shucks , I never heard of a mock turtle in my life . " " Op , you 've never been anyplace but around here , " Alf said . " I used to have mock turtle soup for my lunch sometimes at Wright Airfield . " " We 're not a-ketchin " em fer soup , I can tell ye that . We 're after turtles fer meat and eggs . Lutie knows how to cook ' em . I 've lamed her . But I never heard tell of mock turtle soup ! Say , " Op said , looking straight at Alf , " jist what is a mock turtle ? We 've only got hard-shell and soft-shell turtles around here . " " I do n't know the different breeds , " Alf said irritably as he held the big turtle 's open jaws as far away as he could . " I 'm afraid it 's going to bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Op said . " That 's what makes ' im so mean . " " How do you know he 's a stud ? " " By his shell , " Op replied . " The stud has a harder-lookin ' shell and it has more color in it ! Now let 's look around here close and we 'll find his mate ! The old she-turtle is allus close to the stud . Turtles are never nervous . " " Look up there on the bank , " Alf said . " Look ! " " That 's ' er , " Op shouted with joy . " She 's started to lay ' er eggs in the sand , I-gollies. " 133  | When the turtle saw Alf and Op , she started back for the water . But Op ran up the bank to meet her , reached down , and picked her up . " We 've got turtle aplenty now , " Op said . " And we 'll have anywhere from a dozen to two dozen turtle eggs too . The eggs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A body can taste seven different kinds of wild meat in a turtle . Pheasant , quail , rabbit , possum , coon , chicken hawk , and squirrel . All in turtle meat ! " " I do n't believe I can carry this turtle all the way to the ridge , " Alf sighed . At that moment he was more interested in the weight than the taste . " Well , I 'm not a-goin ' to carry both turtles and let ye carry jist yerself . That load 'll warm ye up ! " As Alf walked up the stream with his turtle , the sun filtered through the leafy treetops enough to warm his legs . His teeth stopped rattling and sweat broke out on his face . When he and Op reached the cabin , it was late afternoon . Op took the turtles directly to the chopblock where he laid their necks over the block and cut their heads off with his double-bitted ax . Lucretia had a tub of hot water ready , and Op dropped the turtles in . " A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the shells offen ' em and cut ' em up like ye cut a chicken . I 'll show ye some of the purtiest , whitest , cleanest meat ye ever saw in yer life ! " " Look at this , Julia " ? Alf turned to his wife . He had never left the wood block . He held the ax handle up to the turtle 's mouth and it snapped at it although the body and head were severed . " Ever see anything like this ? " " I never did , " Julia said , shuddering . " How can its jaws work when it no longer has a body ? " " It 'll keep on a-doin ' that till the sun goes down , " Op said . " Op picked up these turtles with his hands , " Alf told Lucretia  | and Julia . " He reaches back under the creek banks and gets them . I would n't put my hand in one of those holes for all the tea in China . " Op looked up sharply from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China got to do with huntin ' turtles ? " " Nothing . " Alf laughed briefly . " Absolutely nothing . " He walked toward the cabin on his sore bare feet . He looked bent over , as if he thought he was still carrying the turtle . 29 " Watch old Paul , wo n't ye ! " Op said , smiling . " Birds have more sense than a lot of people . They can find enough to cat on the land . But I like to feed ' em so they will nest close to my cabin . " The rooster redbird ran a sparrow from the feedbox Op had nailed on the side of a yellow pine . Here he put the corn-bread crumbs from his table . " There 's not another bird like old Paul . Sparrows can whop all the other birds around here but the redbirds ! And old Paul is the daddy of all the rooster redbirds . Maybe they have respect fer their Pap . " Theopolis trained his good eye on the bird as he picked up crumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his craw filled , " Alf said . " I 've never seen anything that small eat so much . Where does he put it ? " " He 's not fillin ' his craw , " Op explained . " He 'll carry his big bill full of crumbs to a half-grown redbird . Then the old hen bird will fly in and get a load as soon as he leaves . The redbirds take keer of their young long atter they 're out of the nest . They 're good parents . Now watch old Paul when he leaves with the crumbs . See where he goes ! " 135  | The redbird circled around the cabin to a little dogwood which was in plain view from where they were sitting on the porch . Perched upon a limb was a half-grown bird with red tips on his wing feathers . When the father redbird fluttered in the air in front of the young bird , he opened his bill and the father bird unloaded the crumbs into the young bird 's mouth . While he was feeding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedbox and chased away a sparrow that had flown in . " Before any of ye come around here , " Op said , " they ust to fly down and light on my shoulder and eat bread from my hand . Since ye 've come to Laurel Ridge to live , they shy away from me . They do n't trust strangers any morc'n I do . " " I never had time before to sit and watch the birds , " Julia mused . " I used to go to movies or read magazines . There was always something to do in Dayton . " " I never sent fer ye , Julia , " Op said , " but if ye stay up here very long and keep yer eyes open yell see a lot of things . This is a good world up here , fer birds and men both . " " I 've been wondering if it is . " Alf shook his head . " The night after you killed the water moccasin and told me about the snakes , I could n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all directions and they were after me , too . " " When ye do a little more choppin ' , yell get so it wo n't be no trouble to sleep , " Op said . " When ye use the hoe a little more in the garden and tater patch , yell be so tired at night ye could sleep a-standin ' up . In a month or so yell larn to use them tools aright . Now , ye use yer arms like a woman ! " " That 's what I want to do , " Alf said , reaching for the old dream again . " I want to be able to make a living from this earth with my own hands . I want to live by the sweat of my brow and not by the Almighty Dollar like I did in Dayton . " He stood up , taking a deep breath of the clean mountain air . Op was wondering  | if Alf was about to make a speech , when there was a noise by the gate . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammertight 's shrill voice . " What 's all that talk about the Almighty Dollar ? That 's somethin ' I 'm a-interested in . " " Doshie , that 's ye all right , " Op said , turning toward the gate . " It 's yer nature to slip up on people to hear what they 're a-sayin ' . What do ye want , ye old puff of wind ? " " Ye 'd better be a-thinkin ' about things closer to home than the Almighty Dollar , " Doshie warned him . She opened the gate , and Hootbird , dressed in his cowboy clothes and a new dark shirt with white flowers around the collar , followed . He was carrying his rifle , and big Ben Hammertight , swinging his long gorilla arms and spitting bright sluices of amber spittle , came behind him . Ben was almost as broad as the space between the gateposts . " What 's the matter now , Doshie ? " Op asked . " Did Hoot spy on Alf and Julia a-passin ' on the ridge the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are ? " " That 's only part of it , " she replied curtly . " Hiya , honey , " I-Iootbird said , smiling at Lucretia . " Hi , Hoot , " she said , then introduced her two cousins . Alf and Julia stared from one Hammertight to the next , unbelieving . Hootbird swaggered over and sat on the porch near Lucretia 's chair . He let his fancy boots dangle down and leaned his rifle against the cabin . " Honey , ye look awful purty with yer hair tied back in a ribbon , " he said . Lutie smiled at him briefly . " Mr. Pruitt , are ye and yer wife a-livin ' here in the cabin with Op and Lutie ? " Doshie asked . " No , Mrs. Hammertight , " Alf replied , " we 're roughing it out there in Op 's smokehouse . " " I told ye , Mommie , I saw a stovepipe stuck from the smokehouse winder and smoke a-comin ' from it ! " X37  | " You must have been around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon face under the Texas hat . " I 'm allus closer than ye think , honey . Specially to ye ! " Hootbird 's smile broadened . Jerry came up and whiffed Ben 's pants legs and walked away quickly . " Op , that 's perfectly good bread ye 're a-feedin ' the birds , " Doshie said . " Of course it is , " he replied . " I want my birds to have as good a bread as I have . " " There 's many a little hungry young un in this world , Op , " she said . " I s'pect there is , Doshie , " he agreed . " But ye ai n't a-feedin ' ' em . And what I do with my birds is my own business , ai n't it ? " " When I think about the loads I pack to my little young uns out that long ridge from Honeywell , " she complained , " and the big loads I tote up that hill ! It hurts me to see bread wasted up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Op wants to feed the birds , let ' im do it , " Ben said . He spoke slowly , as if each word pained him a little . Then he let fly from his mouth a big sluice of amber spittle he 'd collected while sitting there listening . " Doshie , we did n't come to talk about birds . " " Nope , we 've come to talk about the strange man on this ridge , " Doshie said . " The wild man ! Any man that would kill and eat foxes must be wild ! " " What 's this about a wild man ? " Alf asked , turning to Julia . " We never heard anything about this ! " " Ai n't Op and Lutie told ye about ' im ? " Doshie said eagerly . She had a story to tell and she was near bursting with it . " There 's a wild man on this ridge . Ai n't been a week ago when I went to the Freewill Baptist Church by myself . As I was a-comin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grabbed me . He  | was as strong as an ox and shook me like a dog shakes a rabbit . I thought I 's a goner . " " I do n't believe it , " Op said . " Why would he grab ye ? He might grab Lutie or Julia . But only old Ben would grab ye ! " " There must be somebody loose around here . Hoot found three more dead foxes in the woods , " Ben said slowly . " Found a big fine-lookin ' red fox with his hindquarter taken off . The rest of his body and hide was left . Hoot found him at the arc . And down below the arc where the foxes den he found two pelts with the whole heads a-hangin ' on . Somebody had cut their skinned bodies loose at the neck ! " " I did n't know there was anything like this going on , " Alf said . He turned toward Lucretia . " Lutie , you said in your letters to Uncle Will and Aunt Corrinne it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridge was a paradise . But you never mentioned wild men and dead foxes ! I came down here to find a safe place away from the atom bomb ! The way you talk , I 've come to the wrong place ! " If that man ai n't afearcd of one thing , Op thought , he 's afeared of another . Snakes , turtles , cold water , bumbs , dead foxes . . . . B-gad ! " If ye come to find a safe place , Mister , ye 'd better be a-travelin ' on , " Doshie chattered at him . " This ridge ust to be one and we were happy down at Wince Leffard Gap . Only old Op was up here on the ridge . Op and the fox hunters saw a few ghosts of the ore diggers and lumberjacks who ust to work here long ago . And maybe Ted Newsome 's speret is disturbed and on the loose agin . But a ghost wo n't kill a fox . Why would he eat a fox when the Good Book tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh-and-blood people loose on this ridge ! " " Yeah , an ' I 've seen one , " Hootbird added . " A man with a rifle that took a bead on me and I backed behind a tree . " 139  | " Why do n't you report this to the sheriff ? " Alf asked Hootbird . " Do n't ye think I have n't , " Doshie replied quickly . " I 've told Sheriff Bill Ackerson every day I 've been in Honeywell since Hoot first saw the wild man ! And I 've told all his deputies . Since they wo n't do anythin ' , I 've told Jake Ratcliffe , Justice of Peace of our district . Jake said he 'd wait a while longer and if Bill did n't do sornethin ' , he 'd deputize some men and come out here and clean up this ridge and make it a fitten place to live ! " " And the other night when I was out a-walkin ' the ridge , I heard the music of a geetar and singin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And it was a man 's voice I heard and after the song I heard a woman laughin ' . Her voice sounded like yer voice , Lutie , but I could n't believe it was ye . Since the wind was a-blowin ' the sound the wrong way , I could n't tell . I was afraid to get too close ! " " When did you hear music and singin ' at night , Hoot ? " Op asked . " Night before last . " " I was right here with you , was n't I , Dad ? " Lucretia said quickly . " Pay no attention to Hoot , " Op told her . " I know Lutie was here until nine o'clock , " Julia said . " Alf and I did n't leave the cabin until nine . " " It was about two in the mornin ' when I heard ' em , " Hootbird said . " Right about the time in the mornin ' when the wind is blowin ' strongest on Laurel Ridge . " " Hoot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two in the mornin ' , " Op told him . " Why do ye go around totin ' that rifle all the time ? " " Ye 'd carry a rifle too if ye 'd been shot at . " Hootbird lowered his voice confidentially . " I believe that strange man is atter me . " Doshie just had to open her mouth and words poured out .  | " Ye 've forgotten , Op , that somebody shot through a butternut tree above Hoot 's head down at the wild-strawberry patch that day when he 's a-puttin ' a handful of strawberries in Lutie 's basket . Ye were right down there and saw it all . That 's why Hoot carries a rifle . That 's why I carry a piece of hardware right here in my bosom . And that 's why Ben has a bright piece of hardware on him right now . If there is somebody atter us , we ai n't jist a-goin ' to stand still and take it ! " " Did somebody shoot into a tree when you were picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " she admitted . " But we think it was somebody in the woods squirrel-hunting , who did it for fun . " " I do n't call that fun , " Ben said slowly . " A bullet that will go clean through a thick tree will go through my son Hoot . " " I 've had four boy babies to come stillborn , " Doshie said . " Hoot 's my only livin ' son and I do n't want ' im kilt on Laurel Ridge . Hoot 's dear to me . He 's my young un . " " And we came down here to get away from our worries , Alf , " Julia said , laughing . " Sounds like it would be much safer back in Dayton , would n't it , darling ? " " We 've come around here to warn all of ye , " Doshie said . " It 's not a laughin ' matter and yell see . " " If I thought there was a dangerous character on this ridge , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Op said . " I 'd take my old rifle and go find ' im . Doshie , ye 've wasted a lot of yer talk fer nothin ' . Ye 're a-stirrin ' the pot until it 's a-goin ' to bile over one of these days ! " " I 've come to warn ye , Op , " she said , " and ye do n't even appreciate it ! " " Ye 've come to see who 's out here , " Op told her . " To snoop and stick yer nose in things . I know ye , Doshie ! " " Come on , Hoot , " Doshie said . " Come on , Ben . We 'll haf to be a-goin ' . Op ca n't say he 's not been warned . It 's been nice to  | meet ye , Mr. and Mrs. Pruitt . Come down to Wince Leffard Gap and see us sometime . " " Op , I 've sat so long I can hardly move , " Ben grunted , getting slowly to his feet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped his ten-gallon hat to the ladies , reached for his rifle , aimed a silly smile at Lutie , and followed his folks . 30 " Come outten there ! " Theopolis and Lucretia heard a man shout . " We 've got ye surrounded ! Come outten with yer hands up , too ! " Op jumped up from the breakfast table . He opened the cabin door and walked out onto the porch with his hands up . Lucretia followed her father , hands above her head . " Who is it , Dad ? " she whispered . " I do n't know who it could be , " he replied in a hoarse whisper . " We ai n't done anythin ' ! " Op looked in his front yard and beyond the paling fence to Laurel Ridge road . He trained his good eye up and down the road as far as he could see . There was n't a person . " I do n't see anybody , " he said . " But I heard a voice , did n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been tellin ' ye fer a long time , Lutie , and now ye know it fer yerself , " he said , dropping his hands to his side . " Sperets travel this ridge road . It might 've been one of Morgan 's men . Or maybe Ted Newsome . I 'm a-believin ' it 's a troubled speret ! " " I expect it is , Dad . " Lucretia could n't control a slight giggle .  | " Come outten there ! " It was the same voice . " Get outten that bed ! Come outten there before we bust the door down and come in and get ye ! Come out in the name of the Law and be recog-nized ! " Op jumped down from the porch and started toward the smokehouse . " Sounds like Sheriff Bill Ackerson , " he said , trotting toward the garden gate . " He 's over at the smokehouse ! He 's atter them people ! I 've always been suspicious of ' em ! " " They 're all right , Dad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine people . They 're not running from anything ! " " He 's a-runnin ' from an adam bumb , he told me hisself , " Op panted . " Allus a-talkin ' about his bein ' nervous . Why 's a young man like him nervous ? I 'm a-thinkin ' he 's done somethin ' to make him nervous . He ca n't use the ax and mattock any better'n a twelve-year-old girl . He 's a quair one . It 's hard to tell what he 's done . We 'll soon see ! There 's Sheriff Bill all right ! " Op stopped at the garden gate . Sheriff Bill Ackerson , a man with a big belly and thin legs , was standing in front of the smokehouse door . " Who ye atter , Bill ? " Op went through the garden gate with Lucretia beside him . " We 're not atter ye , Op , " he replied . " But we want to know somethin ' about these strangers ye got a-hangin ' around here . " " They 're my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ! " " What do you want ? " Alf 's voice came shakily from the smokehouse . He had partly opened the door and stuck his pale face up to the crack . His blond hair was as disheveled as a lastyear 's redbird nest . His lips trembled like sweet-corn blades in the morning wind . " Ca n't you let a p-person sleep ? " " Now , stranger , do n't get funny with me , " Sheriff Bill Ackerson said . " I 've got my men with me and we 'll take ye in a minute . We 've not come fer trouble , but we do n't want no foolishness ! Come on outten there ' r open up and let us in ! " 143  | Two men came around one side of the smokehouse and one from the other . " It looks bad to me , " Op whispered to Lucretia . " He 's brought all his deputies . He means business . " " Alf , watch how you talk . " Julia 's calm voice came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'd like to know what for , " Alf said , closing the door in Sheriff Bill Ackerson 's face . " Lady , ye certainly will be arrested , " Sheriff Ackerson shouted . " Give us time to get dressed and we 'll be out . " Julia spoke politely . Sheriff Ackerson scratched his head as if perplexed . " That seems reasonable . But do n't be too long about it . We 've got other things to do . More troublesome spots in Looten County than any place I know . And Laurel Ridge is worst of all ! " " ' What 's this all about , Bill ? " " When ye lived alone here , Op , " Sheriff Ackerson told him , " we never heard of Laurel Ridge . Never any trouble here . But now there 's more'n we can handle . We 've got a lot of things to get straight ! " " They 've not done anything , Sheriff , " Lucretia said . " Ye stay outten this , Miss , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're through questionin ' them ! Then we 'll listen to yer story . I never seen ye before either ! " Sheriff Ackerson was a big man in a dark unpressed suit . Around his waist was a broad leather belt with a bright buckle and attached to this belt were two tan leather holsters with pistol handles showing under the flaps . On the front of his coat was a big silver badge with the word Sheriff engraved in dark letters . His clean-shaven face was flushed red . In the corner of his mouth he chewed a little sassafras twig as he looked at Lucretia with a pair of steady blue eyes .  | " Never be too shore of strangers , Miss , " he said to Lucretia . " It jist do n't pay . " " I 'm Op 's daughter . " " We 'll talk about that in a few minutes , " Sheriff Ackerson said , chewing faster on the twig . Theopolis knew each of Sheriff Ackerson 's deputies and spoke to them by name . There was Sop Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie Onilee was a short , heavy man with thick , broad shoulders . He was wearing brier-scratched boots and carrying a rifle . Then there was Othie Yarberry , six feet four and broad shouldered . Othie had never been beyond the third grade in school but he had the makings of a good deputy . " Sheriff , ye reckon I 'd better keep the winder covered ? " Othie said . " No , stay here , " Sheriff Ackerson said . " He 's not a-goin ' to try to get away . " " They 've not even had breakfast yet , " Op said . " I looked at the stovepipe as I crossed the garden and there was n't any smoke a-comin ' out . Ye got here before they even had their coffee ! " " That 's the way to get ' em , " Sheriff Ackerson boasted . " Mornin 's the best time . That 's part of our strategy . " " Ye must 've left Honeywell early , " Op said . " Two o'clock this mornin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The door started to open and Sheriff Bill Ackerson turned to watch . When Alf walked out with his skinny hands above his head , Op saw that he was shaking even more than he did in the cold water when he took his first bath in Red Bird Hollow . Julia followed behind him . She did n't even have her hands up . " Good morning , Sheriff , " she said , smiling . " Good morning ,  | gentlemen , " she spoke to the deputies . " Have you come to get us ? If you have , I welcome you ! " Then she let out a little chuckle . Alf was shaking so he could n't speak . " There 's a Iot of trouble on Laurel Ridge , " Sheriff Ackerson began , as his deputies watched and listened . " I 've never had so many reports . And all sorts of stories are floatin ' around over Honeywell . I 've come here to check up on all this talk . I want to know jist who ye are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since my husband , who is a little nervous , ca n't speak for himself , " Julia explained , " I 'll speak for him . He got a leave of absence from Wright Airfield in Dayton and he 's come here to spend a little time for his health ! " " Put yer hands down , " Sheriff Ackerson said to Alf . " Ye 're not a-goin ' to be as dangerous as I thought ye might be . " Alf dropped his hands . " What 's this all about ? " he stammered . " When we moved in the city , the police never investigated us . " " Darling , somebody 's reported us , " Julia told him . " That somebody is old long-tongued Doshie Hammertight , " Op said . " All she does is keep the path hot between Wince Leffard Gap and Honeywell . Doshie packs a bigger load of lies to Honeywell than the grub she fetches back . " " We 're glad to get this information , " Sheriff Ackerson said . " People are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tote firearms to defend themselves . It 's our duty to make Looten County a fitten place to live . We know our own people . We want to know who the strangers are a-lurkin ' on this ridge ! " " We are strangers here , " Julia admitted , " but that 's no crime , is it ? And I would n't say that we were lurking , ' exactly . " " But I 've ketched many a guilty man by noticin ' he was nervous , " Sheriff Ackerson said , looking at Alf . " Ye 're the nervousest yet ! "  | " But that 's what I 'm here for , " Alf said , " because I 'm nervous . I 'm afraid the whole world will be blown up in fire and smoke . I 've come to a place where I wo n't see many people , where I can dig in the garden with a hoe , where I can ... " " But yer wife said ye worked at Wright Airfield , " Sheriff Ackerson interrupted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreman there , " he replied . " I was a boss and I own my own home and had a good position . They paid me eight thousand a year ! " " What are ye a-doin ' here then ? " Bill Ackerson asked . " Have ye lost yer mind ? " " Man , ye 're crazy to leave that , " Othie Yarberry said . " I 'll take yer job and give ye mine ! " " Now , just a minute . " Alf raised his hand for silence . He seemed more composed . " You people living in Honeywell and in Looten County do n't realize the danger this country is in . If you had seen what I have seen and read as much as I 've read about this atomic bomb , and if you lived in a place where the enemy will strike first , then you might be nervous too ! " Willie Onilee let out a little chuckle . He put his finger above his head and circled it a few times . Then he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the head , " Op said . " I do n't believe that . He 's a nervous man all right . But eight thousand dollars is a lot of money to pay a man who ca n't even chop wood . That 's more money than I ever made in my lifetime . I 'd haf to pick a lot of berries and sell a lot of hides and nuts to make that much ! " " That 's big money , " Willie said , shaking his head sadly as he looked Alf over . " Now , just what do you want with me , Sheriff ? " Alf asked . He had stopped shaking . " I 've not had my breakfast , so let 's come to the point ! I was checked by the FBI before I got the  | position at Wright Airfield where I 've worked for the last ten years . I can go back to my position any time I want to . " " I want to know if ye 're the man that 's been shootin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were killed before Alf came here , " Lucretia interrupted . " I never shot a fox in my life , " All said . " In fact , I 've never killed anything ! " " One of the fox hunters comes to my office every day beggin ' me to do somethin ' about this knockin ' the red foxes off , " Sheriff Ackerson complained . " And the fox hunters have a big vote . None of our people will eat a fox , so that 's why we know he 's a stranger . But ye do n't meet the description of the man ! They say he 's about six feet tall , has hair the color of frosted crab grass , and carries an army rifle ! " " That describes Ted Newsome , " Op said . Lucretia frowned , staring at her father . " Who 's Ted Newsome ? " Sheriff Ackerson asked . " He 's a speret , " Op replied . " He 's been dead thirty years ! " Willie Onilee grunted in big huffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whinnies . Sop Johnson slapped his thighs with his big hands . " A speret is a-killin ' the foxes , boys , " Sop said . " We 've come here armed to ketch a speret ! " " Ye can all laugh that wants to , " Op said heatedly . " But it 's not a laughin ' matter ! " " I 've heard everybody in Honeywell was a-livin ' on borrowed time with all the underpinnin ' gone from under the town and the bottoms a-droppin ' outten the wells , " Sheriff Ackerson said , " but I never heard of a speret a-killin ' foxes ! I 'll tell the boys , when they come to my office , who is really a-killin ' the foxes ! A speret ! That 'll satisfy ' em ! " " Sheriff , I warn ye , " Theopolis spoke in a serious tone , " it 's dangerous to laugh at the sperets !  | " How do ye know about this speret , Op ? " Othie Yarberry asked . " He comes to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' with Ted Newsome ! " " Oh , Dad , do n't talk such nonsense . " Lucretia turned her head away in disgust . " Now , jist a minute , " Sheriff Ackerson said , holding his laughter . " We 're a-gettin ' some place . Who is this Ted Newsome ? And where does he live ? " " He 's Ted Newsome is all I know , " Lucretia said . " And I do n't know where he lives . " " Then he must be a speret , " Othie added gleefully . " We 're not gettin ' no place , but let 's go on ! " " Is she yer gal , Op ? " Sop Johnson asked . " She says so , " Op replied . " Ted Newsome even picks bouquets of wild flowers fer Lutie to put on our table ! " " Sparkin ' a speret , " Willie said , nudging Sheriff Ackerson with his elbow . His wide grin showed two semicircles of big horse teeth . " We 'll tell the fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'd like to see Penny Shelton after a speret . Or Turkey Maddox or old Plack Rivercomb . " " I think yer a-tellin ' the truth , " Sheriff Ackerson said , turning back toward Alf . " I do n't believe ye could hit a fox with an army rifle . Ye do n't look like this wild man that 's been reported to us ! " " Oh , how I wish Alf were a wild man , " Julia said , laughing . " It would be wonderful to live in a wild country , in a smokehouse with a wild man ! " " But what ye said about this atom bomb , " Sheriff Ackerson said , " it 's enough to start a man 's mind to thinkin ' . I 've never given much thought to bombs . I 've had so much trouble of my own a-tryin ' to keep peace and order in Looten County . " " I figure our enemies might have more than we 've got . " Alf  | was off on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these circular things people call flying saucers . ' It 's something to think about ! I know , where there 's so much smoke there 's bound to be some fire . I think the safest spots in this country are places like Laurel Ridge . " " I 'm not so shore about that , " Willie said slyly . " Not with Ted Newsome , the speret , in love with Op 's gal and a-shootin ' all the red foxes ! Wait 'll Doshie Hammertight comes back to our office and I tell ' er shootin ' at a speret wo n't do ' er any good ! " " Op , ye say this man is akin to ye ? " Sheriff Ackerson said . " Nope , I never said he was , " Op answered . " He 's no blood akin to me . He said his mother was my wife Beadie 's youngest sister who left this country with Will and Corrinne Day . They went to Ohio to get rich and I guess they have . They 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em agin atter the way they 've talked about me . " " They 're akin to me , " Lucretia said . " Alf is my first cousin and that 's his wife , Julia . " " And about ye , Miss ? " Sheriff Ackerson said . " Are ye Op 's gal ? " " That 's right , " she said . " The Red Cross got in touch with me when he was going blind . I came back here and took him to the doctor and had a cataract removed from one eye so he could see . " Is that right , Op ? " Sheriff Ackerson asked dubiously . " That 's right , Sheriff , " Op admitted . " I jist wanted to get straight , " Sheriff Ackerson said , " who this purty young woman is livin ' in yer cabin with ye ! " " Ye do n't haf to worry about me , Sheriff , " Op chuckled . " If she was n't my gal she would n't be in my cabin . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idears about wimmen . I had one , Beadie , and she was enough . When I 'm numbered with the blest , Beadle 's all I want to be a-flyin ' around over Laurel Ridge  | with . It would look mighty strange to see one man a-flyin ' with two sperets . I never want that . I look ahead , Sheriff ! " " Let 's be on our way , boys . " Sheriff Ackerson was already waddling away from the smokehouse . " We ca n't do much with these sperets . We 've got some real people to look after ! " " Well , " Julia said as she turned toward the smokehouse door , " first time we 've ever been checked by a Kentucky sheriff before breakfast . " 31 " The first nest of young redbirds have gone ! " Theopolis announced as he bent over a hill of sugar corn in the long garden row . " Now , Dollie is a-settin ' on four eggs behind the cabin in a bushy-topped persimmon . ' Pears like in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little closer to the cabin . I 've tolled ' em in from the woods . Found ' em a-nestin ' down in Shinglemill Holler and there I started feedin ' ' em bread crumbs on top a stump . " Op crumpled a dry clod of dirt in his big hand and spread it around the corn . Then he fondled the stalks of young green corn as if they were living things that could feel the caress of his calloused hand . He pulled a little sprig of crab grass from beside the corn that was too close to cut with his hoe . Lucretia was hoeing the row of corn next to Theopolis , and Julia was hoeing the third row behind Theopolis and Lucretia . And far behind Julia was Alf , doing the best he could to keep up with his wife . Alf did n't have the breath to spend talking because he was panting as he worked . The good morning wind came from above the floor of clouds over the Sandy Valley and swept over Laurel Ridge . Laurel 151  | Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was surrounded by clouds . And when the morning sun slanted its rays down onto the great uneven floors of rolling white clouds on either side of the green ridge , this was something for Alf and Julia to see . They stopped , leaned on their hoe handles , and looked . " I 'll tell ye , Lutie , " Op said , " many things 've happened around here since Dollie laid ' er first eggs in the nest down there in the persimmon bush . I 've got my sight back , a lot of foxes have been kilt , sperets have returned . There 've been warnin 's . I wonder what 'll happen to us by the time Dollie and old Paul hatch the eggs down in the persimmon bush . " " It would be nice to know , Dad . " Lucretia stared at the ground thoughtfully . " That 's what everybody would like to know . " Alf looked up from his hoeing . " We 'd all love to read our future . And we 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , as he began to hoe again , " it 's better for all of us that we do n't . It 's too bad people with so much intelligence in this world ca n't get along . We 've got enough sense to blow each other up but not enough sense to get along as friendly neighbors . " " Here we go agin , " Op whispered to Lucretia . " Let 's do n't get Alf started on that adam bumb . He 'll worry himself to death ! " " You worry him too , Dad , " Lucretia whispered . " You worry Cousin Alf about the spirits . You know he does n't believe in them , so why talk about them ? " " But he 'll believe in ' em one of these days , " Op said in a low tone . The four long-handled gooseneck hoes made little ringing sounds against the dry garden earth . " I 'm a-goin ' to show Alf somethin ' about the sperets . We 're a-comin ' to a showdown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alf continued , digging crazily into the Laurel Ridge earth with his hoe , " it would be a  | better world . And we would n't have all these fears about going up in flame and smoke . The cemeteries would become obsolete . Undertakers , cemetery sextons , and tombstone salesmen would all have to go out of business ! " " They 're already outten business around here , " Op said . " They 've never been in business . Well , they 're jist now a-gettin ' a little trade , " he admitted as he leaned on his hoe handle . " But around here we 've allus made our own coffins . The men gather and make the coffin , and the wimmen line it with silks and satins while other men go to the Freewill Baptist Graveyard and dig the grave . When a body dies around here , in a short time he 's laid to rest . That is , if it 's in the summertime . In the winter , if the ground is frozen purty hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold room . Sometimes there 's an awful lot of ice and deep snow up here on this ridge and around the Freewill Baptist Graveyard . " " I realize more every day we 're living in a different world here . " Julia spoke for the first time . She wiped her face with a kerchief . " If anybody had ever told me I 'd be above the clouds hoeing corn , I would have laughed . But here I am . I 'm getting my vitamins from the sun , wind , and dirt , I suppose ! " " A-gettin ' yer what ? " Op asked , turning around and looking at Julia . " My vitamins , " she repeated . " What 's that ? " Op asked . " Medicine , something to give more strength to the body , " she explained . " There 's a vitamin for every deficiency in the body . " " And there 's a root , a stem , or a blossom fer every ailment , " Op said as he turned around and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the place of yarbs ! " Op stepped over into Lucretia 's row and hoed a few hills of corn because she was getting behind . 153  | " If all the world was like Laurel Ridge , " Alf said , stopping to clean dirt from his fingernails , " it would be a perfect mixture of good and bad . The air up here is fresh and good to breathe ? but it 's awfully chilly at night when it blows through the smokehouse cracks ! There are vitamins in the sunshine  --  but the sun is hot on my poor back working in the garden . And the clouds ... " " The ground hogs are a-makin ' their coffee , " Op interrupted . " When ye see clouds a-hangin ' over the valleys , the ground hogs 're at work . That 's the steam from their coffee bilers , the old people always told me . " " Tell me , Op , " Alf said . " How do the ground hogs make coffee ? " He turned and winked at Julia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nope , but they 're a-makin ' it fer Red Jacket and his angels . Red Jacket 's another speret on the ridge ? " Theopolis stopped talking to look back at Alf to see what was wrong . He had dropped his hoe and was making funny noises . He was swinging at the wind with his fists . " What 's the matter , Alf ? " Julia asked . " I do n't see anything ! What are you fighting ? " " Damn bee stung me on the lip , " he shouted irritably . " I 'll kill it if I can ! " " Why do n't ye feed yer friends , Alf ? " Op interrupted . " Feed them what ? " Alf was still swinging with his fists . " Sweat , " Op said . " That 's the little sweat bee the good Lord put here to make people work . Ye 're a-starvin ' it to death . That 's what Pap ust to tell us . Work enough to sweat so we would n't starve the sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say : Sweat bees 're put here fer a purpose . That 's to sting lazy people and make ' em work . ' " Alf picked up his hoe . He mumbled , giving Theopolis a hard look : " The Lord did n't put any bee on my lip to sting it ! "  | " The sweat bee 's a good timepiece too , " Op said . " Nine , twelve , and three are his mealtimes and he looks to a body fer some sweat . " Julia laughed . " That was one thing you were saying just yesterday , that you missed up here , Alf  --  your electric clock . Now you do n't need it . Whenever you get stung by a bee , you 'll know what time it is . " Alf was n't enjoying the joke . He fingered his swollen lip tenderly . " It 's all right for Op not to have a clock . He measures time by what President was in office and by the nesting seasons of the birds . But I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sting every three hours . Besides , you 've got to remember that I was an executive once and executives do n't sweat . " " Anybody who do n't sweat ai n't human , " Op said , rising up from pulling weeds from around his corn . " But there are other ways of tellin ' time too . When a man lives without a clock , he gets so he can tell time to the minute by the insects and birds . Snails start a-crawlin ' at six in the mornin ' . The doodlebugs start work at seven . The rain crows croak at ten . Chicken hawks stir at noon to find a mess of young birds . Hoot owls hoot at about two . And at three the grasshoppers chew and spit their terbacker juice . At four the woodpeckers drill in the dead trees . At five the crows fly home . At six the white moths begin to fly . " " That kind of time is all right for you , Op , " Alf said . " You never have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you worked at Wright Airfield . " " At night it 's harder to tell time , " Op talked on , paying Alf no heed . " But if a man has looked long enough at the night skies searchin ' fer signs , he larns to tell time by the stars . Then , there 're the katydids , nightjars , whippoorwills , moths , and foxes . But why worry about the time ? I never did . " Op and Lucretia had reached the end of the garden with their sweet-corn rows . Op stood for a minute and wiped the sweat .  | " Lutie , we 'd better help Julia and Alf , " Op said . " They 're behind . " " Yes , I 've about ruined my hands , " Alf grumbled , stopping to examine the blisters . " I ca n't keep this wonderful garden dirt from getting under my fingernails either . " He peeled dead skin from his hand . " And that reminds me of another job . We 've got to fix that wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaks our wonderful mattresses made of last-year 's leaves . " His sarcasm was lost on Op , who was thinking about a bole in another roof . " A hole in the roof is what almost mint Pap once . " Op , resting on his hoc handle , took one of his deep storytelling breaths . " Brother Adger , years dead and gone to his long home , was about thirty-five then and full of his devilment . Old Brother Ike Strickland was a-preachin ' at the Freewill Baptist Church and he had a big revival a-goin ' hot and heavy . Brother Adger had been a-goin ' night atter night , jist like everybody else around here , to that month-old revival . One night Brother Adger wore a long , white nightshirt , stiff with starch and with a big pair of sleeves . And he wore low-cut shoes without socks . Brother Adger never kept his hair cut very short and in them days he let his beard grow . He had a sandy-colored beard . " He slipped in at the door right when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , Lord , ' Brother Smallwood said , come down from yer Heaven and be with us tonight . Come down through the roof ' ? and at about that time a lot of Amens went up from all over the house fer I was right there and heard ' em ? and right down through the ceilin ' . We do n't mind , Lord . We 'll repair the roof . ' And , about that time , Brother Adger , who was a-standin ' in the back of the church house beside the door , unnoticed by anyone , said : Would n't it be better to walk in at the door , Brother Smallwood ? ' " Brother Smallwood turned around and give one look and  | fell to his knees . He crouched there on his knees and shook till he had to hold to his scat to steady himself . No need to tear up the roof and ceilin ' and have a lot of extra work to repair ' em when there 's a door to this church house , ' Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of extra work fer nothin ' . ' At that , Boadie Sloas , a terrible sinner but under conviction , went out the winder headfirst , with Jim Pennix , Hester Cremeans , and Jimmy Overton a-followin ' . Young Shannon Burton took out a whole sash and cut his hand on the glass but he run into the dark woods and never stopped till he got home . He did n't even know he was cut till he got home and passed out . Wimmen run out the door screamin ' . Little young uns woke up from their sleep and ran after their mothers . " But Brother Sweeter Barnhill , Sister Shug Meadows , Ossie and Tillie Redfern , Bill and Drusie Flannigan come with their arms lifted and fell at Brother Adger 's feet . If Brother Adger had n't had a birthmark on his cheek , a little gray scaly stripe where he was marked by a lizard , I do n't know what might 've happened . I think he might 've come back agin and taken the church over and converted everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and saw the mark . And he let out a wild whoop and jumped up , but Brother Adger , bein ' much younger , was too fast fer Sweeter . He got out before the others knowed what it was all about . And he took to the dark woods and circled home . " There he goes again , Alf thought . I 've heard so many of his weird tales they 're beginning to get under my skin . I wake up in the middle of the night in the smokehouse thinking about his foolish " sperets . " Then a twig scrapes against the windowpane and I sit up in bed shaking and swallowing . " Well , Sweeter went to Honeywell and swore out a warrant fer Brother Adger fer disturbin ' public worship " ? Op had his second wind ? " and it nearly broke Pap up . Pap had to stop  | workin ' in his crop and he rode a mule day and night a-seein ' people he knowed . The trial lasted two weeks and everybody come and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honeywell . It cost Pap his mule team , two yoke of oxen , and three milk cows before he got Adger outten that scrape . That ruint Brother Adger and that 's why he left this country and went West . He went to Oklahomie and died and is buried there . But he planted our seed there with five sons afore he died . Yell find the Akers in Oklahomie ! And all of this happened over a hole in the roof . Only reason poor old Brother Adger would give fer a-doin ' that was : I wanted to see whether they really did want the Lord , Our Saviour , to visit ' em or not . ' He said that in the trial . He was as white as a sheet all a-durin ' that trial . Brother Adger was skeered to death . He was glad to take off fer a new country when it was all over . Yep , it ruint'im around here . " Op had hoed Julia 's row back to where she stood leaning on her hoe handle , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Lucretia and Alf were hoeing . He started hoeing in the middle . " Atter we finish this row , " he said , " we 'll eat some dinner . No ust a-tryin ' to do too much this mornin ' . " He bent to his hoeing and then straightened up abruptly . " Now what set me a-tellin ' about Brother Adger ? Have n't told that story in ten years . " " The hole in the smokehouse roof . " Alf grimaced . " I made the mistake of mentioning it . "  | 32 " Where are we now , Op ? " Alf asked . He had to stop for he was panting for breath and bent over double on the hill . " And how much farther do we go ? " " Do n't worry , Alf , " Op told him . " It 'll be much easier walkin ' from here on ! This is the last big hill . We 'll be walkin ' on the level and down a big hill the rest of the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Laurel Ridge and crossed Pawpaw Gap . And the long hill up from Pawpaw Gap that we 've jist climb is Pawpaw Hill . No more'n five miles now to Cedar Riffles ! " Op started walking on slowly and Alf followed , carrying a coffee sack on his back . He had in the coffee sack a bundle of pine kindling that was rich with resin . Op had split the kindling and had chosen certain sticks for this special occasion . He carried a hunting knife in a sheath on his belt and a cedar bow in one hand . In another sheath made of hickory thongs that rested on his shoulder he carrried a little bundle of arrows . The arrows were made of straight sourwood limbs Op had selected from the sourwood trees on Laurel Ridge . He had pointed the ends of these sourwoods with horseshoe nails , knocked the heads from the nails , and filed the blunt ends to pin-point sharpness . Then he had filed a little hook on the nail so that the arrow would hold . " We 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Op said , as Alf trotted to catch up . " There 's a place out here we want to stop fer a few minutes . I want to show ye somethin ' . " They had walked approximately two hundred yards farther when Op left the road and turned right into a churchyard . There was a small , unpainted , weather-beaten church house with two windows on each side sitting under a grove of giant  | oaks . Around the church house on all sides except the front was a cemetery with white and gray markers . In the barren clay , there were rows of brown field stones with names and dates of the deceased crudely chiseled on them . Many of the letters and initials of the names were chiseled backward . " It 's down here , " Op said , walking through the yuccas , white with bloom , and the little sand briers with reddish-brown leaves . The seeds from the wild grass caught under Op 's boot strings . " Here 's Ted 's long home , " Op said , stopping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once heaped-up mound . " It 's here that he comes and goes and never leaves a trace . " " Private Ted R. Newsome . " Alf read aloud the inscription on the government-bought stone . " Born June 7th , 1888 . Died August 8th , 1919 . Co . C. 40 Kentucky Infantry . " " Now come over here , " Op spoke in a serious tone , " and I 'll show ye what caused his speret to be troubled . She 's not too fur away from ' im . " Alf grinned as he followed Op across the row of graves . " Here she is , " Op said , pointing to a large twin tombstone . " I do n't think she goes and comes when she pleases . I think she 's a-stayin ' right down there ! " Alf read aloud for Theopolis the name , dates , and epitaph on the stone : " Lucinda Dortch Simpson , Born April 16th , 1892 . Died August 20th , 1947 . Gone but not forgotten . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone but not forgotten . She 's a-causin ' Ted 's speret to be troubled , probably ever since they laid ' er here . " Then Alf read a name and date on the other half of the stone : " Jacob Leroy Simpson , Born June 17 , 1894 . . . . Died. ? " " He 's not dead yet , " Op said . " He 's married agin . And it 's a good thing if he wants a speret with ' im in another world .  | Lucinda 's speret would sure go with Ted 's . A lot of the old people believed Jake bushwhacked Ted . " Op turned and walked away , his face somber . Alf followed him back across the barren yellow-clay yard to the wagon road . He wanted to laugh at old Op 's incessant talk of spirits but somehow the bare , neglected graveyard drove all the laughter out of him . 33 Shadows of dusk had filled the Little Sandy River Valley . The wind moaned through the tops of the tall cedars growing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled his hunting knife from his sheath and cut a long willow pole . Then he reached a hickory thong from his hip pocket . He took the pine kindling from the sack and tied it tightly around the pole with the thong . Finally , Op fingered down deep into his hip pocket and brought out a ground-hog string for his bow . " It takes a long time to make a good bow , " he said . " I make ' em in winter a-sittin ' around my stove when I 've not got much to do . I take my time and make ' em good . And I try to make every arrow count . I got the cedar fer my bows here at Cedar Riffles . Best cedar in Looten County grows here . " Theopolis looped one end of his ground-hog  --  hide bowstring over the bow and then pulled with all his might to bend the bow so he could loop the other . Below them a bullfrog made the sound of slow beats on a big bass drum . Alf stood watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and shivering in the wind . " It 's a-gettin ' about time fer the frogs to open up , " Op said .  | " In a few minutes when the frogs and all the night insects open up , ye wo n't be able to hear the wind in the cedars ! " Op took an arrow from the sheath behind his shoulder . " Let 's get our boots off now , " he said . " Hear that water a-splashin ' down there ! " " You mean I 've got to wade in that river ? " " Yep , when the big red hosses 're a-playin ' , " Op said , " ye got ta wade . I 'm hungry fer a good mess of fish ! " " Any swirl holes down there to suck a man under ? " Alf peered uncertainly downstream . " Why do you want me in that river ? " " Ye wade along and hold that torch jist right and give me the light and I 'll show ye ! " " But I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never lam any younger , " Op said . He pulled off his other sock . The moon had come up over Remines Ridge flooding the bank with light . The two men sat under a cedar high up on the river bank . Below , along the riffles , the shores of the Sandy were lined with water birch , ironweed , sycamores , and willows . The treetops leaned over the water and formed a canopy of green that cut away most of the moonlight from the river . The silver could filter through the leaves in only a few places and leave its bright reflections on the water that poured over the riffles . Now Alf heard the roar of frogs and the singing of night insects that Op had predicted . The splashing of the water below sounded far away . " This is a new life all right , " Alf said , just to hear the sound of his own voice . " I 've sure never seen fish caught with a bow and arrow . " " It 's a lot better'n trappin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches his brains with the fish 's this way . Now , when I was nearly blind I made nets and set ' em in the deep holes down by Artner's.  | I had to have my fresh fish and turtles ! I 've had ' em all my life . But now that I kin see agin , I give the fish a chance . " Op struck a match to the pine kindling and the little flame took hold . It leaped into a bigger flame . " Now hold the pole like this , Alf , " Op showed him . " Tip the kindlin ' up so the flame wo n't burn all the way down and burn the thong . " " I see what you mean , " Alf said . " Let 's go ! " Op 's old voice was eager like a boy 's . He picked up the empty coffee sack and lapped it over the thong tied around his waist . They walked down to the water by a little path that had been made by other fishermen . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the roar of water pouring over the rocks . " I saw something jump up there , " Alf shouted . " Look out there by that sycamore ! " " Do n't yell ! " Op said sharply . " Give me light ! " The two men waded into the river above their knees . " Ow ! It 's cold , " Alf whispered , " and the rocks are sharp and slippery . " Op trained his eye in this direction and that . With his right thumb and index finger he gripped the arrow against his bowstring . With his left hand he held tight to his bow . Once he threw up his bow but he did n't shoot . " I saw ' im , " Op whispered . " The red bosses are a-havin ' fun here tonight . It must be a holiday fer the fish . They 're a-havin ' some kind of a big doin 's . " It happened so suddenly Alf only heard the swish in the air and the arrow 's " plump " into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and reached down under the surface , lifting a fish with an arrow sticking through it . " I hit ' im jist right , " Op said proudly . " Not too hard , just 163  | hard enough . B-gad , an arrow stops one , but there 's the danger of a-shootin ' right through ' em . " " What kind of fish is it ? " " A red Floss . " " How much will it weigh ? " Alf 's teeth were chattering but he was determined to show a polite interest in Op 's little fish . " About four pounds , " Op said . " But I 'm atter a twentypounder here tonight . We ought to get one ! This night is jist right ! " Op pulled the arrow on through the fish . He held the fish while Alf took the sack from behind the thong . Then Op dropped the fish into the sack . " Let 's tie the sack in the edge of the riffle , " Op said . " Keep ' im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank where Op tied the end of the sack to a bent-over sycamore . " That fish will die , " Op said . " And we 've got seven miles or more to tote ' im home before we clean ' im . " Alf floundered in the water but he managed to stay on his feet as they waded upstream . " You do n't have to remind me of that seven-mile walk home , " he muttered . Like his father before him , Theopolis Akers had used a bow and arrow and had come to Cedar Riffles at night and killed fish since he was big enough to remember . He 'd fished with nets , throw lines , and poles , but on the riffles he had never used a gig like many of the fishermen he had known . He used his bow and arrow for the simple reason that he loved this kind of fishing best of all . When Alf returned to him with the light , they started across the river . There was a swish and another plump into the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its back . Alf reached down and got the arrow . He lifted the fish from the water . " It 's different from the other one ! " 164  | " It 's about a two-pound white sucker , " Op said , examining the fish . " Take it to the sack ! " Theopolis put the arrow back into the shaft . By eleven o'clock they had caught nine fish . Theopolis had missed only twice . " We 've got plenty of fish , " Alf said , when he put the last fish in the sack . " Who 's going to carry all that load back seven miles ? " " But we do n't have a big un , " Op grumbled . " We 'll be a-carryin ' home more fish than we have now ! " " These are all good-sized , " Alf said . " They 'll be mighty heavy by the time we get up on the ridge ! " " But there are some big red hosses here on this riffle tonight , " Op told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a thirty-pound fish jump up into a strip of moonlight a while ago ! " " Not that big , Op , " Alf chided . " That sounds like one of your big snakes . " Theopolis wheeled in the water . There was a swish and a plop . " I never saw it , " Alf said . " Hold that light , Alf ! " Theopolis was excited . He drew another bow from the sheath and shot again . " Take my bow ! Hurry ! " Alf grabbed Op 's bow , and Op went down into the water . " I got ' im , " he said . " He 's a gollywhopper ! Wait till I get my hand into his mouth ! I 'm afraid of pullin ' the arrow from his back ! " Alf moved the light this way and that as he followed Op down the riffles . Op rolled over in the water as he wrestled with the fish . " Ye ai n't a-gettin ' away , " Op shouted . " Clamp down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Op 's body lodged against a rock in the swift water . But he kept his head above and held to the fish . X65  | " Oh , there goes the light , " Alf yelled . " I could n't hold it with one hand ! " Alf fell headfirst into the water . " Save that bow , " Op shouted . " Throw it out on the bank . I 'll hold the fish till ye can hep me ! " Alf rose from the water , shaking with chills . With Op 's bow out on the bank , he waded down the dark stream . " Where are you , Op ? " " Right here . " " I ca n't see you ! " " Come to the sound , " Theopolis shouted . " Hurry ! " Alf stumbled against Op , who was lodged behind the rock , and pitched over on his head into the riffles . When he arose from the water , there was a note of awe in his shaking voice . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's huge . " " Get two arrows from my sheath and sink ' em in ! " " What about the knife , Op ? " " Do as I tell ye ! Hurry ! Get arrows ! " Alf got arrows from the sheath which was under water . Then he waded down two steps and felt the cold and slimy back of the fish . He pushed an arrow as far as he could into the fish . And then he sank the second one . " I did it , Op , " he shouted with excitement . " I felt the pressure let up , " Op said , " I know ye have . Now get the fish by the tail . Get down in the water if it 's shaller there . Hold its tail with one arm agin yer side and hold to an arrow with yer other hand . " " Got the arrow , Op , " Alf shouted . " Got my arm around his tail ! " " We got ' im now , " Op said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're a-weakenin " im . Wait till I tie ' im with this hickory . " Theopolis pulled the thongs from his water-soaked pocket .  | He put one into the fish 's mouth and threaded it through his gills . Then he freed his hand from its mouth and held to the thong . " We 've got ' im now , Alf , " Op shouted above the roar of the water . " Come and hold ' im by this thong till I run another one through his gills . " Op pulled by one thong and Alf pulled by the other . They heaved the fish from the river and upon the bank where there was a patch of moonlight . " Four arrows in ' im , " Op said . " I hit ' im both times a while ago . But how could I miss a fish this big ! " " This is like a dream , " Alf said excitedly . " I 'll never forget this fish ! How big is he , Op ? About ninety pounds ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty pounds ! " " He 's bigger than that ! " " He jist seems that way atter ye wrestled with ' im in the riffles . A forty-pound fish can give a man a lot of trouble on the riffles ! I thought there was a big red boss there . I saw ' im under the water several times when ye got the light right . " Op and Alf were still panting as they looked on the big gray fish lying there subdued and gasping on dry land . Op said , " We 'll have fresh fish aplenty now . " " It must be midnight , " Alf remembered , his excitement dying . " I 'm exhausted . I 'd love to be in my little bed in the smokehouse . " " Ferget about yer little bed , " Op told him . " We got the big fish , ai n't we ? What if we do n't get home till daylight ? " " But I 'm tired and wet . " Alf thought of the seven-mile walk ahead of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get warm a-totin ' that sack full of fish home ! Ye 'd better fetch it from the river . " While Alf went down to the dark river to find the sack , Op went for his bow . He counted and arranged his arrows in the sheath . Then he removed the ground-hog string and let his bow 167  | go straight again . He tied together the two thongs that went through the fish 's mouth and doubled the ends to make himself a good handhold . " Now carry my bow and the sack , Alf , " Op told him . " Let 's be on our way ! " Alf watched Op swing the big fish high upon his back . Its tail was almost touching the ground . Op held the thongs over his right shoulder , gripping them with both hands . " I ketched a seventy-seven pound fish once , " Op said as they trudged up the bank toward the cedars . Alf was following Op , staring at the big gray fish that shone white in the moonlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried it to Honeywell and weighed it . I thought it would weigh a hundred pounds . I was younger then than ye are now and had n't ketched too many fish . " Op caught a half breath . " That was the biggest fish I ever ketched . " " Shoot it with a bow and arrow ? " Alf grunted . " Nope . I was down there a-fishin ' in the hole at the end of the riffles . I had a line baited and the pole set in the bank . And I had another pole in my hand . I 'd jist baited my hook with a little minner . " Theopolis paused to get more wind . Alf gladly stopped behind him , taking the sack of fish from his shoulder with a slight groan . " I had a feelin ' there was a big fish in that hole , " Op said . " And jist as I 's a-gettin ' ready to drop the minner into the water on my hook , I saw a turtle about the size of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swum right up below me , and a big red hoss reached up and swallered him . My heart nearly pounded itself from my body when I saw that fish . My ribs were all that kept my heart inside . I held the little minner down jist above the water and that red hoss raised up to get ' im and I dropped the minner into his mouth . He started pullin ' and I 168  | knew my line would break . But I had my hand down his mouth and behind his gill . I had my feet behind a stump and I pulled with all the power in me and pulled ' im onto the sand . There I had ' im . He cut my hand awful . It bled but I did n't keer . I wrestled with that fish there on the sand till I weakened ' im and hollered to Brother Adger who was fishin ' further down Sandy to cone a-runnin ' . He found me a-layin ' beside the fish with one hand in his mouth and one arm around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Adger tied him good and tight to a tree with two ' r three strands of trot-line through his gills . IIe could n't get back to water and he soon lost his power . He put a fence rail through his gills and carried ' im to Honeywell . His tail drug the ground and he weighed seventy-seven pounds . And when we cleaned ' im we found a sixteen-pound pike inside ' im he 'd swallered . " Theopolis started up the hill again . With a sigh , Alf shouldered his heavy sack of fish and followed Op up the path . For once he wished Op 's story had been longer . 34 " Well , sir , I was down in Sulphur Spring Holler about a chew of calmus weed away from Ben Hammertight 's when it happened , " Op said . He stood under the oak 's shade in the corner of the garden filing a hoe . " I 'd found one of the best patches of ginseng around a little moss-kivvered rock I 'd ever found in my life . Ginseng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There I was among the five-prong stems of ginseng , but somethin ' told me that a pair of eyes was on me . I 'd put a lot of ginseng roots into my poke when I raised up to look around . There was a big half-rotted log down the hill below the rock and 169  | I saw a pair of little black beady eyes a-lookin ' straight at me . The afternoon sunrays slanted down through an open space in the treetops , right onto that pair of eyes that had no lids . When it could n't bat its eyes and looked right at me in the sunrays , I knowed he was a snake . So I called Jerry from the woods and he came runnin ' . " Op pulled a calmus root from his hip pocket and bit off a chew of the tough , shriveled weed . His three listeners  --  Alf , Julia , and Lutie  --  sat under the oak tree enjoying its shade . " I took my little mattock and I went down to take a look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Its head was on the log and it stretched down among the pea vines and wild oats twelve or fifteen feet . When Jerry ran up and took a look at the snake , he did n't do a thing . He trembled as much as I did . It was too much of a snake fer old Jerry . He backed off growling and I backed away too . Ye slipped up here and planned to swaller me , ' I said to the snake . I 'll give ye some trouble fer that . ' I got hot as a mule under the collar . So I found a big dead pole , all I could handle , and I come down on his head with that . The snake started crawlin ' up the hill and I followed , battin ' ' im over the head . Jerry barked and growled and ran along beside me . Old Jerry has kilt many a snake  --  copperhead and rattler  --  but he was afeared of that one . He nipped at its body about ten feet back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stick . I beat it enough to give it a headache , but over the ridge it went toward the Artner rock cliffs ! " " Yep , snakes can get close enough to swaller ye , Op , but ye allus see ' em in time , " said a man on the other side of the garden fence . " But strangers can live in yer smokehouse and yer cabin and ye do n't do anythin ' about it . " Theopolis , Lucretia , Julia , and Alf turned around to look . " Snake , where did ye come from ? " Op was surprised . " I never saw ye a-standin ' there . " 170  | " I 've stood here long enough to hear that snake story for the hundredth time , " Snake Blue said . " And ye 've told it the same way every time so it must be the truth .... " " It is the truth , " Op interrupted . " I 've come out here to see who these strangers are , " Snake Blue said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-harborin ' on my premises . I 've still got a deed for this land , remember . Look in deed book 90 on page 386 and yell see who the rightful owner is . Go to the Honeywell Courthouse and , if ye ca n't read , have J. L. to read it fer ye . I jist want it understood who owns this land before I start cleanin ' house here . " Snake Blue was a little red-faced man , and he talked faster than an early-July wind blowing among the blackberry briers . He leaned his shotgun against the garden palings and wiped sweat from his turkey-red face while he talked . " There 's a-goin ' to be one of the best hangin 's around here there 's ever been in the history of Looten County . " Snake 's words just poured out of his mouth . " And long , long time ago we ust to hang ' em here . Eleven was hung at one time on the Looten County Courthouse Square . That was before my day , Op . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to Ben Hammertight 's place and talked to Ben . He totes a pistol while he works . Doshie carries one to Honeywell and Hootbird is skeered to death . Was shot at agin the other day when he was squirrel-huntin ' . So I thought I 'd better take my gun out and have a look around my property . I found old Plack Rivercomb a-sittin ' down there on a big moss-kivvered rock with a Winchester across his lap . A-huntin ' squirrels , Plack ? ' I said . I 'm a-huntin ' a big squirrel , Snake , ' he said . I 'm a-huntin ' the squirrel that 's a-killin ' our foxes . If I take ' im alive , he 'll swing to a limb over Laurel Ridge . We 'll have an old-time hangin ' , Snake . ' And then I found Penny Shelton down in Shinglemill Holler with a high-powered rifle he 's bought himself jist fer 171  | the purpose of findin ' this fox killer . Penny 's a-wonderin ' about these people ye 're a-harborin ' around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come to an understandin ' . Let 's have a showdown right here ! " He finished his speech by waving vaguely in the direction of Alf , Julia , and Lutie , huddled together under the oak tree . " Come on through the garden gate , Snake , and meet these people , " Op said . " Right now . " Snake left his shotgun leaning against the palings . He walked through the gate . " This is Lutie , Snake . " " Who 's Lutie ? " " She says she 's my daughter . " " Sounds suspicious to me . " " But ye know Beadie and I had a daughter ? " " I 'm one of the few around here who does know it , " Snake Blue said , looking Lutie over . " I remember the stormy night when yer gal baby was born . I ought to remember . My wife Sal came over that night to deliver her . But some people come here from Ohio and took that baby away from ye , Op . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd haf to have proof she 's yer gal . " " But I am Op 's daughter , " Lucretia repeated . " Why else would I come back to his cabin ? " Snake looked into her pretty face and decided he did n't want to argue the point . " Who are these other people ? " " Julia and Alfred Pruitt , " Op said . " They say they 're Lutie 's cousins . No blood kin to me , though . " " Are ye the man who 's a-doin ' all this shootin ' around here ? " Snake asked Alf , looking him in the eye . " Did ye jump from the brush and grab Doshie Hammertight when she was cornin ' from church the other night ? " " I never killed a fox in my life , " Alf said , the muscles in his 172  | face twitching . " And I never grabbed Doshie Hammertight . Good Lord , no ! " " Old Doshie , that awful bag of hot air , " Op sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where are ye from ? " Snake asked . " I want to know more about ye . " " I 'm from Dayton , Ohio , " All stammered . " Did ye have a job in Dayton ? " Snake asked . " I worked at the Wright Airfield . " " Then what in hell are ye a-doin ' out here on my ridge ? " Snake asked . " This looks suspicious to me . Three strangers out here . And ye , Op , a-harborin ' ' em ! " " Mr. Blue , " ? Alf had found a subject close to his heart ? " since the world has gone mad and the atomic bomb has been discovered , I do n't believe industrial cities like Dayton , Ohio , are safe . In fact , I do n't believe the world is safe . That 's why I 'm here . " " The world not safe ? " Snake Blue peered closely at Alf . " That 's hard to understand , stranger . " Snake Blue wiped more perspiration from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by water once , but that was in the Bible . " " That 's what the atomic bomb'li do " ? Alf 's voice rose ? " only with fire , not water . And one bomb will be enough for a big city and all the people in it will go up in flame ! " Snake Blue looked Alf over from head to toe , as if looking for a third leg or a single eye in the middle of the forehead . " That 's crazy talk , " he said . " Mr. Pruitt , ye are a very nervous man . We do n't have many nervous people around here . Ye need good nerves and a steady eye when ye sight over a gun barrel . Around here when a man is nervous and he talks like ye 're a-talkin ' , we think he 's a-runnin ' from some foul deed . We know this country 's a-goin ' to stand . Ye stick around here with us 173  | awhile and ye wo n't have any doubts . Ye need some hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ye need to dig in the dirt and chop stovewood . " " That 's what I 've told ' im , Snake , " Op said ; " and that 's what he 's a-doin ' and he 's much better'n he was the day he come here . Atter he takes medicine from the wild roots he 'll be a different man too . Alf 's not a-runnin ' from a foul deed , Snake ! I 'm shore of that . Alf needs help . He 's a weaklin ' , runt of the litter , or somethin ' . About next spring , I figure he 'll be able to build his own cabin on the ridge and make his own way . I do n't dislike Alf and Julia exactly , but to have them in my smokehouse is too close . " " Op , I do n't mind yer squattin ' up here twenty years and not a-payin ' rent . But , " Snake warned , " to harbor strangers who kill foxes and shoot at people is somethin ' I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where there 's smoke , there 's fire . Where there 's strangers " ? he pointed at Alf ? " there 's trouble . " Then he scratched his turkey-red neck . " But I 'll admit that ye do n't look like no killer . " " I think it 's Ted Newsome a-doin ' it all , Snake , " Op told him . " Ted Newsome 's been dead thirty years , Op ! " Snake Blue looked strangely at Theopolis . " Ye mean the Ted Newsome we ust to know , do n't ye ? " " Yes , I do , " Op said . " IIe 's been back here ! And he says his name is Ted Newsome . His description fits that of the Ted we ust to know  --  six foot , blond , with pearly-white teeth and a square-set jaw . " " Who 's seen Ted Newsome around here ? " Snake Blue asked , serious now . " Lutie 's seen ' im , " Op said . " He 's a-sparkin ' with Lutie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to see ' er . " " What ! " Snake Blue turned toward Lucretia . " When does this man come ? Where does he live ? " 174  | " Ye know where he lives ! " Op looked strangely at Snake . " He lives in his long home ye and I hepped dig thirty years ago . He lives where we laid ' im . The old temple of flesh lives there but the speret roams ! " " Ye and yer sperets , Op , " Snake said . " Ye tell me about this man , Lutie ? " " He 's a spirit all right . " Lutie looked very earnest when she said it . " I can be working at the cabin and he 'll come in with a bouquet of flowers . I never see him coming . I just look around and he 's standing there . He goes just like he comes ! He disappears like smoke on a high wind . " " No question in my mind ye 're Op 's daughter , " Snake Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was goin ' to get somewhere . But like old Op , ye see strange things in the clouds and ye hear tokens in the wind . Watch poor old Ted that he do n't kill the foxes . And " ? Snake slapped Op on the shoulder ? " do n't let that speret Ted Newsome marry Lutie . What a combination that would be ! Everybody 'd come fer miles to see that couple . Then ye 'd never be able to live in peace on Laurel Ridge ! " " I 'd rather she 'd marry a speret , Snake , as that Hootbird . " Op 's voice shook with anger . " He 's the little sneak that 's a-startin ' a lot of these wild tales about Laurel Ridge . Better check ' im . He might be the one a-killin ' the foxes and sayin ' it 's a wild man he 's seen . I would n't put nothin ' past ' im . " " But he 's not as dangerous as his long-tongued mother , " Lutie said , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate without answering and got his gun . He went over the ridge line toward Shinglemill Hollow . Alf turned to Julia , a bewildered expression on his face . " Does  --  does he still think I killed the foxes ? " " No , darling , " Julia answered absently ; " he just thinks you 're a little teched in the head . " Then she added , in a voice too low 175  | for Op and Lutie to hear : " But did you hear Lutie calling this Ted Newsome fellow a spirit ? There 's something funny there . I know Lutie better than that . She does n't believe in spirits ! " 35 Theopolis wandered back to the tree , his lips moving in a mutter . " First the fox hunters , then old Doshie , atter her comes Sheriff Ackerson , and now Snake Blue . " Surely you do n't believe this nonsense about a wild man , Dad . " Lutie was openly disturbed . Julia watched her closely . " Wal , if there is a wild man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ' im . Atter all , we live up here . " Op began filing his hoe again . " We 'll finish this patch of corn and I 'll go see Ben this afternoon . I know Ben will be willin ' . Doshie and Hootbird 've got ' im worked up in a sweat . And I 'll want ' im with me . And I 'll want ye too , Alf . " " Want me ! " Alf was surprised . " You do n't want me ? I wo n't be any good ! " " It 'll make a man of ye , " Op said , as his file screaked across the hoc and Julia put her hands over her ears . " Ye might be a good un in the time of trouble . If it 's a close call , ye might make the difference . Course I do n't think we 'll find a real man . And ye ca n't shoot the speret of Ted Newsome ! " " But I never carried a gun in my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use one . " " I do n't have anythin ' but a rifle and a good huntin ' knife , " Op said . " I 'll let ye carry the knife . Ye could use a knife in close quarters , could n't ye , if we do happen to find a wild man ? " " O Lord , no ! " Alf 's eyes grew wide at the very idea .  | " But ye 've got good eyes , ai n't ye ? " Op said . " Ye can see a man hidin ' behind a tree or lurkin ' at a far piece ? Ye 've got better eyes than I 've got ! " " My eyes are good enough , " he replied , " but I wo n't carry any knife ! " " I 'll need ye anyway , " Op told him . He laid Julia 's hoe down and picked up Lucretia 's . " Old Ben is awful slow . And my eye is none too good fer long range . " " Dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucretia said , frowning . " That 's Sheriff Ackerson 's job , him and all his fancy deputies . " " Old barrel-bellied Sheriff Ackerson , " Op sighed . " Too much weight on his brier-stem legs and not enough Laurel Ridge air in his lungs . He ca n't do nothin ' . He 's just got a big name . I can do more'n Sheriff Ackerson and all his deputies put together ! " " Anyway , leave Alf here , Dad . " " Let Alf go along , " Julia said heartily . " It may be good for Alf 's nerves . " " What do you want to do , Julia ? Get me killed so you can get a pension ? " Alf said . " But , Dad , you 've got only one eye . " Lucretia was grasping at straws . " I do n't know how to hunt a man . " Alf still was n't enthusiastic . " I came here for my health . I did n't come here to use a gun , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea . " That 's just it , " Op told him . " When ye get in close quarters , ye do n't have time to think . Ye jist act ! It 'll be better fer ye than a yarb tonic . " " You wo n't find anyone , Alf , " Julia laughed . " Go with him ; the walk will do you good . " " I 'll go along and watch for you , Op , " Alf said weakly . " But I 'm a pacifist . I 'll run . " " Ye wo n't run if ye know somebody is a-goin ' to kill ye , " Op  | said . " That life of yourn is the dearest thing ye have . Wait till ye 're put to the test . Ye live in a little world in the head , Alf ! Yer skull bone 's a prison wall around yer speret . I ai n't killed nobody in my life . I never want to . But if somebody 's out to get me , my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na have a tussle . I 've thought this thing out when I hunted in the woods at night with old Jerry . " Julia spoke softly : " Do n't worry so , Alf . It will do you good . " " I said I 'd go . " Alf was disgusted . " But I 'm not carrying any knife  --  and that 's final ! " " Then we 'll hoe out the rest of the corn and I 'll go see Ben , " Op told them . " If there is a man loose in the woods , first daylight 'll be the time . He 'll be out lookin ' fer himself a young fox . That 's when all the animals and birds stir . They 're up from their beds a-huntin ' breakfast . I 'll meat-rind my old rifle tonight . It 's been a long time since I 've had it down from the joist . " 36 " Ben , this is shore the time to find strange men , " Op whispered hoarsely . " Only Laurel Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a-loafin ' on the ridge , we can find ' im this mornin ' , " Ben answered in a slow whisper . " Doshie says ? " " Never mind what old Doshie says . fist keep yer eyes open . " Op was carrying an octagon-sided , heavy-barreled twenty-two ? caliber rifle . He held the barrel with his left hand , and his right hand covered the trigger guard . Ben carried his twenty-two automatic in his right hand with his big index finger through the trigger guard . His arms were so long his hands brushed his knees as he walked . Alf was unarmed . The three men were walking slowly , cautiously , toward the 178  | arc . On their left , over the deep Sandy Valley , was a sea of muslin clouds . The Sandy River and the turnpike were hidden below . In the distance , across this sea of clouds , were the Allcorn Hills , jutting up like a long chain of green islands . Near the Laurel Ridge road , yellow poplars and pines lifted their misty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Oak Valley on their right was completely lost beneath the fluffy mass . " It 's a good time to slip right up on a man and have the gun on ' im before he knows it , " Op whispered . " A body can walk on the damp ground and his brogans wo n't make a whettin ' sound . And a man ca n't see him through the clouds this mornin ' . " " I 'm a-loin ' it fer Doshie , " Ben whispered . " Op , she 's been talkin ' about this fer days . She 's worried about Hoot . " " Yep , I 'm a-worryin ' about Hoot , too , " Op answered . He thought to himself : " I 'm a-worryin ' about havin ' him fer a son-in-law . " When they reached the flat rock about equidistant from the arc , Op stopped . " Ye go with me , Ben , " he whispered . " We 'll go down among the big rocks and do some huntin ' . Ye stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye see a man , hide behind this rock and watch which way he goes . If he 's the speret of Ted Newsome , jist walk up and shake his hand . " Alf mumbled , " I do n't know . I do n't know what 's going on . " Then he walked up on the little bank beside the flat rock where he would have a good view of Laurel Ridge toward the cabin and toward Six Hickories . Op and Ben started down the steep slope , soon disappearing from Alf 's view into the cloud . " It 's better to stay together , " Op whispered . " If we part , one of us might stumble onto the other . I might shoot ye . Ye might shoot me . " X79  | " Jist be keerful with that piece of hardware , " Ben muttered . " If it was n't fer Doshie 's a-talkin ' so much ... " They were within four feet of the first big rock before they saw it jutting up . They looked up its steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud mist that swam in the slow-moving morning wind . " He could be a-layin ' up there , " Ben said softly in Op 's ear . " He could shoot straight down at us . We could n't see the gun barrel in the cloud . " Op whispered , " It 'll look like a bull black snake in the snow . " They walked around the rock , looking up . Then they walked to another large flat-topped rock , scaled up the side , and looked on top . They went from rock to rock , looking around and on top . On the big rock by the yellow poplar , Ben picked up a handful of thirty-caliber empty cartridges . His fire-shovel hand trembled so that he could hardly show them to Op . " We 've looked about every place down here , " Ben whispered . " We ca n't find anybody . Let 's get Outten this cloud . " " I hate to leave a place till I 'm through lookin ' , " Op whispered . " But we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's strange to be a-huntin ' fer people , " Ben whispered . " It makes me nervous . Like Alf . " " Jist remember it 's fer Doshie then , " Op hissed . " I 'm remembrin ' . " Ben shook his big head and disturbed the mist . " But that wo n't help us when we run plumb against this wild man in the fog . " The two men walked up the steep slope , not more than two steps apart . When they came up through the cloud to the ridge , they were three hundred yards beyond the rock where Alf was waiting . The sun was shining over the sea of clouds , and mist was rising toward the sun . " Look at Alf , " Ben whispered hoarsely . " He wants us ! "  | Alf was motioning wildly with his hand . Op and Ben ran toward him . Drops of water ran down Op 's rifle barrel and dripped to the ground . " I was sitting right here , " Alf jabbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the cloud . I got down behind this rock where I could see . My heart come up to my mouth for I thought they would catch me behind this rock . But they did n't . They went out Laurel Ridge . And they were n't spirits ! " " What kind of lookin ' men were they ? " Ben asked , doddling his head . " Mean-looking , " Alf told him . " There 's more than one man hiding on this ridge . They were after something , too . They were whispering to one another things I could n't hear . " " Maybe they were squirrel hunters , " Ben said hopefully . The automatic shook in his huge paw . " They were n't looking for squirrels on the ground and behind trees and rocks , " Al whispered . " They would have been looking up in the trees ! " " They were down in the arc when we were there , Op , " Ben whispered in Op 's ear . " We might 've come head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they 're the men we want to find , " Op told Ben . " Let 's go atter ' em ! Let 's get ' em dead ' r alive ! " " I-gods , " Ben said . " But all the experience I 've had with this pistol is guardin ' the ballot boxes in Honeywell . " Alf 's teeth were chattering . " D-d-dewdrops were dripping from their gun barrels in the sunlight . One short man had a big mustache and dewdrops were dripping from the ends . I 've been thinking about Julia and Lutie out there in the cabin . We 'd better go back . We 'd better follow their tracks and see if they go out the ridge toward the cabin . " Op started out the ridge and Ben and Alf followed . Op bent over . " Look at these tracks . " 181  | Ben looked at them in the sand with Op . " A-goin ' right out the ridge , " Ben said . Op led the way , following the man tracks like Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Op whispered when he came to the path that turned toward Wince Leffard Gap . " Right toward my place , " Ben whispered , doddling his head excitedly . " Doshie and the little young uns there today with Hootbird gone a-huntin ' a bee tree . " " Hootbird , " Op muttered , " that yellerbelly . " They tracked the men down to the ledges of rocks . Here the tracks left the path . Examining the ground carefully , they could track the men by the broken huckleberry twigs , bent-over pea vine , and disturbed bracken . " I 'm glad they did n't go toward the shack , " Ben whispered . " My heart ai n't a-beatin ' as fast as it did . " " Doshie 'd probably scare ' em to death if they did get there , " Op said to himself . Alf looked into the mists while Ben and Op followed the tracks among the ledges on the east wall of Sulphur Spring Hollow , the largest tributary of Little White Oak . " Let 's Essen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We might hear their shoes slushin ' in the wet . " They stopped and stood still , each man controlling his breath while he listened for sounds . All was silent save the drops of water falling from the leaves as the sun 's rays penetrated the sea of white and green . " They can go faster than we can track , Ben , " Op whispered . " Ye 're too slow to ketch a stud turtle . " " They 're using good strategy , " Alf whispered , nervously . " They 're up to something . We could go back to Laurel Ridge and  --  and wait for them at the cabin . " " But they might be a-livin ' in a cliff around here someplace . " 182  | Op 's voice was low and hoarse . " While we can track , we 'd better foller . We might slip up on ' em a-layin ' on a rock a-waitin ' fer the morning sun to clear up the mists . " With Alf peering ahead through the mists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Hollow . There the tracks turned downstream . Shoes had sunk in the soft sand and tracking was easy for more than two hundred yards . Then the tracks parted , each set going in a separate direction around the slope toward Coonden Hollow . " What d'ye know about that ? " Op said in a low voice . " Doshie 's always said there 's more than one man a-combin ' these woods " ? Ben doddled his big head . " Doshie talks a lot but she 's nearly allus right . She 's a smart woman . " They decided , over Alf 's protests , to follow three separate tracks until they reached the high ridge finger that formed the east wall of Coonden Hollow . Here the tracks came together again . The three man hunters stood close in a huddle , pondering their predicament . " The clouds have cleared , " Ben said . " They 'll be able to see us now . Op was about to answer that it was true the other way ' round , too , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There they go ! See them ? " Op trained his good eye in the direction Alf was shaking in. 37 " I see the boogers , Ben , " Op whispered . " Do n't get too excited , Op , " Alf warned . " They might be deadly killers ! " " Shhhh , " Ben whispered . " Give me more time to see that my 183  | hardware is ready . " His big blunt fingers fumbled with the twenty-two . " Let 's go around this finger to the head of Coonden and be a-waitin ' fer ' em as they go over toward the wild-strawberry patch on Shinglemill , " Op suggested . Ben just shook his head . " This is a dangerous situation , " Alf stuttered . " We might be killed . This is Sheriff Ackerson 's duty ! " " If the Law ca n't get these boogers , we can , " Op bragged . " Now that I 'm shore they 're not sperets . " They moved at a faster speed , since they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low toughbutted white oaks that grew from rock crevices . When they reached the head of Coonden Hollow , they turned to their left , to a field with second-growth timber , where corn had once been planted . In this second growth of sumac , sassafras , and hickory , they were careful to tiptoe and not shake the tops of the trees which Op could have reached with his rifle barrel . Then , through holes between the trees and vines , they saw the three men coming . " Stop , " Op whispered . " Better to wait right here and have our guns ready when they turn over the rim toward Shinglemill ! " Alf , Op , and Ben stood about two paces apart . They could see the men coming up closer . " Yander they are ! " one of the strange men shouted when Ben 's doddling head shook a sassafras and made a leafy noise . " Dead ' r alive , boys ! " another shouted , as the first man raised a single-barreled shotgun to take aim . Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started firing . One bullet hit the dirt in front of him . He shot a spray of bullets from the ground straight up toward the sky . " They 're armed , " shouted one of the strange men . " Surrender and we wo n't hurt ye , " Op shouted as he held his  | rifle to his shoulder and aimed with his good eye at a man who had started for cover . Theopolis fired , missing his mark . " No surrender , " came a reply . " Let 's go after ' em . They 're armed but they ca n't shoot . " They charged into the second growth in the direction of the three man hunters . Ben 's big hand was shaking until he could n't get it into his pocket to get more cartridges . " Let 's go , " Ben shouted as he turned and started running . He ran through the brush like a big horse . " Stay under the brush , man , " Op shouted . Op fired twice in the general direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dangerous criminals , " Op grunted as he ran through the brush , following Ben and Alf . Behind them guns set up an awful racket . Shotgun pellets sprayed the air above them and fell like drops of hard rain onto the sassafras leaves . Two pellets stung Op 's neck . " Go fer the rocks , " Op shouted . Then a rifle bullet sang near Op 's ear . Op went to his knees , rose again , and ran faster than ever . " Yander they go , " shouted a voice from behind . " Get ' em ! " " Halt before we kill ye ! " " They 're still a-runnin ' ! " Shotgun pellets and rifle bullets spatted the green leaves and the bushes . One pellet stung Ben 's shoulder . Then Alf and Ben left the old field for the rocks on the east wall of Coonden Hollow , almost the way they had come . Op was only two steps behind when they reached the protection of the rocks . A rifle bullet hit the first rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get behind a rock , " Op said . " No time to reload , " Ben said . " Let 's keep goin ' . " X85  | They dodged behind the rocks with the men in hot pursuit . Op , while still on the run , loaded a cartridge in his rifle and fired once back over his shoulder . He thought he heard a man yell but he was getting his breath too hard and fast to be sure . Ben was getting his breath like a wheel oxen drawing a heavy log . Alf was in the lead screaming as he went over the finger of the ridge between Coonden and Sulphur Spring Hollow . Here Alf turned up the hill and Ben and Op followed . " Keerful , men , " someone shouted below . " Did he hit ye , Fatus ? " " Grazed me with that last bullet . " " They 're a-trackin ' us , " Op grunted . " And we were trackin ' them a while ago , " Ben wailed . " Yander they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get ' em ! Come on ! " The man aimed and fired , and the bullet marked a tree beside Alf . Ben emptied his pistol wildly in the direction of the men . He did n't take aim and his hand was shaking so he could hardly hold on . " Let 's take our stand , " Op shouted . " Criminals ! " " That big un , " one shouted , and a rifle barked . " On the hip , " Ben screamed as he went to the ground . Op got behind a white oak as the bullets whizzed by . Alf jumped behind a rock and started digging a hole in the ground with his hands . " Keep ' em kivvered , " said the men coming down the hill with their guns pointed . " Up with yer hands , big man ! " Ben lay on the ground with both hands up . " Drop that rifle from behind that tree ! We got ye ! " Op dropped the rifle . " Feller , come out from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Op said with a trembling voice . " Come out from behind that tree in the name of the Law ! " " What law ? " Op asked , stepping out . " Jake Ratcliffe 's law ! " " Op Akers ! Is that ye ? " " Jake Ratcliffe , " Thcopolis said , " what are ye a-doin ' atter us ? Fatus Sloane ! And there 's Tiny Timberlake . " " Well , what are ye a-doin ' shootin ' at us ? " Jake asked Theopolis . " Thought ye 's the men a-hangin ' out on Laurel Ridge ! I 'd like to ask ye the same question , " Op said . " Jake fetched us here to clean this ridge , " Fatus Sloane said . " Ye hit old Ben , " Op grunted . " Are ye hurt , Ben ? " Fatus leaned over Ben where he lay on his side holding to his bottom . " That bullet had a lot of smoke on it ! " Ben grunted . " Creased my rind good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiny Timberlake , the short , broad-shouldered man with the mustache . " Alf Pruitt , " Op answered . Tiny walked over behind the rock and found Alf lying face down in a little hole he had scooped out with his hands . His entire body was shaking like a white oak leaf in the January wind . " What 's the matter , man ? " Tiny asked . " It 's all a mistake ! We ai n't a-goin ' to hurt ye . " Alf did n't answer but lay with his face against the ground , shaking . " Alf 's a little nervous ! " Op said . " He 's plenty nervous if ye ask me . " Tiny stood over Alf 's body watching it quiver . Fatus and Op helped Ben to his feet . There was a hole across 187  | the seat of Ben Hammertight 's tight-fitting overalls . The hole was about six inches long and looked as if it had been cut with a pair of dull scissors . There was a red mark across his flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ye can walk , Ben , " Fatus said . Ben took a step and then another . " I 'm all right , " he said . " It 's just skin deep . " Fatus bent over , looking close . " Who give ye a warrant to arrest us ? " Ben asked . " Jake Ratcliffe brought us to arrest the wild men yer wife has been a-seein ' on this ridge . " " Show me the warrants , " Ben said . " I did n't put the warrants in writin ' , " Jake explained . " I looked into my lawbook and I said : Let 's go fetch ' em fellers , dead ' r alive . Let 's bring ' em in to justice . ' That 's good as a warrant . " " But , Jake , ye ca n't read , " Op said . " Ye ca n't read any more'n I can . I 've known ye all my life . " " But it 's in my lawbook , " Jake said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I feel like goin ' before the Grand Jury and indictin ' ye , " Ben said . " A-comin ' in here from the other side of Sandy River on Snake Blue 's premises and a-shootin ' me . " " But this Laurel Ridge is in my district , " Jake said . " To hell with yer district , " Ben said , shaking with anger . " If I knowed the man amongst ye that fired the shot that hit me , I 'd choke his infernal gizzard out . " " Where 's yer warrants ? " Jake Ratcliffe asked Ben . " Ye 're out here with a pistol man huntin ' , too . " " Quit yer gassin ' and come over here and give me some help , " Tiny Timberlake said . " I ca n't do it by myself . " Op walked over and took Alf by one arm and Tiny got him by the other . They lifted his face from the hole . Dirt was in his  | eyes and mouth . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassy eyes stared into space . Op pulled his bandanna from his pocket and wiped Alf 's face while Tiny held him in a standing position . " Ye 're not hurt , Ben ; quit complainin ' , " Tiny said . " Here 's the man that 's gone to pieces , ' r somethin ' . " Fatus Sloane ran to the little stream below and dipped his hat full of water and poured it on Alf 's face . Alf blinked his eyes and slowly looked around . " What happened ? " he asked . " Where was I hit ? " " Ye 're not hit , Alf , " Op told him . " We 've made a mistake . The men we were atter are huntin ' fer the same men we 're huntin ' . And we started to hunt one another . Jake here , is justice of Peace of the Tenth District . He fetched Fatus and Tiny to Laurel Ridge to hunt the same man we were atter . " Alf shook himself and blinked his eyes . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wiped his eyes again . " Everything turned black . " Alf sighed heavily . " I do n't remember what happened . " " We 're lucky somebody was n't kilt , " Op said . " Best thing is to ferget the whole affair . " " Somebody come nigh as a pea gettin ' me , " Fatus said . " Look where this bullet grazed my cheek . " There was a long red mark across Fatus 's cheek and under his ear . " That 's how close I come to the call when we left the old field and went into the rocks . " " I fired that one over my shoulder without aim . " Op chuckled . " Ben , " said Fatus Sloane , a tall bean pole of a man with a sharp hatchet face , " if ye go before the Grand Jury and indict us fer man huntin ' without warrants , we can go before the Grand Jury and indict you , too . All of us might get fined ' r sentenced to jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us . " " Best thing fer all is to go home and ferget it , " Op repeated . 189  | " A thing like this is hard to ferget , " Ben told them . " I 'm a-goin ' to remember every time I sit down . " He twisted his big neck and looked down under his arm at the long red spot and the big rip in his overalls . 38 " Did you see anybody ? " Lucretia met Op and Alf on the cabin porch . " Yep , we shore did . " Op dropped into a chair . " Wrong people , though . " Lucretia looked relieved . " We thought we had the right men , " Alf said . " We trailed them for miles , then they tried to take us . " " What do ye mean tried ' ? They did take us . " Julia looked bewildered . " This gets more fascinating by the minute . " " Jake Ratcliffe and his men got us , " Op grunted . " They thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thought they were . So we met in the woods and shot at one another . " Lucretia burst into laughter . Julia turned her face away from Alf . " It 's not a laughin ' matter , " Op said . " It 's a dangerous thing . " " Not anybody hurt , though ? " Lucretia asked . " Ben went around the ridge with a six-inch scratch on his rind , " Op said . Julia reached over and took her husband 's hand . Alf looked as if he might be about to breathe his last . " Alf went to pieces durin ' the battle and dug a hole and put his face in it , " Op said . " Poor Alf , " Julia said . " And I encouraged you to go . " " Encouraged me ? You practically insisted on it . "  | " I 'm proud of you anyway , Alf , " she told him . " All wimmen love a hero , Alf , " Op grunted . " Not that ye was a-lookin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hole . " " Doshie will have something to talk about now " ? Lucretia changed the subject quickly ? " with Ben shot and everything . " " Doshie , " Op said , as if the word did n't taste very good . " Doshie 's been packin ' ' er lies to old Jake Ratcliffe and he 's anxious to do somethin ' big so the voters in Looten County 'll hear about ' im . He wants to run fer High Sheriff next time , since Sheriff Bill Ackerson ca n't run again . Jake plans to run against Sop Johnson . But he 'll never get my vote . I 'll vote agin him a dozen times . " " Dad , why blame it on Jake Ratcliffe ? " Lucretia asked . " Both parties made a mistake , seems to me . " " I 'm tellin ' ye the truth , " Op sputtered . " That 's why old Jake deputized men and brought ' em in here . He 's got big idears . He 'd love to wear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'll walk the ridges and up the hollers and work agin ' im . " " Why ca n't a sheriff succeed himself in Kentucky ? " Julia asked . " One time in office is enough fer most of ' em , " Op replied . " They make enough money to last ' em the rest of their lives . Yell never see one of the boogers a-sellin ' possum hides , diggin ' ginseng roots , and a-pickin ' berries atter he 's been sheriff . I know what I 'm talkin ' about . " Alf stirred himself slightly . " You mean the sheriff gets good pay here ? " Op laughed . " There 's more than one way a sheriff can get it . Protectin ' moonshiners , fer instance . Yep , old Jake wants to be sheriff , so he come in here with deputized men to make a name fer himself ! And that little puff of hot wind , Doshie , started the whole thing . " 191  | " There I agree , Dad , " Lucretia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " There 's no wild man on this ridge , " Op said . " I 'm convinced of it now ! I feel like a-goin ' before the next Grand Jury and indictin ' Doshie fer lyin ' . Her long tongue got old Ben a nice red stripe across the butt ! " " Are you tired , darling ? " Julia asked Alf . He was sitting slumped down in his chair . " You 're not so nervous as you were ! " " I 'm too tired to be nervous . " Alf laughed weakly . " Maybe that 's a cure . " Op was not to be outdone . " I 'm as tired as a red fox atter it 's circled this ridge all night and up till ten the next mornin ' , " he said . " And my stummick is empty as a gourd . I want to eat till I push my belly from my backbone . " 39 " I 'm only a-tellin ' you what Little Johnnie Blue told Pap and me about Esmerelda Sutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch . It was noon and they were resting . " There 's not a doubt in my mind she was a witch . And she was the last witch I ever heard tell of around here . Little Johnnie Blue told it like this : There was about fifteen hounds atter the fox . He was a big old red fox , almost the size of a new-born calf . He had a red body and a big bushy tail with a white tip . The old fox was jist a few yards ahead of the hounds . He was barely a-gettin ' over the rocks and logs atter the hounds had run ' im about seventeen hours . And the hounds did n't put their noses to the ground to trail ' im , they were too close . They held their noses in the wind 192  | and were ready to close in fer the kill . Sweeter Barnhill , Jimmy Overton , Hester Cremeans , and Johnnie Blue were standin ' in Pawpaw Gap ready to see the hounds finish the fox . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' happened . All of the hounds changed into foxes and the tired old fox was turned into a hound . And the foxes turned tail and fled in all directions . There were so many of ' em the big old tired hound did n't know which one to take atter . But he singled out a fox and got his revenge ! " Lucretia and Julia smiled . Alf put his hands to his sides and groaned with pain . " What 's the matter , Alf ? " Op asked him . " I 'm sore as a boil all over from the chase yesterday , " he replied . " I ca n't even move my body without hurting . " " Ye should 've chopped wood this morning and got that soreness outten ye , " Op said . " Chopped wood ! " Alf groaned again . " Op , tell us why Esmerelda Sutton turned the hounds into foxes and the fox into a hound , " Julia said . " Why would she do a thing like that ? " " Meanness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue said him and the boys looked down from Pawpaw Gap and saw ' er comin ' up the road when the hounds were close on the fox . Said she stopped in the middle of the road and said : What are we a-goin ' to do about it , little brown mouse ? Little brown mouse , that fox is tired . The hounds are goin ' to ketch ' im . Are ye a-goin ' to let ' em do it , little brown mouse ? ' And she looked at the fox before she started talkin ' agin , so Little Johnnie told us . Then Esmerelda said : I 'm glad ye feel that way , little brown mouse . I 'm glad ye want the change made . We 'll change ' em . ' And that 's how Little Johnnie said it happened . When she started walkin ' up the road toward ' em , the men took off in all directions .  | Everybody on Laurel Ridge was afraid of Esmerelda Sutton and that little brown mouse she talked to which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alf repeated . " What nonsense ! " " Nonsense ? Why , ye ai n't heard all yet . Poor old Jake Miller bought a cow from Esmerelda . He was n't married and Esmerelda was n't either . She was in love with poor old Jake , so ' t was said , and atter Jake bought the cow she had ' im down in the hog pen rootin ' with his nose like a hog . And she had the hogs walkin ' around on their hind feet laughin ' . Later , when the boys went out to fox-hunt and Jake was with ' em , he tried to stand on his head on the stopper in a whisky jug . Everybody thought Jake was drunk and they laughed at the crazy things he did that night . But he was under the spell . He stayed under it till he took the picture of Esmerelda she 'd given ' im up to the Freewill Baptist Graveyard and put a silver bullet through it jist as the mornin ' sun was risin ' up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in her hands . " That 's the wildest one yet , Op " " There was never a woman in these parts like Esmerelda Sutton , " Op continued . " She was tall and slender . As purty as a green-leafed willow in the early-spring wind . Men fell fer ' er and when they give ' er kisses she put ' em under the spell . Before she could bewitch ' em they had to give somethin ' to ' er or she had to give somethin ' to ' cm . And she was always talkin ' to that little brown mouse nobody ever saw . ' Cause of ' er , I remember how my Pap was afeared of mice , especially if it was a brown wood mouse . Pap got so he 'd run every time he saw one . Esmerelda had this whole country under the spell . " " Look , Dad , I see somebody coming from the green tunnel . " Lucretia pointed . Op stopped talking . He trained his good eye on the ridge road toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alf said as he watched him walk toward the cabin . " He 's got a pole across his shoulder , " Julia said . " He must be going fishing . But where is the water up here ? " " Who is it , Dad ? " Lucretia asked . " That 's not Ted Newsome , is it ? " Op asked her . " No , it 's not Ted . " " Wait till he gets a little closer , " Op said . Then his voice rose with excitement . " Honest , I believe it 's Jack . It is Jack ! It 's Jack ! " Op ran from the porch to meet him . 40 " Hi , Op , " said the young man . He was a big muscular boy and broad shouldered , maybe in his middle twenties . His eyes were long and narrow and he had a low forehead . Jack dropped the pole from over his shoulder . It had a net on the tip end of it and a bag of clothes tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Jack ? " Op shook Jack 's big hand and patted him on the shoulder . " I 've been to Iowa , Op , " he said . " I 've been a-livin ' with Fred and Kate Schultz on a farm near Creston . I 've had a good place to stay , Op , with a good bed in the granary and plenty to eat and a big team of hosses to drive . But I 've missed Laurel Ridge and ye , Op . I 've wanted to get back and ketch butterflies in Shinglemill Holler . " " I 've missed ye , Jack , " Op said . " But ye know yer old Run-around Jack always makes it back , " Jack said , grinning . " He allus gets back to the butterflies before the spring and summer 're over ! Ye still love me , do n't ye , Op ? "  | " Yes , I love ye , Jack . " Op looked as if he might burst out crying . " I like to be loved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stood on the porch , gaping . " Who are all these people ye got around ye , Op ? Who is this purty woman ? Are ye married to ' er ? " " Nope , I 'm not married agin , " Op answered . " Only one wife in this world and one speret in the next fer me . This is Lutie , who says she 's yer sister . " " My sister ! " Jack was surprised . " I did n't know I had a sister . " " I am your sister , Jack . " Jack said just one word ? " Purty . " " I 've heard about you for years , Jack , " Lucretia said . " But I never heard anything about ye . Why did n't ye tell me I had a sister , Op ? " " Oh , I did n't see any use of that . " Op looked down at his old brogans . " I raised ye , and yer Uncle Will and Aunt Corrinne Day had Lutie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bitterness came into his voice . " If Op had raised ye and me together , I wouldn't 've been lonesome all the time , " Jack said to Lucretia . " I wouldn't 've played so much with the butterflies , frogs , and baby-handed moles . I had plenty of playmates during the spring and summer up till late fall . " His low forehead came down in a frown . " Had only Op and the dog in the winter . " " jack , we 've eaten , but I 'll run and fix you some dinner , " Lucretia said . " I want you to meet your cousins ! " " Gee , I got a lot of kinfolks . " Jack smiled again . Op picked up Jack 's pole with his turkey of clothes and net . IIe followed Jack and Lucretia onto the porch . " This is Julia Pruitt , " Lucretia said . " And this is Alf . They 're your cousins and they 've come from Dayton. " 196  | Alf stared dumfounded from Jack 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julia mumbled her " hello . " " I 've been through that town , " Jack said . " I did n't know I had kinfolks there . If I had , I 'd a-stopped and stayed awhile with ye ! " Alf glanced nervously toward Julia . " This is yer home , Jack , " Op said , almost angrily . " Yer home is here on Laurel Ridge with me . Ye 're allus welcome here ! " " But come lonesome wintertimes when the leaves fall and the ridge gets dark and cold I haf to go , " Jack said . " I remember the winters here and the snow in big drifts and Op a-wadin ' through ' em up around his knees with an ax across his shoulder a-breakin ' a path and me a-followin ' . I do n't like the lonesome winters here without somebody to play with . Summer , spring , and early fail are all right . But never a winter here agin fer Jack . " He turned to Lucretia . " That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named me Run-around Jack . " He turned to Op . " Can ye keep yer Run-around Jack , Op ? In the cabin ? Have ye got too many ? " " Julia and I live over in the smokehouse , jack " ? Alf found his tongue . " We do n't live in the cabin . " Op picked up the butterfly net and started inside with it . He smiled . Run-around Jack was home . " Do n't bother the pole , Op , " Jack told him . " I 'm a-goin ' in a few minutes to Shinglemill . I ca n't wait to get back down there and see every bloom and butterfly . " " Rest awhile , jack , " Op said . " Stay and let 's talk . The butterflies 'll keep . " " I 'm not tired , " he told Op . " I 've been on a bus from Creston to Honeywell and I feel cramped . Like old Mike and Kate , my team out there in Iowa , when a rainy spell hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer two weeks . I 've just got to go ! " 197  | Jack stepped down from the porch and got the pole Theopolis had leaned against the cabin wall . " Go see my friends , " he said . " When will ye be back , Jack ? " " About sundown. " 41 " There 's a purty one , " Jack shouted . He took off running with his net high in the wind above him . He held the pole with one hand and kept his eyes on a black butterfly that had red dots on its wings . It was fluttering in the bright wind high over Jack 's head . " Purty thing ! " Jack leaped high into the wind and swung his net like a baseball bat . The net opened and the butterfly was caught in its center . When Jack came back to earth , he relaxed his net and it closed behind the butterfly . " I 've got ye , purty thing , " he said softly . Lucretia , Alf , and Julia watched in amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want ye to get lonesome . " " Will he kill them ? " Julia asked Op . " Nope , he wo n't kill anythin ' , " Op said . " He 'll leave ' em in the net until he 's through runnin ' and playin ' and then he 'll turn ' em all loose . He jist likes to ketch ' em . He started playin ' with the butterflies when he was big enough to walk and he 's been a-doin ' it ever since . I made ' im a little net when he was about five years old . Later I showed him how to make one . Now jack makes his own nets from regular twine . He allus keeps a supply ahead . " " It 's strange he 'd catch them just for the fun of it , " Lucretia 198  | said . " I know a lot of people who catch them and make displays under glass . " " Jack could n't stand to see a butterfly under glass , " Op said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break his neck with a mattock handle , Jack would run away like a wild turkey . Jack ca n't kill , he 's too gentle . He 's got the mind and the heart of a child . A happy child , too . " Jack leaped a cluster of saw brier swinging his net far over to his left side . He scooped down low and came up with a goldencolored butterfly . They could hear his laugh at the cabin . They watched him from the porch until he turned the bend in the ridge road and was out of sight . " Jack 's a-havin ' the time of his life now , " Op went on . " He 'll run over this ridge and comb the deep hollers on both sides . All of this land is his home . He 'll hep me some , but mostly he 'll ketch butterflies all summer and atter the first frosts he 'll take off to a new place in the West . He 'll go there and work fer the winter . Jack loves big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do with the money he earns ? " Alf asked . " Jack never thinks about money , " Op answered quickly . " He never was ust to money , never had it to play with like a lot of young uns a-growin ' up . And he did n't have any place to spend it . He played with pet birds , squirrels , coons , and ground hogs . Jack 's had every kind of animal and bird that was not too full of wild nature to be tamed . He 's even petted possums as much as they could be petted . But he never had money . And he works fer whatever a farmer will pay him . He works enough to buy his clothes and shoes , twine fer his nets , and bus tickets to travel over the country . He never has any money when he gets home and I give him a little when he leaves . " They could still hear Jack 's happy voice in Shinglemill Hollow . Op closed his eyes and listened a moment , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a tired fox on a clear summer night . " He 's a-travelin ' fast , " Op said . " He 'll go down into Shinglemill Holler where the shoe-makes , persimmons , and daisies are in bloom .

" " There would n't be any place in Dayton for Jack , " Julia said . " Do n't worry , Julia , I never want ' im to go to Dayton , " Op said . " That 's why I 've never told ' im about his sister . People with city ways would n't understand Jack . They might even lock ' im up in jail . Here on Laurel Ridge , Jack has his freedom . Here up near the sky is the best home Jack can ever have . People understand him up here . They know he would n't harm even  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad to hear you say he 's not dangerous , " Alf said , getting up from his chair . He stretched his arms above his head , and then bent over experimentally . " Oh , oh , my poor sore body ! " he cried . " I 'll get ye a cure for that soreness , " Op said . He seemed glad to be able to switch the subject from Run-around Jack . " Pokeberry root . We 'll bile her up and put the juice to you . It 'll smart ye shore , but it 'll fetch the soreness from yer body . " 42 The sun had gone down beyond the Allcorn Hills . There was a red patch of sky like where Op had burned a brush pile and the night wind had fanned the embers to a bright glowing red on the breast of the dark earth .

" I was a-swingin ' my net atter a butterfly on the north wall of Shinglemill when I come face to face with a man as big as I am , " Jack said excitedly , dropping down on the edge of the porch and letting his feet hang over . " He had a rifle in his hand . And I stopped all of a sudden . I said , Who are you ? ' Do n't ye know me ? ' he ast . And I said : Nope , I do n't know ye .

" " Op , my legs got awful weak , " Jack continued . " My strong legs give down under me and my body shook like a shoe-make leaf in the wind . Fer a minute I could n't speak .

' " That 's right , Jack , ' Ted said , and then he laughed like he did n't pay it no minds now . If yell step a little closer and look hard , I 'll show ye a spot right betwixt my eyes . I 'll show ye the price I paid fer love . ' And I said : No , Ted Newsome , I wo n't come that close fer I feel a weakness in my body and a little faint . I 'd rather stay right where I am and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love , but Lucinda Dortch has gone to her long home too , ' Ted said . She , too , sleeps at the Freewill Baptist Graveyard but I have never seen her speret . She has gone to a different place . We are not in the same world , Jack , and it is just as well that way . Because I have found my love ! ' " Who is yer love now ? ' I ast him . And he said : Lutie Akers , yer beautiful sister , Jack ! And ye go back to the cabin and tell  | ' er I said that I love ' er so much my heart aches fer her . ' That 's what he said to me , Lutie , honest he did ! " Jack was so excited the foamy spittle flew from his mouth faster than milkweed furze drifting from an opened pod on an August wind . " And I started back right then . And Ted said : jack , wait a minute . I want to send more word to the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial to him , too . Tell ' im I know that he is my friend and that I will see him face to face someday . But not now ! ' " " I told ye , Lutie , " Op said in a positive tone . " I 've been tellin ' ye Ted Newsome was a speret ! Now will ye believe me ? It wo n't be long till I 'll see Ted Newsome face to face . And I 've got a lot of questions to ask ' im about some of the old-timers I 've had my doubts about . They talked outten two sides of the mouth and I thought they were hypocrites . I 'll find out from Ted if they 're numbered with the blest ! And ye , Lutie , thought Ted was a real flesh-and-blood man ! " " Op , that was n't the all of it , " Jack broke in eagerly . " Ted Newsome told me so much I ca n't remember it all . But I 'll never ferget the way he shook the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked and made me feel better . I said to ' im : Ted , why is yer hair so long ? ' And he said : I 've not had my hair cut in a long , long time . Ye do n't expect a speret to go to a barbershop and sit in a chair and have his hair cut , do ye ? That 'd skeer the wits outten the barber . ' " Then I asked him : Ted , did they bury ye in boots and ridin ' pants ? Did n't they put a nice suit of clothes on ye that fastened up and down the back and a collar and tie when ye left this world ? ' And he said , after he 'd finished laughin ' : Yep , they buried me that way but I 've got to keep my best for the company of sperets on Laurel Ridge . We meet and have parties . Once we had supper together in yer cabin until Op came in from possum 203  | huntin ' and opened the door right easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' at Op 's table . That night I was a-partyin ' with the ore diggers and the lumberjacks . I got awful mad at Op over disturbin ' us . Ast Op if he remembers ? Tell ' im I said fer ' im never to do that agin . ' " " Remember ! " Op repeated . " I hope to tell ye I remember that very night . I'Il never ferget . Ye tried to laugh about it , Lutie . Now , ye see ! I 'll never break in on ' em when they 're a-havin ' another party in my cabin . I 'll let ' em have a dozen parties here if they want to . " " What else did he say , jack ? " Lucretia asked . " He said : I do n't like the Hammertights . I do n't like Doshie . She will never reach the land of the blest . She stirs up too much trouble with her long lizard tongue . She has people huntin ' fer me . As long as she keeps runnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be trouble ! Doshie 's a busybody ! ' " " What did I tell ye ? " Theopolis said , pointing a big index finger at Lutie . " Ye ca n't say I 've not warned ye about the Hammertights ! I 've warned ye about that Hootbird , too ! " " Ted said somethin ' about Hootbird . " Jack talked faster than the wind in the Laurel Ridge pines . " He said : That Hootbird is a sneak . Fox hunters had better keep an eye on Hootbird . He 's a good shot with a rifle ! ' " " So it is Hootbird ! " Op shouted . " I hope they ketch that little striped-tail snake . He 's the young man a-shootin ' the foxes . And he lays it off onto a stranger , a wild man a-livin ' in the cliffs . He 's caused Jake Ratcliffe to come in here with deputized men and bust old Ben 's rind with a bullet till he has to stand up to eat and he has to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pea a-gettin ' old Ben killed . It 's that Hootbird a-causin ' about as much trouble as his long - tongue mother . "  | Run-around Jack was concentrating hard , trying to remember more . " Ted said to me : Jack , come back and see me . Let 's ye and me be friends . ' And I said : Where can I find ye , Ted ? ' And he said to me with a big smile on his sun-tanned face : I will come to ye , Jack . But if ye bring anybody with ye , I wo n't appear . If ye come alone , I 'll swoop down from the skies . Yell never know when and where I 'll come . But I 'll appear to ye , Jack . ' And long atter the sun had set in Shinglemill and I told Ted I 'd promised Op to be home by sundown , he said to me : Tell yer sister , Lutie , I love her . Tell ' er I 'd love to see ' er . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started laughin ' agin , that I 'm a-gettin ' awful tired of wild meat and wild berries . Tell ' er I 'd like to have a nice basket of table grub . ' " " Did he say that , Jack ? " Op asked , his expression one of pure wonderment . " But sperets ai n't supposed really to eat . " " Honest he said it , Op , " Jack replied . " And I said : If Lutie 'll fix it , Ted , I 'll fetch it to ye ! ' And he said : That 's a good boy . But remember not to bring anybody with ye . If ye do , yell haf to carry the basket of grub back or eat it yerself . Yell not see Ted Newsome , the good speret on Laurel Ridge . ' " Theopolis and Lucretia both stared at Jack in a kind of enchantment . " And I said to Ted : I did n't know sperets had need of grub to nourish their bodies atter the body temple had been sleepin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " And he answered me right quick . He said : If a speret roves over the ground plane he gets mighty hungry . ' I did n't know what he meant by ground plane ' and I did n't ast him . I knew ye 'd be out a-lookin ' fer me , Op , and I said : Good speret , Ted Newsome , do n't hold me any longer . I 've got to get back to the cabin . ' He laughed out loud and the wind blew his long blond hair : I wo n't hold ye any longer , Jack . Go back to yer father and yer sister . I know ye 've 205  | been away a long time . But come agin ! ' And when he said these words I took off a-runnin ' like a gray lizard over a hot rock atter a June bug ! " " Poor Ted , if he 's on the ground plane , " Op said , shaking his head sadly , " he 's never reached the land of the blest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , the next and final step is the land of the blest . " " In the morning , Jack , I 'll fix breakfast for Ted Newsome , " Lucretia said , " if you 'll take it to him . " " I shore will , Lutie , " Jack said . " I like Ted Newsome . I 'll be a-wantin ' to see ' im every day I 'm thinkin ' . " 43 A day later , because Alf still had aches and pains from the fish shoot , Op took him on a root walk in the woods looking for natural remedies . " Look at the flowering shrubs , " Alf marveled , walking up a steep slope where lichen rocks as small as his head to the size of his smokehouse lay in disheveled piles . " These are beautiful blossoms ! " Alf pulled a flower from a cluster that grew from the crevice of a rock and held it close to sniff the fragrance . " Ye know what it is ? " Op asked . " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pizen ivy . Not much of it left around here . A body has to hunt to find it . Little Johnnie Blue and his son Snake tried to dig it all up a long time ago . It will pizen livestock . They wanted to make their side of Laurel Ridge a range fer cattle and sheep . But they could n't get rid of the pizen ivy . I remember a lot of dead cattle and sheep and even a few hosses a-rottin ' under these trees , pizened  | by this here mountain laurel . When the wind blew , a body had to hold his nose ! " " Was Laurel Ridge named for this ? " " That 's right . Alf , ye 're a-pickin ' up , ye 're a-showin ' a little sense . " So beautiful and yet it 's poison . " Alf stared at the flower . " Why would the good Lord create a blossom so perfect and then fill it with poison ? Only good to look at and stay away from . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Op said . " Every weed , flower , or plant was put here fer a purpose . The mountain laurel has the purtiest blooms I 've ever seen on any wild shrub that grows among these cliffs , hills , and hollers . And it 's good medicine too . I remember when I 's a young sprout . . . " Alf recognized the story-telling tone creeping into Op 's voice . He relaxed against the hillside , his face up to the sun . .. back when old Al Webb ust to buy the plug bosses at the jockey ground fer a dollar or two apiece and bring ' em out here and kill ' em and skin ' em fer their hides . That 's the way Al made a livin ' . All the fox hunters kicked on it fer their hounds got so fat on ' em they did n't have wind to run the foxes . Pap kicked on it , too . The smell from the hosses , when the wind blowed toward our shack , nearly run us from Little White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hosses . Our three hundred chickens that we ust to get eggs from and trade fer groceries went out into the woods a purty piece , too . They had to have a big range to get enough worms , insects , and berries . But they got somethin ' else . They got maggots . And a devilish maggot wo n't die like a worm when a chicken swallers one . He works his way right through a chicken 's craw . ' When our big flock of chickens got maggots , they died in piles . I remember how Adger and me dug holes and toted ' em still a-kickin ' and dropped ' em in . They 'd have the limber neck , stagger , and fall over . Their 207  | red combs and wattles would turn blue . They 'd gasp a few times and that would be the end . " I remember Ma said to Pap atter we 'd lost half our flock : ' We got to find a way to save ' em . " I 'd like to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But Ma could n't rest easy until she figured a way to save her hens . Ye see , we traded them eggs fer things we needed at the store . If pizen ivy will kill cattle and sheep , it 'll kill maggots , ' Ma said . Go find and fetch me some , Little Op . " It will kill the chickens , too , ' Pap objected . If it 'll kill a vow , a buck , a boss ' r a cow , ye know it 'll kill a thing little as a chicken . ' They 're all a-goin ' to die anyway , ' Ma said . It ca n't be no worse . Better to finish them in a hurry and get ' em outten their misery . ' " " What reminded you of this story , Op ? " Alf shook his head . " So I come right up here where we 're a-standin ' now " ? Op paid All no attention ? " and I broke me an armload of pizen-ivy limbs with green pods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em back down home a-runnin ' . Ma biled ' em until the water was thick and green . It takes pizen to kill a thing like a maggot , ' she said . We 've lost a dozen more purty hens while ye was gone atter the ivy , Little Op . ' So we ketched the chickens , and Pap opened their mouths and Ma poured the juice down ' em . Some of the hens were easy to ketch . They were a-staggerin ' half dead and their heads were a-turnin ' blue . Well , that juice cooked the maggots soon as it teched one . We went to the places where the chickens got the maggots and cleaned them up too . We poured the pizen-ivy sirrup over ' em . And Ma used the sirrup on young chickens atter that . When they got the roup , instead of takin ' a broomstraw like she had done to punch the worm from one 's throat , she used the pizen-ivy sirrup . Atter we 'd discovered this here remedy , Pap run onto Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirrup . Al did n't  | bring another hoss out here to skin . We never knew where he took his hosses atter that . But we do know we found a remedy fer sick chickens . " Alf was enjoying the sun and when Op 's chattering voice stopped , he sought to start it again , a task which never proved very difficult . " You know about every kind of weed that grows , do n't you , Op ? " " Ye 're wrong , Alf "  --  Op took the bait . " I wish I did . I 'd be the greatest doctor in the world . Nope , I have only a few of the answers . I could n't Tarn ' em all in my lifetime . " He stopped to mop his dark , creased brow with his red bandanna . " There 's a little weed I 'd love to know , fer instance . If I could find that weed , I 'd have the answer to the copperhead bite . I 'd be able to do away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's a young man , had the answer if he 'd only thought of it at the time . He watched a copperhead a-fightin ' with a black snake . Pap said they were quiled up with only about two feet betwixt ' em . Said they put their heads up like a couple of fightin ' roosters and let each other have it with their fangs . Said he never saw siclha fightin ' in his life . The black snake would fight awhile and then he 'd slide away and get a bite of a weed and chew it . Then he 'd come back to the copperhead because a copperhead wo n't run from a snake or any other animal . When the snakes were fightin ' , Pap went over and pulled up the weed and threw it away jist to see what would happen . When the black snake went back to get a bite of his weed , it was gone . He raced around in little circles a-huntin ' fer it , so Pap said . When he could n't find his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black , shinin ' body began witherin ' right there on the ground . He crumpled himself up and died right there and the ants started workin ' on his eyes . Pap said that was one mistake he 'd made in his life . He never could get over not a-lookin ' at 209
