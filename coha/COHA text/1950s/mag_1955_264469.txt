Shanghai is the biggest city a Communist regime has ever tried to digest . It has also proved the most indigestible . Tough , resilient , raised on the vigorous traditions of free enterprise , Shanghailanders made little effort to conceal their contempt when Mao Tse-tung 's troops entered in 1949 , chuckled with sophisticated delight at such jokes as the story of a young officer fresh from the caves of Yenan who washed the dust from his rice ration in a hotel toilet bowl . " Just wait and see , " went a confident Shanghai refrain . " We 'll change the Communists . " <P> The Communists did all the changing . In 1952 and 1953 , Shanghai bore the brunt of Peking 's bloody campaigns against " capitalists and counter-revolutionaries . " The city 's dog track was converted into an auditorium , its Great World gambling hall into a theater , its race course into a parade ground . Still Shanghai persisted in being a problem city . Its " teeming slums gave refuge to a steady flow of anti-Communists and criminals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they attracted hundreds of thousands who came from the starving hinterland in hopes of livelihood , thereby increasing unemployment , crime and supply problems . The city 's population rose from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 in six years . <P> Abnormally Developed . Under their Five Year Plan , the Communists proclaimed that industry must be shifted from the old seaboard cities to new centers in the interior . One of the first moves : transplant Shanghai 's textile mills , heart of the city 's industry , to cotton-growing areas . Last spring came an even stiffer edict . " It is absolutely necessary to reduce the population , " decreed the city 's Communist People 's Congress . The reported goal : 50% . Explained the newspaper Sin Wen Daily : " Shanghai was abnormally developed ... for the benefit of imperialism , bureaucratic capital and feudalism . " <P> A big " back-to-the-village " drive swept over Shanghai . " Volunteer " migrants were picked up by the government , persuaded when possible by a saturation propaganda campaign , more often forced to leave by such devices as canceled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April and last month , 500,000 peasants were sent back to their villages . In one month , 35,000 pedicab and rickshaw men " volunteered " to migrate to northern Kiangsu ; in one day 4,000 sampan dwellers left for inland cities . The government press reported proudly that 80% of the city 's university students and flocks of physicians were begging for frontier jobs . <P> Altogether , according to the Communists ' own figures , nearly 1,000,000 were bulldozed out of the city . But recently-apparently at the end of August-the pressure suddenly lifted , and the drive came to a temporary halt . Last week in Hong Kong , three Belgian priests who had left Shanghai a few days previously , reported that the drive " has met so much opposition , created so many difficulties " that it is at a " virtual standstill .
