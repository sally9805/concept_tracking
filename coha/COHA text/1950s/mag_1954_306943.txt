A generation of Americans with party telephone lines learned the fascination of listening in on their neighbors . They also learned to converse guardedly , on the assumption that their neighbors were eavesdropping . While the old-fashioned party line is becoming an ever rarer luxury , a new kind of party-line was installed in Washington last week : the televised monitored phone call . <P> The new gadget has advantages over the old : instead of a handful of eavesdroppers , millions can listen : instead of guarded talk , the callers have unlimited misplaced confidence in their privacy . <P> Joe McCarthy held for weeks to his position that no transcripts of monitored phone calls could go in the Mundt committee record unless all of them went in . Gradually , this position melted , and last week the calls began to pour into the record . So far the results added up to a substantial advantage for McCarthy 's side of the case . <P> Roy to Bob . The earliest of the published monitored conversations occurred on Sept. 23 , when Roy Cohn called Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of Army intelligence , appear before McCarthy 's committee . Excerpts : <P> Cohn : Maybe we wo n't be doing much if we make the head of G-2 look awfully silly . <P> Stevens : You wo n't be gaining much from our standpoint to make the G-2 look awful silly . . . But I think you had better . . . handle it as you think best , but let 's do n't have too much of a spectacle . <P> Bob to Dave . On Oct. 21 Draftee Schine was awaiting induction into the Army , when Stevens telephoned to report on his earnest discussion of Schine 's case with the Secretary of Defense , Charles E. Wilson : <P> Stevens : I have reviewed this whole situation with Mr. Wilson , and it adds up to this : neither he nor I can see an appropriate way to avoid the basic training . . . That is the wise thing to do , Dave , and that having done that , then I think there is an excellent chance that we can pick you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country and to yourself . Just what they would be , I do n't know ... I personally would like to arrange it . . . in such a way that you could use the knowledge and ability you have in certain fields . . . <P> Schine : I am certainly happy to know you have talked it over with Mr. Wilson , and that you are both thinking about it . <P> Stevens : We are . . . <P> Schine : We will probably have to talk this over at greater length some time . <P> Stevens : If you come down , I will be delighted to see you . <P> Roy to Bob . A week later , Cohn suggested to Stevens that it might " save embarrassment all around " to get Schine a job at the Central Intelligence Agency . <P> <P> Cohn : How do you think we should go at that ? <P> Stevens : Do you want me to talk with Allen Dulles . I think I might do it . <P> Cohn : I would appreciate that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulles had turned down the idea . But Roy Cohn had another idea : <P> Cohn : How about this deal of picking up somebody once he 's in the Army . . . ? <P> Stevens : On the question of the pickup , I can probably do a better job on that than Dulles could . <P> Joe to Bob . Four days after Schine was inducted . McCarthy called Stevens . <P> Excerpts :
