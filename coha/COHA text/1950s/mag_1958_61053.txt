They stopped pro football 's best disc jockey and one of 1958 's finest halfbacks without a touchdown . Lenny Moore , formerly of Penn State , went scoreless for the first time this season , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great football team , like the masterwork of a great chef , must contain just the right blend of each essential ingredient . The lack of one can spoil the whole dish  --  or the team . The Colts have had nearly all the ingredients for the last couple of years . Now , it seems , with some new help on the defensive platoon , Coach Weeb Ewbank has completed the recipe beautifully . Not the least element in his concoction is Moore , who provides something as necessary to pro football as cheese is to a souffle  --  a great halfback who provides a running threat outside the ends as well as a pass-receiving threat that prevents the defense from concentrating against any one of his talents . // Although he scored five touchdowns in the first two games of the season , Baltimore 's Moore is still a frustrated man . Not about football , of course . " I feel real good this year , " he says about that . " I 'm cutting back to get loose where I used to go on around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside when I start to the left , so now I cut back . Do n't down those blockers . They 're the ones . " // Moore 's frustration stems from his off-season job , which is disc-jockeying for three hours six days a week on a Baltimore radio station . // " I play rock ' n ' roll most of the time , " Lenny said the other day . " I do n't down it on the air , man . But let me put it this way . I do n't possess any rock ' n ' roll records either . I like progressive jazz . Men like Miles Davis and Stan Getz , they kill me . I used to make my comments on the records , but I got all this mail . " // Moore has a large personal collection of progressive jazz , an enthusiasm he shares with the huge Colt tackle , Big Daddy Lipscomb. // " It was a little while before I got on to this business , " he said . " At first , I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the log and figuring what to say . When I gain a little more power , I 'll have the boys drop by and I 'll chat with them about the team , things like that . " // Moore has all the power he needs when he turns to his other vocation . He 's a tall , rather lean halfback with an especial talent for picking his way through a broken field . Although he has a good change of pace , his strongest asset is an uncanny ability to change direction against the flow of the defense , so that often Lenny is headed one way while the defenders are going the other . // The Colts , a relatively young team , possess an awesome amount of firepower in Moore , Fullback Alan Ameche , Halfback L. G. Dupre and the extraordinary quarterback , John Unitas . In front of this dynamic quartet are Ray Berry and Jim Mutscheller , the best pair of blocking ends in pro football and one of the major reasons for the yardage Moore accumulates each weekend . // The Colts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the San Francisco 49ers , the last two on the West Coast . In 1957 , with the same problem , the Colts lost both games and a chance for the conference championship . // " We 're a better team this year , " Moore said the other day . " That do n't say we 're gon na win it , but we 're better , man . " // In the most startling trade of the year , the Detroit Lions sent veteran Quarterback Bobby Layne to the Pittsburgh Steelers for Earl Morrall , a typical second-string quarterback , and two draft choices . Although various sources reported that the trade was due to 1 ) Layne 's having feuded with Lion Coach George Wilson or 2 ) Layne 's reporting to a late Saturday night meeting with a cocktail too many under his belt , neither story is true . Very simply , Bobby has not shown his usual precision or finesse . When he stubbed his toe and missed on an extra-point attempt against Green Bay , it pointed up the difference in the 1958 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of omission or commission , plus the presence of topflight quarterback Tobin Rote on the Lion roster helped make up Coach Wilson 's mind . // Trading Layne now , while he has considerable value on the open market , makes more sense than waiting until he has obviously passed his peak . And Buddy Parker , who coached the Lions and Layne for many years , will coach him at Pittsburgh . Parker gets a quarterback who probably has a couple of years of topflight play left in him  --  plus a very important asset : the habit of winning . He started inculcating that habit in the Steelers Sunday by engineering a 24-3 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles , the Steelers ' first win of the season . // Layne 's old ball club missed him . When the Lions took the field against the Los Angeles Rams in Detroit 's Briggs Stadium , a giant banner reading " Trade Wilson " was draped in the stands . Wilson may have added to his own discomfiture ; with the Lions moving on the ground late in the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , which was promptly intercepted by the Rams , who turned the interception into an eventual touchdown and finally into a 42-28 victory . // Elsewhere , the Cleveland Browns never solved the Chicago Cardinals ' new double-wing T offense , but they used an exemplary method to defeat the Cardinals ; they scored more  --  35-28. // The Chicago Bears turned back the San Francisco 49ers , with the help of three pass interceptions , 28-6 , to remain within a game of Baltimore . The New York Giants , often befuddled by the wizardry of Washington 's diminutive Eddie LeBaron at quarterback , retained enough self-control to win their second game against one loss , 21-14 , and emerge as Cleveland 's strongest threat in the Eastern Conference .
