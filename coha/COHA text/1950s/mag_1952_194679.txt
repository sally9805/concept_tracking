The Seven Year Itch ( by George Axelrod ) bagged a batch of fine reviews on opening night . It possesses a lively popular theme . It is full of humorous , situations . It boasts an engaging leading man . What it lacks , unfortunately , is any real merit as a play . <P> The story concerns Richard Sherman , a married New Yorker whose wife is away for the summer . Married for seven years and on earth for almost 40 , he has reached that half-wolfish , half-mousy point when the eye begins to wander but the ego to worry , when Caspar Milquetoast sounds an alarm clock on Walter Mitty 's dreams . There is an attractive young lady ( Vanessa Brown ) who lives in the apartment above Richard , and with whom he gets very pleasantly enmeshed . But there is a gaudy imagination and a lurid conscience that live within him , through which he gets enmeshed even more . At times , he prowls about the apartment babbling to himself , or ( being a book publisher ) confides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between Richard 's fall from virtue and all his nights from reality , the play takes complete summer inventory of him . There are some genuinely funny moments , and Tom Ewell , a naturally funny man , plays Richard with as much drollery and as little coyness as the part allows . But people who do n't want everything lip-smackingly spelled out for them will find much of the play a bore . It is less a play , in fact , than an anthology of familiar little situations , a lot of them banged out too loud and too long . In The Seven Year Itch , sex is something that not so much rears its head as never once lowers it . Rather than freshness of finesse , the play exhibits an astute sense of the obvious .
