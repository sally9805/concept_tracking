Many of you have written me to ask how TIME happened to find and report some of the stories which never made the headlines . Recently I put the question to a few of TIME 'S U.S. correspondents . Said Ed Woods , in St. Louis : <P> " Stories for the most part are like mules . Sometimes you can tell them a long way off , by their ears . Sometimes they back up and kick you . In either case , recognition is immediate . " <P> Al Wright , in San Francisco , suggested a further breakdown : 1 ) the big , obvious news story , 2 ) the comprehensive situation story , with preparations made long in advance , 3 ) the local offbeat story which can grow out of a small newspaper squib , and 4 ) " the TIME type of exclusive , like a new business starting up , or a spectacular operation by a surgeon or troubles within some church parish . . . They are the news dividends of the week . " Bill Johnson , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found one originated with a press conference , one tip came from a press agent , seven from newspaper stories and 14 from personal contacts . <P> When TIME 'S Midwest correspondents met for a conference in Chicago last week , the odd sources of stories were favorite topics of conversation at formal and informal sessions . A revised edition of our correspondents ' manual , written by Lawrence Laybourne , general manager of TIME Inc. ' s U.S. and Canadian News Service , was distributed at the meeting . Its first sentences : " Long ago we coined an adjective-'TIMEworthy ' - to describe a news story for TIME . This is a matter which has significance and interest not merely to the community or region where it happens but to all TIME readers everywhere . " <P> Detroit Bureau Chief Fred Collins told of one story that began when he was leafing through a University of Michigan bulletin . He noticed a short item about a professor just back from an archeological expedition to the Middle East . An interview resulted in the story about the Urartu language stone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ad for a new cow-scratching device in the New Mexico Stockman caught Al Rosenfeld 's eye and turned into an item for the BUSINESS section ( TIME , April 9 ) . A full-page treatment of a cowboy camp meeting in the RELIGION section ( TIME , July 30 ) started with a casual remark made while Rosenfeld was interviewing an artist . San Francisco Correspondent Serrell Hillman was covering a professional women 's golf tournament at Carmel , Calif , when a friend mentioned the Army language school at Monterey , which was covered in TIME 'S EDUCATION section ( TIME , July 23 ) . <P> Correspondent Johnson compares many TIME stories to " coral reefs which keep building until they stick out of the water . " He investigated reports of oil finds in Texas ' Spraberry trend for a year before he felt they had built up enough significance to be reported in TIME ( Oct. 8 ) . The news break on " Weedhead , " the narcotics agent who posed as a high school student ( TIME , Dec. 3 ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd long been storing up , " said Johnson . Once , while he was standing at the top of the University of Texas tower admiring the view , a member of the school 's staff happened to mention Henry Dunn , the caretaker who sends books to needy libraries overseas . Result : a full column in the EDUCATION section ( TIME , Aug. 20 ) .
