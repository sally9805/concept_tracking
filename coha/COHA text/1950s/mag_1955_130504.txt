JOSEPHA STAHL , Manhasset , N.Y . " Hooray for Phil Wrigley . If other owners would cancel out their night games , I could have my husband 's undivided attention two or three nights a week . As soon as the summer comes he 's a changed person . Baseball becomes his principal interest . How about us women ? It 's a long summer . " // GUS BELL , Cincinnati Outfielder Cincinnati Redlegs " He 's to be commended . The tendency now is to schedule more and more night games . Since the Cubs get by without night games , Mr. Wrigley 's position is unselfish . I 'm not criticizing the owners who must have night games to carry on , but the emphasis should be on day games . " // HANK BAUER , Overland Park , Kans . Outfielder N.Y . Yankees " Mr. Wrigley is to be commended . He can increase attendance by playing at night , but he may be thinking of his players . Night ball shortens a player 's career . It disturbs his eating habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chilly nights are particularly bad for perspiring pitchers. " // EDDIE YOST , S. Ozone Park , N.Y . Third Baseman Washington Senators " Yes , Mr. Wrigley is right . Many players intensely dislike night baseball . Apparently , Mr. Wrigley does too . I prefer to play baseball in the daytime , but I can see why some of the club owners have to schedule night games for the bigger gate in order that they can make a profit . " // WILLIAM C. STRICKLER , Arlington , Va . President Natl . Assn . Power Engineers " I admire Wrigley for his stand . I do n't like to watch baseball or any other athletic contest under lights . Daytime baseball is more enjoyable and beneficial for players and spectators alike . If this trend continues , it appears as if we 'll be doing everything under lights . " // SID GORDON , Jamaica Estates , N.Y . Third Baseman New York Giants " Yes . Wrigley Field is the most beautiful park in the league . That 's what Mr. Wrigley has always contended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its beauty . Who 's to blame him for his stand against night baseball , particularly when most players do n't like it ? " // CHARLES A. HURTH , New Orleans President Southern Assn . " I do not feel I have the authority to advise the major leagues . However , with respect to the minor leagues , baseball would not be in existence without lighted ball parks . I 'm sure some of the major league baseball clubs must have night games in order to draw enough fans . " // CARMINE DE SAPIO , New York City Secretary of State New York " The nub of the question is the convenience of the public . The people who support any enterprise must be served . Wrigley knows his business . He 's given Chicago a fine baseball club . Perhaps there 's little demand for night baseball in Chicago . An astute businessman should know . " // PEE WEE REESE , Louisville Captain and Shortstop Brooklyn Dodgers " Yes . But some teams have to play night games to make money . I 'd rather see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sleep the next day . If we get subscription television , the greater revenue may enable clubs to drastically reduce the number of night games . " // LT . GEN . CLARENCE R. HUEBNER New York City Director N.Y . State Civil Defense " No . Twenty years ago I would have said yes . Today , engineers have developed lighting that is as good as daylight . Mr. Wrigley 's stand is reactionary . Night baseball gives added millions a chance to see baseball at the parks and on TV . It 's the principal summer recreation for Americans . " // FRANK THOMAS , Pittsburgh Outfielder Pittsburgh Pirates " Certainly . Baseball should be played in daylight . The hot sun loosens you up . Night baseball often works the other way . You go from day to night and from night to day . It throws you off your timing . Then the fans begin riding you . I love to play when the sun is shining . " // RALPH KINER , Palm Springs , Calif . Outfielder Cleveland Indians " I 'm not attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I dislike night ball because it shortens a player 's career . I hope to overtake Ted Williams in home runs this year , but if I do , that 's about as far as I can go . Without night baseball I might have had several more seasons of play left .
