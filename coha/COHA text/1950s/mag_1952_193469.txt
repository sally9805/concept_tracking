Nobody knows how many hot-rod racing fans there are in the U.S. , but Robert ( " Pete " ) Petersen of Los Angeles knows their lingo . At 25 , he has already made a small fortune publishing Hot Rod and other " hogbear " ( real thing ) magazines for them ( TIME , Feb. 19 , 1951 ) . Early last fall Publisher Petersen and his top staff cartoonist , Tom Medley , 31 , got an idea : since rodders seem to like their music as hot as their hopped-up engines , why not give them some with real " lowdown , George-gone-all-the-way " hot-rod lyrics ? <P> Cartoonist Medley went to work on the lyrics . Joe ( " Leadfoot " ) Darensbourg , a clarinetist with Kid Ory and His " Flat Out " Five , turned out a gutbucket background . Sample lyric : <P> I was settin ' in a drive-in having a Coke , When in drove a roadster with a half-inch stroke ; The body was channeled , the top was <P> chopped , The headers were chrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cry went up , ' If it goes , then-Drag it out , drag it out , drag it out ' <P> Last November Petersen and Medley let fellow hot-rodders have a preview of Saturday Night Drag Race over the loudspeakers at the Paradise Mesa Drag Strip in San Diego , and the rodders " got all shook up . " Consensus : " Man , that really comes on like a bomb , " " Greatest invention since the wheel , " " Real catbird , " etc . Last week , as a result , record counters across the nation began filling up with material for a new musical mania . <P> Petersen &; Co. now have four numbers , including one about a motorized cowboy ( " Instead of prodding with his spurs , he mashes on the gas " ) . But Lyricist Medley is still especially fond of Saturday Night Drag because it has a moral : " This hot-rodder gets caught , catch it ? So maybe kids listenin ' to the record do n't go out and race except at a track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
