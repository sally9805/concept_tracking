In such peace and concord that newsmen and even its own space-hungry publicity men were disappointed , the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. met for its fourth triennial General Assembly in St. Louis last week . Eight hundred delegates from 30 denominations gathered in Kiel Auditorium with some 2,000 consultants , observers and visitors to pass the usual resolutions ( against racial segregation , an arms race , corruption in labor unions ) . Even the new president they unanimously elected , to succeed Presbyterian Dr. Eugene Carson Blake , is notably ecumenical , notably withdrawn from intergroup disputes . <P> The first Midwesterner and the first Baptist to hold the position , the Rev. Dr. Edwin Theodore Dahlberg is pastor of St. Louis ' Delmar Baptist Church , which belongs both to the ecumenically-minded American Baptist Convention ( Northern ) and to the separatist Southern Baptist Convention ( the Southern Baptists shun the National Council as an entangling alliance of doctrinal liberals and superchurch promoters ) . Says Dahlberg : " It 's a church with a Southern accent and a Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose grandparents migrated to the U.S. from Sweden , graduated from the University of Minnesota and Colgate Rochester Divinity School in Rochester , N.Y. , has held pastorates in Buffalo , St. Paul and Syracuse . He was president of the American Baptist Convention ( 1946-48 ) , and served six years ( 1948-54 ) on the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches . A nonsmoker and ardent enemy of alcohol , Minister Dahlberg is fond of hiking and mountain climbing , likes to be alone . " For 30 years , " he says , " I have made it a practice to spend an entire nigh of each vacation in solitary prayer anc communion with God . I 've done this in the Mojave Desert , in the mountains , on the plains and by the sea . Three times I 've spent a night of prayer in a rowboat on a lake . " <P> During the next three years , his tenure as National Council president , Dahlberg foresees a new Protestant emphasis on theology . " Even children are asking theological questions as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , " and our exploration of the incredible cosmic order opening up before us should result in a powerful awakening of religion . The possibility of other inhabited worlds must inevitably expand our concept of God . We believe as Christians that Christ is the Lord and Redeemer of those worlds as well as our own . For He Himself said that all authority in Heaven and on earth had been given to Him . "
