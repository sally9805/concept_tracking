A Story by Sherry Mangan Drawings by Oscar Liebman A Question of PRINCIPLE W H E N the barefoot maid asked , " Since Dona Maggie is so late , does the senor wish to dine alone ? " Pat Callahan , refusing , remembered the last time she had been late . Then he had been overwhelmed by such tenderness that he had embraced her till she was breathless , rattling on about buttoning overcoats and crossing streets and wearing rubbers , and felt blissful and inexpressible gratitude for her existence and love . She had been as absurd as he , saying  --  and meaning  --  that she was a selfish gadabout to keep him cage-pacing about dinner and worrying about her . So when he had released her to arm 's length , the sense of the already fifteen good years of it made their eyes fill before they sat down to table and fell into one of their usual hilarious arguments . Now he opened the cottage 's front door , pot-watching , and looked with unconscious hope at the big open gate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bolivian sky had that almost painful brilliance that only dry-season atmosphere at over a mile high can give . " Come on , lamb , shake it up , " he muttered in the vague direction of town , and went back to slide-rule the next step of the problem he had continued past working hours to dull his impatience . He had pretty well lost himself in it for five minutes and was copying off a notation when , one on top of the other , came the motor sound , the headlights , and the scream  --  not just a scream scream , but the piercingest ripped-out explosion that human breath could produce . By the time he reached the front door he was running , but the headlights ' dazzle prevented him from seeing past to where she kept crying , " Pat ! Pat ! " with terrified and terrifying urgency . He was moving so fast that he did not make the mental connection when Chummy , the landlord 's white spitz , flashed past him with a bloody muzzle . It was not till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name and told him , " I 'd no sooner touched my foot to the ground than Chummy came from nowhere and bit me . To the bone  --  T heard his teeth grate on it . Oh , Pat , Pat , I 'm frightened ! " As he swung her up in his arms to carry her in , he noticed vaguely that it was Rob Anderson who had driven her home and was now making voiceless gestures of help . He put her in the big chair , kicked the pouf close for a footstool , and then knelt to look , surprised at the smallness of the mashed pulped area at the ankle . Their own puppy , the black cocker bitch Butch , was utterly panicked , leaped to her lap , and cowered whimpering ; so that Pat had to wait over a minute till Maggie had calmed herself by calming the trembling thing . Anderson had just started to ask , " Is there anything I can ? ? " when Pat cut in with , " Just A QUESTION stand by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed her shoulder hard , said , " Doctor Kugler , of course . Take it easy , kid , while I call him , " and bolted out the cottage 's side door toward the big house where the landlord had a phone . As he ran through the hedge-lined path , he saw Chummy , not skulking but uncharacteristically snarling at bay , and though he thought rabies and felt murder , he was in too much of a hurry to kill him . He did not even knock , but strode over to where Senor Prieto was staring up from replacing the hand-piece on the hall phone . As he dialed Kugler 's number , with strokes so emphatic that their anger made him feel a little ridiculous , he said , " I have n't complained how Chummy picks the spot outside our bedroom window every night to bark all the other dogs in town awake . Nor warned you when that half of his face torn away in last week 's fight did n't heal , and he began to act aggressively . But by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go destroy him . And if not , I  --  hello , Doctor . " He explained , tersely , and slammed back the hand-piece in time to see the face , beautiful even in its startled gawp , of the Seiiora Prieto appear over the banister high above . " What , " she asked , " has Rintintina done now ? " " Nothing , naturally , Dona Claribela , " he snapped . " It was Chummy . Will you ? " he stared at his landlord again " ? deal with the dog ? We 'll need the brain . " He waited just long enough to catch Prieto 's sad slow nod , and was through the door again . As he pounded the path homeward , contempt toward the woman filled him : ever since the once that her children 's characterless chow Rintintina had nipped back at her precious animated dishmop Glamorosita , any occasion served her to try to doom the poor thing . O DDLY enough , grounds for contempt awaited him also at home , redolent of Sulfonaphthol and gabble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await his return before organizing a basin of medicated boiled water , cotton batting , and alcohol , was revealed spreading newspapers over the carpet ; while the maid Honorata , apparently feeling that they lacked a suitable sense of drama , was correcting their deficiency by explaining to Maggie that she was wounded , that it was terrible , and that the merciful Virgin alone knew what would happen . He felt like an apprentice saint for the restraint of his gesture dismissing her to the kitchen , a gesture in which the threat of an avalanche of kicks was nevertheless implicit ; but felt ashamed of his jealous relief that Anderson because of his newspapers had not yet arrived at the point of touching her ankle . He gestured good-willing Bob to the decanter of cheap local brandy on the sideboard as he knelt to strip oil the stocking . By analogy with the surgeon's-taping he had felt on his own hog-bristle chest when he had pleurisy , he had the luck to jerk just right at the point of the wound , and was so relieved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisecracking about the third of a tumbler of raw spirits that she gulped down a minute later : " Baby , I never knew you were such a sensitive plant about alcohol : why , I could palpate right through your ankle-bone the jolt that shot made when it hit your stomach . " As he squeezed and taped , he was grateful that his big hands were less clumsy than they looked , and supposed that it was because tenderness was controlling them . They did not jar even when he himself jarred at the outrageous slam , outrageously repeated , of nearby shotgun blasts , followed by shouts and the pound of running feet . The windows were by now flickering crazily with powerful flashlight sweeps , and when , at the sharper crack of what he supposed was a revolver , she stirred a little uneasily , he felt suddenly nervous for her . " You all right ? " he asked , looking up . " Sure , I 'm all right . " Unsatisfied , he put his palms high against her calves , pressed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " Her held breath sighed out in a relief that ended in a chuckle , and he felt her muscles relax : " Yes , you mug , really all right . " And then , as he looked up at her again in his own relief , she added , " I know the obstetricians say they 've never lost a father yet ; but maybe I should ask back , ' Are you all right ? ' " Worry made him stupid just the split-second necessary to answer , " Sure , I 'm all right , " before he was made aware that he had led with his chin by her bursting into that wonderful guffaw that they called her silvery tinkle , and then , sheepish , he knew it was all really all right . When he squeezed the surgical alcohol over the wound she let her breath out again in a different way ; but it was only when he was dusting on the sulfa powder that she said , " And to think that I supposed , after all these years with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And , Bob or no Bob , he kissed the nearest point of a Ieg and thought , If I am not crying , I rust be growing up at last . And then laid on the loose compress . SO THEN they had time for a few easier breaths and looking around  --  a conjuncture seized on by Anderson to beat a panic but hearty retreat , which relaxed everything even further . Thus quite some minutes must have quietly passed when they heard the bracing sound of Kugler 's car . With his elegant Czech-German formality , he greeted her as a woman before he even allowed himself to glance at the wound . Kneeling for a long careful look under the loose dressing , he finally approved the home-made measures with a nod , and limited himself to taping it on . " Before we talk about it , " said Pat , " thanks for being so prompt . " " No trouble except that I was alone with my little girl , so I had to bring her along in the car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibly mad dog loose . We 're somewhat beleaguered here . " " Statistically there has been no rabies in this middle valley for twenty-four years " ? Kugler waved it away ? " so that . . . " A broadside of shotgun blasts interrupted him , and Pat could see his pupils dilate a little . " Of course . They would be hunting it . That is dangerous . These Bolivians . First they would kill her and then ask her whether she was a mad dog . Excuse me . " MAGAZINE They waited . Pat looked at the petrified Butch and had an idea . So when Kugler returned with the seven-year-old , he whooshed her and Butch all noisy-excited into the big bedroom , and shivered a little as he heard another volley of shots ring out . " We are very lucky , " said Kugler , " in this benighted city where you can not in ordinary practice get even a bacteriological urinalysis done , that there is for this the Inter-American Public Hygiene Service . Doctor Anastasio Savedra . An absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new North American equipment ... " He spread his hands . " If these hysterical Nimrods ever hit the accursed thing . . . You told them we shall want the brain ? Good . But it is Saturday night , and Savedra is probably gone to the country . Ach . It may even have to be refrigerated till Monday morning . " Maggie 's housewifely instincts visibly heaved , then she remembered and said : " Do n't worry : they have two electric refrigerators , so they can concentrate all the food in the other one . " " If they want inc to decapitate . . " Kugler was beginning helpfully , when the next volley 's being followed by shouts of triumph pulled him up . " Ah . Good . " Then , resuming , " No . It is not my dog : let them use an axe or something , or just stuff it in . " He let it go , then unprofessionally took Maggie 's nearer hand to say , " Senora Callahan , your natural shock need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is practically excluded . It seems to be the only plague that this unhappy country has been mysteriously spared . And the laboratory analysis will doubtless confirm the already overwhelming probability . Furthermore there is no hurry . Even in the unlikeliest case of a positive report , we have a safe period of fifteen days in which to start injecting the vaccine . So-o-o , " he drawled out with the German zed , and smiled with sudden brilliance . " And even the pain should not go beyond a heavy throbbing . " He looked at her keenly . " You were fearing cauterization ? No . Relax . " A concentration of flashlights made Pat look at the window in time to see the Prietos ' seventeen-year-o/d son carrying the body of Chummy , A QUESTION and a trick of reflection from the porch light revealed him to be crying . " Well , " said Kugler . " I shall not bother you further . I shall make the laboratory arrangements directly with the Senores Prieto and Savedra . Phone me in the unlikely case anything unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When he had collected his daughter , he was , with duly Teutonic formality , seen out . And then suddenly it was all over and they were as usual and the chicken Tetrazzini was n't spoiled after alI and they had Chilean wine instead of local beer even if they could n't afford it and Maggie told him the various comical wishfulthinkings the bridge-playing crowd were repeating about the corning counter-revolution and Pat was so tender and almost hovering that finally Maggie laughed at him and said , " Listen , fella , you do n't have to prove you love me . If I had n't been sure of it years ago , I would n't have put up with you all this time . Or maybe ? " she looked a moment somber " ? I could n't have helped staying even so . " " You mean I 'm just being self-indulgent to love you ? " " Yes . But if you think I really object to that . . . " The moon rose just as they were turning in about eleven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time on one elbow watching in the moonlight from the window the confident peace of her face as she slept . I N I- HE cheerful sunny morning Prieto was down early to report that he had arranged for anti-rabies vaccine to be sent by that afternoon 's plane from La Paz . Honorata had just both touched and irritated Pat by babbling on about how many candies she had lit after Mass before the Virgin of Copacabana for the sefiora 's recovery , but he was able to answer Prieto blandly enough : " ' That was very thoughtful , but it will probably not be necessary . The analysis of the brain will tell . " " But , Senor Callahan , you will use this vaccine in any case . " " No . Why ? " " But naturally . To be safe . " Pat was disturbed : " Do you mean that Savedra is n't first-rate , as Kugler thinks ? that he 's incompetent ? " Prieto waved the thought away : " A most distinguished physician , Don Anas-tasio Savedra . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you , " said Pat . " It 's an open-and-shut kind of test , and if Savedra 's competent , then . . " " But can we trust scientific tests ? " " Weil , if not , what would you , as an engineer yourself , think we can trust ? " Prieto looked uncomfortable . " Of course , vaccination would have the advantage that my wife could bite people for the next five years without endangering them , " Pat threw in , and immediately regretted it , for Prieto 's expression painfully reminded him that Bolivians found Callahan-brand humor macabre . Prieto made a slightly impatient gesture : " We shall speak of it again later , " he said . " Another thing . Do you not agree that we should destroy Rintintina , who was also cut up in that last week 's fight ? " Pat put his hand warmly on Prieto 's arm : " Don Mariano , " he said , " if I was rude last night , I apologize . I 'm deeply sorry about Chummy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must hate me . " Sentiment between males made Pat awkward , so he plunged on : " She 's been behaving normally . And my impression  --  you 'll have to confirm with Kugler , of course  --  is that , far from destroying her , they 'll want her confined under observation . To check against the brain business . " It was only when Prieto groaned , " But if she too should bite again . . . , " that Pat woke up to the fact that it was Dolia Claribela behind this nonsense . His accumulated indignation burst into voluble argument , and after ten minutes Prieto was convinced . But his homeward pace was leaden-footed . Pat , still irritated , explained it to Maggie , but she merely shooed him back to his slide rule . Yet , two hours later , Prieto was back with slightly refurbished arguments . This time Pat controlled his irritation with the thought that , though Prieto was ten times the man his wife was , she had some kind of Indian sign on him , perhaps through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patience why killing Rintintina not only was needless but would defeat their purpose . Off went Prieto again , logically persuaded but personally miserable . Maggie told Pat to forget it : " You do n't have to go out to Kilometer 116 to look at your bridge until Friday , " she said . " And what with reading that book on memorizing from phonograph records while you sleep , and playing your own physicist games , and  --  well , and me  --  it looks like a specially nice few days . So just put these people out of your mind , pet . " " I 'll do that , " he said . And he did . Within half an hour she could see , from the way he was staring at the paper on which he had been assembling mathematical formulae , that he was happily out in time-space songewhere ; and she began to hum in off-tune contentment as , favoring the bitten foot a little , she went round the sunny garden scissoring off one of her odder mixtures of flowers for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At one o'clock , she kissed him back out of the larger universe into their smaller but satisfactory one . " I think maybe I see something new , " he gestured at his papers , and she sensed that whatever it was had made him pleasantly excited . Lunch was lovely , and after , when he stood behind her chair ruffling her hair , he said , " Say , I like this . Let 's live forever . " She said she 'd try it if he would , and away he went and away went the afternoon better if possible than the morning . About six , as the sun got low over the peaks , he put his stuff away and came out to the back terrace , where she was reading in the deck-chair with her foot up on the pouf . " Gee , I 've been a long way off , " he said . " Out past Galaxy 116 at least . Did you miss me while I was gone ? " " I ca n't pretend I knew just where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see you through the study window , so it was all right . " " Sorry it 's such a short visit , " he said , " because I 'm off again . This time to the hen coop to collect today 's eggs and leg-band the new chicks from Aunt Minnie 's clutch . See you again some time . Soon , I hope . " " You 're always welcome . " AT WAS down on one knee in a breed- ing pen putting distinguishing tape on the newborn chicks ' legs when there was an unbelievable explosion from twenty yards away , and as he stared open-mouthed toward it , buckshot-peppered leaves fluttered down around him from the lowest branches of the tree overhead . Along the path up the garden slope staggered Rintintina , weaving her head , making strange whistling noises , with blood pouring from her throat . As if blind to his presence she faltered past to the celery patch which was her favorite spot to finish bones , and collapsed there , wheezing and crying . Pat hurried through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look told him she was doomed , though it might be still an hour 's suffering to go . There was nothing he could give her but comfort , so , kneeling , he began to stroke her head . But she reacted with a bubbling growl , and he withdrew his hand with the thought : Perhaps one bite at a time is enough in one family . Instead , he started running down the slope to that point of the road from which the buckshot had apparently been fired . There was nobody there , nobody in sight . Yet he would have seen anyone going from the spot to the big house . He went there , knocked and opened , saw Prieto standing , topcoat over arm , at the foot of the staircase . A QUESTION " Rintintina 's been shot . Did you do it ? " Prieto spread his hands : " I could n't do it myself . " " What did you do , then , just announce to the neighborhood that it was open season on her  --  and on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Prieto took a humanitarian step toward him and asked : " Senor Callahan , you have not been wounded ? " " I ? As if ... Oh , Jet it go . Who did this thing , Don Mariano ? " " It would have been Fulgencio Aspera who did the shooting , I think . The man up the road with the three cows who gave us Chummy . He sometimes works for me . " " He certainly does , " said Pat , and was about to add , " There 's one for somebody 's collection of understatements , " when there was Dona Claribela 's head over the banisters again . " Oh , Don Patricio , " she said , " it all makes me sick at heart . " Pat opened his mouth but succeeded in closing it again without saying , " And you me , in another part of my anatomy . " No . He just wanted out . " Thank you both and excuse me , " he said . " It is admittedly a complex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rintintina , he stopped and cursed , long and unimaginatively . At other moments , he could have constructed endless lucid paragraphs on the inadequate and unimaginative nature of swearing , including how even the simple invocation of mere hell implies vestigial religious beliefs ; but right now the stupid repetitive violence of it brought him somehow some relief . Rintintina was , unmercifully , still conscious and agonizing , though he thought the eyes were glazing a little . He could not prevent himself from stroking her head again , and , in lieu of a gun which he 'd never dared keep , wondered fleetingly if there was some morphine left from that compound-fracture incident , but he did n't know dosages or even if they had a syringe , and , discouraged , he finally gave her a last pat and walked , suddenly exhausted , toward the cottage . " About time , " said Maggie , watching him close both doors and gesture warningly at Butch . " What was that awful bang ? " " Buckshot . Missed me . But got Rintintina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't occur to me you 'd worry . " " No ? " Maggie limited herself to a heavy stage accent of irony . " I 'll tell you in a minute , " he said , unheeding . " But first I think we 'll have a few pisco sours to give us an appetite for dinner . No , Butch , out only on the leash the next few days . " She could hear him in the kitchen knocking bits from the snowy lump of ice in the wooden chest , and he finally returned with the shaker already in motion . " To get lemon juice I had to interrupt Honorata at her prayers , " he mentioned mildly when he had poured their cocktails . " For you , presume . " And then , his voice rising , and his hands making gestures as if he were trying to claw his way out of a net : " Are they all trying deliberately to drive us nuts ? " " Not really . Each of them is just doing what he thinks is for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he thought she was joking and he did n't get the point , then he suddenly relaxed into a chair with an outblow of breath . " You 're a genius at simplicity , " he said . " You think of the strangest things and they turn out to be true . You ought to have a degree , too , say : ' Doctor of Realism ' . " " I have what I want , Pat , " she said . " A diploma would n't keep my feet warm in bed on a cold night . " But he insisted : " No , baby , you know things I 'd never suspect , never dream of . And if I say degree , it 's because you profess : you give your knowledge out so simply and clearly and generously . " She gestured toward the bookcase full of volumes of mathematics and physics : " You know some things I do n't know , " she said . " It 's an age of specialization : everybody ca n't know everything . if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , Pat . I can give you love too : that comes so easy . I wish I had money as well . " " Money ? " asked Pat , startled . " Who threw that ? " " Well , I do n't think you 're really very interested in bridges , are you ? " " Oh , that , " said Pat . " Heck , I could n't be just thinking twenty-four hours a day . And bridges are built in the most interesting countries , do n't you find ? The climate too is so bracing . And the people are delightful . " She grinned at him finally and gave up . But she remained nervous . At dinner he was amiably broody , and had two national brandies with his coffee . And after , he could n't even keep his mind to a detective story but spread out the three-pack solitaire layout he 'd once invented and set them up discos and quinine water . She was afraid both that there might not be enough quinine water on hand and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed calm and industrious again , and tensity went back to normal except that they did n't forget for many minutes on end that this was the day they 'd hear the determinant word from the laboratory . The only thing that he did n't take in his stride was when the maid , leaving for late marketing , asked for an advance on her pay . Pat had cheerfully put his hand in his pocket , saying , ' ' What did you see now , Honorata , a shawl or a skirt ? Or earrings ? " But when she explained , " I want to light some more candles for the recovery of the senora , " he stopped short . He thought a fast minute , then said very gently , " It 's the first time I 've refused you , Honorata . But you get too little money to spend it on candles . Do n't worry : we 'll take care of Dona Maggie 's health . " After she had , much cast down , gone off , lie could only shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked up from change-counting to become aware of the long puzzled way she had been staring at him , he got it , slapped his thigh , and said : " Do you see it , baby ? She thinks I secretly do n't love you . What next ? " And he clawed his way out of the net again , this time as a conscious gesture . IT WAS four o'clock when Kugler came . Formalities completed , he smiled : " Negative . No rabies . The dog was crazy  --  to bite you , I mean  --  but not mad . " As they leaned back , Pat 's and Maggie 's eyes met and they let out their breath simultaneously . Pat redundantly added , " Out ! " and then , " No vaccine . " " Since I am here , just Jet me look at the foot , " Kugler said ; and , as he worked , went on : " And allow me to assure you that the vaccine would not have been pleasant for the senora . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abdomen  --  once each day for thirty consecutive days . " He coughed . " One accepts even this because the disease itself , once it is too late , is incurable  --  and fatal . " He stood up again , satisfied . " Senor Prieto still asks of me that the vaccine be given ; but I do not think it necessary , He is , however , very insistent . " Pat glowered irritably a moment ; then : " It is unnecessary ? " - at is unnecessary . " " That 's final , then . Tell him to go be insistent about something else elsewhere . I do n't get the guy . Such scientific certainty ! Row does he dare travel on his own railroads ? " After two days , and blessedly everyday days they were , Pat afoot ran into Kugler at a street crossing downtown . Kugler pulled the car over to the curb and shook his head at Pat in not-somock despair : " Prieto has visited me twice and phoned me four times , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the vaccine . " Pat impatiently brandished his arms , as if to clear a space through jungle creepers : " I 'm sorry he 's pestering you . He 's avoiding me , I suddenly realize , Well ? " " Well ? " " It is unnecessary ? " " It is ? " but this time Kugler paused a second and looked at him " ? unnecessary . " Pat was for a moment speechless with exasperation , then blurted : " And his wife no doubt is lighting candles . " " I believe she is . In fact , my wife saw her doing so . " Pat 's sympathy surged up at the doctor 's confession ; but for the moment everything was too much for him , He threw up his arms , hastily shook hands , and left Kugler . But this time it stuck . ' That night there was solitaire again , and Maggie , seeing him with a card suspended , staring at the wall thinking . began to feel nervous again . The next morning he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broody hens . At lunch he was alternately very much there and not there at all , and in the afternoon he looked up once from the book he was studying and asked : " You think we 're right , do n't you ? " She nodded . " I should have known without asking . Forgive me , Mag . " A T FIVE Kugler turned up . After the examination , he sat down rather heavily and said : " Prieto came again , and phoned twice . " Pat felt as if his head would explode , He said desperately : " Get together with another doctor and certify him as a lunatic . What is this ? " Kugler shrugged in a discouraged way , and they sat a long minute silent before Pat startled to realize that Kugler 's look was one of inquiry . Doubting even Kugler 's understanding , he blurted : " At the risk of sounding callow , I 'll try to put it in words . A man has to believe in something . I believe in man . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Facts . Observation . Objectivity . Experiment . Scientific methods . Right now , especially , tests . Truth , I suppose , as close as we can get .

How , " he was going on , " can I make it clearer to you . . . ? " when he realized that Kugler was embarrassedly nodding in agreement and sympathy . " Of course , " Kugler said . " Then why were you looking doubtful ? " asked Pat almost passionately . " Brass tacks . Cards on the table . Is there any chance of rabies ? " Kugler sighed : " Theoretically , none ; practically , human error is never impossible . Say one chance in a thousand . " " At those odds , bet my life . " " It is n't yours , you know , " Kugler gently reminded him . Pat sat stunned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally said , in a voice so soft and inward that they could just catch it , " that I 've been a little egocentric . You see , I always felt we were the same person . And we are , in most things . But in this . . . " He looked at her , and she met his look completely . " Now I 'm finally awake , " he asked , " what do you want to do ? " " Whatever you decide , " she answered . It made Pat feel strong and proud with love ; yet he slumped a little at the decision . " When can you start her , then , Doctor ? " he asked . " The material is in my consulting-room refrigerator , " said Kugler precisely , " so I can drive her down , give her the first injection , and get her back in not much over half an hour . " They were all up and in motion , but Pat still had to grab her arm and say , " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them yet . " After she 'd gone , he said to himself : Callahan , you 're at such a loose end that you do n't know which end is up , so maybe you can kill the time by tidying up that dog-killing matter . He got Butch on a leash , and asked Pedro the hour-a-day chicken-coop cleaner to come along as a legal witness . Pedro was visibly terrified , but opted for manhood and a firmed chin and came - tagging along in proud surprise at himself . They guessed the but from the three cows , and Aspera was in fact there . " I 'm Callahan , Don Mariano 's tenant in the cottage , " Pat began . " You killed Rintintinasneakily from ambush  --  and missed me by six feet . This is my wife 's dog . Take a good look at it : I do n't want any talk later about misunderstanding or mistaken identity . You 're responsible for this dog 's life from now on . If anybody  --  anybody  --  kills her , even by poisoned meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never killed anybody yet ; but with you it would be a pleasure . And do n't think that in this country I could n't somehow talk or buy my way out of it . " As he walked home , Pat felt the kind of relief that usually follows openly expressed anger , but wondered from whom in case of need he could borrow a firearm . That is , he thought a little tardily , remembering the cunning recessed hating eyes , if Aspera does n't shoot first . It filled the awkward interim anyway and he had not long to wait at home till he saw Kugler ceremoniously depositing Maggie at the gate . He 'd left the front door open so he stayed standing where he was and waited . She came in , looking somehow defeated and not far from tears , stopped a second to murmer shamefacedly , " I 'm sorry , Pat , " before coming blindly into his arms to say , " It hurt any way you want to mean the word . " And as , crying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pat , it hurt like hell . "
