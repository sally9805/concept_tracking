Years later , when Louis Philippe became King of France , he remembered the kindness , sent the paintings to the bishop for Bardstown 's new cathedral . <P> Bardstown could place no exact value on the stolen paintings , could not even prove that they were the authentic masterpieces that local tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasured part of St. Joseph 's , and last week the parishioners prayed for their return .
