You wait your turn to leave the coach , carrying a suitcase , and walk up the platform to the waiting room . Here you put down your suitcase and crane your neck , wondering what the architecthad up his sleeve . There are gods above you in a dim light and , unless there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trod by presidents and kings . You follow the crowds and the sounds of a fountain out of this twilight into the night . You put down your suitcase again and gape . On your left is the Capitol building , flooded with light . You have seen this so often on medallions and post cards that it seemed incised on your memory only now there is a difference . This is the real thing . You have eighteen dollars and thirty-seven cents in your pocket . You have not pinned the money to your underwear as your father suggested but you keep feeling for your wallet to make sure that it has n't been lifted by a pickpocket . You want a place to stay and , feeling that there will not be one around the Capitol , you start off in the opposite direction . You feel springy and young  --  your shoes are comfortable and the good , woolen socks you wear were knitted by your dear mother . Your underwear is clean in case you should be hit by a taxicab and have to be undressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase from hand to hand . You pass lighted store fronts , monuments , theaters and saloons . You hear dance music and the thunder of tenpins from an upstairs bowling alley and wonder how long it will be before you begin to play a role against this new scene . You will have a job , perhaps in that marble building on your left . You will have a desk , a secretary , a telephone extension , duties , worries , triumphs and promotions . In the meantime you will be a lover . You will meet a girl by that monument on the corner , buy her some dinner in that restaurant across the street and be taken home by her to that apartment in the distance . You will have friends and enjoy them as these two men , swinging down the street in shirt sleeves , are enjoying one another . You may belong to a bowling club that bowls in the alley whose thunder you hear . You will have money to spend and you may buy that raincoat in the store window on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red convertible like that red convertible that is rounding the corner . You may be a passenger in that airplane , traveling southeast above the trees , and you may even be a father like that thin-haired man , waiting for the traffic light to change , holding a little girl by one hand and a quart of strawberry ice cream in the other . It is only a question of days before the part begins , you think , although it must in fact have begun as soon as you entered the scene with your suitcase . You walk and walk and come at last to a neighborhood where the atmosphere is countrified and domesticated and where signs hang here and there , advertising board and rooms . You climb some stairs and a gray-haired widow answers the door and asks your business , your name and your former address . She has a vacancy , but she ca n't climb the stairs because of a weak heart or some other infirmity and so you climb them alone to the third floor back where there is a pleasant-enough room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sign a register and hang your best suit in the closet ; the suit that you will wear for your interview in the morning . Or you wake  --  like Coverly  --  a country boy in the biggest city inp105t h e world . It 's the hour when Leander usually begins his ablutions and the place is a three-dollar furnished room , as small or smaller than the closets of your home . You notice that the walls are painted a baneful green which ca n't have been chosen because of its effect on a man 's spirit  --  this is always discouraging  --  and so must be chosen because it is cheap . The walls seem to be sweating hut when you touch the moisture it is as hard as glue . You get out of bed and look out of your window onto a broad street where t rucks are passing , bringing produce up from the markets and railroadyards  --  a cheerful sight but one that you , coming from a small town in New England , regard with some skepticism , even with compassion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the city as a last resort of those people who lack the fortitude and character necessary to endure the montony of places like St. BotoIphs . It is a city , you have been told , where the value of permanence has never been grasped and this , even early in the morning , seems to be a pitiful state of affairs . In the hallway you find a wash basin where you shave your beard and while you are shaving a stout man joins you and watches critically . " You got ta stretch your skin , sonny , " the stranger says . " Look . Let me show you . " He takes a fold of his skin and pulls it tight . " Like that , " he says . " You got ta stretch it , you got ta stretch your skin . " You thank him for his advice and stretch your lower lip , which is all you have left to shave . " That 's the way to do it , " the stranger says . " That 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , clean shave . Last you all day . " He takes over the wash basin when you are finished and you go back to your room and dress . Then you climb down the stairs to a street full of shocks and wonders , for in spite of its Philosophical Society your home town was a very small place and you have never seen a high building or a dachshund ; you have never seen a man in suede shoes or a woman blow her nose into a piece of Kleenex ; you have never seen a parking meter or felt the ground under your feet shaken by a subway , but what you first notice is the fineness of the sky . You have come to feel  --  you may have been told  --  that the beauties of heavenp106centered above your home , and now you are surprised to find , stretched from edge to edge of the dissolute metropolis , a banner or field of the finest blue . It is early . The air smells of cheap pastry , and the noise of trucking  --  theclatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into a bakery for some breakfast . The waitress smiles at you openly and you think : Perhaps . Maybe . Later . Then you go out onto the street once more and gawk . The noise of traffic has gotten louder and you wonder how people can live in this maelstrom : how can they stand it ? A man duckfoots past you wearing a coat that seems to be made out of machine waste and you think how unacceptable such a coat would be in St. Botolphs . People would laugh . In the window of a tenement you see an old man in an undershirt eating something from a paper bag . He seems to be by-passed so pitilessly by life that you feel sad . Then , in crossing the street , you are nearly killed by a truck . Safe on the curb again you wonder about the pace of life in this big city . How do they keep it up ? Everywhereyou look you see signs of demolition and creation . The mind of the city seems divided about its purpose and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are tearing up good streets ; and the noise is so loud that if you should shout for help no one would hear you . You walk . You smell cooking from a Spanish restaurant , new bread , beer slops , roasting coffee beans and the exhaust fumes of a bus . Gaping at a high building you walk straight into a fire hydrant and nearly knock yourself out . You look around , hoping that no one saw your mistake . No one seems to have cared . At the next crossing a young woman , waiting for the light to change , is singing a song about love . Her song can hardly be heard above the noise of traffic , but she does n't care . You have never seen a woman singing in the street before and she carries herself so well and seems so happy that you beam at her . The light changes and you miss your chance to cross the street because you are stopped in your tracks by a host of young women who are coming in the opposite direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look anything like the table-silver girls in St. Botolphs . Not a single one of them is underp107the charge of modesty that burdens the beauties in your New Englandhome . Roses bloom in their cheeks , their hair falls in soft curls , pearls and diamonds sparkle at their wrists and throats and one of them  --  your head swims  --  has put a cloth rose into the rich darkness that divides her breasts . You cross the street and nearly get killed again . You remember then that you must telephone Cousin Mildred who is going to get you a job in the carpet works but when you go into a drugstore you find that all the telephones have dials and you have never used one of these . You think of asking a stranger for help but this request would seem to expose  --  in a horrible way  --  your inexperience , your unfitness to live in the city , as if your beginnings in a small place were shameful . You overcome these fears and the stranger you approach is kind and helpful . On the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thrilled by a vision of the brotherhood of man . You call Cousin Mildred but a maid says that she is sleeping . The maid 's voice makes you wonder about the circumstances of your cousin 's life . You notice your rumpled flannel pants and step into a tailor shop to have them pressed . You wait in a humid little fitting room walled with mirrors , and , pantless , the figure you see is inescapably intimate and discouraging . Suppose the city should be bombed at this moment ? The tailor hands in your trousers , warm and cozy with steam , and you go out again . Now you are on a main avenue and you head , instinctively , for the north . You have never seen such crowds and such haste before . They are all late . They are all bent with purpose and the interior discourse that goes on behind their brows seems much more vehementthan anything in St. Botolphs . It is so vehement that here and there it erupts into speech . Then ahead of you you see a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lovely , so full of grace and yet frowning so deeply as if she doubted her beauty and her usefulnessthat you want to run after her and give her some money or at least some reassurance . The girl is lost in the crowd . Now you are passing , in the store windows , those generations of plaster ladies who have evolved a seasonal cycle of their own and whop108have posed at their elegant linen closets and art galleries , their weddings and walks , their cruises and cocktail parties long before you came to town and will be at them long after you are dust . You follow the crowd north and the thousands of faces seems like a text and a cheerful one . You have never seen such expensivenessand elegance and you think that even Mrs. Theophilus Gates would look seedy in a place like this . At the park you leave the avenue and wander into the zoo . It is like a paradise ; greenery and water and innocence in jeopardy , the voices of children and the roaring of lions and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are surprised at the display of apartment houses and you wonder who can live in them all and you may even mistake the air-conditioning machinery for makeshift iceboxes where people keep a little milk and a quarter of a pound of butter fresh . You wonder if you will ever enter such a building  --  have tea or supper or some other human intercourse there . A concrete nymph with large breasts and holding a concrete lintel on her head causes you some consternation . You blush . You pass a woman who is sitting on a rock , holding a volume of the Beethovensonatas in her lap . Your right foot hurts . There is probably a hole in your sock . North of the park you come into a neighborhood that seems blighted  --  not persecuted , but only unpopular , as if it suffered acne or bad breath , and it has a bad complexion  --  colorless and seamed and missing a feature here and there . You eat a sandwich in one of those dark taverns that smells like a pissoir and where the sleepy waitress wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great eyesore , the Cathedral of St. John The Divine , and say your prayers , although the raw walls of the unfinishedbasilica remind you of a lonely railroad station . You step from the cathedral into a stick-ball game and in the distance someonepractices a sliding trombone . You see a woman with a rubber stocking waiting for a bus and in the window of a tenement a girl with yellow bangs . Now the people are mostly colored and the air rings with jazz . Even the pills and elixirs in the cut-rate drugstore jump to boogie/woogie and on the street someone has written in chalk : JESUS THE cHRIST . HE IS RISEN . An old woman on a camp stool sings from a braille hymnal and when you put a dime into her hands she says , God bless you , God bless you . A door flies open and a woman rushes into the street with a letter in her hand . She stuffs it into a mailbox and her manner is so hurried and passionate that you wonder what son or lover , what money-winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see a handsome Negress in a coat made out of cloth of gold . " Baloney John and Pig-fat 's loth dead , " a man says , " and me married five years and still do n't have a stick of furniture . Five years . " " Why you always comparing inc to other girls ? " a girl asks softly . " Why you always telling me this one and that one is better than me ? Sometimes it seems you just take me out to make me miserable , comparing me to this one and that one . Why you always comparing me to other girls ? " Now it is getting dark and you are tired . There is a hole for sure in your sock and a blister on your heel . You decide to go home by subway . You go down some stairs and board a train , trusting that you will end up somewhere near where you began , but you wo n't ask directions . The fear of being made ridiculous  --  a greenhorn  --  is overpowering .

There are alsop1173 carpenters , 2 shoemakers , a blacksmith and many other trades represented including the genteel art of music for one of the cornpanyhas brought his violin with him and entertains us at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I lowie Cockaigne and me got to work with our pick-axes in the bed of the river and when we had been digging for less than an hour two Mexicans came along and offered to buy the digging for an ounce of flour-gold and so we took the offer and had our first gold in less time than it takes to tell and you see that with gold selling at $5.6o an ounce and if our luck holds out we will be making forty or fifty dollars per day . Now under Captain Marsons leadership we are making a race in the river and turning its course so that we will be able to take the gold out of the dry bed . " Do n't expect many letters from me Old Scout because this happy land is still wild and as I am writing you now the ground is my chair and the night is my roof . But oh its a grand feeling to be out here and even with the professor playing symphonius strains on his violin and bringing back to me the sweet remembrance of all by-gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole world that I envy for I always knew I was born to be a child of destiny and that I was never meant to be subservient to the wealth , fame , power , etc. of others or to wring my living from detestable , low , degrading , mean and ordinary kinds of business . "  |p118To  create or build some kind of bridge between Leander 's world and that world where he sought his fortune seemed to Coverly a piece of work that would take strength and perseverance . The difference between the sweet-smelling farmhouse and the room where he lived was abysmal . They seemed to have come from the hands of different creators and to deny one another . Coverly thought about this one rainy night on his way to Cousin Mildred 's , wearing a rented tuxedo . " Come for dinner , " she had asked him ,  --  and then we 'll go to the opera . That ought to be fun for you . It 's Monday night so you 'll have to dress . Everyone dresses on Mondays.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings that Coverly , on his first day , had wondered if he would ever penetrate . Looking up at the building Coverly realized that by all the standards of St. Botolphs it would be condemnedas expensive , pretentious , noisy and unsafe . It could not be compared to a nice farm . He took an elevator to the eighteenth floor . He had never approached such an altitude and he entertainedhimself with some imaginary return to St. Botolphs where he regaled Pete Meacham with a description of this city of towers . He felt worldly and saturnine like a character in a movie . A pretty maid let him in and took him into a parlor for which he was corn/pletely unprepared . The walls were half-paneled like the diningroomwalls at West Farm . Most of the furniture he recognized since most of it had been stored in the hayloft when he was a boy . There , over the mantelpiece , hung old Benjamin himself , in his peignoir or Renaissance costume , staring out into the room with that harsh and naked look of dishonesty that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamps had come from the barn or the attic and Grandmother Wapshot 's old moth-eaten sampler ( " Unto Us a Son Is Given " ) was hanging on the wall . Coverly was studying old Benjamin 's stare when Cousin Mildred blew in  --  a tall , gaunt woman in a red evening dress that seemed cut to display her bony shoulders . " Coverly ! " she exclaimed . " My clear . How nice of you to come . You look just like a Wapshot . I Larry will be thrilled . He adores Wapshots . Sit down . We 'll have something to drink . Where are you staying ? Who was the woman who answered the telephone ? Tell me all about Honora . Oh , you do look like a Wapshot . I would have been able to pick you out in a crowd . Is n't it nice to be able to recognize people ? There 's another Wapshot in New York . Justina . They say she used to play the piano in the five-and-ten-cent store but she 's very rich now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he looks better . Did you notice ? Of course , he still looks like a crook . Have a cocktail . " The butler passed Coverly a cocktail on a tray . He had never drunk a martini cocktail before and to conceal his inexperience he raised the glass to his lips and drained it . He did n't cough and sputter but his eyes swam with tears , the gin felt like fire and some oscillation or defense mechanism in his larynx began to palpitate in such a way that he found himself unable to speak . IIe settled down to a paroxysm of swallowing . " Of course , this is n't my idea of a decent room at all , " Cousin Mildred went on . " It 's all Harry 's idea . I 'd much rather have called in a decorator and gotten something comfortable but Harry 's mad for New England . He 's an adorable man and a wizard in the carpet business , but he does n't come from anyplace really . I mean he does n't have anything nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really more of a Wapshot than you or I. " " Does he know about Benjamin 's ear ? " Coverly asked hoarsely . It was still hard for him to speak . " My dear , he knows the family history backwards and forwards , " Cousin Mildred said . " He went to England and had the name traced back to Vaincre-Chaud and he got the crest . I 'm sure he knows more about Lorenzo than Honora ever did . He bought all these things from your mother and I must say he paid for them generously and I 'm not absolutely sure that your mother  --  I do n't mean to say that your mother was untruthful  --  but you know that old traveling desk that always used to be full of mice ? Well , your mother wrote and said that it belonged to Benjamin Franklin and I do n't ever remember having heard that before . " This hint or slur at his mother 's veracity made Coverly feel sad and homesick and annoyed with his cousin 's rattling conversational style and the pretentions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something about this , but the butler refilledhis glass again and when he took another gulp of gin the oscillations in his larynx began all over again and he could n't speak . Then Mr. Brewer came in  --  he was much shorter than his wife  --  a jolly pink-faced man with a quietness that might have been developed to complement the noise she made . " So you 're a Wapshot , " he said to Coverly when they shook hands . " Well , as Mildred may have told you , I 'm very much interested in the family . Most of these things come from the homestead in St. Botolphs . That cradle rocked four generations of the Wapshot family . It was made by the village undertaker . That tulip-wood table was made from a tree that stood on the lawn at West Farm . Lafayette rode under this tree in 1815 . The portrait over the mantelpiece is of Benjamin Wapshot . This chair belonged to Lorenzo Wapshot . He used it during his two terms in the state legislature . " With this Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of this relic beneath him a smile of such sensual gratification spread over his face that he might have been squeezed between two pretty women on a sofa . " Coverly has the nose , " Cousin Mildred said . " I 've told him that I could have pickedp121him out in a crowd . I mean I would have known that he was a Wapshot . It will be so nice having him work for you . I mean it will be so nice having a Wapshot in the firm . " It was quite some time before Mr. Brewer replied to this but he smiled broadly at Coverly all during the pause and so it was not an anxious silence and during it Coverly decided that he liked Mr. Brewer tremendously . " Of course , you 'll have to start at the bottom , " Mr. Brewer said . " Oh , yes sir , " Coverly exclaimed ; his father 's son . " I 'll do anythingsir . I 'm willing to do anything . " " Well , I would n't expect you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's earnestness , " but I think we might work out some kind of apprenticeship , so to speak  --  some arrangement whereby you could decide if you liked the carpet business and the carpet business could decide if it liked you . I think we can work out something . You 'll have to go through personnel research . We do t his with everyone . Grafley and Harmer do this for us and I 'll make you an appointment for tomorrow . If they 're done with you on Monday you can report to my office then and go to work . " Coverly was not familiar with a correct dinner service , but by watching Cousin Mildred he saw how to serve himself from the dishes that the waitress passed and he only got into trouble when he was about to drop his dessert into his finger bowl , but the waitress , by smiling and signaling , got him to move his finger bowl and everything went off all right . When dinner was finished they went down on the elevator and were driven through the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things that we are most often disappointedand it may be because the mind itself is such a huge and labyrinthine chamber that the Pantheon and the Acropolis Iurn out to be smaller than we had expected . At any rate , Coverly , who expected to be overwhelmed by the opera house , found it splendid but cozy . Their seats were in the orchestra , well forward . Coverly had no libretto and he could not understand what was going on . Now and then the plot would seem to be revealed to him but he was always mistaken and in the end more confusedp122than ever . He fell asleep twice . When the opera ended he said good night and thank you to Cousin Mildred and her husband in the lobby , feeling that it would be to his disadvantage to have them drive him back to the slum where he lived . Early the next morning Coverly reported to Grafley and Harmer , where he was given a common intelligence-quotient test . There were simple arithmetical problems , blocks to count and vocabulary tests , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better part of the morning . He was told to come back at two . He ate a sandwich and wandered around the streets . The window of a shoe-repair place on the East Side was filled with plants and reminded him of Mrs. Pluzinski 's kitchen window . When he returned to Grafley and Harmer he was shown a dozen or so cards with drawings or blots on them  --  a few of them colored  --  and asked by a stranger what the pictures reminded him of . This seemed easy , for since he had lived all his life between the river and the sea the drawings reminded him of fish bones , kelp , conch shells and other simples of the flood . The doctor 's face was inexpressive and he could n't tell if he had been successful . The doctor 's reserve seemed so impenetrable that it irritated Coverlythat two strangers should be closeted in an office to cultivate such an atmosphere of inhumanity . When he left he was told to report in the morning for two more examinations and an interview . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Coverly guessed they were all doctors  --  showed him a series of pictures or drawings . If they were like anything they were like the illustrations in a magazine although they were drawn crudely and with no verve or imagination . They presented a problem to Coverly , for when he glanced at the first few they seemed to remind him only of very morbid and unsavory things . He wondered at first if this was a furtive strain of morbidity in himself and if he would damage his chances at a job in the carpet works by speaking frankly . He wondered for only a second . Honesty was the best policy . All the pictures dealt with noisome frustrationsp123and when he was finished he felt irritable and unhappy . In the afternoon he was asked to complete a series of sentences . They all presented a problem or sought an attitude and since Coverly was worried about money  --  he had nearly run through his twenty-five dollars  --  he completed most of the sentences with references to money . He would be interviewed by a psychologist on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little nervous . A psychologist seemed as strange and formidable to him as a witch doctor . He felt that some baneful secret in his life might be exposed , but the worst he had ever done was masturbate and lookingback over his life and knowing no one of his age who had - not joined in on the sport he decided that this did not have the status of a secret . He decided to be as honest with the psychologist as possible . This decision comforted him a little and seemed to abate his nervousness . His appointment was for three o'clock and lie was kept waiting in an outer room where many orchids bloomed in pots . He wondered if he was being observed through a peephole . Then the doctor opened a double or soundproof door and invited Coverly in . The doctor was a young man with nothing like the inexpressive manners of the others . he meant to be friendly , although this was a difficult feeling to achieve since Coverly had never seen him before and would never see him again and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet factory . It was no climate for friendship . Coverly was given a very comfortable chair to sit in , but he cracked his knuckles nervously . " Now , suppose you tell me a little about yourself , " the doctor said . lie was very gentle and had a pad and a pencil for taking notes . " Well , my name is Coverly Wapshot , " Coverly said , " and I come from St. Botolphs . I guess you must know where that is . All the Wapshots live there . My great-grandfather was Benjamin Wapshot . My grandfather was Aaron . My mother 's family are Coverlys and ... " " Well I 'm not as interested in your genealogy , " the doctor said , " as I am in your emotional make-up . " It was an interruption , but it was a very courteous and friendly one . " Do you know what isp124meant by anxiety ? Do you have any feelings of anxiety ? Is there anything in your family , in your background that would incline you to anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My father 's very anxious about fire . He 's awfully afraid of burning to death . " " How do you know this ? " " Well , he 's got this rig up in his room , " Coverly said . " He 's got this suit of clothes  --  underwear and everything  --  hanging up beside his bed so in case of fire he can get dressed and out of the house in a minute . And he 's got buckets full of sand and water in all the hallways and the number of the fire department is painted on the wall by the telephone and on rainy days when he is n't working  --  sometimes he does n't work on rainy days  --  he spends most of the day going around the house sniffing . He thinks he smells smoke and sometimes it seems to me that he spends nearly a whole day going from room to room sniffing . " " Does your mother share this anxiety ? " the doctor asked . " No sir , " Coverly said . " My mother loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's afraid of crowds . I mean she 's afraid of being trapped . Sometimes on the Christmas holidays I 'd go into the city with her and when she got into a crowd in one of those big stores she 'd nearly have a fit . She 'd get pale and gasp for breath . She 'd pant . It was terrible . Well then she 'd grab hold of my hand and drag me out of there and go up some side street where there was n't anybody and sometimes it would be five or ten minutes before she got her breath back . In any place where my mother felt she was confined she 'd get very uneasy . In the movies , for instance  --  ifanybody in the movies was sent to jail or locked up in some small place why my mother would grab her hat and her purse and run out of that theater before you could say Jack Robinson . I used to have to sprint to keep up with her . " " Would you say that your parents were happy together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way , " Coverly said . " They 're married and they 're my parents and I guess they take the lean with the fat like everybody else but there 's one thing she used to tell me that left an impression on me. "  | " What was that ? " " Well , whenever I had a good time with Father  --  whenever he took me out on the boat or something  --  she always seemed to be waiting for me when we got home with this story . Well , it was about , it was about how I came to be , I suppose you 'd say . My father was working for the table-silver company at the time and they went into the city for some kind of banquet . Well , my mother had some cocktails and it was snowing and they had to spend the night in a hotel and one thing led to another but it seems that after this my father did n't want me to be born . " " Did your mother tell you this ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told me I should n't trust him because he wanted to kill me . She said he had this abortionist come out to the house and that if it had n't been for her courage I 'd be dead . She told me that story lots of times . " " Do you think this had any effect on your fundamental attitude toward your father ? " " Well , sir , I never thought about it but I guess maybe it did . I sometimes had a feeling that he might hurt me . I never used to like to wake up and hear him walking around the house late at night . But this was foolish because I knew he would n't hurt me . He never punished me . " " Did she punish you ? " " Well , not very often , but once she just laid my back open . I guess perhaps it was my fault . We went down to Travertine swimming  --  Iwas with Pete Meacham  --  and I decided to climb up on the roof of the bathhouse where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty thing to do but we had n't even hardly got started when the caretaker caught us . Well my mother took me home and she told me to get undressed and she took my greatgrandfather'sbuggy whip  --  that was Benjamin  --  and she just laid my back open . There was blood all over the wall . My back was such a mess she got scared , but of course she did n't dare call a doctor because it would be embarrassing , but the worst thing was I could n't go swimming for the rest of that summer . If I went swimming people would see these big sores on my back . I wasn'tp126able to go swimming all that summer . " " Do you think this had any effect on your fundamental attitude toward women ? " " Well , sir , where I come from , I think it 's hard to take much pride in being a man . I mean the women are very powerful . They are kind and they mean very well , but sometimes they get very oppressive . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man . Now there 's this story they tell about Howie Pritchard . On his wedding night he 's supposed to have put his foot into the chamber pot and pissed down his leg so his wife would n't hear the noise . I do n't think he should have done that . If you 're a man I think you ought to be proud and happy about it . " " Have you ever had any sexual experiences ? " " Twice , " Coverly said . " The first time was with Mrs. Maddern . I do n't suppose I should name her but everybody in the village knew about her and she was a widow . " " Your other experience ? " " That was with Mrs. Maddern too . " " Have you ever had any homosexual experiences ? " " Well , I guess I know what you mean , " Coverly said . " I did plenty of that when I was young but I swore off it a long time ago . But it seems to me that there 's an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I expected . There 's one in this place where I 'm living now . He 's always asking me to come in and look at his pictures . I wish he 'd leave me alone . You see , sir , if there 's one thing in the whole world that I would n't want to be it 's a fruit . " " Now would you like to tell me about your dreams ? " " I dream about all kinds of things , " Coverly said . " I dream about sailing and traveling and fishing but I guess mostly what you 're interested in is bad dreams , is n't it ? " " What do you mean by bad dreams ? " " Well , I dream I do it with this woman , " Coverly said . " I never saw this woman in real life . She 's one of those beautiful women you see on calendars in barbershops . And sometimes , " Coverly said , blushing and hanging his head , " I dream that I do it withp127men . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you dream in color ? " the doctor asked . " I 've never noticed , " Coverly said . " Well , I think our time is about up , " the doctor said . " Well , you see , sir , " Coverly said , " I do n't want you to think that I 've had an unhappy childhood . I guess what I 've told you does n't give you a true picture but I 've heard a little about psychologyand I guessed what you wanted to know about were things like that . I 've really had an awfully good time . We live on a farm and have a boat and plenty of hunting and fishing and just about the best food in the world . I 've had a happy time . " " Well , thank you , Mr. Wapshot , " the doctor said , " and good-by . " On Monday morning Coverly got up early and had his pans pressed as soon as the tailor shop opened . Then he walked to his cousin 's office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he said that he had n't she said that she could n't arrange one until Thursday . " But I 'm Mr. Brewer 's cousin , " Coverly said . " I 'm Coverly Wapshot . " The secretary only smiled and told him to come back on Thursday morning . Coverly was not worried . he knew that his cousin was occupied with many details and surrounded by executives and secretaries and that the problems of this distant Wapshot might have slipped his mind . I Lis only problem was one of money . He did n't have much left . I Ic had a hamburger and a glass of milk for supper and gave the landlady the rent that night when he came in . On Tuesday he ate n box of raisins for breakfast , having heard somewhere that raisins were healthful and filling . For supper he had a bun and a glass of milk . On Wednesday morning he bought a paper , which left him with sixty cents . In the help-wanted advertisements there were sonic openings for stock clerks and he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store and was told to return at the end of the week . He bought a quart of milk and marking the container off in three sections drank one section for breakfast , one for lunch and one for dinner . The hunger pains of a young man are excruciating and whenp128Coverly went to bed on Wednesday night he was doubled up with pain . On Thursday morning he had nothing to eat at all and spent the last of his money having his pants pressed . He walked to his cousin 's office and told the girl he had an appointment . She was cheerful and polite and asked him to sit down and wait . He waited for an hour . He was so hungry by this time that it was nearly impossible for him to sit up straight . Then the receptionist told him that no one in Mr. Brewer 's office knew about his appointment but that if he would return late in the afternoon she might be able to help him . He dozed on a park bench until four and returned to the office and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was final . Mr. Brewer was out of town . From there Coverly went to Cousin Mildred 's apartment house but the doorman stopped him and telephoned upstairs and was told that Mrs. Brewer could n't see anyone ; she was just leaving to keep an engagement . Coverly went outside the building and waited and in a few minutes Cousin Mildred came out and Coverly went up to her . " Oh yes , yes , " she said , when he told her what had happened . " Yes , of course . I thought Harry 's office must have told you . It 's something about your emotional picture . They think you 're unemployable . I 'm so sorry but there 's nothing I can do about it , is there ? Of course your grandfather was second crop . " She unfastenedher purse and took out a bill and handed it to Coverly and got into a taxi and drove away . Coverly wandered over to the park . It was dark then and he was tired , lost and despairing  --  no one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the shawls from India and the crows winging their way up the river valley like businessmen with brief cases , off to catch a bus ? This was on the Mall , the lights of the city burning through the trees and dimly lighting the air with the colors of reflected fire , and he saw the statues ranged along the broad walk like the tombs of kings  --  Columbus , Sir Walter Scott , Burns , Halleck and Morse  --  and he took from these dark shapes a faint comfort and hope . It was not their minds or their works he adored but the kindliness and warmth they must have possessed when they lived and so lonely and so bitter was he then that he would take those brasses andp129stones for company . Sir Walter Scott would be his friend , his Moses and Leander . Then he got some supper  --  this friend of Sir Walter Scott  --  and in the morning went to work as a stock clerk for Warburton 's DepartmentStore.  |p130Moses  ' work in Washington was highly secret  --  so secret that it ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after he arrived  --  areflection perhaps of Mr. Boynton 's indebtedness to Honora or a recognition of Moses ' suitability , for with his plain and handsome face and his descendance from a man who had been offered a decoration by General Washington , he fitted into the scene well enough . He was not smooth  --  the Wapshots never were  --  and compared to Mr. Boynton he sometimes felt like a man who eats his peas off a knife . His boss was a man who seemed to have been conceived in the atmosphere of career diplomacy . I 1 is clothes , his manners , his speech and habits of thought all seemed so prescribed , so intricately connected to one another that they suggested a system of conduct . It was not , Moses guessed , a systcmmm evolved at any of the eastern colleges and may have been formed in some foreign-service school . Its rules were never shown to Moses , so he could not abide by them , but he knew that rules must tin derlie this sartorial and intellectual diffidence . Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , and found it tenanted mostly by people of his own age : the sons and daughters of mayors and other politicians ; the prang eny of respectable ward heelers who were in Washington , like himp131self , as the result of some indebtedness . He did not spend much time at the boardinghouse for he found that much of his social , athletic and spiritual life was ordained by the agency where he worked . This included playing volleyball , taking communion and going to parties at the X Embassy and the Z Legation . He was up to all of this although he was not allowed to drink more than three cocktails at any party and was careful not to make eyes at any woman who was in government service or on the diplomatic list , for security regulations had clapped a lid on the natural concupiscenceof a city with a large floating population . On the autumn week ends he sometimes drove with Mr. Boynton to Clark County , where they went riding and sometimes stayed for dinner with Mr. loynton 's friends . Moses could stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . It was a chance to see the countryside and the disappointing southern autumn with its fireflies and brumes , all of which stirred in him a longing for the brilliance of autumn at West Farm . Mr. Boynton 's friends were hospitable people who lived in splendid houses and who , without exception , had made or inheritedtheir money from some distant source such as mouthwash , airplane engines or beer ; but it was not in Moses to sit on some broad terrace and observe that the bills for this charming picture had been footed by some dead brewer ; and as for brewing he had never drunk such good bourbon in his life . It was true that , having come from a small place where a man 's knowledge of his neighbors was intimate and thorough , Moses sometimes experienced the blues of uprootedness . His knowledge of his companions was no better than the knowledge travelers have of one another and he knew , by then , enough of the city to know that , waiting for a bus in the morning , the swarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian prince in good standing or he might be a rooming - house eccentric . This theatrical atmosphere of impermanence  --  this latitudefor imposture  --  impressed him one evening at an embassy concert . He was alone and had gone , at the intermission , out onto the steps of the building to get some air . As he pushed open the doors he noticed three old women on the steps . One was so fat , one so thin and haggard and one had such a foolish countenancep132that they looked like a representation of human folly . Their eveningclothes reminded him of the raggle-taggle elegance of children on Halloween . They had shawls and fans and mantillas and brilliantsand their shoes seemed to be killing them . When Moses opened the door they slipped into the embassy  --  the fat one , the thin one and the fool  --  so warry , so frightened and in such attitudes of wrongdoing that Moses watched . As soon as they got inside the building they fanned out and each of them seized a concert programthat had been left on a chair or fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and as soon as they were discovered they headed for the door and fled , but they were not disappointed , Moses noticed . The purpose of their expedition had been to get a program and they limped happily down the driveway in their finery . You would n't see anything like that in St. Botolphs . The man who had the room next to Moses in the boardinghouse was the son of a politician from somewhere in the West . He was competent and personable and an ideal of thrift and continence . He did not smoke or drink and saved every penny of his salary toward the purchase of half a saddle horse that was stabled in Virginia . He had been in Washington for two years and he invited Moses into his room one night and showed him a chart or graph on which he had recorded his social progress . He had been to dinner in Georgetown eighteen times . His hosts were all listed and graded according to their importance in the government . He had been to the Pan-American Union four times : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time ( a garden party ) and to the White House one time ( a press reception ) . You would n't find anything like that in St. Botolphs . The intense and general concern with loyalty at the time when Moses arrived in Washington had made it possible for men and women to be discharged and disgraced on the evidence of a breath of scandal . Old-timers like to talk about the past when even the girls in the Library of Congress  --  even the archivists  --  could be booked for a clandestine week end at Virginia Beach , but these days were gone or at least in suspense for government servants . Public drunkenness was unforgivable and promiscuity was death.  |p133Private  industry went its own way and a friend of Moses ' who was in the meat-packing industry once made him this proposition : " I 've got four dirty girls coming up from the shirt factory in Baltimore Saturday and I 'm going to take them out to my cabin in Maryland . How about it ? Just you and me and the four of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moses said no thanks  --  he would have said so anyhow  --  but he envied the meat packer his liberty . This new morality was often on his mind and by thinking about it long enough he was able to make some dim but legitimate connectionbetween lechery and espionage , but this understanding did nothing to lessen this particular loneliness . He even wrote to Rosalie , asking her to visit him for a week end , but she never answered . The government was full of comely women but they all avoided the dark . Feeling lonely one night and having nothing better to do he went out for a walk . He headed for the center of town and went into the lobby of the Mayflower to buy a package of cigarettes and to look around at a place that , for all its intended elegance , only reminded him of the vastness of his native land . Moses loved the lobby of the Mayflower . A convention was meeting and red-necked and self-respecting men from country towns were gathering in the lobby . Listening to them talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the Mayflower and walked deeper into the city , and hearing music and being on a fool 's errand he stepped into a place called the Marine Room and looked around . There were a band and dance floor and a girl singing . Sitting alone at a table was a blonde woman who seemed pretty at that distance and who looked as if she did n't work for the government . Moses took the table beside her and ordered a whisky . She did not see him at first because she was looking at herself in a mirror on the wall . She was turning her head , first one way and then another , raising her chin and taking the tips of her fingers and pushing her face into the firm lines that it must have had five or six years ago . When she had finished examining herself Moses asked if he could join her and buy her a drink . She was friendly  --  a little flurried  --  but pleased . " Well , it would be very nice to have your company , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Chucky Ewing , the band leader , is my husband and when I do n't have anything better to do I just come down here and kill time . " Moses joined her and bought her a drink and after a few farewell looks at herself in the mirror she began to talk about her past . " I used to vocalize with the band myself , " she said , " but most of my training is operatic . I 've sung in night clubs all over the world . Paris . London . New York ... " She spoke , not with a lisp , but with an articulation that seemed childish . Her hair was pretty and her skin was white but this was mostly powder . Moses guessed that it would have been five or six years since she could be called beautiful but since she seemed determined to cling to what she had been he was ready to string along . " Of course , I 'm really not a professional entertainer , " she went on . " I went to finishing school and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very stuffy . Old family and all that sort of thing . Cliff dwellers . " Then the band broke and her husband joined them and was introduced to Moses and sat down . " What 's the score , honey ? " he asked his wife . " There 's a table in the corner drinking champagne , " she said , " and the six gentlemen by the bandstand are drinking rye and water . They 've each had four . There 're two tables of Scotch and five tables of bourbon and some beer drinkers over on the other side of the bandstand . " She counted the tables off on her fingers , still speaking in a very dainty voice . " Do n't worry , " she told her husband . " You 'll gross three hundred . " " Where 's the convention ? " he said . " There 's a convention . " " I know , " she said . " Sheets and pillowcases . Do n't worry . " " You got any hot garbage ? " he asked a waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes sir , " the waiter said . " I 've got some delicious hot garbage . I can give you coffee grounds with a little sausage grease or how about some nice lemon rinds and sawdust ? " " That sounds good , " the band leader said . " Make it lemon rinds and sawdust . " He had seemed anxious and unhappy when he came to the table but this leg-pulling with the waiter cheered him up.  | " You got any dishwater ? " he asked . " We got all kinds of dishwater , " the waiter said . " We got greasy dishwater and we got dishwater with stuff floating around in it and we got moth balls and wet newspaper . " " Well , give me a little wet newspaper with my sawdust , " the band leader said , " and a glass of greasy dishwater . " Then he turned to his wife . " You going home ? " " I believe that I will , " she said daintily . " Okay , okay , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nice to have met you . " He nodded to Moses and went back to the bandstand , where the other players had begun to stray in from the alley . " Can I take you home ? " Moses asked . " Well , I do n't know , " she said . " We just have a little apartment in the neighborhood and I usually walk but I do n't think there 'd be any harm in you walking me home . " " Go ? " She got a coat from the hat-check girl and talked with the batcheckgirl about a four-year-old child who was lost in the woods of Wisconsin . The child 's name was Pamela and she had been gone four days . Extensive search parties had been organized and the two women speculated with deep anxiety on whether or not little I'amla had died of exposure and starvation . When this conversa-f ion ended , Beatrice  --  which was her name  --  started down the hall , but the hat-check girl called her back and gave her a paper bag . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Beatrice explained that the hat-check girl kept an eye on the ladies ' room and gave Beatrice whatever was left there . She seemed ashamed of the arrangement , but she recuperated in a second and took Moses ' arm . Their place was near the Marine Room  --  a second-story bedroom dominated by a large cardboard wardrobe that seemed on the verge or in the process of collapse . She struggled to open one of its warped doors and exposed a magpie wardrobe  --  maybe a hundred dresses of all kinds . She went into the bathroom and returned , wearing a kind of mandarin coat with a dragon embroidered up the back out of threads that felt thorny to Moses ' hands . Shep136yielded easily but when it was over she sobbed a little in the dark and asked , " Oh dear , what have we done ? " Her voice was as dainty as ever . " Nobody ever likes me except in this way , " she said , " but I think it 's because I was brought up so strictly . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , she was so strict . I was never allowed to play with other children . . . . " Moses dressed , kissed her good night and got out of the building without being seen.  |p137Back  at the farm Leander had banked the foundations of the old house with seaweed and had hired Mr. Pluzinski to clear the garden . His sons wrote him once or twice a month and he wrote them both weekly . He longed to see them and often thought , when he was drinking bourbon , of traveling to New York and Washington , but in the light of morning he could n't find it in himself to ever leave St. Botolphs again . After all , he had seen the world . He was alone a lot of the time , for Lulu was spending three days a week with her daughter in the village and Mrs. Wapshot was working three days a week as a clerk in the Anna Marie Louise Gift Shoppe in Travertine . It was made clear to everyone , by Sarah 's mien , that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing it because she loved to , and this was the truth . All the energies that she possessed  --  and that she had used so well in improving the village  --  seemed to have centered at last in an interest in gift shops . She wanted to open a gift shop in the front parlor of the farmhouse . She even dreamed of this project , but it was something Leander would n't discuss . It was hard to say why the subject of gift shops should excite , on one hand , Sarah 's will to live , and on the other , Leander 's bitterestscorn . As Mrs. Wapshot stood by a table loaded with colored/glass vases and gave a churchly smile to her friends and neighbors when they came in to spend a little money and pass the time , her equilibrium seemed wonderfully secure . This love of gift shops  --  this taste for ornamentation  --  may have been developed by the colorless surface of that shinbone coast or it may have been a most natural longing for sensual trivia . When she exclaimed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is n't it lovely ? " she was perfectly sincere . The gossip and the company of the customerslet her be as gregarious as she had ever been in the Woman 's Club ; and people had always sought her out . The pleasure of selling things and putting silver and bills into the old tin box that was used for this purpose pleased her immensely , for she had sold nothing before in her life but the furniture in the barn to Cousin Mildred . She liked talking with the salesmen and Anna Marie Louise asked her advice about buying glass swans , ash trays and cigarette boxes . With some money of her own she bought two dozen bud vases that Anna Marie Louise had not wanted to buy . When the bud vases came she unpacked the barrel herself , tearing her dress on a nail and getting excelsior all over the place . Then she washed the vases and , arranging a paper rose in one , put it into the window . ( She had had a lifelong aversion to paper flowers , but what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vase had been put in the window it was sold and in three days they were all gone . She was very excited , but she could not talk it over with Leander and could only tell Lulu in the kitchen . To have his wife work at all raised for Leander the fine point of sexual prerogatives and having made one great mistake in going into debt to Honora he did n't want to make another . When Sarah announced that she wanted to work for Anna Marie Louise he thought the matter over carefully and decided against it . " I do n't want you to work , Sarah , " he said . " You do n't have anything to say about it , " Sarah said . That was that . The question went beyond sexual prerogatives into tradition , for much of what Sarah sold was ornamented with ships at sea and was meant to stir romantic memories of the great days of St. Botolphs as a port . Now in his lifetime Leander had seen , raised on the ruins of that coast andp139port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , restaurants , tearooms and bars where people drank their gin by candlelight , surroundedsometimes by plows , fish nets , binnacle lights and other relics of an arduous and orderly way of life of which they knew nothing . Leander thought that an old dory planted with petunias was a pretty sight but when he stepped into a newly opened saloon in Travertine and found that the bar itself was made of a bifurcated dory he felt as if he had seen a ghost . He spent much time in his pleasant room on the southwest corner of the house , with its view of the river and the roofs of the village , writing his journal . He meant to be honest and it seemed , in recording his past , that he was able to strike a level of candor that he had only known in his most lucky friendships . Young and old , he had always been quick to get out of his clothes , and now he was reminded of the mixed pleasures of nakedness .

He was a widower who had a house somewhere to the north where he went for week ends and who pinched pennies by living in the rooming house so that he would have a comfortable retirement . Ile had a job with Civil Service and it was his feeling that Coverly should get on the Civil Service lists . He brought him those newspapersthat list Civil Service openings and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trained by the Civil Service schools in the city . There was a demand that year for Tapers and he pointed this out to Coverly as his best bet . The government would pay half of Coverly 's tuition at the Macllhenney Institute . It was a fourmonthcourse and if he passed his exams he would be taken into government service at seventy-five dollars a week . Advised and encouraged by his friend , Coverly enrolled in some night classes on Taping . This involved the translation of physics experiments into the symbols  --  or tape  --  that could be fed into a computation machine . Coverly 's schedule went like this . He punched Warburton'sp154time clock at half-past eight and went down a back staircase into the basement . The air was spectacularly bad : the reek and the closeness of a department store backstage . The other stock boys were of varying ages  --  one of them was in his sixties  --  and they were all amused by Coverly 's catarrhal accent and his references to life in St. Botolphs . They unpacked the merchandise as it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departments overhead . When there were sales they worked sometimes as late as midnight , unloading racks of fur-trimmed coats or cartons of bed sheets . On three nights a week , when Coverly had finished work at Warburton 's , he signed the monitor 's book at the MacIlhenney Institute . This was in the fourth floor of an office building that seemed to contain a good many other schools  --  institutes of portrait photography , journalism and music . The only elevator that ran in the evening was a freight elevator , operated by an old man in overalls who could , by pursing his lips , give a fairly good imitation of a French horn . He performed the William Tell Overture while he took his passengers up and down and he liked to be complimented . There were twenty-four students in Coverly 's class and the instructor was a young man who seemed to have put in a hard day himself by the time he got to them . The first lecture was an orientation talk on cybernetics or automation , and it Coverly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any irony in his future relationship to a thinking machinehe was swiftly disabused . Then they got to work memorizing the code . This was like learning a language and a rudimentary one . Eve thing was done by rote . They were expected to memorize fif symbols a week . They were quizzed for fifteen minutes at th opening of each class and were given speed tests at the end c the two-hour period . After a month of this the symbols  --  like the study of any language  --  had begun to dominate Coverly 's thinking and walking on the street he had gotten into the habit of rcgrou ing numbers on license plates , prices in store windows and numerals on clocks so that they could be fed into a machine . When the class ended he sometimes drank a cup of coffee with a friend whoP155was going to school five nights a week . His name was Mittler and his second enrollment was at Dale Carnegie 's and Coverly was very much impressed with how likeable Mittler had learned to make himself . Moses came over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the streets and drinking beer but when it came time for Moses to go back the separation was so painful for both of them that Moses never returned . Coverly planned to go to St. Botolphs for Christmas but he had a chance to work overtime on Christmas Eve and he took it , for he was in the city , after all , to make his fortune . All things of the sea belong to Venus ; pearls and shells and alchemists ' gold and kelp and the riggish smell of neap tides , the inshore water green , and purple further out and the joy of distancesand the roar of falling masonry , all these are hers , but she does n't come out of the sea for all of us . She came for Coverly through the swinging door of a sandwich shop in the Forties where he had gone to get something to eat after classes at the MacllhenneyInstitute . She was a thin , dark-haired girl named Betsey MacCaffery  --  raisedin the badlands of northern Georgia  --  an orphan , her eyes red that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . She brought him a glass of milk and a sandwich in an envelope and then went to the far end of the counter and began to wash glasses . Now and then she took a deep , tremulous breath  --  a sound that made her seem to Coverly , as she bent over the sink , tender and naked . When he had eaten half his sandwich he spoke to her : " Why are you crying ? " " Oh Jesus , " she said . " I know I should n't be here crying in front of strangers , but the boss just came in and found me smoking a cigarette and he gave me hell . There was n't anybody in the store . Its always slow this late on rainy nights , but he ca n't blame me for that , can he ? I do n't have anything to do with the rain and I just ca n't stand out there in the rain asking people to come In . Well , it was slow and there had n't been anybody in for nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out backp156and lighted a cigarette and then he came right in , sniffing like a pig , and gave me hell . He said these awful things about me . " " You should n't pay any attention to what he says . " " You English ? " " No , " Coverly said . " I come from a place called St. Botolphs . It 's a small town , north of here . " " The reason I asked was you do n't talk like the others . I come from a small town myself . I 'm just a small-town girl . I guess maybe that 's the trouble with me . I do n't have this thick skin you need to get along with in the city . I had so much trouble this week . I just took this apartment with my girl friend . I have or perhaps I should say I had this girl friend , Helen Bent . I thought she was my true-blue friend ; true-blue . She certainly led me to believe she was my best friend . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to take an apartment together . We were inseparable . That 's what people used to say about us . You ca n't ask Betsey unless you ask Helen , they used to say . Those two arc inseparable . Well , we took this apartment together , my girl friend and I. That was about a month ago ; a month or six weeks . Well , just as soon as we got moved in and settled and about to enjoy ourselves I discover that the whole thing is just a scheme . Theonly reason she wants to share this apartment with me is so she can meet men there . Formerly she was living with her family outin Queens . Well , I do n't have any objections to having a boy friend now and then but it was only a one-room apartment and she was having them in every night and naturally it was very embarrassing for me . There were men going in and out of there so much that it did n't seem like home to me . Why , sometimes when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whet ( ' I was paying rent and had all my own furniture I 'd just feel so heavyhearted about busting in on her with one of her friends that I 'd go and sit in a late movie . Well , I finally spoke to her . Helen , I said , this place does n't seem like home to me . There 's no setain my paying rent , I said , if I have to take up residence in a mov house . Well , she certainly showed her true colors . Oh , the spit ful things she said . When I come home the next day she 's gop157television set and all . I was glad to see the last of her , of course , but I 'm stuck with this apartment with nobody to share the rent and in a job like this I do n't have any occasion to make girl friends . " She asked Coverly if he wanted anything more . It was nearly time to close and Coverly asked if he could walk her home . " You sure come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Anybodycould tell you come from a small town , asking if you can walk me home , but it so happens I just live five blocks from here and I do walk home and I do n't guess it would do me any harm , providing you do n't get fresh . I 've had too much of freshness . You 've got to promise that you wo n't be fresh . " " I promise , " Coverly said . She talked on and on while she made the preparations for closingthe store and when these were finished she put on a hat and coat and stepped with Coverly out into the rain . He was delighted with her company . ' What a citizen of New York , he thought  --  walking a counter girl home in the rain . As they approached her house she reminded him of his promise not to be fresh and he did n't ask to come up , but he asked her to have dinner with him some night . " Well , I 'd adore to , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Sunday 's all right with you I 'd adore to have dinner with you on Sunday night . There 's this nice Italian restaurant right around the corner we can go to  --  I 've never been there , but this former girl friend of mine told me it was very good  --  excellent cooking , and if you could pick me up at around seven ... " Coverly watched her walk through the lighted hall to the inner door , a thin girl and not a very graceful one , feeling , as surely as the swan recognizes its mate , that he was in love.  |p158Northeaster  ( Leander wrote ) . Wind backed from SW. 3rd equinoctialdisturbance of season . All in love is not larky and fractious .  --  In the attic the broken harp-string music of water . dropping into pails and pans had begun and , feeling chilled and exposed to the somber view of the river in the rain , he put away his papers and went down the stairs . Sarah was in Travertine . Lulu was away . He went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lighting a fire  --  in watching how it caught , in sniffing the perfume of clean wood and feeling the heat as it reached his hands and then went through his clothes . When he was warm he went to the window to see the dark day . He was surprised to see a car turn in the gates and come up the drive . It was one of the old sedans from the taxi stand at the station . The car stopped at the side door and he saw a woman lean forward and talk to the driver . He did not recognize the passenger  --  she was plain and gray-haired  --  and he guessed that she was one of Sarah 's friends . He watched her from the window . She opened the door of the car and walked up , through the thin curtain of rain that fell from the broken gutters , to the door . Leander was glad for any company and he went down the hall and opened the door before she rang.  | He saw a very plain woman , her coat darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hat was trimmed gaily with hard white feathers , like the feathers that are used to balance badmintonbirds , and her coat was worn . Leander had seen , he thought , hundreds of her kind . They were the imprimatur of New England . Dutiful , pious and hardy , they seemed to have patterned their spirits after the weeds that grow in high pastures . They were the women , Leander thought , after whom the dirty boats of themackerel fleet were named : Alice , Esther , Agnes , Maybelle andRuth . That there should be feathers in her hat , that an ugly pinmade of seashells should be pinned to her flat breast , that there should be anything feminine , any ornament on such a discouragingfigure , seemed to Leander touching . I " Come in , " Leander said . " I expect you 're looking for Mrs. Wapshot ? " " I think you 're the gentleman I 'm looking for , " she said with a look so troubled and shy that Leander glanced down at his clothes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I 'm Leander Wapshot . Come in , come in out of the rain . Come into the parlor . I have a little fire . " She followed Leander along the hall and he opened the door to the back parlor . " Sit down , " he said . " Sit in the red chair . Sit by the fire . Give your clothes a chance to dry out . " " You have quite a big house here , Mr. Wapshot , " she said . " It 's too big , " Leander said . " Do you know how many doors there are in this house ? There are one hundred and twenty-two doors in this house . Now what was it that you wanted to see me about ? " She made a sniffling sound as if she had a cold or might even have been crying and began to unbuckle a heavy brief case that she carried . " Your name was given to me by an acquaintance .

Dr. Bartholomew , the director of the institute , has divided human knowledge into seven branches .

" Dr. Bartholomew thinks it 's more a question of inclination than background , " the stranger said . " Many people who 've been fortunate enough to have a college education are still ineligible by Dr. Bartholomew 's standards . " She spoke without emphasis or feeling , almost with dread , as if she had come about something else , and she kept her eyes on the floor . " Educators all over the world and some of the crowned heads of Europe have endorsed Dr. Bartholomew 's methods and Dr. Bartholomew 's essay on The Science of Religion ' is in the Royal Library in Holland . I have a picture of Dr. Bartholomew here and ... " " Who gave you my name ? " Leander asked again . " Daddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She began to wring her hands . " He died last summer . Oh , he was good to me , he was like a real daddy , there was n't anything in the world that he would n't do for me . He was my best beau . On Sundays we used to take walks together . He was awfully intelligent but they cheated him . They did him out of everything . He was n't afraid , though , he was n't afraid of anything . Once we went to a show in Boston . That was on my birthday . He bought these expensiveseats . They were supposed to be in the orchestra but when we came to sit in them they put us in the balcony . We paid for orchestra seats  --  he told me  --  and we 're going down and sit in that orchestra . So he took my hand and we went downstairs and he told the usher  --  he was one of those stuck-up fellows  --  we paid for orchestra seats and we 're going to sit in that orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think about . He never let me go anywherewithout him . And then he died last summer . " Where is your home ? " Leander asked . " Nahant . " " Nahant ? " " Yes . Daddy told me everything . " " What do you mean ? " Leander said . " Daddy told me everything . He told me how you came there after dark , like thieves , he said , and about how Mr. Whittier paidp161for everything and how Mother kept me from drinking her wicked milk . " " Who are you ? " Leander said . " I 'm your daughter . " " Oh no , " Leander said . " You 're lying . You 're a crazy woman . Get out of here . " " I 'm your daughter . " " Oh no , " Leander said .

You never gave me a thought . Now I want some money . After Daddy died I sold the house and I had a little money and then I had to take this work . It 's hard for me . It 's too hard for me . I 'm not strong . I 'm out in all weathers . I want some money . " " I do n't have anything to give you . " " That 's what Daddy said . He said you 'd try to get out of helping me .

" God will be your judge , " she said at the door , " but I know mny rights and I can bring you into court and blacken your name . " Then she went down the hall and when she got to the door Leander called after her , " Wait , wait , wait , please , " and went down the hall . " I can give you something , " he said . " I have a few things left . I have a jade watch fob and a golden chain and I can show you your mother 's grave . It 's in the village . " " I would spit on it , " she said . " I would spit on it . " Then she went out of the house to where the taxi was waiting and drove away.  |p162A  week or ten days after his dinner with Betsey , Coverly moved into her apartment . This took a lot of persuasion on Coverly 's part but her resistance pleased him and seemed to express the seriousnesswith which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she needed someone to look out for her , on the fact that she did not have , as she had said herself , the thickness of skin the city demanded . Coverly 's feelings about her helplessnesswere poetic and absorbing and when he thought of her in her absence it was with a mixture of pity and bellicoseness . She was alone and he would defend her . There was this and there was the fact that their relationship unfolded with great validity and this informal marriage or union , played out in a strange and great city , made Coverly very happy . She was the beloved ; he was the lover -- there was never any question about this and this suited Coverly 's disposition and gave to his courtship and their life together the liveliness of a pursuit . Her search for friends had been arduous and disappointing and it was these disappointments and exasperationsthat Coverly was able to redress . There was no pretentiousnessin her  --  no memories of either hunt balls or razorback hogs  --  and she was ready and willing to cook his supper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her grandmother , who hadp163wanted her to be a schoolteacher , and she had disliked the South so much that she had taken any job to get out of it . He recognizedher defenselessness , but he recognized , at a much deeper level , her human excellence , the touching qualities of a wanderer , for she was that and said so and while she would play all the parts of love she would not tell him that she was in love . On the week ends they took walks , subway and ferryboat rides , and talked over their plans and their tastes , and late in the winter Coverly asked her to marry him . Betsey 's reaction was scattered , tearful and sweet , and Coverly wrote his plans in a letter to St. Botolphs . Ile wanted to marry as soon as he had passed his civil-service examinationsand had been assigned to one of the rocket-launching stations where Tapers were employed . He enclosed a photograph of Betsey , but he would not bring his bride to St. Botolphs until he was given a vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that Betsey 's southern accent and sometimes fractiousmanner might not go down with Honora and that the sensiblething to do would be to marry and produce a son before IIonora saw his wife . Leander may have sensed this  --  his letters to Coverly were all congratulatory and affectionate  --  and it may have been at the back of his mind that with Coverly married they might soon all be on Easy Street . It would be way at the back of his mind . Sarah was heartbroken to know that Coverly would not l ) c married at Christ Church . Coverly passed his exams with flying colors in April and was surprised when the MacIlhenney Institute had a graduation ceremony . This was held in the fifth floor of the building in an academy of piano teaching where two classrooms had been thrown together to make an auditorium . All of Coverley 's classmates appeared with their families or their wives , and Betsey wore a new hat . A lady , a stranger to them all , played " Pomp and Circumstance " on the piano and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the room and got their diplomas from Mr. MacIlhenney . Then they went down to the fourth floor where they found Mrs. MacIlhenneystanding by a rented tea urn and a plate of Danish pastry . Coverly and Betsey were married the next morning at thep164Church of the Transfiguration . Mittler was the only witness and they spent a three-day honeymoon on an island cottage that Mitticr owned and loaned them . Sarah wrote Coverly a long letter about what she would send him from the farm when he was settled  --  the Canton china and the painted chairs  --  and Leander wrote a letter in which he said , among other things , that to make a son was as easy as blowing a feather off your knee . Honora sent them a check for two hundred dollars , but no message . Coverly passed his Civil Service examinations and was qualified as a Taper . He knew , by then , the location of most of the rocketlaunchingbases in the country and as soon as he was settled he would send for Betsey and they would begin their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut at an army base and he was given transportation by the air force . his orders were cut in code . A week after his marriage he boarded an old C-54 with bucket seats and found himself , next day , in an airfield outside San Francisco . His feeling then was that he would be sent to Oregon or flown back to one of the desert stations . Ile telephoned Betsey and she cried when she heard his voice but he assured her that in a week or ten days they would be together again in a house of their own . He was very uxorious and lay down each night in his army bunk with Betsey 's specter , slept with her shade in his arms and woke each morning with powerful longings for his sandwich-shop Venus and wife . There was some delay about the second stage of his journey and he was kept at the air-force base in San Francisco for nearly a week . We all , man and boy , know what a transient barracks looks like and there would be no point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian did not give him any freedom and whether he went to the officers ' club or the movies he had to report his whereabouts to the orderly room . He could see the hills of San Francisco across the bay and , thinking that this city  --  or some firing grounds in the vicinity  --  would be his destination , he wrote hopefully to Betsey about her coming West . " It was cold in the barracks last night and I sure wish you 'd been in bed with me to warm it up . " And so forth and so on . He lived amongp165a dozen or so men who seemed to have been withdrawn from permanent installations in the Pacific because they were unfit . The most articulate of these was a Mexican who had not been able to stomach army food because there were no peppers in it . He told his story to anyone who would listen . As soon as he started eating army food he lost weight . He knew what the trouble was . He needed peppers . He had eaten peppers all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peppery . He pleaded with army cooks and doctors to get him some peppers but they would n't take his pleas seriously . He wrote to his Momma and she sent him some pepper seeds in an envelope and he planted them around an anti-aircraft gun emplacement where the soil was rich and where there was plenty of sun . He watered them and tended them and they had just begun to sprout when the commanding officer ordered them to be plowed under . It was unmilitary to raise vegetables on a gun emplacement . This order broke the Mexican 's spirit . He lost weight ; he became so emaciated that he had to be sent to the infirmary ; and now he was being discharged from the army as a mental incompetent . He would have been happy to serve his flag , he said , if he could have peppers in his food . His plaint seemed reasonable enough but it got tiresome night after night and Coverlyusually stayed out of the barracks until the lights were off . He ate his meals at the officers ' club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drank a glass of ginger ale at the bar and went to the movies . He saw Westerns , gangster careers , tales of happy and unhappy love both in brilliant colors and in black and white . He was sitting in the movies one evening when the publicaddresssystem called : " Attention , attention everybody . Will the following men report to Building Thirty-two with their gear . Private Joseph Di Gacinto . Private Henry Wollaston . Lieutenant Marvin Smythe . Mister Coverly Wapshot . . . " The audience hooted and whistled and called , " You 'll be sorreee , " as they went out into the dark . Coverly got his valise and went over to Building Thirty-two and was driven with the rest of the men to the airfield . They all had some theory about their destination . They were going to Oregon , Alaska or Japan . It had never occurred to Coverly thatp166he might be leaving the country and he was worried . He pinned his hopes on Oregon but decided that if his destination was Alaska Betsey could follow him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shut and they taxied down the runway and took off . It was an old transport with a conservative speed , Coverly guessed , and if their destination was Oregon they would reach there before dawn . The plane was hot and stuffy and he fell asleep , and waking at dawn and looking from the port he saw that they were high over the Pacific . They flew westward all day , shooting crap and reading the Bible , which was all they had to read , and at dusk they picked up the lights of Diamond Head and landed on Oahu . Coverly was assigned a bunk in another transient barracks and told to report to the airfield in the morning . No one would tell him if his travels were over , but he guessed , from the looks of the orderly-room clerks , that he had some way to go . He got rid of his valise and hitched a ride on a weapons carrier into Honolulu . It was a hot , stale-smelling night with thunder in the mountains . Memories of Thaddeus and Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked in the footsteps of many Wapshots , but this was not much of a consolation . Half a world lay between him and Betsey , and all his plans of happiness , children , and the honor of the family name seemed cruelly suspended or destroyed . He saw a sign on a wall that said : AIRMAIL AN ORCHID LEI TO YOUR SWEETHEART FOR AS LITTLE AS THREE DOLLARS . This would be away of expressing his tender feelings for Betsey and he asked an MP near the old palace where he could get a lei . He followed the MP 's directions and rang the bell of a house where a fat woman in evening clothes let him in . " I want a lei , " Coverly said sadly . " Well , you come to the right place , honey , " she said . " You come right in . You come right in and have a drink and I 'll fix you up in a few minutes . " She took his arm and led him into a little parlor where some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " Coverly said suddenly . " There 's some mistake . You see , I 'm married . " " Well , that do n't make no difference , " the fat lady said . " More'iip167half the girls I got working for me 's married and I been happily married for nineteen years myself . " " There 's been a mistake , " Coverly said . " Well , make up your mind , " the fat woman said . " You come in here telling me you want to get laid and I 'm doing the best I can for you . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " Coverly said , and he was gone . In the morning he boarded another plane and flew all day . A little before dark they circled for a landing and out of the ports Coverly could see , in the stormy light , a long , scimitar-shaped atoll with surf breaking on one coast , a huddle of buildings and a rocket-launching platform . The airstrip was small and the pilot took three passes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and crossed the strip to an office where a clerk translated his orders . He was on Island 93  --  an installation that was half military and half civilian . His tour of duty would be nine months with a two-week vacation at a rest camp in either Manila or Brisbane ; take your pick.  |p168Moses  was promoted and he bought a car and rented an apart ment . He worked hard at his office and still had a lot of nightwork assigned to him by Mr. Boynton . He saw Beatrice about once a week . This was a pleasant and irresponsible arrangement for he discovered very soon that Beatrice 's marriage had gone on the rocks long before he had stepped into the Marine Room . Chucks ' was going around with the girl who sang in the band and Beatrice liked to talk about his perfidy and ingratitude . She had given hini the money to organize the band . She had supported him . Slie had even bought his clothes . Beatrice meant to speak bitterly , but it was n't in her . The dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them any of the deeper notes of human trouble . She had trouble  --  plenty of it  --  but she could n't get it into her voice . She was thinking of traveling and spoke of beginning a new life in Mexico , Italy or France . She said she had plenty of money although if this was so Moses wondered why she put up with a broken-down cardboard wardrobe and wore such dilapi dated furs . Going unexpectedly to her apartment one night , Moses was not let in until he had cooled his heels in the hallway for some time . From the noises inside he figured that she was entertaininganother caller and when he was finally let in he wondered if his rival was hidden in the bathroom or stuffed into the ward/robe . But he was not in any way concerned with the life she led and he stayed long enough to smoke a cigarette and then went out to a movie . It was the kind of relationship that was useful and peaceable enough until Moses began to lose interest and then Beatrice got ardent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she called his apartment , sometimes nightly , and when he went to see her she would cry and tell him about her artificial and socially ambitious mother and the sternness of Clancy . She moved from her apartment to a hotel and he helped carry her bags . She moved from this hotel to another and he helped her again . One early evening when he had just come in from supper she telephoned to say that she had gotten a singing engagement in Clevelandand would Moses put her on the train ? He said that he would . She said she was home and gave him another address and he took a taxi . The address was a delicatessen . He thought that perhaps her mother , in somewhat reduced circumstances , might have taken an apartment above the store , but there was no apartment entranceand he looked into the delicatessen . There in the back , dressed in a hat and coat and surrounded by suitcases , sat Beatrice . She was crying and her eyes were red . " Oh , thank you for coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . " I 'll be ready to go in just a minute . I want to catch my breath . " The room where she sat was the kitchen of the delicatessen . There were two other people there . Beatrice did n't explain or introducethem but Moses recognized one as Beatrice 's mother . The resemblance was marked , although she was a very stout woman with a florid and handsome face . She wore an apron over her dress and her shoes were broken . The other woman was thin and old . This was Clancy . Here were the origins of Beatrice 's splendid and unhappy memories . Her governess was a delicatessen cook . The two women were making sandwiches . Now and then they spoke to Beatrice , but she did n't reply . They did n't seem troubled by her tear-stained face or her silence and the atmosphere in the kitchen was of a spent and ancient misunderstanding . The contrast between the stories Beatrice had told him of her unhappy child/hood  --  her elegant and callous mother  --  and the clear lights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troubles of a child . It was a fine delicatessen . The acid smell of pickles in brine came from some barrels near the door . Fresh sawdust had been scattered on the floor by Clancy  --  a little of it still clung to her apron  --  and from the door to the rear of the place , from the floor to the ceiling , were stacked cans of vegetables and fruit , shrimps , stone crabs , lobster meat , soups and chickens . There were baked turkeys and fowl in the glass cases , hams , turban-shaped rolls in the bread bins , sliced cucumbers in vinegar , creamed cheese , rollmops , smoked salmon , whitefish and sturgeon , and from this abundance of acid and appetizing smells poor Beatrice had inventedan unhappy childhood with a hardhearted mother and a stern governess . A little sob came from Beatrice . She took a paper napkin from a container on the table and blew her nose into it . " If you could get a taxi and take my suitcases out , Moses dear , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what her suitcases contained  --  that magpie wardrobe  --  and when he lifted them they felt like stone . He carried the bags out to the curb and got a cab and Clancy followed with a large paper bag full of sandwiches . " She 'll eat them on the train , " Clancy said to Moses . Beatrice said nothing to either her mother or the cook and in the taxi she sobbed some more and kept blowing her nose into the paper napkin . Moses carried her bags through the station and put them on the Cleveland train and then Beatrice kissed him good-by daintily and began to cry in earnest . " Oh dear Moses , I 've done something awful , and I have to tell you . You know how they always investi gate people , I mean they ask everybody you know about you , and a man came to see me one afternoon and I told him this long story about how you took advantage of me and promised to marry me and took all my money but I had to tell them something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't and I 'm sorry and I hope nothing bad happens to you . " Then the con ductor shouted all aboard and the train pulled out for Cleveland.  |p171And  now we come to the wreck of the Topaze . This happened on May 3o  --  her first voyage of the year . For two weeks Leander and the hired hand  --  Bentley  --  had been getting her into shape . The lilac was in bloom and in St. Botolphs there were hedges of lilac  --  there were whole groves and forests of it blooming the length of River Street and growing wild around the cellar holes on the other side of the hill . Going to the wharf in the early mornings Leander saw that the children walking to school all carried branches of lilac . He wondered if they gave it to their teachers , who must have lilac trees themselves , or used it to decorate the classrooms . All that week he saw children carryinglilac branches to school . Early on the morning of the thirtieth he cut some lilac himself and took it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentley had worked as a hired hand for Leander before . He was a young man who had been to sea and who had a bad name . Ile was known by everyone to be the illegitimate son of Theophilus Gates by a woman who called herself Mrs. Bentley and who lived in a two-family house near the table-silver factory . He was one of those neat , taciturn and competent seamen who tear the world to pieces about once a month . Landladies in many cities had ad/mired him for his cleanliness , sobriety and industry until he would come home some rainy night with three bottles of whisky in a paper bag and drink them , one after the other . Then he would break the windows , piss on the floor and erupt in such a volcano of bitterness and obscenity that the police were usually called and he would start all over again in some other city or furnished room . Another passenger or crew member that day was Lester Spinet , a blind man who had learned to play the accordion at the HutchensInstitute . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topaze , and she planned to pay him a salary herself . Leander was naturally pleased to have music on his boat and displeased at himself that he disliked the sound of the blind man 's cane and the way he looked . Spinet was a heavy man with a massive head and face canted upward , as if some traces of light still reached his eyes . Spinet and Bentley were waiting for Leander that morning when he got to the wharf and they took on some passengers including an old lady with some lilac branches wrapped in a newspaper . The sky and the river were blue and it was everything , or almost everything , that a holiday should be , although it was a little close or humid and mixed with the smell of lilacs that came down from the river banks was a sour smell like the smell of wet paper , I t might storm . At Travertine he took on more passengers . Dick Hammersmith and his brother were on the wharf in bathing trunks , diving for coins , but there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that the beach in front of the Mansion House was crowded and heard the shrieks of a child who was being ducked by her father . " Daddy is n't going to hurt you , Daddy only wants you to see how nice the water feels , " the man said while the child 's cries grew higher and more desperate . He passed through the channel between Hale and Gull rocks into the lovely bar , green inshore , blue in the deeper water and as purple as wine at forty fathoms . The sun shone and the air was warm and fragrant . From the wheelhouse he could see the passengers settling them selves on the forward deck with the charm and innocence of all holiday crowds . They would be dispersed , he knew , once hep173headed up into the wind , and he took a wide tack after the channelso that he would have their company for as long as possible . There were families with children and families without but very few old people had bought tickets that day . Bucks were photographingtheir girls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never . taken a picture in his life he felt kindly toward these cameramen or anyone else who made a record of such a lighthearted thing as the crossing to Nangasakit . There was among the passengers , he guessed , a man with a wig or toupee , and turning the boat up into the wind he watched the stranger grab for his hairpiece and secure it to his head with a cap . At the same time many women grabbed for their skirts and hats , but the damage was done . The fresh breeze scatteredthem all . They gathered up their papers and their comic books and carrying deck chairs went over to the leeward side or back to the stern and Leander was alone . The fact of his aloneness reminded Leander of Helen Rutherford , whom he had seen the night before . He had worked late on the boat and had gone into Grimes ' bakery to get his supper . While he was eating he looked up and saw her standing at the window , reading the menu that was posted there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with her  --  he did n't know what he would say  --  but as soon as she recognized him she backed away from him in fear , saying , " Get away from me , get away from me . " In the spring dusk the square was deserted . They were alone . " I only want to . . . " Leander began . " You want to hurt me , you want to hurt me . " " No . " " Yes , you do . You want to harm me . Daddy said you would . Daddy said for me to be careful . " " Please listen to me . " " Do n't you move . Do n't you come near me or I 'll call ' the police officer . " Then she turned and walked up the Cartwright Block as if the soft air of evening were full of flints and missiles  --  a queer , frightenedlimp  --  and when she had turned up a side street Leander wentp174back to the bakery to pay for his supper . " Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been around here telling everybody she 's got this secret that will set the river on fire . Oh , I hate nuts . " When Bentley came up to the wheelhouse , Leander saw that Ile had been drinking . Considering his own habits he had a long nose for the smell of rotted fruit that clung to the lips of someone else . Bentley still preserved the preternatural neatness of a man who is often tempted and deeply familiar with sloth . His curly hair shone with grease , his pale face was clean shaven with razor nicks on his neck and he had washed and scrubbed his denims until they were threadbare and smelled nicely of soap , but mixed with the smell of soap was the smell of whisky and Leander wondered if he would have to make the return voyage alone . He could see the white walls of Nangasakit then and hear the music of the merry-go-round . On the wharf there was an old man with a card in his hat advertising the four- , five- and six-course shore dinners at the Nangasakit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own refrain . " Return voyage at three thirty . Return voyage at three thirty . Please give yourself plenty of time to get back to the boat . Return voyage at three thirty . Please give yourself plenty of time to get back to the boat . ... " The last to leave the boat was Spinet , who tapped his way down the wharf with a stick . Leander went to his cabin , ate a sandwich and fell sound asleep . When he woke it was a little before three . The air was quite dark and he saw that it would storm . He poured some water into a basin and splashed his face . Going out onto the deck he saw a fog bank a mile or so out to sea . He wanted a hand on the return voyage and he put on his cap and walked up to Ray 's Cafe , where Bentley usually did his drinking . Bentley was in no shape at all . He was not even in the bar but was sitting in a small back room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muss think I 'm drunk , " he began , but Leander only sat down wearily , wondering where he could get a deck hand in fifteen minutes . " You think I 'm no good , but I got this girl out in Fort Sill , Oklahoma , " Bentley said.  | " She thinks I 'm good . I call her parrot . She 's got this big nose . I 'm going back to Fort Sill , Oklahoma , and love my parrot . She 's got this two thousand dollars in the bank she wants to give me . You do n't believe me , do you ? You think I 'm no good . You think I 'm drunk , but I got this girl out in Fort Sill , Oklahoma . She loves me . She wants to give me this two thousand dollars . I call her parrot . She 's got this big nose . . . . " It was not his fault , Leander knew , that he was a bastard , and it might not even be his fault that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck hand and he went out to the bar and asked Marylyn if her kid brother would want to pick up a dollar for the return voyage . She said sure , sure the kid was crazy to make a nickel , and she telephoned her mother and her mother opened the kitchen door and shouted for the boy but he could n't be found and Leander walked back to his ship . He watched his passengers come aboard with interest and some tenderness . They carried trophies  --  things they had won  --  thin blanketsthat would not keep the autumn cold from your bones ; glass dishes for peanuts and jelly ; and animals made out of oilclotoh and paper , some of them with diamond eyes . There was a pretty girl with a rose in her hair and a man and his wife and three children , all of them wearing shirts made of the same flowered cloth . IIelen Rutherford was the last to come aboard , but he was in the wheelhouse and did n't see her . She wore the same pot-shaped hat , ornamented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breast and carried the old brief case . IIelen Rutherford had been trying to sell Dr. Bartholomew 's wisdom in the cottages of Nangasakit for a week . On the morningof this , her last day , she had wandered into a neighborhood that seemed more substantial than anything else in the little resort . The houses were small  --  no bigger than bungalows  --  and yet all of them declaring by their mansards and spool railings and their porch latticework arched like the vents to a donjon that these were not summerhouses ; these were places where men and women centered their lives and where children were conceived and reared . The sight might have cheered her if it had n't been for the dogs.  |p176The  place was full of dogs ; and it had begun to seem to Helen that her life was a martyrdom to dogs . As soon as her footsteps were heard the dogs began to bark , filling her with timidity and self-pity . From morning until night dogs sniffed at her heels , snapped at her ankles , bit the skirts of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief case . As soon as she entered a strange neighborhood dogs that had been sunning themselves peacefully in clothesyards or sleeping by stoves , dogs who had been chewing bones or daydreaming or sporting with one another would give up their peaceful occupations and sound the alarm . She had dreamed many times that she was torn to pieces by dogs . I t seemed to her that she was a pilgrim and the soles of her shoes were so thin that she was virtually barefoot . She was surrounded , day after day , by strange houses and people and hostile beasts , and like a pilgrim she was now and then given a cup of tea and a piece of stale cake . Her lot was worse than a pilgrim 's for God alone knew in which direction her Rome , her Vatican would appear . The first dog to come at her that day was a collie who snarled at her heels , a sound that frightened her more than a loud , straight forward bark . The collie was joined by a small dog who seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly-seeming dog who had torn her coat . A black dog joined these two and then a police dog , woofing and belling like a hound from hell . She walked half a block , trailed by four dogs , and then all but the collie went back to their occupations . The collie was still a little behind , snarling at her heels . She hoped , she prayed , that someone would open a door and call him home . She turned to speak to him . " Go home , doggie , " she said . " Go home , good doggie , go home , nice doggie . " Then he sprang at her coat sleeve and she struck at him with her brief case . Her heart was beating so that she thought she would die . The collie sank his teeth into the old leather of the brief case and began a tug of war . " Leave that pool lady alone , you nasty cur , " Helen heard someone say . A stranger appeared at her right with a kettle of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howling up the street . " Now you come into the house for a few minutes , " the stranger said . " You come in andp177tell me what you 're selling and rest your feet . " Helen thanked the stranger and followed her into one of the little houses . Her savior was a short woman with eyes of a fine , pale blue and a very red face . She introduced herself as Mrs. Brown and in order to receive Helen she took off an apron and hung it over the back of a chair . She was a little woman with an extravagantlycurved figure . Her breasts and buttocks stretched the cloth of her house dress . " Now tell me what it is that you 're selling , " she said , " and I 'll see if I want any . " " I 'm an accredited representative for Dr. Bartholomew 's Institutefor Self-Improvement , " Helen said . " There are still a few subscriptionsopen for eligible men and women . Dr. Bartholomew feels that a college education is not a requirement . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Brown said , " because I 'm not what you would call an educated woman . I graduated from the NangasakitHigh School , which is one of the best high schools in the world  --  known all over the world  --  but the amount of education I got through learning is nothing to the amount of education that runs in my blood . I 'm directly descended from Madame de Stael and many other well-educated and distinguished men and women . I suppose you do n't believe me , I suppose you think I 'm crazy , but if you 'll notice that picture on the wall  --  it 's a picture post card of Madame de Stael  --  and then notice my own profile you 'll see the resemblance , no doubt . " " There are many four-colored portraits of famous historical men and women , " Helen said . " I 'll stand right up beside the portrait so 's you 'll be sure to see the resemblance , " Mrs. Brown said , and she went across the room and stood beside the card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see the resemblance , do n't you ? You must see it . Everybody else does . A man came by here yesterday selling hotwaterheaters and told me I looked enough like Madame de Stael to be her twin . Said we looked like identical twins . " She smoothed her house dress and then went back and sat on the edge of her chair . " It 's being directly descended from Madame de Stael and other distinguished men and women , " she said , " that accounts forp178the education in my blood . I have very expensive tastes . If I go into a store to buy a pocketbook and there 's a pocketbook for one dollar and a pocketbook for three dollars my eye goes straight to the one that costs three dollars . I 've preferred expensive things all my life . Oh , I had great expectations ! My great-grandfather was an ice merchant . He made a fortune selling ice to the niggers in Honduras . He was n't a man to put much stock in banks and he took all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back his ship sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras , gold and all . Of course it 's still there  --  two and a half million dollars of it  --  and it 's all mine , but do you think the banks around here would loan me the money to have it raised ? Not on your life . There 's over two and one half million dollars of my very own lying there in the sea and there 's not a man or woman in this part of the country with enough gumption or sense of honor to loan me the money to raise my own inheritance . Last week I went up to St. Botolphs to see this rich old Honora Wapshot and she . . . " " Is she related to Leander Wapshot ? " " She 's the very same blood . Do you know him ? " " He 's my father , " Helen said . " Well , for land 's sakes , if Leander Wapshot 's your father what are you doing going from door to door , trying to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarissa began to cry . " Oh , he has , has he ? Well , that 's easier said than done . It 's crossed my mind to disown my own children , but I do n't know how to go about it . You know what my daughter  --  my very own daughter  --  did on Thanksgiving Day ? We all sat down to the table and then she picked up this turkey , this twelve-pound turkey , and she threw it onto the floor and she jumped up and down on it and she kicked it from here to there and then she took the dish with the cranberry sauce in it and she threw it all over the ceiling  --  cranberry sauce all over the ceiling  --  and then she began to cry . Well , I thought of disowning her then and there but it 's easier said than done and if I ca n't disown my own daughter how 's it Leander Wapshot can disown his ? Well , " she said , getting to her feet and tying on her apron again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't spend any more time talking but my advice to you is to go to that old Leander Wapshot and tell him to buy you a decent pair of shoes . Why , when I saw you walking down the street with the dogs behind you and the holes in your shoes I did n't feel it would be Christian not to come to your help but now that I know you 're a Wapshot it seems that your own flesh and blood could come to your aid . Good-by . " Leander blew the warning whistle for his last voyage . From the wheelhouse he could see the rain falling onto the roller-coaster . He saw Charlie Matterson and his twin brother throw a tarpaulin over the last section of cars to come down . The merry-go-round was still turning . He saw the passengers in one of the boats of the Red Mill look up in surprise , as they were debouched from the mouth of a plaster-of-Paris ogre , to find it raining . He saw a young man gaily cover his girl 's head with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bluff lighting their kerosene lamps . He thought how sad it was that on this , their first trip away from home in so many years , it should rain . There were no stoves or fireplaces in the cottages . There was no escape from the damp and the doleful sounds of the rain for the matchboard walls of the cottages , salt soaked and tight , would resound when you touched them like the skin of a drum and you would hardly have settled down to a twohandedgame of whist before the roof began to leak . There would be a leak in the kitchen and another over the card table and anotherover the bed . The vacationers could wait for the mailman , but who would write to them ?  --  and they could n't write letters themselves for all their envelopes would be stuck together . Only the lovers , their bedposts jingling loudly and merrily , would be spared this gloom . On the beach Leander saw the last parties surrender , calling to one another to remember the blanket , remember the bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until there was no one left but an old man who liked to swim in the rain and a young man who liked to walk in the rain and whose head was full of Swinburne and whose nickname was Bananas . Leander saw the Japanese , who sold fans and back scratchers , takep180in his silk and paper lanterns . He saw people standing in restaurant doorways and waitresses at windows . A waiter took in the naked tables of the Pergola Cantonese Restaurant and he saw a hand part some window curtains in the Nangasakit House , but he could n't see the face that looked out . He saw how the waves , that had been riding in briskly , subsided in the rain so that they barely lapped the shore . The sea was still . Then the old man , who was standing waist deep in the water , suddenly turned and struggled up the beach , feeling the inward pull of the storm sea . He saw the gladness with which Bananas was watching these signs of danger . Then the sea , with a roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stony beginnings of the harbor bottom , forming a wave that , when it broke ( the first of a barrage that would sound all night ) , shook the beach and scooted up after the heels of the old man . He took off the lines and blew the whistle . Spinet started to play " Jingle Bells " as the Topaze went out to sea . There was a channel at Nangasakit  --  a granite breakwater bearded with sea grass and a bell buoy rocking in the southwest sea , white foam spilling over the float as it tipped . The bell , Leander knew , could on this wind be heard inland . It could be heard by the card players rearranging pots and pans under their leaky roof , by the old ladies in the Nangasakit House and even 1 ) v the lovers above the merry jingling of their bedposts . It was the only bell Leander had ever heard in his dreams . He loved all bells : dinner bells , table bells , doorbells , the bell from Antwerp and the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only bell that chimed on the dark side of his mind . Now the charming music fell astern , fainter and fainter , lost in the creaking of the old hull and the noise of seas breaking against her bow . Ont in the bay it was rough . She took the waves head on , like an old rocking horse . Waves broke over the glass of the wheelhouse so that Leander had to keep one hand on the windshield wiper to see . The water pouring down the decks began to come in at the cabin . It was dirty weather . Leander thought of the passengers  --  the girl with the rose in herp181hair and the man with three children , all wearing shirts cut of the same cloth as his wife 's summer dress . And what about the passengersthemselves , sitting in the cabin ? Were they frightened ? They were , nine times out of ten , their fear clothed lightly in idle speculation . They fished for their key rings and their small change , gave their privates a hitch and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a St. Christopher medal , they rubbed it with their fingers . St. Christopher , be with us now ! They readjusted their garters if they wore them , tightened the knots in their shoelaces and their neckties and wondered why their sense of reality should seem suspended . They thought of pleasant things : wheat fields and winter twilights , when five minutes after the lemony yellow light in the west was gone the snow began to fall , or hiding jelly beans under the sofa cushions on Easter Eve . The young man looked at the girl with the rose in her hair , remembering how generously she had spread her legs for him and now how fair and gentle she seemed . In the middle of the bay Leander turned the boat toward Travertine . It was the worst of the trip , and he was worried . The followingsea punished her stern . Her screw shook the hull at the crest of every wave and in the hollow she slipped to port . He set his bow on Gull Rock , which he could see clearly then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanning out as the waves mounted and swallowed the granite pile . Beyond the channel he would be all right with nothing ahead of him but the run up the calm river to home . He put his mind on this . He could hear the deck chairs smashing against the stern rail and she had taken in so much water that she heeled . Then the rudder chain broke with the noise of a shot and he felt the power of the helm vanish into thin air beneath his hands . There was a jury rudder in the stern . He thought quickly enough . lie put her into half speed and stepped into the cabin . Helen saw him , and she began to shriek . " He 's a devil , he 's a devil from hell that one there . He 'll drown us . He 's afraid of me . For eighteen weeks , nineteen on Monday , I 've been out in all weathers . He 's afraid of me . I have information in my possession that could put him into the electric chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear thatp182stopped him , but a stunning memory of her mother 's loveliness  --  the farm near Franconia and haying on a thundery day . He went back into the wheelhouse and a second later the Topaze rammed Gull Rock . Her bow caved in like an egg shell . Leander reached for the whistle cord and blew the distress signal . They heard his whistle in what had been the parlor and was now the bar of the Mansion House and wondered what Leander was up to . He had always been prodigal with his whistle , tooting it for children 's birthday parties and wedding anniversaries or at the sight of an old friend . It was one of the waiters in the kitchen  --  a stranger to the place  --  who recognized the distress signal and rain out onto the porch and gave the alarm . They heard him at the boat club and someone started up the old launch . As soon as Leander saw the boat leave the wharf he went back to the cabin , where most of the passengers were putting on life jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the boat came alongside . I lc helped them aboard , including Spinet , including Helen , who was sobbing , and the boat chugged off . He unscrewed the compass box from its stand and got his binocularsand a bottle of bourbon out of his locker . Then he went up to the bow to see the damage . The hole was a big one and the follow . ing sea was worrying her on the rocks . As he watched she began to ease off the rocks and he could feel the bow settle . He walked back toward the stern . He felt very tired  --  almost sleepy . His animal spirits seemed collapsed and his breathing , the beating of his hcait felt retarded . His eyes felt heavy . In the distance he saw a dory coming out to get him rowed by a young man  --  a stranger  --  and through this feeling of torpor or weariness he felt as if he watched the approach of someone of uncommon beauty  --  an angel , or a ghost of himself when he had been young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger said , and the illusion of ghosts and angels vanished . Leander got into the dory . He watched the Topaze ease off the rocks and start up the channel herself with the sea pounding at her stern ; and derelict and forsaken she seemed , like those inextinguish  --  able legends of underwater civilizations and buried gold , to piercep183the darkest side of his mind with an image of man 's inestimable loneliness . She was heading through the channel , but she would n't make it . As each wave pushed her forward , she lost some buoyancy . Water was breaking over her bow . And then , with more grace than she had usually sailed , her stern upended  --  there was a loud clatter of deck chairs knocked helter-skelter along the sides of her cabin  --  and down went the Topaze to the bottom of the sea.  |p184Leander  wrote to both his sons . He did not know that Coverly was in the Pacific and it took three weeks for his letter to be forwarded to Island 93 . Moses did n't get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a security risk ten days after Beatrice left for Cleveland . It was at a time when these dismissals were summary and unexplained and if there was some court of appeal Moses did not , at that time , have the patience or the common sense to seek it out . An hoar after he had received his discharge he was driving north with all his possessions in the back of his car . The anonymity of his dischargegave it oracular proportions , as if some tree or stone or voicC from a cave had put the finger on him , and the pain of being con demned or expelled by a veiled force may have accounted for his rage . He was far from the green pastures of common sense . He was angry at what had been done to him and angry at himself for haw ing failed to come to reasonable terms with the world and he was deeply anxious about his parents , for if the news should get back to Honora that he had been discharged for reasons of security ha knew they would suffer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been that he wanted to recapture the pleasures of his trips to Langely with Leander , Fishing was the only occupation he could think of that might rc.  |p185fresh  his common sense . He drove straight from Washington to a trout pond in the Poconos that he had visited before and where he was able to rent a cabin or shack that was as dilapidated as the camp at Langely . He ate some supper , drank a pint of whisky and went for a swim in the cold lake . All this made him feel better and he went to bed early , planning to get up before dawn and fish in the Lakanana River . He was up at five and drove north to the river , as anxious to be the first fisherman out as Leander had been anxious to be the first man in the woods . The sky was just beginning to fill with light . He was disappointed and perplexed then when a car ahead of him turned off and parked on the road shoulder that led to the stream . Then the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over his shoulder at Moses in such agony and panic that Moses wondered  --  so soon after dawn  --  if he had crossed the path of a murderer . Then the stranger unbuckled his belt , dropped his trousersand relieved himself in full view of the morning . Moses gatheredup his tackle and smiled at the stranger , happy to see that he was not another trout fisherman . The stranger smiled at Moses for his own reasons ; and he took the path to the water and did n't see another fisherman that day . Lakanana Pond emptied into the river and the water , regulated by a dam , was deep and turbulent and in many places over a man 's head . The sharp fall of the land and the granite bed of the stream made it a place where there was nowhere a respite from the loud noise of water . Moses caught one trout in the morning and two more late in the day . Here and there a bridle path from the Lakanana Inn ran parallel to the stream and a few riders hacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any of them stopped to ask Moses what he had caught . The sun by then was below the trees and the early dark seemed to deepen the resonance of the stream . It was time for Moses to go and he was taking in his line and putting away his flies when he heard the hoofs and the creaking leather of some riders . A middleagedcouple stopped to ask about his luck while he was pulling off his boots . It was the urbanity of the couple that struck Moses  --   |p186they  looked so terribly out of place . They were both of them heavy and gray-headed  --  the woman dumpy and the man choleric , short-winded and obese . It had been a warm day but they were dressed correctly in dark riding clothes  --  bowlers , sticks , tattersalls and so forth . All of this must have been very uncomfortable . " Well , good luck , " the woman said in the cheerful , cracked voice of middle age , and turned her horse away from the stream . Out of the corner of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned his head so much dust had been raised by the scuffle of hoofs that he did n't see how she fell . He ran up the bank and got the fractious horse by the bridle as her husband began to roar : " Help , help . She 's dead , she 's dead , she 's been killed . " The horse reared again while Moses ' hand was on the bridle . He let go and the hack galloped off . " I 'll go for help , I 'll go for help , " the husbandroared . " There 's a farm back there . " He cantered off to the north and the dust settled , leaving Moses with what seemed to be a dead stranger . She was on her knees , face downward in the dirt , the tails of her coat parted over the broad , worn seat of her britches and her boots toed in like a child 's , so stripped of her humanity , so defeated  --  Moses remembered the earnest notes of her voice  --  in her attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flash of repugnance . Then he went to her and more out of consideration for his own feelings than anything else  --  more out of his desire to return to her the form of a woman than to save her life  --  he straightened out her legs and she rolled with a thump onto her back . He rolled yip his coat and put it under her head . A cut in her forehead , over the eye , was bleeding and Moses got some water and washed the cut , pleased to be occupied . She was breathing , he noticed , but this exhausted his medical knowledge . He knelt beside her wondering in what form and when help would come . He lighted a cigarette and looked at the stranger 's face  --  pasty and round and worn it seemed with such anxieties as cooking , catching trains and buying useful presents at Christmas . It was a face that seemed to state its history plainly  --  she was one of two sisters , she had no children , she could be inflexible about neatness and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Then he heard hoofs and leather and her bereaved husband bore down in a cloud of dust . " There 's nobody at the farm . I 've wasted so much time . She ought to be in an oxygen tent . She probably needs a blood transfusion . We 've got to get an ambulance . " Then he knelt down beside her and put his head on her breast , crying , " Oh my darling , my love , my sweet , do n't leave me , do n't leave me . " Then Moses ran up the path to his car and , driving it a little way through the woods , he got it onto the loose dirt of the bridle path where the man still knelt by his wife . Then , opening the door , they managed together to lift her into the car . He started back for the road , the wheels of the car spinning in the loose dirt , but he was able to keep it moving and was cheered when they got onto the black-top road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat . " She 's dying , she 's dying , " the stranger sobbed . " If she lives I 'll repay you . Money is no consideration . Please hurry . " " You know you both seem pretty old for horseback riding , " Moses said . He knew there was a hospital in the next village and he made good time until he got stuck , on the narrow road , behind a slowmovingtruck loaded with live chickens . Moses blew his horn but this only made the truck driver more predatory and how could Moses communicate to him that the thread of a woman 's life might depend on his consideration ? He passed the truck at the crown of a hill but this only excited the driver 's malevolence and , roaring downhill , his chicken crates swaying wildly from side to side , he tried , unsuccessfully , to repass Moses . They had come down at last into the leafy streets of the village and the road to the hospital . Many people were walking at the side of the road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital lawn party . They were out of luck . The hospital was surrounded by the booths , lights and music of a country fair . A policeman stopped them when they tried to approach the hospital and waved them toward a parking lot . " We want to get to the hospital , " Moses shouted . The policeman leaned towardp188them . He was deaf . " We have a woman here who is dying , " the stranger cried loudly . " This is a matter of life and death . " Moses got past the policeman and through the fair , approaching a brick building , darkened by many shade trees . The place was shaped like a Victorian mansion and may have been one , modified now by fire escapes and a brick smokestack . Moses got out of the car and ran through an emergency entrance into a room that was empty . He went from there into a hall where he met a gray-haired nurse carrying a tray . " I have an emergency in my car , " he said . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of bitterness that we exchange when we are too tired , or too exacerbated by our own ill luck , to care whether our neighbors live or die . " What is the nature of the emergency ? " she asked airily . Another nurse appeared . She was no younger but she was not so tired . " She was thrown by a horse , she 's unconscious , " Moses said . " Horses ! " the old nurse exclaimed . " Dr. Howard has just come in , " the second nurse said . " I 'll get him now . " A few minutes later a doctor came down the hall with a second nurse and they wheeled a table out of the emergency room down a ramp to the car and Moses and the doctor lifted the unconscious woman onto this . They accomplished this in a summer twilight , surrounded by the voices of hawkers and the sounds of music that came from the fair beyond the trees . " Oh , ca n't somebody stop this ? " the stranger asked , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll pay any amount of money . Send them home . Send them home . I 'll pay for it . Tell them to stop the music at least . She needs quiet . " " We could n't do that , " the doctor said quietly , and with a marked upcountry accent . " That 's how we raise the money to keep the hospital running . " In the hospital they began to cut off the woman 's clothes and Moses went into the hallway , followed by her husband . " You 'll stay , you 'll stay a little while with me , wo n't you ? " he asked Moses . " She 's all I have and if she dies , if she dies I do n't know what I 'll do . " Moses said that he would stay and wandered down the hall to an empty waiting room . A large , bronzep189plaque on the door said that the waiting room was the gift of Sarah P. Watkins and her sons and daughters , but it was difficult to see what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation-leather furniture , a table and a collection of old magazines . Moses waited here until Mr. Cutter returned . " She 's alive , " he sobbed , " she 's alive . Thank God . Her leg and her arm are broken and she has a concussion . I 've called my secretary and asked them to send a specialist on from New York . They do n't know whether she 'll live or not . They wo n't know for twenty-four hours . Oh , she 's such a lovely person . She 's so kind and lovely . " " Your wife will be all right , " Moses said . " She is n't my wife , " Mr. Cutter sobbed . " She 's so kind and lovely . My wife is n't anything like that . We 've had such hard times , both of us . We 've never asked for very much . We have n't even been together very much . It could n't be retribution , could it ? It could n't be retribution . We 've never harmed anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the only time we ever have together . It could n't be retribution . " He dried his tears and cleaned his spectacles and went back down the hall . A young nurse came to the door , looking out at the carnival and the summer evening , and a doctor joined her . " Bz thinks he 's dying , " the nurse said . " He wants a priest . " " I called Father Bevier , " the doctor said . " lie 's out . " IIe put ahand on the nurse 's slender back and let it fall along her buttocks . " Oh , I could use a little of that , " the nurse said cheerfully . " So could I , " the doctor said . He continued to stroke her buttocks and desire seemed to make the nurse plaintive and in a human way much finer and the doctor , who had looked very tired , seemed refreshed . Then , from the ( lark interior of the place , there was a wordless roar , a spitting grunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable hope . The doctor and the nurse separated and disappeared in the dark at the end of the hall . The grunt rose to a scream , a shriek , and to escape it Moses walked out of the buildingand crossed the grass to the edge of the lawn . He was on highp190land and his view took in the mountains , blackened then by an afterglow  --  a brilliant yellow that is seen in lower country only on the coldest nights of February . In the trees on his left the fair or carnival had hit its gentle , countrified stride . An orchestra on a platform was playing " Smiles " and on the second chorus one of the players put down his instrumentand sang a verse through a megaphone . Strings of lights  --  white and faded reds and yellows  --  were hung from booth to booth to light , with the faint candle power of these arrangements , the dark of the maples . The noise of voices was not loud and the men talking up hamburgers and fortune 's wheel called with no real insistence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee from a pretty country girl . When she had given him his change she moved the sugar bowl an inch this way and that , looked at the doughnut jar with a deep sigh and pulled at her apron . " You 're a stranger ! " she asked . He said that he was . The girl moved down the counter to wait on some other people who were complaining about the chilly mountain dusk . In the next booth a young man was pitching baseballs at a pyramid of wooden milk bottles . His aim and his speed were superb . He stared at the milk bottles , drawing back a little and narrowing his eyes like a rifleman , and then winged a ball at them with the energy of sheer malevolence . Down they came , again and again , and a small crowd of girls and bucks gathered to watch the performance but when it was ended and the pitcher turned toward them they said so long , so long , Charlie , so long , and drifted away , arm in arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher there was a booth selling flowers that had been picked in the village gardens and there were wheels and a bingo game and the wooden stand where the musicians continuedwithout a break their selection of dance music . Moses was surprised to find them so old . The pianist was old , the saxophone player was bent and gray and the drummer must have weighed three hundred pounds , and they seemed attached to their instill ments by the rites , conveniences and habits of a long marriage . When they had finished their last set a man announced sonicp191local talent and Moses saw a child , at the edge of the platform , waiting to go on . She seemed to be a child but when the band played her fanfare she lifted up her hands , shuffled into the light and began a laborious tap dance , counting time painfully and throwing out to the audience , now and then , a leering smile . The taps on her silver shoes made a metallic clang and shook the lumberof the platform and she seemed to have left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mechanics of her dance and the enjoinder to seem flirtatious , her freshness was gone and all the bitterness and disappointments of a lascivious middle age seemed to sit on her thin shoulders . At the end she bowed to the little applause , smiled her tart smile once more and ran into the shadows where her mother was waiting with a coat to put over her shoulders and a few words of encouragement and when she stepped back into the shadows Moses saw that she was no more than twelve or thirteen . He threw his paper cup into a can , and finishing his circuit of the carnival saw , walking through the deep grass smell and the summer gloom , a group , a family perhaps , in which there was a woman wearing a yellow skirt . The color of the skirt set up in him a yearning , a pang that put his teeth on edge , and he remembered that he had once loved a girl who had a skirt of the same color although he could not remember her name . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses heard his friend shouting when he returned to the hospital . " Charter a plane if it 's necessary . Money is no consideration . If he wants a consultant , tell him to bring a consultant . Yes . Yes . " He was using a telephone in an office across the hall from the waiting room that had been given by the Watkins family and where it had grown dark without anyone 's bothering to turn on a lamp . Only a few lights seemed to burn in the hospital at all . The bereaved and elderly lover sat among covered typewriters and adding machines and when he had finished his conversation he looked up to Moses and either because the light caught his spectacles or because his mood had changed , he seemed very officious . " I want you to consider yourself on my payroll as of this morning , " he said to Moses . " If you have otherp192engagements to fulfill you can cancel them , confident that I will more than make this worth your while . The hospital has given me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the inn and get my toilet articles . I 've made out a list , " he said , passing such a list to Moses . " Estimate your mileage and keep track of the time and I will see that you are amply reimbursed . " Then he picked up the telephone and asked for long distance and Moses stepped out into the dark hall . He had nothing better to do and he was glad to drive back to the inn , not so much from a commendable sense of charity and helpfulness as from his desire to draw into a sensible perspective the events of the last few hours . Back at the inn he gave the manager  --  likea true Wapshot  --  the most meager account of what had happened . " She was in an accident , " he said . He went upstairs to the room that had been occupied by poor Mr. Cutter and his paramour . All the things on the list were easy to find  --  everything but a bottle of rye but after looking in the medicine cabinet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found a well-stocked bar . He had a drink of Scotch himself in a tooth- . brush glass . Back at the hospital Mr. Cutter was still on the telephone . He put his hand over the mouthpiece . " Now you get some sleep , my boy , " he said mingling paternalism with officiousness . " If you do n't have a place , go back to the inn and ask them to give you a room . Report back here at nine o'clock . Remember that money is no consideration . You 're on my payroll . " Moses went back to the bridle path to get his fishing tackle , which he found unharmed except for a fall of dew , and spent the night in his rented shack.  |p193The  next day at dusk , Mr. Cutter 's paramour regained consciousness , and in the morning Moses arranged to have his car driven to New York and flew to the city with Mr. Cutter and the patient in a chartered ambulance plane . He was not quite sure where he stood on Mr. Cutter 's payroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Coverly 's address as soon as he got to New York , not knowing that his brother was on Island 93 . Betsey was there and he took her out to dinner . She was not the girl he would have married , but he found her likable enough . A day or so later he had an interview with Mr. Cutter and a few days later he was enrolled in the Fiduciary Trust Company Bond School at a better salary than he had received in Washington and with a more brilliant future . The letter Leander wrote to him in Washington lay on the hall floor of his apartment and it went like this : " Slight mishap to Topaze on 3oth . All hands removed with dry feet . Sank in channel and was removed as navigational hazard by Coast Guard on Tues . Beached and patched at Mansion House . She 's at your mooring now ( Tern 's ) and has been at same since mishap .

" The mooring that Leander mentioned was a mushroom anchor and chain in the river at the foot of the garden , and the old launch could be seen from there . Mrs. Wapshot stared at the Topaze one afternoon when she was picking sage . She felt a stirring in her mind and her body that might mean that she was going to have a vision . Now in fact so many of Mrs. Wapshot 's imaginings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions . Years and year ago , when she was walking by Christ Church , some force of other ness seemed to stop her by the vacant lot that adjoined the elms ( hp195and she had a vision of a parish house  --  red brick with small-paned casement windows and a neat lawn . She had begun her agitation for a parish house that afternoon and a year and a half later her vision  --  brick for brick  --  was a reality . She had dreamed up horse troughs , good works and pleasant journeys to have them materializeoftener than not . Now , coming back from the garden with a bouquet of sage , she looked down the path to the river where the Topaze lay at her mooring . It was a gray afternoon along the coast , but not an unexciting one  --  there might be a storm , and the prospect seemed to please her , as if she held on her tongue , like a peppercorn , the flavor of the old port and the stormy dusk . The air was salty and she could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , dark and she seemed unsalvageable in that light  --  one of those hulks that we see moored by coal yards in city rivers , kept afloat through some misguided tenderness or hope , wearing sometimes a For Sale sign and sometimes the last habitation of some crazy old hermit whose lair is pasted up with pearly-skinned and spread-legged beauties and whose teeth are pulled . The first thing that crossed her mind when she saw the dark and empty ship was that she would not sail again . She would not cross the bay again . Then Mrs. Wapshot had her vision . She saw the ship berthed at the garden wharf , her hull shining with fresh paint and her cabin full of light . She saw , by turning her head , a dozen or more cars parked in the cornfield . She even saw that some of them had outof-statelicense plates . She saw a sign nailed to the elm by the path : VISIT THE S.S. TOPAZE , THE ONLY FLOATING GIFT SHOPPE IN NEWENGLAND . In her mind she took the path down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her cabin was all new paint ( the life preservers were gone ) , and lamps burned on many small tables , illuminating a cargo of ash trays , cigarette lighters , playingcardcases , wire arrangements for holding flowers , vases , embroidery , hand-painted drinking glasses and cigarette boxes that played " Tales from Vienna Woods " when you opened them . Her vision was in detail and splendidly lighted and warm as well , for she sawp196a Franklin stove at one end of the cabin with a fire in the grate and the perfume of wood smoke mingled with the smell of sachets , Japanese linen and here and there the smell of tallow from a lighted candle . The S.S. Topaze , she thought again , The Only Floating Gift Shoppe in New England , and then she let the stormy dusk reclaim the dark ship and went very happily into the house.  |p197Leander  did not understand why Theophilus Gates would not lend him enough money to have the bow of the Topaze repaired while he would loan Sarah all the money she wanted to turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened . The day after her vision Sarah went to the bank and the day after that the carpenters came and began to repair the wharf . The salesmen began to arrive  --  three and four a day  --  and Sarah began to stock the Topaze , spending money , as she said herself , like an inebriated sailor . Her happiness or rapture was genuine although it was hard to see why she should find such joy in a gross of china dogs with flowers painted on their backs , their paws shaped in such a way that they could hold cigarettes . There may have been some vengefulnessin her enthusiasm  --  some deep means of expressing her feelingsabout the independence and the sainthood of her sex . She had never been so happy . She had signs painted : VISIT THE S.S. TOPAZE , THE ONLY FLOATING GIFT SHOPPE IN NEW ENGLAND , and posted atall the roads leading into the village . She planned to open the Topaze with a gala tea and a sale of Italian pottery . Hundreds of invitations were printed and mailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parlor and urinated against an apple tree in full view of the boats on thep198river and the salesmen of Italian pottery . He claimed to be aging swiftly and pointed out how loudly his bones creaked when he stooped to pick a thread off a carpet . Tears streamed capriciously from his eyes whenever he heard a horse race on the radio . He still shaved and bathed each morning , but he smelled more like Neptunethan ever and clumps of hair grew out of his ears and nostrils before he could remember to clip them . His neckties were stained with food and cigarette ash , and yet , when the night winds woke him and he lay in bed and traced their course around the dark compass , he still remembered what it was to feel young and strong . Deluded by this thread of cold air he would rise in his bed thinkingpassionately of boats , trains and deep-breasted women , or of some image  --  a wet pavement plastered with yellow elm leaves  --  that seemed to represent requital and strength . I will climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiger ! I will crush the serpent with my heel ! But the fresh winds died with the morning dusk . There was a pain in his kidney . He could not get back to sleep and he would limp and cough through another day . His sons did not write him . On the day before the Topaze opened as a gift shop , Leander paid a call on Honora . They sat in her parlor . " Would you like some whisky ? " Honora asked . " Yes , please , " Leander said . " There is n't any , " Honora said . " Have a cookie . " Leander glanced down at the plate of cookies and saw they were covered with ants . " I 'm afraid ants have gotten into your cookies , Honora , " he said . " That 's ridiculous , " Honora said . " I know you have ants at the farm , but I 've never had ants in this house . " She picked up a cookie and ate it , ants and all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I do n't have time to spend in gift shops , " Honora said . " 1 ' 111 taking piano lessons . " " I thought you were taking painting lessons , " Leander said . " Painting ! " Honora said scornfully . " Why I gave up my painting in the spring . The Hammers were in some financial difficulty sop199I bought their piano from them and now Mrs. Hammer comes and gives me a lesson twice a week . It 's very easy . " " Perhaps it runs in the family , " Leander said . " Remember Justina ? " " Justina who ? " Honora asked . " Justina Molesworth , " Leander said . " Why , of course I remember Justina , " Honora said . " Why should n't I ? " " I meant that she played the piano in the five and ten , " Leander said . " Well , I have no intention of playing the piano in the five and ten , " Honora said . " Feel that refreshing breeze , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( There was no breeze at all . ) " Sit in the other chair , " she said . " I 'm quite comfortable here , thank you , " Leander said . " Sit in the other chair , " Honora said . " I 've just had it reupholstered . Although , " she said as Leander obediently changed from one chair to the other , " you wo n't be able to see out of the window from there and perhaps you were better off where you were . " Leander smiled , remembering that to talk with her , even when she was a young woman , had made him feel bludgeoned . He wondered what her reasons were . Lorenzo had written somewhere in his journal that if you met the devil you should cut him in two and go between the pieces . It would describe Honora 's manner although he wondered if it was n't the fear of death that had determinedher crabwise progress through life . It could have been that by side-stepping those things that , through their force  --  love , incontinenceand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our mortality she might have uncovered the mystery of a spirited old age . " Will you do me a favor , Honora ? " he asked . " I wo n't go to Sarah 's tea if that 's what you want , " she said . " I 've told you I have a music lesson . " " It is n't that , " Leander said . " It 's something else . When I die I want Prospero 's speech said over my grave . " " What speech is that ? " Honora asked  | " Our revels now are ended , " Leander said , rising from his chair . " These our actors , as I foretold you , were all spirits and are melted into air , into thin air . " He declaimed , and his declamatory style was modeled partly on the Shakespearians of his youth , partly on the bombast and singsong of prize-ring announcements and partly on the style of the vanished horsecar and trolley-car conductors who had made an incantation of the place names along their routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonic very literal gestures . " . . . and , like the baseless fabric of this vision , the cloud-capped towers , the gorgeous palaces , the solemn temples , the great globe itself , yea , all which it inherit , shall dis solve , and , like this insubstantial pageant faded , leave not a rack behind . " He dropped his hands . His voice fell . " We are such stuff as dreams are made on , and our little life is rounded with a sleep . " Then he said good-by and went . Early the next morning Leander saw that there would be no sanctuary or peace for him in the farm that day . The stir of a large ladies ' party  --  magnified by the sale of Italian pottery  --  was inescapable . He decided to visit his friend Grimes , who was liviic in an old people 's home in West Chillum . It was a trip he had planned to make for years . He walked into St. Botolphs after breakfast and caught the bus to West Chillum there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver told him they had reached the Twilight Home and Leander got off . The place from the road looked to him like one of the New England academies . There was a granite wall , set with sharp pieces of stone to keep vagrants from resting . The drive was shaded with elms , and the buildings it served were made of red brick along architectural lines that , what ever had been intended when they were built , now seemed vcry gloomy . Along the driveway Leander saw old men hoeing the gutters . He entered the central building and went to an office , where a woman asked what he wanted . " I want to see Mr. Grimes . " " Visitors are n't allowed on weekdays , " the woman said , " I 've just come all the way from St. Botolphs , " Leander said.  | " He 's in the north dormitory , " she said . " Do n't tell anyone I said you could go in . Go up those stairs . " Leander walked down the hall and up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a double row of iron beds down each side of a center aisle . Old men were lying on fewer than half the beds . Leander recognized his old friend and went over to the bed where he was lying . " Grimes , " he said . " Who is it ? " The old man opened his eyes . " Leander . Leander Wapshot . " " Oh Leander , " Grimes cried and the tears streamed down his cheeks . " Leander , old sport . You 're the first friend to come and see me since Christmas . " He embraced Leander . " You do n't know what it 's like for me to see a friendly face . You do n't know what it 's like . " " Well , I thought I 'd pay you a little call , " Leander said . " I meant to come a long time ago . Somebody told me you had a pool table out here so I thought I 'd come out and play you a little pool . " " We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come on , I 'll show you the pool table . " He seized Leander 's arm and led him out of the dormitory . " We 've got all kinds of recreation , " he said excitedly . " At Christmas they sent us a lot of gramophone records . We have gardens . We get plenty of fresh air and exercise . We work in the gardens . Do n't you want to see the gardens ? " " Anything you say , Grimes , " Leander said unwillingly . He did not want to see the gardens or much more of the Twilight Home . If he could sit quietly for an hour somewhere and talk with Grimes he would feel repaid for the trip . " We grow all our own vegetables , " Grimes said . " We have fresh vegetables right out of the garden . I 'll show you the garden first . Then we 'll play a little pool . The pool table is n't in very good shape . I 'll show you the gardens . Come on . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and crossed to the gardens . They looked to Leander like the rigid and depressing produce gardens of a reformatory . " See , " Grimes said . " Peas . Carrots . Beets . Spinach . We 'll have corn soon . We sell corn . We mayp202grow some of the corn you eat at your table , Leander . " He had led Leander into a field of corn that was just beginning to silk . " We have to be quiet now , " he said in a whisper . They went through the corn to the edge of the garden and climbed a stone wall marked with a No Trespassing sign and went into some scrub woods . They came in a minute to a clearing where there was a shallow trench dug in the clay . " See it ? " Grimes whispered . " See it ? Not everybody knows about it . That 's potter 's field . That 's where they bury us . These two men got sick last month . Charlie Dobbs and Henry Fosse . They both died one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then but I wanted to make sure . I came out here that morning and I hid in the woods . Sure enough , about ten o'clock this fat fellow comes along with a wheelbarrow . He 's got Charlie Dobbs and Henry Fosse in it . Stark naked . Dumped on top of one another . Upsidedown . They did n't like each other , Leander . They never even spoke to one another . But he buried them together . Oh , I could n't look . I could n't watch it . I 've never felt right after that . If I die in the night they 'll dump me naked into a hole side by side with somebody I never knew . Go back and tell them , Leander . Tell them at the newspapers . You were always a good talker . Go back and tell them .... " " Yes , yes , " Leander said . He was backing through the woods , away from the clearing and his hysterical friend . They climbed the stone wall and walked through the corn patch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them , tell them at the newspapers . Save me , Leander . Save me . ... " " Yes , I will , Grimes , yes , I will . " Side by side the old men returned through the garden and Leander said good-by to Grimes in front of the central building . Then he went down the driveway , obliged to struggle to give the impression that he was not hurried . He was relieved when he got outside the gates . It was a long time before the bus came along and when one did appear he shouted , " Hello there . Stop stop , stop for me . " He could not help Grimes ; he could not , he realized when thep203bus approached St. Botolphs and he saw a sign , VIST THE S.S. TOPAZE , THE ONLY FLOATING GIFT SHOPPE IN NEW ENGLAND , help himself . He hoped that the tea party would be over but when he approached the farm he found many cars parked on the lawn and the sides of the driveway . He swung wide around the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs to his room . It was late then and from his window he could see the Topaze  --  the twinkling of candles  --  and hear the voices of ladies drinking tea . The sight made him feel that he was being made ridiculous ; that a public spectacle was being made of his mistakes and his misfortunes . He remembered his father then with tenderness and fear as if he had dreaded , all along , some end like Aaron 's . He guessed the ladies would talk about him and he only had to listen at the window to hear . " He drove her onto Gull Rock in broad daylight , " Mrs. Gates said as she went down the path to the wharf . " Theophilus thinks he was drunk . " What a tender thing , then , is a man . Flow , for all his crotchhitchingand swagger , a whisper can turn his soul into a cinder . The taste of alum in the rind of a grape , the smell of the sea , the heat of the spring sun , berries bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all of that which he meant by life seemed taken away from him . Where were the serene twilights of his old age ? IIe would have liked to pluck out his eyes . Watching the candlelight on his ship  --  he had brought her home through gales and tempests  --  he felt ghostly and emasculated . Then he went to his bureau drawer and took from under the dried rose and the wreath of hair his loaded pistol . He went to the window . The fires of the day were burning out like a conflagration in some industrial city and above the barn cupola he saw the evening star , as sweet and round as a human tear . He fired his pistol out of the window and then fell down on the floor . He had underestimated the noise of teacups and ladies ' voices and no one on the Topaze heard the shot  --  only Lulu , who was in the kitchen , getting some hot water . She climbed the back stairs and hurried down the hall to his room and screamed when she opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hisp204knees . " Oh , Lulu , Lulu , you were n't the one I wanted to hurt . I did n't mean you . I did n't mean to frighten you . " " Are you all right , Leander ? Are you hurt ? " " I 'm foolish , " Leander said . " Oh , poor Leander , " Lulu said , helping him to his feet . " Poor soul . I told her she should n't have done it . I told her in the kitchen many times that it would hurt your feelings , but she would n't listen . " " I only want to be esteemed , " Leander said . " Poor soul , " Lulu said . " You poor soul . " " You wo n't tell anyone what you saw , " Leander said . " No . " " You promise me . " " I promise . " " Swear that you wo n't tell anyone what you saw . " " I swear . " " Swear on the Bible . Let me find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old Bible ? " Then he searched the room wildly , lifting up and putting down books and papers and throwing open drawers and looking into book shelves and chests , but he could n't find the Bible . There was a little American flag stuck into the mirror above his bureau and he took this and held it out to Lulu . " Swear on the flag , Lulu , swear on the American flag that you wo n't tell anyonewhat you saw . " " I swear . " " I only want to be esteemed. "  |p205Although  the administration of Island 93 was half military and half civilian , the military , having charge of transportation , communicationand provisions , often dominated the civilian administrators . So Coverly was called to the military communications office one early evening and handed a copy of a cable that had been sent by Lulu Breckenridge . YOUR FATHER IS DYING . " Sorry , fellow , " the officer said . " You can go to communications but I do n't think they 'll do anything for you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cable into the wastebasket and walked out of the office . It was after supper and the latrines were being fired and the smoke rose up through the coconut palms . In another twenty minutes the movies would begin . When Coverly had gone a little way beyond the building he began to cry . He sat down by the road . The light was changing and the light goes quickly in the islands and it was that hour when the primitive domesticity of a colony of men without women begins to assert itself : the washing , letterwritingand the handicrafts with which men preserve some reason and dignity . No one noticed Coverly because there was nothing unusual in a man sitting by the side of the road and no one could see he was crying . He wanted to see Leander and cried to thinkp206that all their plans had taken him to the flimflam of a tropical island a little while before the movies began while his father was dying in St. Botolphs . He would never see Leander again . Then he decided to try to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . There was a young officer there who seemed , in spite of Coverly 's civilian clothes , disappointed not to have him salute . " I want some emergency transportation , " Coverly said . " What 's the nature of the emergency ? " Coverly noticed that the officer had a tic in his right cheek . " My father is dying . " " I-Iave you any proof of this ? " " There 's a cable at communications . " " What do you do ? " the officer asked . " I 'm one of the Tapers , " Coverly said . " Well , you might get excused from work for a week . I 'm sure you ca n't get any emergency transportation . The major 's at the club but I know he wo n't help you . Why do n't you go and see the chaplain ? " " I 'll go and see the chaplain , " Coverly said . It was dark then and the movies had begun and all the stars hung in the soft dark . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and when he got there he could see a blue gasoline lamp above the door and behind the lamp a large sign that said WELCOME . The building was a considerable tribute to human in genuity . Bamboo had been lashed into a scaffolding and this was covered with palm matting  --  all of it holding to the conventional lines of a country church . There was even a steeple made of palm matting and there was an air of conspicuous unpopularity about the place . The doorway was plastered with WELCOME signs and so was the interior and on a table near the door were free stationery , moldy magazines and an invitation for rest , recreation and prayer . The chaplain , a first lieutenant named Lindstrom , was there , writing a letter . He wore steel-rimmed GI spectacles on a weak and homely face , and he was a man who belonged to the small places of the earth  --  to little towns with their innocence , theirp207bigotry and their devilish gossip  --  and he seemed to have brought , intact to the atoll , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-righteous and bitter piety with which he would thank God , at Sunday dinner , for a can of salmon and a bottle of lemonade . He invited Coverly to sit down and offered him some stationery and Coverly said he needed help . " I do n't remember your face , " Linstrom said , " so I guess you 're not a member of my congregation . I never forget a face . I do n't see why the men do n't come here and worship . I think I have one of the nicest chapels in the West Pacific and last Sunday I only had five men at the service . I 'm trying to see if I ca n't get one of the photographers to come down from headquarters and take a picture of the place . I think there ought to be a photograph of this chapel in Life magazine . I have to share it with Father O'Leary , but he did n't give me much help when there was work involved . He did n't seem to care where his men worshiped . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . It 's none of my business how he spends his time but I do n't think a minister of the gospel ought to play cards . I 've never held a playing card in my hand . Of course it 's none of my business , but I do n't approve of the methods he uses to get his congregation together , either . He had twenty-eight men here last Sunday . I counted them . But you know how he did it ? There was a whisky ration last Saturday and he went down and pulled the men out of line and made them come to confession . No confession , no whisky . Anybody could fill up a church if they did things like that . I put out the stationeryand the magazines and I painted the Welcome signs myself and whenever my wife sends me cookies  --  my wife bakes oatmeal cookies ; she could make a fortune if she wanted to open a bakery  --  now when my wife sends me cookies I put them in a dish out here but that 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some emergency transportation , " Coverly said . " I want to go home . My father 's dying . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , my boy , " Lindstrom said . " I 'm very sorry . I ca n't get you emergency transportation . I do n't know why they send people to me . I do n't know why they do this . You can gop208and see the major . A man got some emergency transportation last month . At least that 's what I heard . You go to the major and I 'll pray for you . " The major was playing poker and drinking whisky at the officers ' club and he left the card table gruffly , but he was an amiable or sentimental drinker , and when Coverly said that his father was dying he put an arm around his shoulder , walked him over to the transportation office and got a clerk out of the movies to cut his orders . He left before dawn in an old DC-4 , covered with oil and with a picture of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . They got to Oahu in the disorder of a hot summer dusk with more lightning playing in the mountains . He left for San Francisco in a transport at eleven the next night . There was a crap game and the uninsulated plane was very cold and Coverly sat in a bucket seat , wrapped in a blanket . The drone of the motors reminded him of the Topaze and he fell asleep . When he woke the sky was a rosy color and the flight clerk was passing out oranges and saying that he could smell the land wind . A solid cloud ceiling broke as they neared the coast and they could see the burned summer hills of San Francisco . A few hours after clearing military customs Coverly hitched a ride on a bomber to Washington and went from there to St. Botolphs on the train . He took a taxi from the station out to the farm in the middle of the morning and saw , for the first time , the signs on the main road on the elm tree , VISIT THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got out of the cab and looking around he saw his father , searching for four-leaf clovers in the meadow by the river , and he ran to him , " Oh , I knew you 'd come , Coverly , " Leander called . " I knew that you or Moses would come , " and he embraced his son and laid his head on his shoulder.  |p211At  the turn of the century there were more castles in the United States than there were in all of Merrie England when Gude King Arthur ruled that land . The search for a wife took Moses to one of the last of these establishments to be maintained  --  the bulk of them had been turned into museums , bought by religious orders or demolished . This was a place called Clear Haven , the demesne of Justina Wapshot Molesworth Scaddon , an ancient cousin from St. Botolphs who had married a five-and-ten-cent-store millionaire . Moses had met her at a cotillion or dance that he had gone to with a classmate from Bond School and through her had met her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant he saw her , to be , by his lights , a most desirable and beautiful woman . He courted her and when they became lovers he asked her to marry him . So far as he knew , this sudden decision had nothing to do with the conditions of Honora 's will . Melissa agreed to marry him if he would live at Clear Haven . He had no objections . The place  --  whatever it was  --  would shelter them for the summer and he felt sure that he could prevail on her to move into the city in the fall . So one rainy afternoon he took a train to Clear Haven , planning to love Melissa Scaddon and to marry her . The conservative sumptuary tastes that Moses had formed inp212St . Botolphs had turned out to coincide with the sumptuary tastes of New York banking , and under his dun-colored raincoat Moses wore the odd , drab clothes of that old port . It was nearly dark when he set out , and the journey through the northern slums , and the rainfall catching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , made him somber and restive . The train that he took ran up the banks of the river and , sitting on the land side of the car , he watched a landscape that in the multitude of its anomalies would have prepared him for Clear Haven if he had needed any preparation , for nothing was any more what it had aimed to be or what it would be in the end and the house that had meant to express familial pride was now a funeral parlor , the house that had meant to express worldly pride was a rooming house , Ursuline nuns lived in the castle that was meant to express the pride of avarice , but through this erosion of purpose Moses thought he saw everywherethe impress of human sweetness and ingenuity . The train was a local and the old rolling stock creaked from station to station , although at some distance from the city the stops were infrequent and he saw now and then from the window those huddled families who wait on the platform for a train or a passenger and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attitudes to seem to be drawn together by some sad and urgent business . Only two passengers remained in the car when they reached Clear Haven and he was the only one to leave the train . The rain was dense then , the night was dark and he went into a waiting room that held his attention for a minute for there was a large photograph on the wall , framed in oak , of his destination . Flags flew from the many towers of Clear Haven , the buttresses were thick with ivy and considering what he went there for it seemed far from ridiculous . Justina seemed to have had a hand in the waiting room for there was a rug on the floor . The matchboard walls were stained the color of mahogany and the pipes that must heat the place in winter rose gracefully , two by two , to disappear like serpents into holes in the ceiling . The benches around the walls were divided at regular intervals with graceful loops of bent wood that would serve the travelers as arm rests and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the waiting room he found a single cab at the curb . " I 'll take you up to the gates , " the driver said . " I ca n't take you up to the house but I 'll leave you at the gates . " The gates , Moses saw when he got out of the taxi , were made of iron and were secured with a chain and padlock . There was a smaller gate on the left and he went in there and walked through the heavy rain to the lights of what he guessed was a gatehouse or cottage . A middle-aged man came to the door  --  he was eating  --  and seemed delighted when Moses gave his name . " I'ma Giacomo , " he said . " I'ma Giacomo . You cornea with me . " Moses followed him into an old garage , rank with the particular damp of cold concrete that goes so swiftly to the bone . There , in the glare , stood an old Rolls-Royce with a crescent-windowed tonneau like the privy at West Farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuel pump and it took him some time to get the car started . " She'sa nearly dead , " Giacomo said . " She'sa no good for night driving . Then they backed like a warship out into the rain . There were no windshield wipers or Giacomo did not use them and they traveled without headlights up a windingdrive . Then suddenly Moses saw the lights of Clear Haven . There seemed to be hundreds of them  --  they were so numerous that they lighted the road and lifted his spirits . Moses thanked Giacomo and carried his suitcase through the rain to the shelter of a big porch that was carved and ribbed like the porch of a cathedral . The only bell he saw to ring was a contraption of wrought-iron leaves and roses , so fanciful and old that he was afraid it might come down on his head if he used it , and he pounded on the door with his fist . A maid let him in and he stepped into a kind of rotunda and at the same time Melissa appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain run out of the brim of his hat and gathered his beloved up in his arms . His clothes were wet and a little rancid as well . " I suppose you could change , " Melissa said , " but there is n't much time .... " Ile recognized in her look of mingled anxiety and pleasure the suspense of someone who introduces one part of life into another ,  |p214feeling  insecurely that they may clash and involve a choice or a parting . He felt her suspense as she took his arm and led hint across a floor where their footsteps rang on the black-and-white marble . It was unlike Moses , but to tell the truth he looked neither to the left where he heard the sounds of a fountain nor to the right where he smelled the sweet earth of a conservatory , feeling , like Cousin Honora , that to pretend to have been born and bred in whatever environment one found oneself was a mark of character . He was in a sense right in resisting his curiosity , for Clear Haven had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one had ever counted the rooms  --  no one , that is , but a vulgar and ambitious cousin who had spent one rainy afternoon this way , feeling that splendor could be conveyed in numbers . She had come up with the sum of ninety-two but no one knew whether or-not she had counted the maid 's rooms , the bathrooms and the odd , unused rooms , some of them without windows , that had been created by the numerous additions to the place , for the house had grown , reflecting the stubborn and eccentric turns of Justina 's mind . When she had bought the great hall from the Villa Peschere in Milan she had cabled the architect , telling him to attach it to the small library . She would not have bought the hall if she had known that she would be offered the drawing rooms from the Chateau de la Muette a week later , and she wrote the architect asking him to attach this to the little dining room and advising him that she had bought four marble fountains reprosenting the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived and that since there was no room for them in the house would she approve his plans for a winter garden to be attached to the hall from Milan ? She cabled back her approval and bought that afternoon a small chapel that could be attached to the painted room that Mr. Scaddon had given her on her birth day . People often said that she bought more rooms than she knew how to use ; but she used them all . She was not one of those collectors who let their prizes rot in warehouses . On the same trip she had picked up a marble floor and some columns in Vincenrap215but the most impressive addition to Clear Haven that she was able to find on that or any of her later trips were the stones and timbers of the great Windsor Hall . It was to this expatriated hall now that Melissa took Moses . Justina sat by the fire , drinking sherry . She was , by Leander 's reckoning , about seventy-five then , but her hair and her eyebrows were ink black and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were glassy and shrewd . Her hair was raised offher forehead in a high construction , plainly old-fashioned and remindingMoses of the false front on the Cartwright Block in St. Botolphs . It was the same period . But she reminded him mostly of what she had been  --  a foxy old dancing mistress . She greeted Moses with marked disinterest but this was not surprising in a woman whose distrust of men was even more outspokenthan Cousin Honora 's . Her dress was rich and simple and her imperious and hoarse voice ranged over a complete octave of requited social ambitions . " The Count D'Alba , General Burgoyne and Mrs. Enderby , " she said , introducing Moses to the others in the room . The count was a tall , dark-skinned man with cavernous and hairy nostrils . The general was an old man in a wheel chair . Mrs. Enderby wore a pince-nez , the lozenge-shaped lenses of which hung so limply from the bridge of her nose that they gave her a very dropsical look . Her fingers were stained with ink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these were so outrageouslyproportioned that Moses had to boost himself up and found , when he was seated , that his legs did not reach the floor . A maid passed him a glass of sherry and a dish in which there were a few old peanuts . The sherry was not fit to drink and when he tasted it Melissa smiled at him and he remembered her accounts of Justina 's parsimony and wished he had brought some whisky in his suitcase . Then a maid stood in a distant doorway and rang some chimes and they went down a hall into a room that was lighted with candles . The dinner was a cup of soup , a boiled potato , a scrap of fish and some kind of custard , and the conversation , that was meant to move at Justina 's dictates , suffered from the fact that shep216seemed either tired , absent-minded or annoyed by Moses ' arrival . When the general spoke to her about the illness of a friend she expressed her fixed idea about the perfidiousness of men . It was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illness . Unmarried women  --  she said  --  were much healthier than wives . When the meal was finished they returned to the ball . Moses was still hungry and he hoped that there was some break . down in the kitchen arrangements and that if he did live at Cleat Haven he would not be expected to get along on such meager fare . Justina played backgammon with the general and the count sat down at the piano and started a medley of that lachrymose music that is played for cocktails and that is so limpid in ib amorousness , so supine and wistful in its statement of passion that it will offend the ears of a man in love . Suddenly all the lights went out . " The main fuse is gone again , " Justina said , rolling her dice in the firelight . " Can I fix it ? " Moses asked , anxious to make a good impression . " I do n't know , " Justina said . " There are plenty of fuses . " Melissa lighted a candle and Moses followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voices from the kitchen where t ho servants were striking matches and looking for candles . She opened a door into a further corridor and started down a steep flight el worn , wooden stairs into a cellar that smelled of earth . They foursthe fuse box and Moses changed the old fuse for a new on although he noticed that the wiring was in some cases bare carelessly patched with friction tape . Melissa blew out her sand and they returned to the hall , where the count had resumed Is forlorn music and where the general hitched his wheel chair up to Moses and led him to a glass case near the fireplace where tlhut  --  were some moldy academic robes that the late Mr. Scaddott had worn when he was given an honorary degree from Princeton . It pleased Moses to think that the palace and the hall stood four square on the five-and-ten-cent stores of his youth with their appetizing and depraved odors . His most vivid memories errs of the girls  --  the girl with acne at the cosmetic counter , the lull.  |p217busted  girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the demure beauty selling oilcloth and the straw-haired town whore on probation among the wind-up toys  --  and if there was no visible connection between these memories and the hall at Clear Haven the practical connection was inarguable . Moses noticed that when the general spoke of J. P. Scaddon he avoided the phrase " five-and-ten-cent store " and spoke only of merchandising . " He was a great merchant , " the general said , " an exceptional man , a distinguished man  --  even his enemies would admit that . For the forty years that he was president of the firm his days were scheduledfrom eight in the morning until sometimes after midnight . When I say that he was distinguished I mean that he was distinguished by his energies , his powers of judgment , his courage and imagination . He possessed all these things to an unusual degree . He was never involved in any shady deals and the merchandisingworld as we see it today owes something to his imagination , his intelligence and his fine sense of honor . He had , of course , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened stores in Venezuela and Belgium and India his intention was not to make himself or his stockholders any richer , but to raise the standard of living generally . . . . " Moses listened to what the general said but the thought that he would lay Melissa had given to that day such stubborn light and joy that it was an effort to keep his ardor from turning to impatiencewhile he listened to this praise of the late millionaire . She was beautiful and it was that degree of beauty that fills even the grocery boy and the garage mechanic with solemn thoughts . The strong , dark-golden color of her hair , her shoulder bones and gorge and the eyes that appeared black at that distance had over Moses such a power that , as he watched her , desire seemed to darken and gild her figure like the cumulative coats of varnish on an old painting , and he would have been gratified if some slight hurt had befallen her , for that deep sense of involvement we experience when we see a lovely woman  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loveliness of intent  --  trip on the iron steps of a train carriage or on a curbing of the street  --  or when , on a rainyp218day , we see the paper bag in which she is carrying her groceries home split and rain down around her feet and into the puddles on the sidewalk oranges , bunches of celery , loaves of bread , cold cuts wrapped in cellophane  --  that deep sense of involvement that can be explained by injury and loss was present with Moses with no explanation . He had half risen from his chair when the old lady snapped : " Bedtime ! " He had underestimated the power of desire to draw his features and he was caught . From under her dyed eyebrows Justina looked at him hatefully . " I 'm going to ask you to take the general to his room , " she said . " Your room is just down the hall so there wo n't be any inconvenience . Melissa 's room is on the other side of the house "  --  she said this triumphantly and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not convenient for her to take the general up .... " The stamp of desire on his face had betrayed him once and he did not want to be betrayed by disappointment or anger and he smiled broadly  --  he positively beamed  --  but he wondered how , in the labyrinth of rooms , he would ever find his way to her best , He could not go around knocking on all the doors nor could he open them on screaming maids or the figure of Mrs. Enderby taking off her beads . He might stir up a hornet 's nest of servants even the Count D'Alba  --  and precipitate a scandal that would end with his expulsion from Clear Haven . Melissa was smiling se sweetly that he thought she must have a plan and she kissed him decorously and whispered , " Over the roof . " Then she spoke fat the benefit of the others . " I 'll see you in the morning , Moses , . Pleasant dreams .

" Thank you , Mr. Wapshot , " the oldp219man said when Moses had wheeled his chair to the door . " I 'll be all right now . We 're very glad to have you with us . Melissa has been very unhappy , very unhappy and unsettled . Good night . " Back in his own room Moses shucked his clothes , brushed his teeth and stepped out onto the balcony of his room , where the rain still fell , making in the grass and the leaves a mealy sound . He smiled broadly with a great love of the world and everything in it and then , in his skin , started the climb over the roofs . This seemed to be the greatest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sought , to be a naked man scrambling over the leads presented nothing that was actually very irregular or perplexing . The rain on his skin and hair felt fresh and soft and the chaos of wet roofs fitted easily into the picture of love ; and it was the roofs of Clear Haven , to be seen only by the birds or a stray airplane , where the architect had left bare the complexity of his task  --  in a sense his defeat  --  for here all the random majesty of the place appeared spatchcocked , rectifiedand jumbled ; here , hidden in the rain , were the architect 's secrets and most of his failures . Peaked roofs , flat roofs , pyramidal roofs , roofs inset with stained-glass skylights and chimneys and bizarre systems of drainage stretched for a quarter of a mile or more , shining here and there in the light from a distant dormer window like the roofs of a city . As far as he could see in the rainy dark the only way to get to the other side of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started for them when a length of wire , stretched kneehighacross a part of the roof , tripped him up . It was an old radio aerial , he guessed charitably , since he was not hurt , and started off again . A few minutes later he passed a rain-soaked towel and a bottle of sun-tan lotion and still further along there was an empty bottle of vermouth , making the roof seem like a beach on which someone , unknown he felt sure to Justina , had stretched out his bones in the sun . As he approached the ledge to the first lighted dormer he saw straight into a small room , decked with religious pictures , where an old servant was ironing . The lights in the next window were pink , and glancing in briefly he was sur/prised to see the Count D'Aba standing in front of a full-length mirror without any clothes on . The next window was Mrs. 1 , ' . n derby 's and she sat at a desk , dressed as she had been at dinner , writing in a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk light when his right foot , seeking a hold , moved off into nothing but the rainy dark and only by swinging and throwing his weight onto the slates did he keep from falling . What he had missed was an airshaft that cut straight through the three stories of the brill and that would have been the end of him . He peered down at this , waiting for the chemistry of his alarmed body to quiet and listening then to see if Mrs. Enderby or the others had heard the noise he made when he threw himself down . Everything w'ai quiet and he made the rest of his climb more slowly , swinging down at last onto the balcony of Melissa 's room where he stood outside her window , watching her brush her hair . She sat at a table by a mirror and her nightgown was transparent so that even in the dim light of the room he could see the fullness of her brcastr , parting a little as she leaned toward the mirror . " You 're drenched , my darling , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opaque and wanton ; she raised her mouth to be kissed and he unknotted the ribbons of her gown so that it fell to her waist and she drew his head down from her lips to salute her breasts . Then , naked and unshy , she crossed the floor and went into the bathroom to finish her toilet and Moses listened to the noises of running water and the sounds of opening and closing drawers , knowing that it was sensible for a lover to be able to estimate these particular delays . She came back , walking he thought in glory and turning out the lights that she passed on her way , and at dawn , stroking her soft buttocks and listening to the singing of the crows , she told him that he would have to go and he climbed in his skin back over the chaos of roofs . It was daybreak then and Moses , unable to sleep , dressed and went out . Coming down the stairs , he saw in the strong light of morning that everything sumptuous was dirty and worn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cigar ashes on the stair carpet and the needlepoint bench at the turning wasp221missing a leg . Coming down into the rotunda Moses saw a large gray rat . They exchanged a look and then the rat  --  too fat or arrogant to run  --  moved into the library . Crystals were missing from the chandelier , bits of marble from the floor were gone and the hall seemed like an old hotel where expensiveness and elegancehad been abandoned by its company to old men , old women and the near poor . The air was stale and the chests that stood at regular intervals along the wall were ringed white from glasses . Most of the chests were missing a claw or a piece of hardware . Continuing along the hall Moses realized that he had never seen so many chests and he wondered what they contained . He wondered if the Scaddons had bought them by mail , ordered them from some dealer or succumbed to a greed for these massive , ornate and , so far as he knew , useless things . He wondered again what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a glass door onto a broad lawn . The women that Moses loved seemed to be in the morning sky , gorged with lights , in the river , the mountains and the trees , and with lust in his trousers and peace in his heart he walked happily over the grass . Below the house there was an old-fashioned Roman plunge with a marble curb and water spouting out of lions ' mouths and , having nothing better to do , Moses took a swim . A day that had begun brilliantly darkened suddenly and it began to rain , and Moses went back to the house to get some breakfast and talk with Justina . Moses had written to Leander about Justina and Leander had replied without a salutation and with this title : " The Rise of a Mercenary B -- ch . " Under the heading he had written : " Justina ; daughter of Amos and Elizabeth Molesworth . Only child . Father was sporting gent . Good-looker but unable or unwilling to meet domestic obligations . Deserted wife &; child . Was never heard from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; night . Ruined eyesight . Mouth always full of pins . Little Justina was changeling from onset or so it appeared to me . Marked taste for queenly things . Scraps of velvet . Peacock feathers ,  |p222etc  . Only childhood game ever indulged in was to play queen iii topshelf finery . Out of place in such a town as St. Botolphs . Sub ject to much ridicule . Was taken on as apprentice dancing nuis tress by Gracie Tolland . Held sway in Eastern Star Hall above drugstore ; feed store also . Place smelled of floor oil . Later played piano for movies in old Masonic Temple and J. P. Scaddon five &; dime store . Waltz me around again Willie . Piano always badly out of tune . " J. P. Scaddon then competing with Woolworth and Kresge . Millionaire but not above visiting backwoods stores . Beheld Justina tickling the ivories . Love at first sight ! Transported same to New York . Amy Atkinson served as duenna . Later married Justina . Newspaper accounts omitted any mention of St. Botolphs , dress making mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into high society . Justina well equipped to scrap for social position in New York bear pit . Became benefactress of Dog &; Cat Hospital . Often photographed in newspaper , surrounded by grate ful bow-wows . Was once asked to contribute small sum of money to local Sailor 's Home . Refused . Anxious to keep severance of tics with home-place in good condition . No children . Hobnobbed with dukes and earls . Entertained royalty . Opened big house on Fifth Avenue . Also country place . Clear Haven . All dreams come true . " Later in the morning Moses found Justina in the winter garden  --  a kind of dome-shaped greenhouse attached to one of the extremitiesof the castle . Many of the window lights were broken and Giacomo had repaired these by stuffing bed pillows into the frames . There seemed to have been flower beds around the walls in the past and in the center of the room were a fountain and a pool . When Moses entered the room and asked to speak with her , Justina sat down in an iron chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that facade of black hair that was like the Cart . wright Block and sighed . " Then why do n't you ? Melissa is twenty-eight years old . She can do what she wants . "  | " We would like your approval . " " Melissa has no money and no expectations , " the old woman said . " She owns nothing of value but her beads . The resale value of pearls is very disappointing and they 're almost impossible to insure . " " That would n't matter . " " You know very little about her . " " I only know that I want to marry her . " " I think there are some things about her past that you should know . Her parents were killed when she was seven . Mr. Scaddon and I were delighted to adopt her  --  she has such a sweet nature  --  but we 've had our troubles . She married Ray Badger . You knew that ? " " She told me . " " He became an alcoholic through no fault , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas about marriage . I hope you do n't entertain any such opinions . " " I 'm not sure what you mean . " " Mr. Scaddon and I slept in separate rooms whenever this was possible . We always slept in separate beds . " " I see . " " Even in Italy and France . " " It will be some time before we can hope to travel , " Moses said , hoping to change the subject . " I do n't think Melissa will ever be able to travel , " Justina said . " She 's not left Clear Haven since her divorce . " " Melissa 's told me this herself . " " It seemed a confining life for a young woman , " Justina said . " Last year I bought her a ticket to go around the world . She was agreeable , but when all her luggage had been brought aboard and we were drinking some wine in her cabin she decided that she could n't go . Her distress was extreme . I brought her back to Clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her hats went around the world . " " I see , " Moses said . " Melissa 's told me this and I would like to live here until our marriage . "  | " That can be arranged . Is your father still alive ? " " Yes . " " He must be very old . My memories of St. Botolphs are not pleasant . I left there when I was seventeen . When I married Mr. Scaddon I must have received a hundred letters from people in the village , asking for financial help . This did nothing to improve my recollections . I did try to be helpful . For several years I took some child  --  an artist or a pianist  --  and gave them an education . but none of them worked out . " She unclasped her hands and gestured sadly as if she had dropped the students from a great height . " I had to let them all go . You lived up the river , did n't you ? I remember the house . I suppose you have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this and he answered hesitantly . " Could you give me some idea of what they are ? " " Cradles , highboys , lowboys , things like that . Cut glass . " " I would n't be interested in cut glass , " Justina said . " However , I 've never collected Early American furniture and I 've always wanted to . Dishes ? " " My brother Coverly would know more about this than I , " Moses said . " Ah yes , " Justina said . " Well , it does not matter to me whether you and Melissa marry . I think Mrs. Enderby is in her office now and you can ask her to set a date . She will send out the invitations . And be careful of that loose stone in the floor . You might trip and hurt yourself . " Moses found Mrs. Enderby and after he listened to some frowsty memories of her youth on the Riviera she told him that he could be married in three weeks . He looked for Melissa but the maids told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb the stairs to her part of the house he heard Justina 's voice at his back . " Come down , Mr. Wapshot . " Melissa did n't come down until lunch and this meal , although it was not filling , was served with two kinds of wine and dragged on until three . After lunch they walked back and forth on the terrace below the towers like two figures on a dinner plate andp225looking for some privacy in the gardens they ran into Mrs. Enderby . At half-past five , when it was time for Moses to go and he took Melissa in his arms , a window in one of the towers flew open and Justina called down , " Melissa , Melissa , tell Mr. Wapshot that if he does n't hurry he 'll miss his train . " After work on Monday Moses packed his clothing in two suitcasesand a paper box , putting in among his shirts a bottle of bourbon , a box of crackers and a three-pound piece of Stilton cheese . Again he was the only passenger to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the old Rolls and drive him up the hill . Melissa met him at the door and that evening followed the pattern of his first night there except that the fuses did n't blow . Moses wheeled the general to the elevatorat ten and started once more over the roofs , this time on such a clear , starlit night that he could see the airshaft that had nearly killed him . Again in the morning at dawn he climbed back to his own quarters and what could be pleasanter than to see that heavily wooded and hilly countryside at dawn from the high roofs of Clear Haven . He went to the city on the train , returned in the evening to Clear Haven , yawned purposefully during dinner and pushed the old general to the elevator at half-past nine.  |p226While  Moses was eating these golden apples , Coverly and Betsey had settled in a rocket-launching station called Remsen Park . Coverly had only spent one day at the farm . Leander had urged him to return to his wife  --  and had gone to work himself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined Betsey iii New York and , after a delay of only a few days , was transferred to this new station . This time they traveled together . Remsen Park was a community of four thousand identical houses , bounded on the west by an old army camp . The place could not be criticized as a town or city . Expedience , convenience and haste had pro ducal it when the rocket program was accelerated ; but the houses were dry in the rain and warm in the winter ; they had wellequippedkitchens and fireplaces for domestic bliss and the healthy need for national self-preservation could more than excuse the fact that they were all alike . At the heart of the community there was a large shopping center with anything you might want  --  all of it housed in glass-walled buildings . This was Betsey 's joy . She and Coverly rented a house , furnished even to the pictures on the  --  walls , and set up housekeeping with the blue china and the painted chairs that Sarah sent them from St. Botolphs . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was pregnant . She felt sick in the morning and stayed in bed late . When she got up , Coverly had gone to work . He had left coffee for her in the kitchen and had washed his own dishes . She ate a late breakfast , sitting at the kitchen window so that she could see the houses of Remsen Park stretchingaway to the horizon like the pattern on a cloth . The woman in the house next door came out to empty her garbage . She was an Italian , the wife of an Italian scientist . Betsey called good morning to her and asked her to come in and have a cup of coffee but the Italian woman only gave her a sullen smile and returned to her own kitchen . Remsen Park was not a very friendly place . Betsey hoped that she would not be disappointed in her pregnancy . Her mind seemed to strike an attitude of prayer , as involuntaryas the impulse with which she swore when she slammed her finger in a window . Dear God , she thought briefly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted five or six . She smiled suddenly , as if her wish had filled the kitchen with the love , disorderand vitality of a family . She was braiding the hair of her daughter , Sandra , a beautiful girl . The other four or five were in the room . They were happy and dirty and one of them , a little boy with Coverly 's long neck , was holding in his hands the halves of a broken dish , but Betsey had not scolded him , Betsey had not even frowned when he broke the dish , for the secret of his clear , resilient personality was that his growth had never been impeded by niggardly considerations . Betsy felt that she had a latent talent for raising children . She would put the development of personality above everything . The phantom children that played around her knees had never received from their parents anything but love and trust . When the housework was done it was time for Betsey to take the iron out and have the cord repaired . She walked out of Circle K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the super market , not because she needed anything but because the atmosphere of the place pleased her . It was vast and brightly lighted and music came down from the high blue walls . She bought a giant jar of peanut butter to the strains of the " Blue Danube "  |p228and  then a pecan pie . The cashier seemed to be a pleasant young man . " I 'm a stranger here , " Betsey said . " We 've just moved from New York . My husband 's been out in the Pacific . We have one of those houses in Circle K and I just wondered if you could give me some advice . My ironing cord is frayed , it just gave out the day before yesterday when I was doing my husband 's shirts , and I just wondered if you happened to know of an electrical-appliance or repair store in the vicinity that might fix it for me so that I could have it tomorrow because tomorrow 's the day when I do my big shopping and I thought I could come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron on my way home . " " Well , there 's a store four , no five doors down the street , " the young man said , " and I guess they can fix it for you . They fixed my radio for me once and they 're not highway robbers like some of the people 's come in here . " Betsey thanked him kindly and went out into the street and wandered along to the electrical store . " Good morning , " Betsey said cheerfully , putting her iron on the counter . " I 'm a stranger here and when my ironing cord went yesterday while I was doing my husband 's shirts I said to myself that I just did n't know where to take it and have it repaired but this morning I stopped in at the Grand Food Mart and tha t cashier , the nice one with the pretty , wavy hair and those dark eyes , told me that he recommended your store and so I came right over here . Now what I 'd like to do is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my iron on my way home because I have to get some shirts ironed for my husband by tomorrow night and I wondered if you could have it ready for me by then . It 's a good iron and I gave a lot of money for it in New York where we 've been living although my husband was out in the Pacific . My husband 's a Taper . Of course I do n't understand why the cord on such an expensive iron should wear out in such a short time and I wondered if you could put on an extra-special cord for me because I get a great deal of use out of my iron . I do all my husband 's shirts , you know , and he 's high up in the Taping Department and has to wear a clean shirt every day and then I do my own personal things as well . " The man promised to givep229Betsey a durable cord and then she wandered back to Circle K.But her steps slowed as she approached the house . Her family of phantom children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her period was only seven days late and her pregnancy might not be a fact . She ate a peanut-butter sandwich and a wedge of pecan pie . She missed New York and thought again that Remsen Park was an unfriendly place . Late in the day the doorbell rang and a vacuum-cleaner salesman stood in the door . " Well now , come right in , " Betsey said cheerfully . " You come right in . I do n't have a vacuum cleaner now and I do n't have the money to buy one at the moment . We only just moved from New York but I 'm going to buy one as soon as I have the money and perhaps if you 've got some new attachments I might buy one of those because I 'm determined to buy a new vacuum cleaner sooner or later and I 'll need the attachments anyhow . I 'm pregnant now and a young mother ca n't do all that housework without the proper equipment ; all that stooping and bending . Would you like a cup of coffee ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that heavy bag all day long . My husband 's in the Taping Department and they work him hard but it 's a different kind of tiredness , it 's just in the brain , but I know what it is to have tired feet . " The salesman opened his sample case in the kitchen before he drank his coffee and sold Betsey two attachments and a gallon of floor wax . Then , because he was tired , and this was his last call , he sat down . " I was living alone in New York all the time my husband was in the Pacific , " Betsey said , " and we just moved out here and of course I was happy to make the move but I do n't find it a very friendly place . I mean I do n't think it 's friendly like New York . In New York I had lots of friends . Of course I was mistaken , once . I was mistaken in my friends . You know what I mean ? There were these people named Hansen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they were my real friends . I thought at last I 'd found some lifelong friends . I used to see them every day and every night and she would n't buy a dress withoutasking me about it and I loaned them money and they werep230always telling me how much they loved me , but I was deceived . Sad was the day of reckoning ! " The light in the kitchen was dim and Betsey 's face was drawn with feeling . " They were hypocrites , " she said . " They were liars and hypocrites . " The salesman packed his things and went away . Coverly came home at six . " Hello , sugar , " he said . " Why sit in the dark ? " " Well , I think I 'm pregnant , " Betsey said . " I guess I 'm pregnant . I 'm seven days late and this morning I felt sort of funny , dizzy and sick . " She sat on Coverly 's lap and put her head against his . " I think it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to mc . Of course there 's no point in counting your chickens before your eggs are hatched but if we do have a baby one of the things I want to buy is a nice chair because I 'm going to breast feed this baby and I 'd like to have a nice chair to sit in when I nurse him . " " You can buy a chair , " Coverly said . " Well , I saw a nice chair in the furniture center a couple of days ago , " Betsey said , " and after supper why do n't we walk around the corner and look at it ? I have n't been out of the house all day and a little walk would be good for you , would n't it ? Would n't it be good for you to stretch your legs ? " After supper they took their walk . A fresh wind was blowing out of the north  --  straight from St. Botolphs  --  and it made Betsey feel vigorous and gay . She took Coverly 's arm and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and gave her a French kiss . Once they got to the shopping center Betsey was n't able to concentrate on her chair . Every suit , dress , fur coat and piece of furniture in the store windows had to be judged , its price and way of life guessed at and some judgment passed as to whether or not it should enter Betsey 's vision of happiness . Yes , she said to a plant stand , yes , yes to a grand piano , no to a breakfront , yes to a dining-room table and six chairs , as thoughtfully as St. Peter sifting out the hearts of men . At ten o'clock they walked home , Coverly undressed her tenderly and they took a bath together and went to bed for she was his potchke , his fleutchke , his notchke , his motchke , his everything that the speech of St. Botolphs left unexpressed . She was his little , little squirrel.  |p231During  the three weeks before their marriage , Moses and Melissa deceived Justina so successfully that it pleased the old lady to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she spoke several times at dinner of Melissa 's part of the house as that part of the house that Moses had never seen . Moses 's trainingas a mountain climber kept him from tiring in his nightly trip over the roofs but one evening , when they had wine with dinner and he was hurried , he tripped over the wire once more and sprawled , full-length , on the slates , cutting his chest . Then , with his skin smarting , a deep physical chagrin took hold of him and he discovered in himself a keen dislike of Clear Haven and all its antics and a determination to prove that the country of love was not bizarre ; and he consoled himself with thinking that in a few days he would be able to put a ring on Melissa 's finger and enter her room at the door . She had , for some reason , made him promise not to urge her to leave Clear Haven , but he felt that she would change her mind by autumn . On the eve of his wedding Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a suitcase . On the drive he met Giacomo , who was putting light bulbs into the fixtures along the drive . " She'sa two hundred feefty light bulbs ! " Giacomo exclaimed  | " She'sa likea Saint 's Day . " It was dusk when the lights gave Clear Haven the cheerful look of a country fair . When Moses took the general up the old man wanted to give him a drink and some advice , but he excused himself and started over the roofs . He was covering the stretch from the chapel to the clock tower when he heard Justina 's voice , quite close to him . She was at D'Alba 's window . " I ca n't see anything , Niki , " she said , " without my glasses . " " Shhh , " D'Alba said , " he 'll hear you . " " I wish I could find my glasses . " " Shhhh . " " Oh , I ca n't believe it , Niki , " Justina said . " I ca n't believe that they 'd disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , " D'Alba said as Moses , who had been crouching in the dark , made for the shelter of the clock tower . " Where ? " " There , there . " " Get Mrs. Enderby , " Justina said . " Get Mrs. Enderby and have her call Giacomo and tell him to bring his crow gun . " " You 'll kill him , Justina . " " Any man who does such a thing deserves to be shot . " What Moses felt while he listened to their talk was extreme irritation and impatience , for having started on his quest he did not have the reserve to brook interruptions , or at least interrup tions from Justina and the count . He was safe in the shelter of the tower and while he stood there he heard Mrs. Enderby and then Giacomo join the others . " She'sa nobody there , " Giacomo said . " Well , fire anyway , " Justina said . " If there 's someone there you 'll frighten them . If there is n't you wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scaddon , " Giacomo said . " You fire , Giacomo , " Justina said . " You either fire or hand me that gun . " " Wait until I get something to cover my ears , " Mrs. Enderby said . " Wait until ... "  |p233Then  there was the ear-clapping blast of Giacomo 's crow gun and Moses heard the shot strike on the roof around him and in the distance the ring of breaking glass . " Oh why do I feel so sad ? " Justina asked plaintively . " Why do I feel so sad ? " D'Alba shut the window and when his lights were turned on and his pink curtains drawn , Moses continued his climb . Melissa ran to him weeping when he swung down onto the balconyof her room . " Oh my darling , I thought they 'd shot you , " she cried . " Oh my sweetheart , I thought you were dead . " Coverly could not get away from Remsen Park , but Leander and Sarah came to the wedding . They must have left St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral car . Moses was delighted to see them and proud , for they played out their parts with the wonderful simplicity and grace of country people . As for the invitations to the wedding  --  Justina had dusted off her old address book , and poor Mrs. Enderby , wearing a hat and a scrap of veiling , had addressed the four hundred envelopes and come to the dinner table for a week with ink-stained fingers and an ink-spotted blouse , her eyes red from checking Justina 's addressesagainst a copy of the Social Register that could have been printed no later than 1918 . Giacomo mailed the cards with his blessing ( " She'sa lovely , Missa Scaddon " ) and the cards were delivered to brownstones in the East Fifties that had been transformedfrom homesteads into showrooms for Italian neckties , art galleries , antique dealers , walk-up apartments and offices of such organizations as the English-Speaking Union and the **26;10548;TOOLONG . Further uptown and further east the invitationswere received by the tail-coated doormen of eighteen- and twenty-story apartment buildings where the names of Justina 's friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up Fifth Avenue invitations were delivered to more apartment houses as well as to institutes of costume design , slapdash rooming houses , finishing schools and to the offices of the American Irish Historical Society and the Sino-American Amity , Inc . They were exposed to the sootfall among other uncollected mail ( old bills from Tif/fany and copies of The New Yorker ) in houses with boarded-up front doors . They lay on the battered tables of progressive kindergartenswhere children could be heard laughing and weeping and they fell into the anonymous passageways of houses that , built with an open hand , had been remodeled with a tight one and where peoplecooked their dinners in the morning room and the library . An invitation was received at the Jewish Museum , at the downtown branch of Columbia University , at the French and the Jugoslavian consulates , at the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations , at severalfraternity houses , actors ' clubs , bridge clubs , milliners and dressmakers . Further afield invitations were received by the Mother Superiors of the Ursuline Order , the Poor Glares and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseers of Jesuit schools and retreats , Franciscan Fathers , Cowley Fathers , Paulists and MisericordiaSisters . They were delivered to mansions remodeled into country clubs , boarding schools , retreats for the insane , alcohol cures , health farms , wildlife sanctuaries , wallpaper factories , draftingrooms and places where the aged and the infirm waited sniffily for the angel of death in front of their television sets . When the bells of Saint Michael 's rang that afternoon there were no more than twenty-five people in the body of the church and two of these were rooming-house proprietors who had come out of curiosity . When the time came Moses said the words loudly and with a full heart . After the ceremony most of the guests returned to Clear Haven and danced to the music of a phonograph . Sarah and Leander performed a stately waltz and said good-by . The maids filled the old champagne bottles with cheap sauterne and when the summer dusk had fallen and all the chandeliers were lighted the main fuse blew once more . Giacomo repaired it and Moses went upstairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Remsen Park were fifteen miles to the south and this presented a morale problem for there were hundredsor thousands of technicians like Coverly who knew nothing about the beginnings or the ends of their works . The administrationmet this problem by having public rocket launchings on Saturdayafternoons . Transportation was furnished so that whole familiescould pack their sandwiches and beer and sit in bleachers to hear the noise of doom crack and see a fire that seemed to lick at the vitals of the earth . These firings were not so different from any other kind of picnic , although there were no softball games or band concerts ; but there was beer to drink and children strayed and were lost and the jokes the crowd made while they waited for an explosion that was calculated to pierce the earth 's atmosphere were very human . Betsey loved all of this , but it hardly modified her feeling that Remsen Park was unfriendly . Friends were important to her and she said so . " I just come from a small town in Georgia , " she said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stepping up and making friends . After all , we only pass this way once . " As often as she made the remark about passage , it had not lost its strength . She was born ; she would die . Her overtures to Mrs. Frascati continued to be met with sullenp236smiles and she invited the woman in the next house  --  Mrs. Galen  --  in for a cup of coffee , but Mrs. Galen had several college degrees and an air of elegance and privilege that made Betsey uneasy . Shc felt that she was being scrutinized and scrutinized uncharitably and saw there was no room for friendship here . She was persistent and finally she hit on it . " I met the liveliest , nicest , friendliest woman today , honey , " she told Coverly when she kissed him at the door . " Her name 's Josephine Tellerman and she lives on M Circle . Her husband 's in the drafting room and she says she 's lived on nearly every rocket-launching reservation in the United States and she 's just full of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice family and she asked us why did n't we come over some night and have a drink . " Betsey loved her neighbor . This simple act of friendship brought her all the delights and hazards of love . Coverly knew how dim and senseless Circle K had seemed to her until the moment when she met Josephine Tellerman . Now he was prepared to hear about Mrs. Tellerman for weeks and months . He was glad . Betsey and Mrs. Tellerman would do their shopping together . Betsey and Mrs. Tellerman would be on the telephone every morning . " My friend Josephine Tellerman tells me that you have some very nice lamb chops , " she would tell them at the butcher . " My friend Josephine Tellerman recommended you to me , " she would tell them at the laundry . Even the vacuum-cleaner salesman , ringing her doorbell at the end of a hard day , would find her changed . She would be friendly enough , but she would not open the door . " Oh , hello , " she would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm very sorry I do n't have the time this afternoon . I 'm expecting a telephone call front my friend Josephine Tellerman . " The Wapshots went over to the Tellermans ' for a drink one night and Coverly found them friendly enough . The Tellermans ' house was furnished exactly like the Wapshots ' , including the Picasso over the mantelpiece . In the living room the women talked about curtains , and Coverly and Max Tellerman talked about cars in the kitchen while Max made the drinks . " I 've been looking at cars , " Max said , " but I decided I would n't buy one this year . I havep237to cut down . And I do n't really need a car . You see I 'm sending my kid brother through college . My folks have split up and I feel pretty responsible for this kid . I 'm all he 's got . I worked my way through college  --  Jesus , I did everything  --  and I do n't want him to go through that rat race . I want him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have everything he needs . I want him to feel that he 's as good as the next fellow for a few years . . . . " They went back into the living room , where the women were still talking about curtains . Max showed Coverly some photographs of his brother and went on talking about him and at half-past ten they said good night and walked home . Betsey was no gardener but she bought some canvas chairs for the back yard and some wooden lattice to conceal the garbage pail . They could sit there on summer nights . She was pleased with what she had done and one summer night the Tellermans came over to christen  --  as Betsey said  --  the back yard with rum . It was a warm night and most of their neighbors were in their yards . Josie and Betsey were talking about bedbugs , cockroaches and mice . Coverly was speaking affectionately of West Farm and the fishing there . He was n't drinking himself and he disliked the smell of rum that came from the others , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Josie said . " It 's that kind of a night . " It was that kind of a night . The air was hot and fragrant and from the kitchen , where he mixed the drinks , Coverly looked out of the window into the Frascatis ' back yard . There he saw the young Frascati girl in a white bathing suit that accentuated every line of her body but the crease in her buttocks . Her brother was spraying her gently with a garden hose . There was no horseplay , there were no outcries , there was no sound at all while the young man dutifully sprayed his beautiful sister . When Coverly had mixed the drinks he carried them out . Josie had begun to talk about her mother . " Oh , I wish you people could have met my mother , " she said . " I wish you kids could have met my mother . " When Betsey asked Coverly to fill the glasses once more he said they were out of rum . " Run down to the shopping center and getp238a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that kind of a night . We only live once . " " We only pass this way once , " Betsey said . " I 'll get some , " Coverly said . " Let me , let me , " Max said . " Betsey and I 'll go . " He pulled Betsey out of her chair and they walked together toward the shoppingcenter . Betsey felt wonderful . It 's that kind of a night , was all she could think to say , but the fragrant gloom and the crowded houses where the lights were beginning to go out and the noise of sprinklers and the snatches of music all made her feel that the pain of traveling and moving and strangeness and wandering was ended and that it had taught her the value of permanence and friendship and love . Everything delighted her then  --  the moon in the sky and the neon lights of the shopping center  --  and when Max came out of the liquor store she thought what a distinguished , what an athletic and handsome man he was . Walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his arms around her and kissed her . It was a stolen kiss , Betsey thought , and it was that kind of a night , it was thc kind of a night where you could steal a kiss . When they got back to Circle K , Coverly and Josie were in the living room . Josie was still talking about her mother . " Never an unkind word , neverharsh look , " she was saying . " She used to be quite a pianist . Oh , there was always a big gang at our house . On Sunday nights we all used to gather around the piano and sing hymns you know and have a wonderful time . " Betsey and Max went to the kitchen to make drinks . " She was unhappy in her marriage , " Josie was saying . " He was a real sonofabitch , there 's no two ways about it , but she was philosophical , that was the secret of her success ; she was philo sophical about him and just from hearing her talk you 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ... " " Coverly , " Betsey screamed . " Coverly , help . " Coverly ran down the hall . Max was standing by the stove . l le had torn Betsey 's dress . Coverly swung at him , got him on the side of the jaw and set him down on the floor . Betsey screamed and ran into the living room . Coverly stood over Max , cracking hisp239knuckles . There were tears in his eyes . " Hit me again if you want to , kick me if you want to , " Max said . " I could n't punch a hole in a paper bag . That was a lousy thing for me to do , you know , but I just ca n't help myself sometimes and I 'm glad it 's over and I swear to God I 'll never do it again , but Jesus Christ Coverly sometimes I get so lonely I do n't know where to turn and if it was n't for this kid brother of mine that I 'm sending through college I think I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thought of it often enough . You would n't think , just looking at me , that I was suicidal , would you , but so help me God I am an awful lot of the time . " Josie 's all right . She 's a darned good sport , " Max said , still speaking from the floor , " and she 'll stay with me through thick and thin and I know that , but she 's very insecure , you know , oh she 's very insecure and I think it 's because she 's lived in so many different places . She gets melancholy , you know , and then she takes it out on me . She says I take advantage of her . She says I do n't bring in the money for the food . I do n't bring in the money for the car . She needs new dresses and she needs new hats and I do n't know what she does n't need new and then she gets real sore and goes off on a buying spree and sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills . I still owe bills all over the whole United States . Sometimes I do n't think I can stand it any more . Sometimes I think I 'm just going to pack my bag and take to the road . That 's what I think , I think I 'm entitled to a little fun , a little happiness , you know , and so I take a pass here and a pass there but I 'm sorry about Betsey because you and Betsey have been real good friends to us but sometimes I do n't think I can go on unless I have a little fun . I just do n't think I have the strength to go on . I just do n't think I can stand it any more . " In the living room Josie had taken Betsey into her arms . " There , there , honey , " Josie was saying , " there , there , there . It 's all over . Nothing happened . I 'll fix your dress . I 'll get you a new dress . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's got the wandering hands . He 's got the wandering hands and he just had too much to drink . Those hands of his , he 's always putting them someplace where they do n't belong . Honey , this is n't the first time . Evenp240when he 's asleep those hands of his are feeling around all the time until they get hold of something . Even when he 's asleep , honey . There , there , do n't you worry about it any more . Think of me , think of what I have to put up with . Thank God you 've got a nice , clean husband like Coverly . Think of poor me , think of poor Josie trying to be cheerful all the time and going around picking up after him . Oh , I 'm so tired of it . I 'm so tired of trying to make his mistakes good . And if we get a couple of dollars ahead he sends it to this kid brother in Cornell . He 's in love with this kid brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anybody . He spoils him . It makes my blood boil . He 's living up there like a regular prince in a dormitory with his own bathroom and fancy clothes while I 'm mending and sewing and scrubbing to save the price of a cleaning woman so that he can send this college boy an allowance or a new sports jacket or a tennis racket or something . Last year he was worried because the kid did n't have an extraspecialheavy overcoat and I said to him , I said , Max , I said , now look here . You 're worrying yourself sick because he does n't have a winter coat , but what about me ? Did it ever occur to you that I did n't have a good winter coat ? Did it ever cross your mind that your loving wife is just as entitled to a coat as your kid brother ? Did you ever look at it that way ? And you know what he said ? Ile said it was cooler up where this college is than it was in Montana where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him at all . Oh , it 's terrible to be married to a man who 's got something on his mind like that all the time . Sometimes it just makes my blood boil , seeing how he spoils him . But we have to take the lean with the fat , do n't we ? Into every real friendship a little rain must fall . Let 's pretend it was that , honey , shall we , let 's pretend it was just a little rain . Let 's go and get the men and drink a friendship cup and let bygones be bygones . Let 's pretend it was just a little rain . " In the kitchen they found Max still sitting on the koor and Coverly standing by the sink , cracking his knuckles , but Betsey went to Coverly and pleaded with him in a whisper to forget it , " We 're all going to be friends again , " Josie said loudly . " Come on , come on , it 's all forgotten . We 're all going into the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mousie in a mill ; Kickmaleerie , cowden doon , Cuddy alane and I.Now , I ask you , where was the sense in that ? But somehow Mary Ruadh seemed to understand , and when her father bellowed , " Kickmaleerie , cowden doon ! " she screamed and shouted and splashed with her bath toys until the water shot all the way out into the hallway where I was sitting . Then Mr. MacDhui picked her out of the tub and gave her a tousle and a rubdown until her whole body was red , when he would say , " How now , little pink puddy ! Now this fine blue towel really becomes you . What shall we have for tea ? KickmaleerieMary Ruadh ! " But me , he never so much as deigned to notice . After they had their supper in the dining room , with Mary Ruadh sitting on a pile of cushions so that she would be higher , they would go into her room across the hall , where he played with her or sometimes told her some ridiculous kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh and gurgle ridiculously and play with his bristly face and pull his fur and tease him , or sometimes they would even join hands and dance around the room together , and if you think THAT is any way to bring up a child ora kitten , you wo n't get me to agree with you . That night Mary Ruadh became so excited that she would not calm clown to say her prayers that Mr. MacDhui always insistedupon . These were kind of a petition and rhyme that she had to say every night before she went to sleep , and sometimes having to do it made her very willful and naughty . Well , I know , for one thing , how I am when I am made to do something . Then Mr. MacDhui changed quite suddenly from being kind and gay to becoming most stern and ugly . He pushed out hisp51great red beard at his daughter and growled , " That will be all and enough of that , Mary Ruadh . You have had plenty of play . Now say your prayers at once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " Daddy , WHY do I have to say my prayers ? " If she asked this once , she asked it at least four times in the week . I had to smile inside to myself , for of course I knew it was just to keep putting it off , just as when we are ordered to do something , we suddenly discover that we have a most important bit of washing to do . His answer would always be the same : " Because your mother would have wished it ; that is why . She said her prayers every night . " Mary Ruadh then asked , " Can I hold Thomasina while I say them ? " I had to turn away to conceal the smile on my face , because I knew the explosion that was coming from Mr. MacDhui . " No , no , NO . You can not . Kneel now and say your prayers properly this minute . " Mary Ruadh asked that same question every night , not , I think , to make her father angry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he changed his mind and said yes . It always succeeded in making him quite furious , and whereas at other times he simply ignored me as though I did not exist , I am sure at that moment he hated me . He then stood beside her bed while she knelt , folded her hands together in the manner that was prescribed for her , and began her petition . " God bless Mummy in heaven , and Daddy , and Thom-asina --  " I always waited to make sure that my name was mentioned well up in the list that included such odd bods as Mr. Dobbie the grocer , and Willie Bannock , and Mr. Bridie the dustman , ofp52whom she seemed to be fond , and then I went over and rubbed against Mr. MacDhui 's legs , purring and getting hairs on his trousers , because I was well aware that it infuriated him , but he did n't dare shout , or kick , or swear , or do anything about it , becauseby that time Mary Ruadh was in the middle of her rhyme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look upon this little child ; Pity my simplicity , And suffer me to come to thee  --  AMEN. and which was a very important one so that he could not stir until it was properly finished , by which time I would be under the bed where he could not reach me . But he seemed to forget that he was angry when the prayers were finished and she lay upon her pillow with her ginger hair tousled about and he looked down upon her after he had kissed her good night . I used to watch his face , and all the bristle seemed to go out of his beard for once , and his fierce eyes turned soft . It was even more than soft . Soppy ! Then he would blow himself up with a deep breath , turn , and stalk out of the room , like somebody in a play . But I just stayed under the bed and waited my turn . When he was gone , Mary Ruadh would call , " Mrs. McKenzie ! Mrs. McKenzie ! " and when she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't make it difficult for the poor old soul , but by that time would be cruising close to the edge of the cot . Mrs. McKenzie would reach down , pick me up , and put me into Mary Ruadh 's bed . Mr. MacDhui , who had gone off to his study , always heard her doing it , and knew that it happened , but pretended that he did n't . . . . Well , that was what THAT day in my life , in fact , many daysp53in my life were like  --  for in most respects one day was very like another  --  except for the pain I felt at the base of my spine from the bump I had received when I fell off Mary Ruadh by the statue of Rob Roy , as I have told you already , and which was followed by the morning of my assassination.  |p54On  Thursday mornings , Mr. MacDhui left his house beforeseven for farm calls in the immediate neighborhood so as to return in time for his office hours , which were from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need be , for more distant visits . Before departing on this day , he rattled off instructions to Willie Bannock : " I shall be stopping at Birnie Farm to see a case of scour , and Jock Maistock suspects the blackleg amongst his Ayrshires , so see that there is an ampoule or two of vaccine in the bag . I shall be testing John Ogilvie 's herd , and I may stop at the McPherson chicken farm , if there is time , and relieve the mind of the widow . If I am late getting back , tell the folk to bide . " He did not neglect the morning round through his modest animal hospital , with the indispensable Willie in his train . On this particular day the veterinary seemed more aware than usual of the irony of this routine , which convenience and necessity had dictated should be almost an imitation if not a burlesque of that in the great hospitals in Edinburgh and Glasgow . There , he knew , each morning the house surgeon , followed by an intern or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the wards inspecting charts , having a thump or a look at a patient , diagnosing , prescribing , dropping a pleasant or cheery word at each bed , dispensing hope and courage along with medicines , andp55leaving the ward behind him brighter , happier , and at ease , each human armored more strongly for his or her fight against injury or illness . MacDhui , looking with a mind 's eye turned resentful , could see himself in this healer 's role as he had since he had been a boy , a doctor whose mere presence in the sickroom was enough to banish sickness and bar the angel of death . Since it had been denied him , he denied in turn the warmth and love which is so much a part of the cure of any ailing animal . They were immured in scrupulously clean cages in which paper or straw might be changed by Willie a dozen times a day , properlydiagnosed , drugged , bandaged , fed , watered and thereafter ignored by him . Pausing before each cage , he regarded each inmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms or reaction to treatment there was further knowledge or experience to be gained . But as fellow creatures , prisoners like himself aboard the same revolving ball of rock , dirt , and water , brothers and sisters in one great family of the living , he did not consider them at all . They seemed to feel this as he went by and remained quiescent , regarding him with sad or morose eyes , or giving vent to minor-. keyed complaints , whines , mews , snuffles -- They went through the aisle of cages , with Mr. MacDhui appraising and ordering dosage and treatments as always , to Willie 's intense admiration , for Willie was mortally in awe of this great , red , pagan deity who could cure wee beasties . Nor were there any to be " put away , " which came as a great relief to the attendant , for one of his duties was to play the part of executioner when MacDhui decided that an animal was better off dead than alive , a decision from which it appeared nothing could turn him once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated , but he never presumed to question the orders of his chief , and with gentleness , chloroform bottle ,  |p56and  rag , got the unhappy business over with as quickly as possible and put the remains on the heap out back of the house , where he would not have to see them until the day 's end when the incineratorwas fired and all waste matter from the hospital burned , including small corpses . " Try a larger dose of the Number 4 formula on Mrs. Sanderson 's dog and I 'll have another look at it when I get back . I do n't expect I shall be late . If that confounded parrot keeps up its abominable noise , you have my permission to wring its neck . " He took his bag , into which Willie , who knew every ailment at each farm and what was required almost before MacDhui told him , had packed syringes , plungers , clysters , sprays , disinfectants , vaccines , dressings , sutures and needles , gauzes and plasters , as well as various stock items against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove off . Willie waited until he saw him reach the end of Argyll and turn the corner into the f-Iigh Street before , with almost unseemly haste , he hurried back to the animal hospital , where he was received with a perfect pandemonium of enthusiastic barks , whines , howls , shrieks , squawks , mews , and general animal hurrah for a loved human . Willie , who just about came up to Mr. MacDhui 's shoulderin height , was seventy , and fifty of those years he had devoted tothe love and care of animals . MacDhui had inherited him fromthe man from whom he had bought the practice . Spry and alert , he had a friar 's atoll of white hair about his skull and meltingbrown eyes that gave away his character and kindness of heart . This was The Hour . Dogs stood up frantically on their hindlegs inside their cages , pawing and shouting at him , birds shrieked , cats stiffened their tails and rubbed their flanks against the cagedoors in anticipation , even the dogs too sick for greater demonstrationsmanaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , now  --  " Willie said , surveying the pandemonium withp57the most intense satisfaction . " One at a time now , one at a time ! " He stopped first at the cage of a fat dachshund , who went hystericalin his arms when he took him out , screaming , wriggling , lickinghis face , singing a passionate obbligato over the general chorus of enthusiasm . " There , there , now , Hansi  --  dinna excite yersel ' so , or ' twill appear on your chart , no less , and the doctor will read that I 've had ye oot for a spell . Yell be going awa ' tomorrow or the next day --  " Thus he went from cage to cage , bestowing love , the secret medicine which surely effected as many cures as the doctor 's drugs , or helped them along . Cats and dogs that were well enough he had out for a hug , or a bit of play , the sick had their ears and bellies rubbed , the parrot his head scratched , the lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had its turn and been calmed down , when the regular routine of care and medication went forward . The morning was misty and the smell of sea salt mingled with coal and peat smoke was in the air from the breakfast fires as Mr. MacDhui drove through the streets of gray-stone or whitewashed houses , tall , narrow and slate roofed , down to the quay where the waters of the loch were gray too , and a blue fishing boat with a stumpy mast and the forward well loaded with lobster pots , floats , and gear chuffed out of the harbor . He breathed the smell of mingled sea and land , wild sea and rugged woodland and man and habitation smells , with no particularenjoyment , nor did he look to the flight of gulls or the curl of the tide lapping the shore ; the beauty of the blue boat on the gray mirror of the loch in the pearly morning mist , already shot through with the light of the mounting sun , was lost upon him . He turned the jeep northward onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old saddleback bridge and , when he reached Creemore , took the left fork up into the hills . When he had climbed somewhat , he could see the gypsy en/campment lying at the foot of a fold in the valley to the south and noted from the smoke and the number of wagons that it was a large one . He recalled what Mary Ruadh had told him of it as seen through the eyes of Geordie McNabb , and the run-in that Constable MacQuarrie had had with them , but he shrugged the whole matter off as none of his business . If the police chose to let them remain there , that was their affair . There would no doubt be the usual neglect of their horses and livestock among these people , who in some instances even in this day and age continued to live themselves like animals , but as long as the police were satisfied he did not care . This the curious paradox of the animal doctor who did not love animals . But he would have denied vehemently and truculently , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was a cold or loveless man , and with much outjutting of his beard had cited his affection for his daughter Mary Ruadh as the keystone of his life . He admitted to loving little or nothing else but her . The minister , with whom he liked to tussle philosophically just because he was so unpredictable , and whose range was from the erudite through the theological to the poetic , had surprised him by indulging in flights of the latter in his reply . He had maintained that in his opinion one could not love a woman without likewise loving the night and the stars that made even more of a mystery of her presence , or the soft air and sun that warmed and made fragrant her hair ; that you could not love a little girl without loving , too , the field flowers , limp and wilted , with which she returned from a foray into the meadow , clutched in a damp hand . And he had said that , too , you would have to feel love for the mongrel she adored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff of the frocks that clung to her body . He said that if you loved the wild sea lashed in storm , then you could not help loving the mountains too , which , with their swelling hills and jagged and snow-topped peaks swirled by the wind like sea froth ,  |p59imitated  the waves and presented to one 's gaze the miracle of an ocean petrified in mid-storm . He declared that you could not love the bright , hot , lazy summer days without loving also the rains that came to cool them ; that one could not love the flight of birds without loving , too , the flash of the trout or salmon in the dark pool , that one could not love man , any or all of him , without loving the beasts of the field and the forests , or the beasts without loving the trees and the grasses , the shrubs and the heather and the flowers of meadow and garden . And here , dropping the rhetorical style into which he had drifted , and truth to tell , held MacDhui rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary and matterof-factroutine of speech and said that it was difficult to understand how a man could love all or any of these without loving God as well , from any point of view , philosophically , practically , theologically , or just plain logically . The result , of course , had been the usual scornful and indignant snort from MacDhui , who declared that Peddie was better and at least more plausible as poet . Mr. MacDhui turned in at the wagon track leading to the Birnie farm and , parking the jeep , entered the stone stalls of the stables with an expression of deep disgust upon his face . The stench was overpowering . Fergus Birnie , a wizened farmer , was almost as dirty as his cowsheds . He greeted the veterinarian sourly at the entrance and complained , " ' T is the lask come back again . The medicine ye gied me was gey unchancy . Ye swyked me wi ' it , Mr. MacDhui , and I 'll thank ye for the shillings back I laid oat for it . " MacDhui minced no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face as near as he could bear the smell of him , he bellowed , " Ye are a filthy dog , Birnie . Yer cattle are in diarrhea again because ye live dirtier than any swine wallowing out yonder in their ane glaur . I 've warned ye often enough , Fergus Birnie . Noo I 'm takingawa ' yer license for the herd and the selling of yer milk until ye change yer ways . "  |p60He  went outside and removed a small metal plate from the door of the barn and put it in his pocket , while Birnie stood there regardinghim blankly . " I 'll be back here within the hour , " the veterinarian said . " Call your misbegotten sons over here and wash down these stables and sheds  --  and yourselves along with it . And wash those cattle until they are clean enough to buss . If there 's so much as a smitch of dirt about here when I return , I 'll charge ye to Constable MacQuarrie for endangering the public health and it 's to jail yell all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the hills , a well-run place , where he complimented Jock Maistock for giving him an early warning of symptoms of the dreaded blackleg in one of his long-horned , fringe-browed Ayrshire cattle . He ordered the suspectedanimal slaughtered at once , vaccinated the remainder of the herd against the disease , and placed a temporary quarantine on them until time should reveal the extent of the immunity obtained . He called in at the McPherson chicken farm and calmed the fears of the widow McPherson that she was in for an outbreak of the gapes , a disease of fowls caused by worms in the windpipe . The laboratory report had been negative and the suspected chicks were suffering from a harmless respiratory attack and were already perking up in their isolation pen . MacDhui certified them for release . He called in at the farm of a wealthy experimental cattle farmer who was trying out a herd in the hills , and gave the cattle the tuberculin test , visited several other small farms and crofters ' cottages for minor complaints , and on his way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loss of bread and butter had worked upon the farmer , and stables and cattle were in passable condition , clean enough at least for the vet to get on with the treatment . He inoculated each animal , promised to restore the license when the disease hadp61abated , provided the standard of cleanliness was maintained . With a final threat to drop in any day unannounced to check up on them , he climbed into his jeep and headed down the twisting , winding track to the main road back to the valley and Inveranoch . Yet he dawdled with his driving , hunched about the wheel , dwarfing it with his great bulk , since he was in no hurry to get back . For of all there was to and about his work and profession , this was the part he liked the best , poking about in the rugged hill country above the loch , visiting the farms , and practicing a medicine that was almost human medicine in that it was designed to aid in the protection of human beings , and where the beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants of man , from the clever , bright-eyed sheep dogs to the black-faced sheep they herded and the stalwart hardy breeds of Highland cattle . Here , too , he was received almost with the same respect as Dr. Strathsay , who came out likewise to the back country to deliver their children , set their fractures , or treat occasional illnesses . To the crofter who lived by his sheep , pigs , fowl , or cattle , Mr. MacDhuiwas a man of importance . A person could well recover from a sneeze or feverish cough , a hand or foot cut with ax or scythe , but a dead animal that could not even be sold for meat was money out of pocket , and an infection which might condemn an entire herd to slaughter was a catastrophe . To them Mr. MacDhui was a man of value and in most quarters he was treated with deference . Thus it was with reluctance that the animal doctor found himselfagain in Inveranoch , where his office waiting room would no doubt be filled once more with both locals as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham , and London , with their uselessand pampered pets . It was a quarter past eleven when he drove the jeep around to the back and , entering the premises from the rear , turned his hag over to Willie Bannock along with a quick account of the morn/ing 's doings back in the hills , washed his hands , still talking and giving his assistant no chance to speak , and donning a fresh white coat , made his usual entrance , beard outthrust , into the doorway of the waiting room . He noted that , as usual , every bench and chair was occupied , the locals in their sober clothes , coveralls or work aprons , the city dwellers more flamboyantly clad , including a lady in a most grand and fashionable hat holding a chocolate-covered Pomeranian with rheumy eyes . And , as always , the sight inspired the same choler and truculent impatience it seemed to bring on every day at this hour . He hated them and he hated his work . Yet he looked them over and looked again and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting clients . Seated quietly and most upright on the edge of the last chair at the far end of the room , the very last in line , was his daughter , Mary Ruadh . MacDhui colored red at this challenging evidence of disobedience , for the child was under strict orders and Mrs. McKenzie knew it too , that she was never to come next door to the surgery , hospital , or consulting room , as many of the diseases suffered by animal patients were likewise infectious and communicable to man . One such tragedy in his life had been sufficient . As he stared with rising anger , he noted that what had seemed to be an extension of her red-gold hair tumbling down her shoulder was her ginger cat held in her arms close to her breast , its head cuddled under her chin in the manner of a child . Before he could inquire sharply as to what kind of play or nonsense this was , and in direct contravention to his orders , Willie Bannock was at his elbow whispering : " The puir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nae mair . The chiel has been biding anxiously for your return . " Mr. MacDhui said , " You know as well as I she is not to come here . Well , since she is here then she must await her turn like the rest . " To the woman seated nearest the door he said , " If you willp63take your dog inside now , Mrs. Kechnie , we 'll have a look at those ears , " when a great noise and hubbub was heard without in the street , approaching nearer and a moment later the door swung open and it burst in upon them . It revealed itself to be composed of small children in various stages of excitement , housewives from neighboring cottages , wiping their hands on their aprons , several men likewise attracted by the noise , and at its center the minister , Mr. Angus Peddie , old Tammas Moffat , the blind man who was licensed to sell pencils and shoelaces at the corner of High and Fore streets , and ConstableMacQuarrie . In the constable 's arms , muddied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle , lay the quivering form of Bruce , the seeing-eye dog that had been provided for Tammas through subscription by the parish at the instigation of Mr. Peddie . The noise caught Mr. MacDhui as he was closing the door and he returned quickly . " Now , now  --  what 's all this ? I 'll have no crowding in here . Come , now , out with you , all of you who have no business here , everyone except Mr. Peddie , Tammas , and the policeman . Angus , what has happened ? " " Run over , sir , " the constable replied in place of the priest , who busied himself clearing the followers on out of the room . " It happened only a few moments ago , one of the visitors , speeding . We 'll have him under lock and key in short order , but in the meantime I 'm afraid the dog 's done for . Both wheels went over him . We brought him here as quickly as we could . " Mr. Peddie returned , fluttering anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can still do something --  " The old blind man was in a state , his knees trembling and his head shaking from side to side , stunned by the accident , lost without his dog , bewildered by the people about . He moaned , " Where is he , my Bruce ? Where is he ? We were about to cross thep64street . I heard a noise and a shout . Where is he ? Is he dead ? ' What will I do ? What will happen to me ? " Mr. Peddie took him by the arm . " Gently now , Tammas . Do n't take on so . The dog is still alive and in good hands . Mr. MacDhui will do the best he can for him . " The blind man groped for an instant and then quavered , " Mr. MacDhui ? Mr. MacDhui ? Is that where we are ? " " Take the dog inside , " Mr. MacDhui ordered Willie Bannock , who carefully relieved the policeman of his quivering burden . The veterinarian glanced at the dog as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed all but crushed out of it . " Is it Mr. MacDhui ? " the blind man said again , and turning his sightless face to him , put out his hand , touched and held his arm . " I 'm an old man . I can not be doing without him . Save my eyes for me , Mr. MacDhui --  " The plea went into the bowels of Mr. Veterinary Surgeon Andrew MacDhui like a knife thrust and turned there , for with three words  --  " save my eyes "  --  the blind man had brought back again all of the frustration and failure of his forty-odd years of living . He would have given the next forty to have heard those words spoken to him as a doctor of medicine , to have been called upon to give of his skill , love , and devotion to the saving of human sight , or health , or life itself instead of being asked to put together again , like Humpty Dumpty , the fragments of a dog . Something of what was passing through his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tortured misery the minister thought he glimpsed at that moment in the face of the animal doctor , or because he himself was so well acquainted with MacDhui 's story , since they had known one another since their schoolboy and student days in Glasgow . It was to the young Peddie that the boy MacDhui had confided his ambition to become a great physician just about the time that the former had decided for the ministry , and they had argued andp65discussed the respective merits of their chosen professions then , boasted , bickered , and let their ambitions soar . And it was only Peddie , the young divinity student , who saw fall the tears of grief , rage , and frustration when the tyrannical father cut short his boy 's hopes and ambitions and compelled him to follow in his own profession of animal medicine . " He means --  " Mr. Peddie began , but MacDhui quelled him with a look . " I know what he means , " he said . " The dog is three-quarters dead and ought to be put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammas'seyes if I can --  " Then to all of those in the waiting room he shouted , " Go home . Come back tomorrow . I have no time for you now . " One by one they picked up their pets and filed out . MacDhui said to Peddie , " There 's no use your waiting . It will be sometime before I can tell . Get Tammas home . I 'll let you know --  " He went into the surgery and closed the door behind him . The constable led the blind man out . Peddie was about to follow when his glance fell upon the child sitting quietly in the corner hugging her cat to her and he went over to her in surprise . " Hello , Mary Ruadh . What are you doing here ? Why are n't you out playing ? " She looked up at him confidingly , for they were old and trusted friends , and replied , " Thomasina 's very sick . She ca n't walk at all . I 'm bringing her to Daddy to make well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger cat and scratched it under the chin as he always did when he came upon the two together . The accident to the blind man 's dog , though he had not witnessed it , had been a shock to him , and , too , he had felt the depth of pain of MacDhui 's reaction . Mr. Peddie nodded again and said , " Ah well , I 've no doubt he 'll put her right again , " and went out after Constable MacQuarrie.  |p66On  that fatal day I awoke , as usual , at dawn and prepared to engage in my accustomed routine  --  a yawn , a good stretch lengthwise followed by a round humpbacked one , and then escape from the house . I had a secret exit and entrance , of course , but I could use them only when nobody was about or they would n't have been secret any more . These escape routes are the first things we work out in whatever house we find ourselves living . People actually believe they can shut us up . Well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really want to do so . I liked to be about early in the morning to see the sun come up , to attend to eliminations , have a quiet once-over-lightly wash to get my fur looking presentable , inspect things on our lane , and exchange a bit of gossip with friends and neighbors sitting on their doorsteps or engaged upon similar errands . This was one of the pleasantest hours of the day and I used to look forward to it . It was wonderful to be free and with no people about . Yet I always managed to be back before Mary Ruadh awakened . But not that day . I opened my eyes at the usual hour when the curtains drawn over the windows turned from black to gray , tried to stretch , and discovered that I was unable to move my legs . Such a thing had never happened to me before . I was so frightened I simply lay there trembling from head to tail.  |p67I  thought perhaps it might be a bad dream , for we have them quite often , dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , and I lay there quietly for a little , waiting for it to go away . But it did n't , and as it grew lighter , I realized that there was something wrong with my vision as well . I was unable to see the room or the corner of it , or the window , sharply ; objects seemed to be unclear and when I tried to look harder they seemed to vanish . I appeared to be swimming in and out of things . The next thing I remembered I was lying in Mary Ruadh 's arms and she was saying , " Sleepyhead Thomasina . I have been awake ever so long and you are still sleeping . Shall I give you a whisper , Thomasina ? I love you ! " I had no time for such sentiments . . . . I was sick , sick , sick and for all I knew , might be dying . There was no use my trying to tell Mary Ruadh that something queer had happened to me , that I could not make my legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was lying in her arms . Those are the times when people are our despair , so dense , obtuse , and insensitive are they , and unable to understand even our simplest communications . Another cat would have known at once , at the first sight , the first sniff , the first and smallest impulse transmitted from my antennae to hers , that I was dangerously ill . The dreadful morning wore on until sometimes I was certain it could only be a nightmare . Mrs. McKenzie came to get Mary Ruadh up , but since the child always carried me about everywhere , I was left to lie there while she was helped to dress ; then she came and got me from the bed and carried me into the next room and later lifted me into the dining room and put me on the chair next to hers while she had breakfast and Mrs. McKenzie gossiped with the dustman . And when I cried Mary Ruadh only said , " Have n't you a lot to say this morning , Thomasina , you naughty sleepyhead --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl of milk and cereal by the back door in the kitchen , and called , " Come , puss , and get yer porridge --  " I lay on the chair where Mary Ruadh had last put me , unable to stir except for my head and the tip of my tail . I did n't want anything to eat . I only wanted them to find out there was something the matter with me and help me . I cried to them as loudly as I could , but not much sound came out . Mary Ruadh said , " Lazy Thomasina ! Go and have your breakfast . Oh , very well then , I 'll carry you , you lazy old Thomasina . " She picked me up and went with me to the bowl and put me down next it , where I fell over onto my side . I tried washing , but I was not even able to make the proper movements with my head and tongue . Mary Ruadh said , " Thomasina , you MUST drink your milk , " imitating the way Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you do n't drink your milk , you naughty Thomasina , I sha n't take you to the burn this afternoon to watch the trout with Hughie Stirling . " I tell you , it is n't much fun to be lying at death 's door , AND at the same time be scolded and told you are to be punished ... . For there was nothing I liked so much as to squat among the flowers on the bank of the brook that flowed into the river not far from the ruins of Castle Ardrath and watch the trout lying on the bottom , fanning themselves with their fins . I think I could sit and watch them for days . I never caught any . I did not even try to scoop them out with my paw , though I am sure I could have done so had I wished . I was just happy to lie as still as they . Sometimes when one moved away from the sunny shallows and swam into a deeper portion where it would be merely a faint shadow against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down into the clear water , try to make it out . The children would wander off , exploring , but I would just stay there watching the fish . Tears began to roll from my eyes as I thought that I had probably done this for the last time.  |p69I  lay on my side , helpless , no sound coming from my mouth as I tried to call for the help that was not forthcoming . At last ! Mary Ruadh came over to me and tried to set me on my feet , saying , " Thomasina , you MUST eat your breakfast ! " and when I fell over onto my side again she became alarmed and when it happened once more called , " Mrs. McKenzie ! Oh , dear Mrs. McKenzie ; do you come here at once , please , and see what is wrong with Thomasina . Please , Mrs. McKenzie , do come at once . " The housekeeper hurried into the kitchen and knelt at my side . She , too , tried to set me on my feet and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm feart oor puss has some unchancy illness . The puir wee thing canna stan ' on her ain fower feet . " Mary Ruadh picked me up , half crushing me , crying my name over and over , the tears rolling down her cheeks . " Thomasina  --  Thomasina  --  poor Thomasina --  ! " Like a fool , I purred . I could n't help myself . Mrs. McKenzie enveloped us both in her arms and said , " Dinna greet so , lassis , for it 's mair nor his hert can stan ' tae hear ye . Ye maun rin , Mary Ruadh , an ' take Thomasinanext door tae yer ain feyther , the doctor , wha 'll nae doot ken goo tae pit richt whitever ails her . He 'll shairly no rail gin ye come there this yince an sae sair an errand . " Mary Ruadh ceased her crying at once . The tears stopped as if by magic and she smiled down at me . " Do you hear , Thomasina ? We will go to see Daddy and Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not share her optimism , and quite frankly I ( lid not relish finding myself in the hands of this great , red brute of a man who could not bear the sight of me , and entrusting what was left of my life to him . But there seemed to be no other choice . I lad I been able to walk , I should have crawled away to some hole or corner by myself . Mrs. McKenzie led us next door , Mary Ruadh carrying me , and as soon as we entered I smelled the same medicine smell that was always on Mr. MacDhui and it turned me sick and faint.  |p70I  was swimming again , in and out , and I saw blurred , as though looking into the loch when it was stirred by the wind , a room filled with people , some with cats and some with dogs , but I was feeling quite too awful to care much about them . Mary Ruadh sat down on a chair while Mrs. McKenzie explained to Willie Bannock what had happened . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be away at the farms , but as soon as he returned he would tell him and the best thing for Mary Ruadh to do was bide there . Willie Bannock said he did not dare examine me himself , for the doctor would have the rest of his hair off his head if he did , but Mary Ruadh was not to worry , for the doctor was quite the cleverestman in the world where beasties were concerned and would cure me if anyone could . I felt cheered for the first time . I always liked Willie Bannock . Had I but known the part he would be called upon to play ! And so we settled down to wait and I slipped in and out of consciousness , or was it sleep , or was it death ? I could not tell , but each time I found that I was still on Mary Ruadh 's lap , the lavenderscent of her clothes stronger even than the medicine smell , I purred a little . Have I grumbled a good deal about my lot , about being dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mary Ruadh ? Have I done a lot of complaining over being slave to a child and an unwelcome guest in the house of a man who could not seem to bear the sight of me , and whom I disliked cordially ? Well , now that the time had come when I might have to leave them , I did not wish to do so . For to die is to go away from all the people and things that you like ; it is a journey from light into darkness , from excitements and play and tastes and smells , voices and affection and the here , into the quiet , endless sleep . No more to sit in the warm yellow sunlight and wash down one'sp71back with smooth , rhythmic , satisfying strokes , never again to stalk through the jungle of meadows of high sweet grass and field flowers , to flash into the air after a grasshopper , butterfly , or buzzbug , no longer to crouch patiently at the mousehole , whiskers forward , eyes eager , body tensed and waiting , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet comfort of the drowse by the fire while outside the rain drums on the slate roof , or the white , wet snow falls silently ; not ever again to enjoy that sheltered half sleep through which one hears the reassuring movements of the humans in the house , the sighs , the rustle of newspapers , the click of needles , the sound of human voices . An end forever to the satisfying bowl of warm milk , or the dish of porridge or haddock leavings , the comfort of the leg and ankle against which to rub , the stroking hand , the gentle fingers that understood and scratched where it most itched ; not any more to steal the forbidden catnaps in the chests of drawers , to lie on the soft fragrant clothes and smell the sweet lavender . To die is to depart , to go away from these things forever and become one with the generations that have preceded us since the beginning of time , a whispered memory in the bones and whiskers of the generations to come . I could admit it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not easily laid down . Many of our kind have known hard and cruel times , living in cities and towns , starving , cold , wet , beaten , kicked , and set upon , fighting daily for their miserable existence . Yet how , even in those circumstances , we cling to life when even death might seem preferable to the misery and friendlessness of those chilled and lonely lairs , never having known the warmth of a fire , the hearth of a home , or a human hand to fondle us . How much more , then , did I not wish to go away , to become but one more link in the long , dark chain of another 's memory . Was I still alive , or already dead ? It seemed that there was a great noise and hubbub and to-do ; I heard the howl of an animalp72and thought that Anubis , the great jackal , had come to escort me on the final journey . But I was awake and saw the room crowded with people shouting and gesturing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacQuarrie 's uniform , and the big red bush of Mr. MacDhui as he waved his arms and shouted . A wave of reassurance swept over me . I thought to myself , Aha ! Word has got about now that I am ill , and the whole town , including the constable , has collected to plead with old Red Bristles to make me well for the sake of Mary Ruadh and all the others who have loved and admired me . And I thought too , Why , Mr. MacDhui can not AFFORD to let me die . I am too important . I am necessary to the happiness of the daughter he says he loves so much and over whom he makes such a fuss . Oh , you are safe , all right , Thomasina . No one is going to let anything happen to you . I could see that ; I was swimming into darkness again , but I did n't mind , for I was satisfied . The excitement apparently occasioned by my illness was no more than my just due for the manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much I do not know  --  that I came awake again in Mary Ruadh 's lap , but it was a different kind of awake . I no longer swam in and out of dreams . All was now clearcutand steady . It was as though my ailment had either worked its greatest harm and was relenting , or , having prepared to kill me , gave me a moment 's truce before the end . Whichever , I now heard , saw , and felt more sharply than ever that I could remember . It began with the angry voice of Mr. MacDhui , roaring from the door through the empty room to where Mary Ruadh still sat , but now quite alone , with me clutched to her breast . " Mary Ruadh ! What are you doing here still ? Did I not tell you to leave at once and never come back here again ? Havep73I not forbidden you ever to set foot here ? Must I remind you about your mo --  " Mary Ruadh was not frightened at all . She interrupted him firmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would cure her . " " Blast Mrs. McKenzie ! Why does n't the woman mind her own business and do as she is told ? Besides , I ordered each and every one to return tomorrow . I have no time for anything now . Be a good girl and go home . " His white coat was smeared with blood like a butcher 's ; he wore rubber gloves and had a small knife in his fingers . The expression of his face was most wild and fearful and his beard and hair were matted with sweat . He was a sight to inspire terror in anyone , but Mary Ruadh was not at all impressed . She said , " I wo n't go home . Thomasina is very sick , Daddy . She ca n't stand up or eat or anything . Please , Daddy , make her well . " Mr. MacDhui fell into talking to her as with an adult , as he so often did with her . " I beg of you again to go home , Mary Ruadh . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of an animal who serves as the eyes to a man who is blind . Which is more important , the eyes of a blind man or that wretched cat ? " " Thomasina , " Mary Ruadh replied firmly and properly to this ridiculous question , and Mr. MacDhui for a moment was so exasperated that he could not even speak . But then , strangely , lie seemed to calm for a moment and he stared down at his daughter quite differently , as though perhaps he might be seeing us both for the very first time . " Very well , then , bring the beast in ; I can spare you a few moments while the dog is resting . But take your face away from her until I find out what it is that ails her . Do you think that I want to lose you too ? " We went through into an office . The door was open into another room where there was a bright light and a white table withp74something on it . Mr. MacDhui said , " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Give me the cat and wait there . " He took me from her . Mary Ruadh gave me a last pat and said , " There , now , Thomasina . Do n't you worry . Daddy is going to give you some medicine to make you all better again . I 'll give you a whisper : next to Daddy I love you best in all the world . " Mr. MacDhui took me inside and closed the door . There was a big dog on the white table in the middle of the room . He was bloody . His mouth was open and his tongue hanging out . I saw his eyes and felt sorry for him even though he was a dog . Willie Bannock was there , his apron like a butcher 's too . He was giving the dog a damp sponge at which to suck . Nearby was a can and a rag from which came a sweetish , sickish smell . I felt frightened and wished that Mary Ruadh were there . There was another and smaller table at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Willie Bannock said , " Och , the wean 's wee puss . She was grieving ower it sair --  " " She gave me no peace until I would bring it in . Well , now that it is here --  " But first he went over and gave a long look down at the dog , who rolled up his eyes at him and looked back . Then he came over and touched me . Do you know , his hands were not brutal and cruel at all as I had expected , but kind and gentle . They felt all over my body and pushed deep into my belly and back , where they found a fearful pain that made me cry out . Then he pulled back my lips from my teeth and held my eyes open while he looked into them . He gazed at me for another moment , shrugged , and said something to Willie Bannock that I did not understand but which sounded like " meningeal infection . " Then he added , " We had best destroy her --  " I understood that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright and lay there shivering and twitching under his hand . " Och ! " said Willie Bannock , " the wean wull take it gey hard.  |p75Micht  it not be some hurt the puss has suffered ? If ye would let me --  " Be still , " Mr. MacDhui ordered . " Have we not enough on our plate at the moment ? The animal will be better off dead . Mary Ruadh will get over it , or have another --  " He went to the door leading to his office , opened it , and stood blocking it so that I could not see Mary Ruadh . But I heard him say , " I am afraid your cat is very sick , Mary Ruadh . " " I know that , Daddy , " she replied . " Mrs. McKenzie said so . ' That is why you must give her some medicine to make her well again . He said , " I am not sure that I can , Mary . I think perhaps the best thing would be if we were to put her away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag her hind legs . I think you will have to say good-by to Thomasina , Mary Ruadh . " Can you imagine me lying there hearing this ? Mary Ruadh did not understand . " But I do n't want to say good-by to Thomasina , Daddy . You must give her some medicine right away and then I will take her home and put her to bed and nurse her . " The dog on the table in the center of the room gave a cough and a moan . Mr. MacDhui turned his head to look at it for a moment . Then he said to his daughter , " That you can not . Try to understand , child . When people fall ill , sometimes they get well , and  --  sometimes they die . With animals it is different . It is kinder to put them out of their misery and this is what we will do with Thomasina . We will put her to sleep . " Mary Ruadh understood at last and threw herself at her father , trying to get past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must n't put Thomasina to sleep . You must cure her . Mrs. McKenzie SAID you would cure her . I wo n't let you put her to sleep . I wo n't , I wo n't , I wo n't ! " I heard Willie Bannock say , " The dog 's breathing easier , sir . "  | " Ach ! " cried Mr. MacDhui angrily , holding her back . " Do not be a naughty girl and stupid besides . Can not you see that the cat is already half dead and will like as not die anyway and that I have enough on my hands at the moment without bothering with such --  " Mary Ruadh began to scream . Mr. MacDhui 's neck turned as red as his hair with choler as he struggled with her and bellowed , " Mary Ruadh ! Go home at once --  " Willie Bannock said , " Sir , if ye would gie me leave tae look after the wee puss , maybe I micht --  " Mr. MacDhui turned on him . " I 'll thank you to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take that chloroform can and put that damned cat out of its misery and there 's an end to it and we 'll get on with the dog .... " An end to it ! My end ! The end of me , ME ! The finish to my life , my thoughts and hungers and desires and pleasures , my existence ! I could hear Mary Ruadh struggling to reach me and was helplessto assist . Oh , had I been able I should have jumped upon Mr. MacDhui 's back and bitten his neck in two . " Sir --  " said Willie Bannock . " Get on with it as soon as I have the door closed , " Mr. MacDhuiordered . " Daddy , do n't , please  --  oh , please , please ! " sobbed Mary Ruadh . It was a most terrible scene . Willie Bannock called out to her , " Dinna ye greet so , Mary Ruadh , for ye 're bursting ma ain hert . The wee puss will no suffer a bit and that 's the promise o ' Willie Bannock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. MacDhui tried to comfort her . " Willie will put her to sleep as gently as can be and it will be all over in a moment . Come , now --  " There was a queer kind of silence , as though the child was no longer struggling , or even crying . Then I heard her say in ap77strange way I had never heard her speak before , " Daddy  --  Daddy -- if you put Thomasina to sleep , I 'll never speak to you again as long as I Live --  " " Very well , then , " Mr. MacDhui shouted , " I will not bide defiance . Go home ! " and slipping quickly inside the room , he closed the door and locked it . ' Then I heard the pounding of Mary Ruadh 's fists upon the panel of the door , and her frantic screams . " Daddy  --  Daddy  --  please do n't kill Thomasina ! Oh , please do n't ! Thomasina --  Thomasina --  " Mr. MacDhui jerked his beard at Willie Bannock  --  " Get on with it then , Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Mien ien he picked up some kind of instrument , and I knew that Mary Ruadh and I had gone out of his mind . Willie Bannock came over to me , uncorking the canister , poured out some of the sweetish-smelling liquid onto a cloth and held it over my nose , and I , too , no longer cared about Mary Ruadh or what would happen to her , or anything but me , me , ME , for I was going to die and I did not wish to , I wanted to live , to live , to FIVE , even if I were to be sick , crippled , an outcast , I wanted to live -- I could n't breathe ; I was choking , my senses began to swim . I heard Mr. MacDhui shout , " Come , come , man , do n't be all day about it . I need you over here --  " Mary Ruadh 's fists were still pounding on the door from without  --  I heard one last despairing rrv , " Thomasinaaaaaaa ! " And then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all dark , and I , Thomasina , was no more.  |p78At  the rear of the animal clinic and hospital of VeterinarianAndrew MacDhui of Inveranoch-by-Loch-Fyne was an incinerator and a refuse heap . Toward evening it was the duty of Willie Bannock to dispose of the contents of this refuse heap consisting of waste from the hospital as well as the corpses of defunct animals that had either perished in the course of illness or were done away with at the advice of Mr. MacDhui . A stickler for hygiene , the veterinary would order these corpses placed outside upon the refuse heap immediately , to await the attention of Bannock via the incinerator , a most modem electric one , complete with smoke arrestor . A high fence enclosed this area from the prying eyes of neighbors , and a lower one partitionedthe grounds behind the little hospital from those of the dwelling next door , where Mrs. McKenzie waged her perpetual battle to wring a few herbs , flowers , and vegetables from the soil . Mrs. McKenzie 's formal gardens were often the subject of some banter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peddie when he came to spend an evening with his friend , but both were also just men who praised her flowers and occasional radishes , onions , and carrots when there was a yield . Thus death and life were close neighbors in the back areas of the twin houses on Argyll Lane.  |p79The  rear of the hospital was , of course , strictly off limits for Mary Ruadh , but with due care and appreciation for the sacredness of Mrs. McKenzie 's horticultural ventures she had the run of the yard back of her own house and often played there . There was yet an hour before lunch and Mrs. McKenzie was still at her ironing in the upstairs spare room devoted to her departmentof sewing , mending , frilling , etc. , and so she did not hear Mary Ruadh when she returned empty-armed from the tragedy that had befallen her next door . Tears fell in a steady stream from the eyes of the child and she sobbed , not in paroxysms , but without end , as though to weep was now the normal state of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gurgle , or smile , as though she would thus weep forever after . For all her tears , there was a certain grim purposefulness in her movements , and as she entered the house she hushed her sobbing until it was no more than a whispered exhalation of the breath that expressed her misery . Closing the door behind her softly , she hearkened for a moment to the doleful kirk-humming and ironing noises that proceeded from above and betokened what Mrs. McKenzie was safely about . Then she continued on through the dining room , into the kitchen where Thomasina 's untasted bowl of milk still remained on the floor , left there by the housekeeper in anticipation of her return from the doctor , cured and with an appetite . Filled with the necessity and daring of her determination , Mary-of-the-red-hair stepped over it without so much as a glance and went out the back door , proceeding at once to the fence that divided the area from the one next door . It was higher than her head . She searched about until she found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she climbed , and looked over . l'here , atop the refuse heap , stretched out as limp as an old , discardedfur piece , lay the remains of Thomasina , the eyes closed , one lip partly withdrawn from the white teeth.  |p80With  a cunning never before in her life called upon , but which seemed to be there , ready-made for her need , Mary Ruadh appraisedthe rear windows of both houses . No figures appeared at any of them . Mrs. McKenzie 's ironing continued to occupy her , as the sound of the doleful melodies testified  --  she always sang hymns when she ironed , probably an association between the hot iron and the probable hell-fire to come  --  and if her father and Willie Bannock were about , they were still in the operating room , which was in the front part of the house . Swiftly the little girl scrambled over the fence and , hanging by her hands , dropped onto the ground on the other side . Then she ran to the heap and took her dead from it , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle was over and the clan corpses lay stark upon the battlefield , sought out and claimed their men , and silently lifting them in their arms , carried them away for burial to some secret grave that would not be found or desecrated . Mary Ruadh draped Thomasina about her shoulders as she had so often done in life , quickly arranged another steps of boxes , kicking them away when she had done with them , and climbed back into Mrs. McKenzie 's garden , removing the evidence there too , with a care to spare the housekeeper 's show of asters , stock , and sweet William . There was a door in the rear wall of the garden and , clutching the still-warm body of the cat to her breast , she quickly let herself out through it , closing it quietly behind her before she began to run . The lane was at the south end of the village , where the tide crept upon a pebbled shore and small sand runners and sea birds pecked , yet nearby , at no more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a copse of pale gray ash , smooth-boled beech , and gnarled oak . It was for the shelter of these woods lying at the entrance to the grounds of the dark-stone manor house that Mary Ruadh ran as fast as her legsp81could carry her and her burden , as though if she did not reach it quickly , her grief would overtake her and catch her naked in the open where she could not hide . At the foot of a giant oak , so ancient that its roots , like the veins on the hands of the very old , stood out from the ground to form ridges of moss-covered shelter for a small body , Mary Ruadh flung herself beside the limp remains of her friend , for on that day that had begun so ordinarily and usually , like any other day , she had lost all she had . It was not only her cat , her dear companion and friend of whom she had been bereft , but also her father . Now , however , she wept over the immediate , beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face again and again in the soft , still flank , crying aloud over and over the beloved name of Thomasina until her wailing filled the grove and reached the cars of Hughie Stirling and brought him over to where she lay , to discover the cause . Hughie , the son of the laird who lived in the large manor house in the park on the slope a mile or so from the shore , was a boy of nine , attractive , with blue eyes of unusual clarity and color beneath ( lark brows and long lashes with curly , crisp dark hair , high brow and cheekbones , and square chin of the Campbells , to whom time Stirlings were related . A leader in the parish school , which he attended with youth of all degree and scale in and about Invermumoch , he was enjoying the lazy days of summer-holiday freedom . Clad in shorts and white T shirt , Hughie went over and knelt by the side of the child and examined the still figure of the cat . " I Iello , Mary Ruadh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is she dead ? " Mary raised her tear-stained face to see her friend and protector kneeling above her . She poured out her heart to him . " She was tick and Daddy killed her , " she wailed . " She could n't stand upp82this morning and when I took her to Daddy to be cured he made Willie Bannock put her to sleep . She 's dead . " The boy examined the cat more closely and gave the body a tentative prod . Even then , the sweetish scent of the chloroform still clung to it , and he wrinkled his nose . His quick mind saw and understood what might have happened . Raised among animals , dogs , cats , horses , livestock , and in an atmosphere where they were less sentimentally regarded , he knew how quickly a beast could be stricken with a sudden illness and an agony which made shootinga mercy . He said , " Maybe it was all for the best , Mary Ruadh . Maybe Thomasina was so sick your father could n't help it --  " The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred , and Hughie , more sensitive than most , was at once aware of his error , yet helpless in the new onrush of tears and sobs , as , confronted with this last blow , the seeming disloyalty of her friend , she cried , " Daddy did n't even try . He just went and had her killed , " and then added , " I hate you too --  " In a paroxysm of grief she buried her face in the ground and dug into the moss with her small fingernails . At a loss for what to do , Hughie first pronounced a valedictory over the departed : " She was a good cat , " he said , and then added , " Do n't cry so , Mary Ruadh , you 'll do yourself a hurt . Maybe Thomasina is in heaven already with wings and is having a lovely time chasing winged mice . " The little girl glanced at him for a moment with slightly less hostility , but the tears and sobs that wracked her slender body continued . Hughie could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his world was full of assorted cats who lived in the barns and stables or snoozed in the kitchen behind the stove and one was like another , but the awful grief afflicting Mary Ruadh touched and frightened him . . . . He was near enough her age to understand the greater tragedy of her loss of trust in her father along with the companionship of her pet . Plainly there wasp83nothing more to be done for Thomasina , but he was deeply concernedover Mary Ruadh . He had heard of people dying from a broken heart . Unless something were done to help her , his playmate , over whom he had exercised a kind of benevolent watch throughout the summer and who was strangely dear to him , iiiight lie there until she wept herself to death over the corpse of her cat . So much a man already was Hughie Stirling that in this crisis he remembered that where one could not console the next best thing was to distract . He said , " I 'll tell you what we 'll do , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful funeral any cat ever had . Mary ! Mary Ruadh ! Do you hear me ? We 'll give Thomasina a grand burial this very day . I know just the satin box at home that will do for the casket . We 'll put in the young heather for her to lie on , which is as soft as down  --  well , almost , anyway . Are you listening to me , Mary Ruadh ? " She was . The agony of sobs began to diminish and when she raised her head and tear-brightened eyes from the gray-green sward of old moss and roots , the anger and mistrust had gone from them . Here was definite interest . Hughie pressed the advantage thus won and at the same timegan to fire his own vivid imagination , for even as he invented and improvised to divert the unhappy child , the idea began to sound most promising and might result in a " do " that would be talked about by his companions in Inveranoch for a long while to come . " Look you , Mary Ruadh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession through the town as long as when Lachlan Dougal was buried andu shall wear widow 's mournings and walk directly behind the sket , weeping . " Mary Ruadh was now frankly interested in the proposal . She ' eked herself up and knelt facing Hughie , so that the body ofp84Thomasina lay between them , unnoticed . " Will I wear a veil and a black shawl ? Mrs. McKenzie has a black shawl . " " Of course , " Hughie assented , delighted with the results he was achieving and more and more carried away with his idea , " I 'm sure I can find you a veil of mother 's . We 'll have the funeral this very day in the afternoon . I 'll ask Geordie McNabb , and Iain will bring his brothers and sisters and others from the school . " Mary Ruadh asked , " Can the dustman come ? " " Well , no , " Hughie replied , " he 'd very likely be working --  " Then as the child 's face fell , he had another brilliant inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sergeant Braid , father 's piper ? He 's been learning the pipes and already has unco ' skill . We 'll have him . Can ye no ' see Jamie in his kilts with his ain wee pipes ( Hughie when he became excited was apt to drop somewhat into the local way of speech ) , wi ' the ribbons flying and his bonnet set saucily upon his knob , piping Maclntosh 's Lament ? " Mary Ruadh was quite enchanted now . Her eyes were as round as half-crown pieces and tears no longer flowed from them . Hughie continued : " Well , and I 'll wear my formal kilts with skean dhu and sporran and every one on the street will turn his head as we go by and say , There goes the poor widow MacDhui , a-burying of her dearest Thomasina , God rest her soul , foully done to death --  ' " " Really truly , Hughie ? " " Oh yes , " the boy promised , " and I 'll tell you something more . " He was now beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distracting his unhappy friend , but at the same time organizing a splendid afternoon 's entertainment , far better than the somewhattame picnic he originally projected . " We 'll make a head-board ! " " What is a headboard ? " " Well , it 's a kind of a thing like a gravestone when you are in a hurry . It tells about the person who is buried there . " Here hisp85own blue eyes widened and he ran his fingers through his crisp , dark hair , seized by the throes of literary composition and quite forgetting his prior judgment rendered upon the assassination , namely that Mr. MacDhui probably had no alternative but to put the cat out of its misery . " We 'll print on it , Here lies THOMASINA  --  MURDERED July 26 , 1957Mary Ruadh 's gaze was brimming with worship . The word " murdered " had the proper ring to it and filled her with a curious satisfaction . She looked down now upon the still form of Thomasina ; gloomy retrospect enveloped her once more as the memory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence : " I 'm not going to speak to Daddy ever again . " Hughie nodded absently . Mary 's family vendettas were her own affair and none of his concern as long as they did not impinge upon the grandiose funeral , the details of which any Highland chieftain or even modern local inhabitant of Inveranoch would have been proud . He went on creating : " I 'll play the part of the minister and make the speech at the graveside  --  ashes to ashes and dust to dust ' and then all about what a wonderful person the deceased was and how sorry everybody is that she has gone away to her heavenly reward . And after that we 'll cover over the casket with earth and lay our wreaths and flowers on the mound and we 'll come away from the grave to a merry tune skirled by Jamie Braid , after which we 'll have a feed of some kind , a real draidgie , and all be gay and cheerful again . Well , what do you say to that , Mary Ruadh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughie 's neck , leaning over Thomasina to do so , and hugged him , for he had brought something interesting and exciting at least momentarily into her life ; something was about to happen in which she would play a major role and she was quite enchanted with the program . " Good lass ! " Hughie said , produced a reasonably clean handkerchief , wiped the tear stains away from her face and held it forp86her to blow her nose . Then he brushed her pinafore where leaves and moss had clung to it , ran his fingers through her bright hair and , setting her then upon her feet , said , " There you are , then . I 'll be taking Thomasina home to prepare the casket ; I 'll find Geordie McNabb and he 'll wake over her whilst I 'm having lunch and getting everything ready . Jamie 's brother Ewan will go and tell the others . We 'll all meet here when the tower clock strikes three , and form up for the procession . " Nearly a head taller than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with himself and with her as well . It would be a great " do " that afternoon , probably the best of the whole summer , one that would be remembered and spoken about by him and all his friends and companions for long after . He picked up the remains of Thomasina and flung them unceremoniously over his shoulder and , turning Mary in the direction of her home , started off with an affectionate pat on her shoulder . " Off you go now . And remember , wear your mourners and do n't be late . A funeral 's no good at all without the widow or weeping relatives . And this one is going to be quite the best ever . " Mary Ruadh now trotted off obediently . She did not so much as turn around to give the departed and departing Thomasina anotherglance . That Thomasina , the one she had carried about with her and nursed and played with and cuddled to her at night , was " gone away " never to return , which was her understanding of death , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away " when she was very little . Gone away , then , meant not there any more . Yet the yearning remained , and her left arm , over which Thomasina was usually draped , felt strangely unweighted . She had had no experience of knowing what to do with a love when once the object of its power and intensity of feeling was no longer there to receive it . And then there was something else besides the death of a person , since Thomasina was in many ways more real to her and humanp87than many of those surrounding her , and that was the death of a love , which had happened almost simultaneously and was still going on within her . The gentle , the all-wise , all-knowing , all-powerful , all-loving father had " gone away " too . In his place there remained only the mountain of a man with the bristly red beard , thunderous voice , and iron arms who had set her on the other side of the door while inside his office the murder of Thomasina was taking place . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used and which was to become a permanent part of Thomasina 's memorial , a slight smile of satisfaction played about the corners of her otherwiseinnocent mouth . The grownup who had brought about the disaster of Thomasina 's departure was still to be dealt with.  |p88Mr  . Veterinarian Andrew MacDhui missed the funeral procession of his late victim that afternoon , for he was engaged in proceeding through another part of the town in the company of his friend , Mr. Angus Peddie , to bear good news to blind man Tammas Moffat , that , in a sense , he would " see " again . Mr. Peddie dropped in upon the animal doctor shortly after three o'clock to learn what had happened to the Seeing Eye dog he had been instrumental in securing for Tammas , who was one of his oldest parishioners . He was a wonder , was Mr. Peddie , and known all over the town for being able to smooth-tongue a person out of a contribution when there was a need . His way was to appear to be letting you in on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winning pools combination ; he made you a cheerful and excited co-conspirator and before you knew it , you had parted with a pound note , or ten shillings , or whatever you happened to have on you at the moment . And blessed if later on , when the results showed , you did n't feel as though you had won something . The minister found Mr. MacDhui looking tired but satisfied when he entered his consulting room . Peddie said , " I stopped by , Andrew , to ask whether there was any news of Tarnmas 's dog  --  good or ill --  " MacDhui savored for a moment the pleasure of the reply he had to make , before indulging in it , but the smile of gratification wouldp89not stay from his full lips ; his strong teeth showed through the red bristles of beard and mustache as he replied , " Well , I have saved ' I'ammas 's eyes for him . The dog will manage . In three weeks it will be good as new . " Mr. Peddie said , " Ah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so . I was expecting it . " MacDhui cocked his head at his friend . " Your faith , Angus , flatters me , but I might tell you --  " " Oh , " Mr. Peddie said innocently , " I was n't referring to you in this instance , I meant --  " MacDhui barked a savage laugh . " Hah ! Your Higher Power , of course . Well , my friend , if you knew how many times the slender thread of your faith came near to being snipped . It 's almost a miracle the beast is alive --  " He checked himself as he realized what he had said . Peddie nodded cheerfully and said , " Well , yes , that 's what I asked for . In matters of faith , narrow escapes do n't count . It 's the results really that matter , is n't it ? As for what you would do , I had not the slightest doubt . Shall we go and tell the good news to Tammas ? He was in a great torment of worry when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind and alone . The dog was his comfort as well as his guide . " " Eh ? " MacDhui asked . " What do you want me along for ? You can tell him --  " " It was to you he said , Save my eyes , ' " Peddie replied , " yours was the hand and the skill --  " " Oh , was it ? I thought you just said --  " " Well , actually , it was you who said it . But then you would n't be the first to confuse the Power and the instrument . Come along , Andrew , it will do you good to see the old man 's joy . " MacDhui grumbled in his throat , but he put on his old tweed jacket with the leather patches at the elbows and pockets , loadedp90a great black pipe , took up his twisted blackthorn , and said to Peddie , " Want to have a look at him first ? " He took the minister to the hospital part of the house . The dog lay on clean straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fine eyes were alert and keen , the pointed ears picked up , and he beat a rat-tat-tat on the floor of his cage with his brush at their coming , whined and scratched at the door with his forepaws . " ' What a beautiful sight , " Mr. Peddie said , and feasted his eyes on it . " Do n't pamper or spoil him , " MacDhui said to Willie Bannock , who was hovering nearby . " He 's been trained for but one man . " Tammas Moffat lived on the other side of town , the poorer section , and as the two men walked thither chatting , the faint wind-borne skirl of pipes in lament reached the ears of Mr. Peddie for a moment and he paused , cocking an ear . " That 's strange , " he said , " I thought I heard the sound of Maclntosh 's Lament . But there 's no ' any burial today I know about . " It was the faraway mourning of the little pipes of Jamie Braid , the sergeant piper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears . Mr. MacDhui hearkened for a moment and then said , " I hear nothing , " and they continued on . Tammas Moffat had a room on the second floor of a twostoryhouse of whitewashed stone and roof of gray slate in a section of such tenements , drab new council houses and the remains of several wartime Nissen huts . Several small children were playing in the dust before the house ; a gray and white gull with but one leg perched on the chimney and an old woman in cap and apron was sweeping the doorstep . " Is Tammas Moffat in ? " Mr. Peddie inquired . She paused in her sweeping long enough to say , " I have nae Boot yell be finding him at home . I have not heard him stirring . "  | " Thank you . We 'll go up then . The veterinary here has good news for him about his dog . " " I 'm sure your news will be welcome . He was badly put out when the poor bonnie creature was hurt . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " They entered and went up the dark , narrow stairs , Peddie leading . There was no sound in the house whatsoever , though from below they could hear the dry susurrus of the sweeping and the rumbling of the baker 's van and then the beat of the gull 's wings as it flapped off the chimney . Mr. Peddie paused irresolutely , halfway up the stairs . He turned to look back at the veterinary . " Andrew --  " he said . " Well -- 7 " The minister did not continue , and the silence became oppressive . The rotund little man was much more of an instrument of communication from outside sources than his outward appearanceindicated or most people suspected . He was an extraordinarily kind and sensitive man , so sensitive that at that moment he felt his soul go sick within him . " Andrew , " he said again , but changed his mind when the looming bulk of his friend pressed him on and he merely said , " Well , we will see , then . " He proceeded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to the end of the landing and knocked at the closed door . He waited for a moment , with ever-waxing certainty , and when there was no reply , opened the door gently and went in , followed by MacDhui . " Oh dear , " said Mr. Peddie softly . The blind man was sitting in an armchair facing the door . His head had not fallen forward but somehow remained in the position of listening , the strained , anxious listening for footsteps that had been his attitude when death had come to him . Mr. Peddie bent down and looked up into the sightless eyes to see whether there was any sign of life remaining , but MacDhuip92hurried forward and placed his head on his chest to listen , and then took his wrist to try to find a pulse . The sere arm was still warm , but there was no heart within the body . " He 's gone , " MacDhui said . " He can not have been dead for more than an hour or two . " Peddie nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDhui suddenly emitted a harsh and horrid laugh that explodedthrough the silent house . " I saved his eyes ! " he brayed . " Where is your God now ? " He shocked Mr. Angus Peddie into anger . The minister drew himself up to all of the dignity his size and form could muster , his round face flushed , lips quivering , eyes behind the spectacles hot with indignation . " Be quiet , Andrew , " he cried , " and be damned to you for your impertinence . " " Aye , you can damn , but you can not answer me . What was the good of it all ? What is the use of the work I have done ? What kind of God do you worship who permits the dog to live and the man to die ? " " Is God your servant then , or is He God ? " cried the minister , in most un-Peddie-like outrage . " Must He admire your work and flatter your vanity like a father to a child , or is He to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then your great design that we are supposed to worship and believe in and give thanks for ? " Ruffled and angry , they faced one another across the unheeding form of the old man , who sat like one in quiet judgment upon their folly and the humanity of it . MacDhui shouted , " What has he to be thankful for ? " his beard thrust out toward the top of Peddie 's head . The minister was the first to recover . He said , looking at the dead man , " He was an old man ; he died peacefully ; he died with hope in his heart . " He looked up at MacDhui and said , with such con/trition in his mild eyes that MacDhui was similarly moved , " I should not have lost my temper , Andrew , I am sorry . " MacDhui said , " Well , nor am I proud of shouting at you over this poor fellow . I am sorry I was impertinent to you -- - " " Oh , you were n't to ME , " Peddie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has unstrung us both , except I knew as we climbed the steps that it would be so . " With the greatest gentleness , he closed the eyes of the blind man . He paused momentarily in the middle of this act as he was struck by a thought that seemed unrelated at the time and which yet he knew somehow was not . He said , " Mary Ruadh was in your waiting room this morning . She told me her cat was ill . ' Whatever became of it ? " To MacDhui , the morning 's scene sprang to life again with painfully vivid clarity . He saw and heard again the hurt and moaningdog upon the table , with Willie Bannock sponging its tongue and muzzle , and his daughter standing outside the door with the dying cat in her arms . For , he told himself again , it had been dying and no doubt of that , and mentally his tongue formed the exact long medical term for the nature of its illness . No one knew whether it was communicable or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled again the sweetish scent of the chloroform rag as Willie Bannock had carried out his orders and destroyed the animal , and in his ears once more was the helpless drumming of Mary Ruadh 's fists upon the panels of the door and her fearful cries . He wished he could get the sound of the thrumming of those tiny hands upon the door from out his ears . He replied , " I had the animal put away . I suspected a meningeal infection . Better safe than sorry . Besides , I was attending the dog and could n't take the time . I have no doubt the beast was better off dead . " A frown clouded the serene face of Mr. Peddie , and he pulled at his lower lip with his fingers , a trick he had when he was greatlyp94worried . " Oh dear , " he said . " Oh dear ! " For he seemed to be feelinginto the future again ; sometimes he wondered whether he was not in some manner related to the Norms the way occasionally for him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came along who were to tread it . The cat was dead then , and the child would be desolate and there would be far-reaching consequences . " Oh dear me , " he said again , and , still fingering his lip , walked out of the room and down the stairs , with Andrew MacDhui following him , uncomprehending.  |p959  The procession led by Jamie Braid , the sergeant piper 's son , wound its way through the town by way of Rob Roy 's Square and across the quay northward , skirting the shore where , guided by Wolf Cub Geordie McNabb , it crossed the river by the old saddlebackbridge and then turned westward into the mouth of Glen Ardrath , passing on the way the gypsy encampment in the valley , with its many caravans whisping smoke out of crooked pipe chimneys . Jamie was a thin boy and so tall for his age of eleven that he seemed to be proceeding on stilts , though they were actually the long shanks of his legs striving to reach into his body . His face , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks to inflate the tartaned bag beneath his arm he appeared to have a crab apple stored in each one , while his eyes threatened to bulge from their sockets . But he had a fine head of thick , wavy brown hair and his Glengarry was cocked bravely upon it at the angle proper to his father 's late regiment . There were streamers attached to it and streamers and ribbons , too , from his pipes , and his kilts rose and fell as he walked the slow piper 's tread he had learned from his father . Behind him , bearing the sacred pennant of their Wolf Cub troop , marched Geordie McNabb with several of his fellows in uniform , lending the military touch . Next came the hearse itself ,  |p96drawn  by four of the younger girls of the first class part of Hughie Stirling in the brief time between luncheon and the appointed hour for the cortege to form . Having to compromise between a caisson and a cart , the casket containing the mortal remains of Thomasina reposedon the body of an old toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potting sheds . The casket itself was a large wicker comfit case lined with satin that Hughie had seen in his mind 's eye as left over from Christmas and stored away against the day when it might be turned into a sewing basket or something else useful . The children had lined it with young heather to make a bed and upon it had laid Thomasina curled into a lifelike position as though merely sleeping , and over all , as a covering , and in lieu of the flag with which the military draped its coffins , a length of the Stirling tartan had been flung . Directly behind the casket marched Mary Ruadh in her weeds , on the arm of Hughie Stirling , who had seized upon the occasion  --  and in the face of certain retribution to follow  --  to make of himself the glittering star of the production . Thus he had filched his formal attire from the chest where it reposed in moth balls waiting to be called forth reverently by The Games , or a visit from someone royal . There was genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of frothy splendor against the short-cut black velvet jacket with the silver buttons bearing the crest of the Stirlings . He wore dirk and sporran and white gloves ; his bonnet was set on the back of his crisp , curly hair and he carried an authorized prayer and psalm book . Rarely had such a handsome lad been put together , or one who lent such tone to a funeral . Mary Ruadh was draped in Mrs. McKenzie 's best black wool shawl , which , being too long for her , was wound first around her shoulders and then her waist , with a curiously oriental effect.  |p97Hughie  , on his successful raid through the grownups ' quarters of the manor , had unearthed a purple veil of his mother 's , or more likely his grandmother 's , since it was the kind ladies used to wear when they went motoring in the open juggernauts of the twenties , and this was now draped about Mary Ruadh 's head in the manner of a summer thundercloud through which gleamed the red-gold of her hair , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was both startling and striking , if not exactly funereal . And finally , trailing behind the principals and dignitaries , followedthose adherents of the Stirling coterie , members of the school , plus a scattering of summer-visitor children raised by word of mouth and bush telegraph , who came in what they had , or thought appropriate to the burial ceremony of the best cat in Inveranoch , and as the imposing cortege moved onward , it attracted quite a few more to walk in its wake , so that it numbereda good twenty by the time it burst from the northern boundaries of the town and headed for the glade in the glen that Geordie McNabb had suggested as the burial ground . The town itself took the masquerade in its stride and as indicativeof the changing times when youth no longer walked solemnly in the steps of its forefathers as well as a to-be-endured manifestation of that summertime madness which descended upon Inveranoch with the influx of holiday visitors . A nearsighted old gentleman standing by the side of the road removed his ancient , flat-topped , curl-brimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgently , and that was about all the stir created by the affair . But if this was but innocent children 's fancy and play to the onlookersand a delightful afternoon 's make-believe for the participants , there was one to whom it was not , and who in a small way was trailing the remnants of the complete innocence of childhood out behind her as she proceeded on the arm of the exquisitely beautiful Hughie Stirling . This was Mary Ruadh MacDhui , forp98after all it was not only her cat but her alter ego that lay in the silk- and heather-lined casket beneath the Stirling tartan , and which was now on its way to being buried forever . The place of interment had been chosen by Geordie McNabb , who remembered it from the visit he had paid to the Red Witch with his injured frog , and approved by Hughie Stirling . The proximity to the strange weaver of Glen Ardrath known as Daft Lori held no more terrors for Geordie , for he had looked upon her , but it did add a fillip of further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided the procession to that faery circle in the woods , the glade formed by beach and ash and presided over by an enormous graybeard of the forest , an ancient oak beneath which surely Rob Roy , the outlaw , wrapped in his cloak of invisibility from the King 's men , had slept on many a summer night . It lay some thirty yards or so off the main path that climbed up into the glen , but away from the burn , whose rushing descent made cool music to background the doleful droning of the pipes . A shaft of the late-afternoon sun like theatrical illumination , penetrating the glade , cast its spotlight upon the colorful pageant of the children . It splintered on the silver buttons of Hughie Stirling 's jacket and the silver chain of his sporran , and a darting arrow of reflected light caught in the eyes of Daft Lori almost a quarter of a mile away , higher up in the darker , deeper woods above , where she roamed in quest of mushrooms and varieties of herbs . She wore a skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her red hair was bound up in a green cloth . Over her arm she carried a light basket in which reposed a small knife and trowel . She was as sensitive , alarmed , and wary as a young deer at this unusual invasion of what had come to be regarded as her territory . Not even picnickers came to this part of the glen . The windp99now brought the cry of the pipes to her . She glided forward cautiously , moving from tree trunk to tree trunk , ever closer until she paused behind the smooth bole of a copper beech clinging to the hillside a hundred yards or so from the glade , into which she now had an almost unobstructed view . She thought at first it was a faery rout , a visit from the Little People of another age , for she believed in them , and in gnomes and pixies , nymphs and brownies , elves and hamadryads , and angels too , and frequently communed with them . She caught flashes of the gay colors , the lace , velvets and tartans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with melancholy and sadness and , because of the distance , she did not at first recognize the intruders as children . But later it became plain to her , and though she could not hear their voices clearly or immediately distinguish what was toward , or fathom the meaning of the curious ritual they seemed to be performing , she remained quietly concealed in her vantage point until at last the meaning of it all was revealed . In the Scottish thoroughness of his organization , Hughie Stirling had even thought to provide a gravedigger , one of the young sons of the gardener at the manor , who had marched , spade over shoulder , in the procession and proudly too , and now his moment of importance had come , as Hughie intoned solemnly , " Gravedigger  --  do thy job . " The lad made the earth fly in the glade and soon had prepared a creditable shallow pit into which the wicker basket was lowered as the principals and mourners stood about the graveside enjoyingthemselves thoroughly . Mary Ruadh watched the proceedings silently , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was thinking . Hughie Stirling , somewhat out of his depth with ritual , scatteredsome earth over the top of the basket , saying , " Return unto the ground from which you wast to  --  I mean thou wast taken ,  |p100for  dust thou art and unto dust retumeth , amen , " and then remarked , " I think we ought to sing something  --  " No one had thought to bring a hymnbook ; none of them was strong on doxology . One of the girls struck up a tentative quaver , appropriately nasal , but was not followed and subsided in embarrassment . It was bullet-headed Geordie McNabb who came to the rescue , his years as yet unencumbered by theology or ritual , and having been asked for a song , launched into the " Bonnie , bonnie banks of Loch Lomond , " in which they all joined with the fine fervor of familiarity . The strains of it drifted up the glen and reached the ears of the Red Witch of Glen Ardrath herself , resembling a hamadryad , watching from behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughie cleared his throat preparatory to delivering the valedictory he had been composingin his head during the march and wherein he felt more at home . He said : " Brethren , friends , and fellow mourners at the graveside . We have come here to bury Thomasina and to praise her . Thomasina was the beloved cat of our own grieving Mary Ruadh MacDhui here , who I am sure you all know . Anyway , here she is . Thomasina was a good cat . She was one of the best cats in Inveranoch . I suppose it would not be too much to say that she was one of the best cats in all Argyllshire . Those of us who knew her well were proud to be her friend and now that she has been taken from our midst her place can not be filled and we all feel for her sorrowing mother . " Several of the visitors were so overcome by this eloquence that they burst into applause at this point to be quelled by a stem , " Not yet , you cuffs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anything wrong such as catching birds or biting or scratching anyone . If she caught a mouse in the cellar she would bring it to Mary Ruadh to keep , instead of eating it herself . She was never cross or bad-tempered . She was also veryp101clean and was always washing herself . She liked Mary Ruadh best of all , but she would also let other children pick her up and play with her , which most cats , as you know , will not do . She could purr louder than any cat I ever heard and the expression on her face was very becoming to her . She had a few faults , but I will not mention those here . Her mortal remains now lie at our feet , but her soul has already ascended straight to heaven , where it will sit at The Right Hand and will wait there until Mary Ruadh 's soul comes to join hers when they will be together again , forever and ever , amen ! " The amen having given the direct clue that he was finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this speech with prolonged rounds of applause that awakened the echoes until the pattering appeared to bounce from side to side of the rocky glen . Hughie Stirling bowed modestly and said , " We 'll fill in the grave now , but first , Mary Ruadh , you ought to attempt to throw yourself weeping across the casket like the bereaved always do . " Mary Ruadh said succinctly , " I do n't want to . I want to go home . " It had been a long day and tremendous things had happened to her , how tremendous she was not yet even aware . The procession and the funeral had been exciting and diverting ; she had enjoyed being the center of attention , but now she wished to be at home , where her sense of loss could be more sharply identified than here . The connection between her and the object in the basket was no longer clear , since she could not see it , the glade was foreign and the sun was beginning to sink . Teatime was coming on , tea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dolls on their chairs and Thomasina opposite her with napkin tied about her neck and the little bit of pink tongue showing between her lips as it always did when there were goodies to be shared . The picture in her mind was so vivid that it startled her momentarily into tears that had not yet flowed since the burial had begun . Shep102knew in her heart that Thomasina had gone away , or had been " put away " and that she would never see her again , but she could not do her mourning here and in front of them all . It was at home she had her rendezvous with misery . It had all been rather much for one small girl to grow so old in the brief span between morning and afternoon ... . Truth to tell , Hughie Stirling was wanting his tea too , and in a shed back behind the manor there was a cache of food , the funeral feast or draidgie he had organized , and it was getting on . Too , he had noted the glint of tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked reasonably , " All right . You do n't have to . Sometimesthe bereaved bears her sorrow nobly and silently without unseemly show of emotion . Fill in the grave , Gravedigger . " The earth rattled against the top of the wicker basket and loosely filled the shallow trench , forming a small mound . The gravedigger , too , was anxious to be getting home . ' While Hughie Stirling set up the previously prepared headboard some of the children collected wild flowers , and as Jamie Braid intoned an appropriate pibroch , they circled the grave and deposited them thereon . " Now , " ordered Hughie , " you play something cheerful . " Obedientlyfrom Jamie 's pipes skirled the strains of the Campbelltown Reel , and he stepped out , bending his long stork 's legs high at the bare knees , puffing and swelling . Hughie Stirling took Mary Ruadh by the hand and they and all the rest filed from the scene and vanished down the glen path in the direction of Inveranoch . Nothing stirred in the glade for what seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed directed upon the greensward stage from the wings rather than the flies and threw elongated shadows out of which the girl known as Daft Lori came gliding , a green wraith , hardly to be seen , hardly to be heard . She trod the ground lightly and timidly , first about the edges , then , drawn by curiosity , she crossed the little clearing and kneel/ing swiftly on the ground beside the newly turned earth she studied and read the inscription composed by Hughic Stirling and painted on the headboard marker , somewhat plagiarized from sentiments he had encountered on the gravestones of Inveranoch churchyard . " Here lies Thomasina , born Jan. 18 , 1952 , FOULLEY MURDEREDJuly 26 , 1957 ! Sleep Sweetly Sainted Freind . " All fear and perplexity now went from Lori 's countenance , while a smile of sympathy and understanding illuminated her face and sweetly rueful mouth . Yet a moment later her expression changed to one of uneasiness again as she reread the marker and the words " FOULLEY MURDERED . " They seemed to cast a chill upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innocence where a children 's summer masque had taken place to one where something evil seemed to lurk . She shuddered and rose to her feet , took a few steps , and then turned back , unable to tear her eyes from the grim legend . She knelt again by the graveside , her hands folded , her plain face and clear brow contracted with concern as she bent over it . A children 's play burial had taken place there , of that there was no doubt , but who and what had been buried there ? She wished she knew what she should do . For an instant her fingers closed over the trowel reposing in the basket on her arm , yet still hesitated . Whatever lay beneath the ground was dead , and it was with the living that she had to do . She continued to kneelthere undecided.  |p10410  All in all , it had been a bad day for Veterinary Andrew MacDhui and he returned home to supper late and in ill-humor after awaiting the arrival at the blind man 's home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenens , and also in company with the Reverend Peddie , giving police testimony on the discoveryof the body of Tammas Moffat . The death caused no surprise . Tammas was eighty-six . It was Dr. Strathsay 's preliminary guess that the old heart had failed from strain and shock , which the autopsy would later confirm , but MacDhui could not find interest in such details . The man was dead and there was an end to it ; he need not have died , for MacDhui had brought his Seeing Eye dog back from the brink , performing , as he had indicated , a miracle of modern canine surgery . Tammas had passed on without ever knowing this . MacDhuiwas not pleased with fate , or circumstances , or luck , or whichever it was that appeared to doom him to play just the opposite role to that of his youthful ambition , to be a healer and doctor to humanity . He was still preoccupied as he swung open the low wooden gate leading to his house and marched up the narrow flagstone walk , and halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking about him , then searching his pockets and thereafter his mind , but for the life of him he couldp105not think what it was , or why he had thus stopped . It was only later he remembered . Mary Ruadh had not been there to greet him on the pathway , her ginger cat hanging over one arm like an extension of her hair . Nor was there any charging of small feet accompanied by shouts of " Daddy  --  Daddy ! " as he crossed the threshold . However the odor of food cooking cheered him somewhat and he went to his quarters for a scrub-up and thereafter proceeded to the dining room where a startling sight met his eyes . Mary Ruadh was seated at the table set for two . She was still clad in mourning dress  --  that is to say , Mrs. McKenzie 's black shawl wound about her middle and the purple cloud of veiling , now draped about her head and shoulders madonna style . In the background Mrs. McKenzie was seen through the door to the kitchen in the throes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors and potlids that indicates food is about to be got onto the table . She glanced in anxiously through the door when she heard Mr. MacDhui enter and then quickly ducked back to her tasks . Mary Ruadh did not look up at all when her father came into the room , but sat staring before her , her hands in her lap . MacDhui called out cheerily enough , " Hello there , chicken : what 's all this ? What are you dressed up for , Queen of the Night ? " He cocked his head and beard at her and said , " Becoming , though not exactly cheery in view of the kind of day I have had . How about putting it off now that we are about to have supper ? " The child raised her head and with a steady and unwinking gaze , looked at him , through him , and beyond him , and did not reply . Mrs. McKenzie put her head in through the door , an anxious and worried expression upon her long , narrow face and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' good evenin ' tae yer feyther ? " She shook her head in silent negation . Her father chose thep106wrong moment to be jocular , and an even worse allusion . " What 's the matter , child ? Cat got your tongue ? " Two tears welled forth from the eyes of Mary Ruadh and rolled down her cheeks , and her small face puckered for a moment as though she were about to break down . Had she done so , it might have been better , for the huge man would then have gathered her to him , hugged and cuddled her , chucked her under the chin and comforted her and in the familiar warmth of his arms and affection , her new resolve might have melted then and there and been dispelled . But the tears were not followed by others , the crying wrinkles smoothed from the young face , to be replaced by an expression of stony distaste as she stared her father down . The veterinarian called in the direction of the kitchen , " Mrs. McKenzie ! I say , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the room , nervously wiping her hands upon her apron , looking with worry as well as some trepidationupon the likes of a Mary Ruadh such as she had never encounteredbefore . The plain but rather sweetly odd face of childhood innocence , the perpetual breathlessness of one who lives half in , half out of childhood 's dream world , had turned hard and curiously adult in its concentration . It was as though a changeling had suddenly entered the house . Mrs. McKenzie was a simple soul and quite out of her depth in the presence of primitive emotions . She tried to explain : " The puir bairn 's in a swither o'er the death o ' her pussy baudrons . She canna thole to be wi'oot . " When the veterinarian stared at her blankly she added , " The weans had a funeral for her this afternoon . The procession was a grand yin wi ' Jamie Braid , the sergeant piper 's son from the great hoose blowin ' the deid march . I dinna ken whaur they laid her awa '  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that is nought but a lot of children 's play and gilaver . I wish to know why she will not speak with me ? What has got into her ? "  |p107Mrs  . McKenzie looked from the glowering child to the gloweringman and plucked up her courage . " The bairn maun be ower fashed. 0 ' course she couldna mean it , but she said ye mur  --  I mean tae say , she said ye put away her puss baudrons Thomasina , and she will no speak tae ye again ' til ye bring her back . " MacDhui stared unbelieving , a flush mounting from out his shirt collar and rising to join the flame of his hairline . In the tragedy of the blind man and the part he had played in it , the episode of the chloroforming of his daughter 's cat that morning had been pushed clean out of his head . It is most certain that under other circumstances , relaxed in his home as he was inclined to be after a hard day 's work and in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise and , with sympathy and understanding , cozened her out of her rebellion . But the reference to what had happened that morning triggered once more , it seemed , the whole train of his frustrations brought on by that fatal plea of the blind man . It was those eyes he had been working on when his daughter had brought in her sick cat to shake him from his dream . He saw again the stark , stubborn , and stricken face of the child when he had pronounced the death sentence upon her pet , as he had felt compelled to do upon so many others that did not seem worth trying to save . Once more he heard the helpless beating of her small fists upon the surgery door and her exhausted , hysterical sobbing . Into his mind again came the haunted eyes and face of old Mrs. Laggan and her fat , wheezy , miserable dog , and the gentle words of his friend , the Reverend Peddie : " But it was that poor , wretched dog she loved --  " And he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in his chair listening with his sightless eyes turned toward the door . And so he turned upon his child as he did upon clients who triedp108his patience , red beard thrust forward belligerently , eyes hot , voice harsh , and shouted , " What nonsense is this , Mary Ruadh ? I 'll not have it , I say . I told you your cat was so ill it would likely have died in a day or so anyway . Now then , go at once and remove those garments and then return to the table and be yourself . " To his surprise , the child arose obediently , left the table , and went to her room . MacDhui suddenly felt as foolish and contrite as he had the moment he had found himself shouting at his friend Peddie across poor Tammas Moffat . When she returned a few minutes later without the offending clothes and took her place once more he said disarmingly , " See here now , Mary Ruadh , I 'm sorry about Thomasina , but there 's no restoring her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like another cat for your own , a wee kitten ? When I looked in upon grocer Dobbie on the way home he offered me a choice out of six his mother cat brought in . And one of them was snow white without a mark . Now what do you say to that ? " Mary Ruadh said nothing . She did not seem to have heard . Mrs. McKenzie fluttered in the doorway with the tray . " Well , bring it in then , bring it in , " MacDhui ordered impatiently . While they were eating he tried again . " Well then , a dog perhaps for a change , to be all your own , eh , Mary Ruadh , and follow you about wherever you go ? Or perhaps a Siamese . Now there 's an idea and I believe I know where I might lay hands on one . Come , Mary Ruadh , speak up . " The child turned her silent , stubborn gaze upon her father , and in her eyes was the look of one who regards a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that exasperation verging upon blind , helpless rage that adults experience in the presence of a willful and headstrong child whose contempt is written clearly and plainly upon its face . With an enormous effort he controlled himself , said no more , and fell to eating his supper , but with small appetite . Silence hung heavilyp109over the room , and in the kitchen he had a feeling that Mrs. McKenzie was going about on tiptoes . Mary Ruadh ate too , but listlessly and without looking at her father . Sinkingly MacDhui thought , What if she were really never to speak to him again  --  ever ever again ? What was one to do ? What would he do ? What could he do ? But it was , he told himself , preposterous and impossible , all over that damned cat that he should have turfed out of the house long ago as a potential carrier of disease germs and a general nuisance . The love she had lavished upon the beast should be reserved for a human  --  she treated it almost like --  With an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the child in her arms and the look upon her face before she died . And for one fearful instant he asked himself the question , denying it with all the inner vehemence he could muster  --  whether he had put the cat away out of jealousy -- At this point the uncomfortable and unhappy silence was broken shatteringly . " Please , Mrs. McKenzie , " Mary Ruadh said ,  --  may I have some more apple pudding ?  --  This unexpected end to the painful quiet , and the child 's addressing herself to the housekeeper , he found a hundred times more unbearable and exasperating than if she had not spoken at all . Yet the first words she had said since he had returned home that evening appeared to him to offer an entering wedge . Thrusting his beard across the table at her , he said , " Have you not had sufficient apple pudding , Mary Ruadh ? " The child stared at him across the table and remained silent . At the kitchen door Mrs. McKenzie hesitated with the basin in her hands , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish more dessert , Mary Ruadh , " MacDhui said meaningfullyand with all the pregnant emphasis and self-satisfaction of the chess player who , seeing game in hand , announces his first " check ! " to his opponent , " If you wish more , you will ask it of me. "  |p110Again  the child turned her gaze upon her father and this time added the insult of a longer study , quiet , thorough , contemplative , and hostile . The figure and person of her father was there , the great , warm , smelly man to whom she cuddled , in whose beard and neck she buried her face , in whose arms there was safety , whom sometimes when she felt overwhelmed with love for him she could not hug strongly enough or devour sufficiently with kisses . Yet none of these feelings were present in her now . For she was now looking upon the person who had ordered the life of Thomasina taken and the remains flung out upon the refuse heap , and who , now that she was punishing him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps an even harder blow , for in the world in which she lived and played , the world of Hughie Stirling and Geordie McNabb , and even the simple world of Mrs. McKenzie , the great and unforgivable crime was injustice . The line between fair and unfair was sharply demarcated . Adults as well as those of their own age who crossed it were judged . She was still too young to know the word " blackmail , " but at her father 's words she was filled at once with an understanding of its power and essential loathsomeness and she felt herself smitten to the heart with a sadness and disappointment almost deeper than any she had already experienced that day . First it was her cat which had been killed and now her father , for the look that she was giving him was his execution . In the short space of a few hours the two beings that she had most loved in all the world and who had made up the sum of her security and happiness had been taken from her . Thereupon Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoicism of which the sensitive child is capable when deeply hurt . Withdrawing her damning gaze from her father she said , " No , thank you , Mrs. McKenzie , I do n't think I want any more apple pudding . "  |p111Andrew  MacDhui flung his napkin to the floor , scraped his chair angrily back from the table , and without another word turned and slammed out of the room and the house . She had defeated him . To his " Check ! " she had replied with " Checkmate ! " He knew that she had been aware of the logical extension of his gambit to , " If you wish anything to eat , you will speak to me and ask ME for it "  --  and that he would not browbeat her into compliance , for in those stony eyes and grimly clenched lips he had read her unshakable determination to be starved rather than speak to him . Hot flushes of rage surged through him as he flung himself along the foreshore of the loch in a kind of desperation effort to work off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shake her . It was MacDhui 's first experience with that peculiar kind and intensity of rage that comes to a parent when he encounters some trait or facet of his own character mirrored in his child . The sea loch was bathed in that unreal light of Northern lands where the clock calls for darkness or dusk to settle , but night refuses to fall and the falsely greenish glow of day lingers long after the sun appears to have sunk beneath the horizon . The loch was not moving , for the tide was slack . A heat mist covered it so that it seemed less a body of water and more a low-lying cloud through which extended the barren rocky mountainsides and peaks rising from the opposite shore . To the north MacDhui could see the lights of Inveraray and the crown of The Cobbler , that massive mountain barring the road to the Trossachs , colored by an afterglow . It was the hour of stillness , but the scene had nothing to say to the disturbed and unhappy man who walked with such violencethat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ease or relief from the events of the day . And a good deal of his temper stemmed from the fact that these exacerbations should have happened to him , for by and large he consideredp112himself a good man and not deserving of the attentions of illintentionedfate , or just plain bad luck . Since he did not believe in God , he must needs ascribe it to one of these , or else face the fact that he brought it all upon himself , and such acknowledgementswere not for Andrew MacDhui . At last he walked himself into a more quiet state . His passions cooled and he turned his footsteps homeward , telling himself that this was in all likelihood not the first time there had been a row between a father and a child ; by morning it would have all blown over ; she would have forgotten it and things would again pursue their normal course.  |p113My  name is Bast-Ra . I am the cat goddess of Bubastis . My other titles are " Lady of the East " and " Lady of Sept , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Sept . And I am known as Sekhmet-Bast-Ra , the tearer and renderer , destroyer of Apophis , the evil serpent at the foot of the celestial tree . My father is Ra , the sun , my mother Hathor , the moon . Nut the sky goddess is my sister ; my brother Khonsu , exorciser of evil spirits . I am a most powerful and important deity . I was goddess in the temple of Khufu in the year 1957 of the Twelfth Dynasty , and the thirteenth in the reign of Sesostris I , may his ka never grow less . And when I died , my mummy was wound round and round with plaited linen ribbons , and dyed one red , the other blue ; a mask was made for my head , with golden eyes and whiskers of golden wire and the ears stiffened so that they stood up as they had when I was alive and worshiped and called sweet and dear , and holy and all powerful . The coffin case in which my mummy was placed was of carved sandalwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life so that when my priestesses looked upon it they wept and said , " That is indeed Bast the Beautiful , our beloved , " for so I was known . And the coffin was painted in lemon yellow and whitep114and cinnabar , for such was my coloring of mottled lemon and madder , with white feet and breast and with green eyes , and thereforethe eyes of the coffin were two emeralds . Harps and trumpets played and the sound of the sistra were heard above the weeping ; the priests shaved their heads and eyebrows when they brought me to my vault , but my ka ascended and remained in the keeping of Isis-Hathor , lady of heaven . I was born and lived a goddess . I died . I was resurrected and born again . The months of my festivals in Bubastis were April and May , and in my honor the inhabitants of the city gathered in a great fleet of ships with banks of oars flashing in the sunlight ; the boats were painted blue and crimson and the sails dyed in purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed with gold and silver , all , all in my honor , so great a goddess was I.And as they sailed up the two branches of the Nile that enclosedmy island city , they played upon drums and tabors and castanets , the heavenly voices of my priestesses rose above the silvery shivering of the sistra . And I , within the sanctuary of my temple , waited and dozed and slept and dreamed those dreams that were to become the destinies of men , spinning those strands that enmeshed them from the cradle to the grave . For I was and am Bast , the living goddess . My temple was the most graceful of all those in the city , and light and airy , with the inner court surrounded by a grove of trees whose branches gave cool and pleasant shade . My temple buildings were more than two hundred yards long and the same in width and the columns of my inner sanctuary were of porphyry . My priestesseswere chosen from the most beautiful and pure maidens of Bubastis and they served me night and day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small stone house . I have but one priestess . Her name is Lori . She has not the beauty of my twelve priestesses of the Nile , for her skin is fair ,  |p115her  eyes as light as mine , and her hair the color of the copper ingots that used to lie gleaming on the wharf at Bubastis . But she is kind and sings to me beautifully . I am in a different country and a different era . It is 3914 years since last I dwelt on earth . It is the year 1957 once more , the fourth of the reign of the great Queen Elizabeth II in the ninth Dynasty of Great Britain . I live in the cold northland of Scotland . It is here in a forest hut by a brook close to an arm of the salt sea that my ka has been returned to me and I live again . The others of our household do not believe in me and laugh when I tell them I am a goddess . Even my name is changed , for my priestess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still dream the dreams of the destinies of men and spin the strands of fate by which they are ensnared . And someday they will know my power here as they did in my first incarnation by the banks of the Nile . It is a curious thing to be a goddess , all knowing , all powerful  --  and to be a cat as well . Sometimes in my temple sanctuary in Bubastis I used to laugh softly to myself at the cleverness of men . Oh , so , so clever ! They walk erect , they use their hands and wear clothes ; they have inventedspeech and writing , they can send messages from afar , fight wars , sail the waters , ride the land , store up food and wealth and rule the earth , and yet they prayed to us . For all of their being men and lords of the earth , they came a-begging to us of favors , burned incense to us , brought us gifts , sang to us and danced and staffed us with priests and servants . ' When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trumpets braying , when I smelled the incense from afar and heard the measured tramp of feet and the voices raised in songs of praise , and thought ahead to the address of the supplicant ; " Oh , great Goddess Bast , oh , Bast-Ra , oh , great Sekhmet-Bast-Ra , child of the gleaming lady of heaven , protector of thy heavenly father the sun , oh , perfumed one , wondrous one , look with favorp116upon this humble supplicant and grant him this one prayer --  " it was hard for me to repress a snigger . But at other times , deep in my heart , I pitied them . For it must be painful to be at once so great and yet so small , to be lord of all and yet master of nothing , to walk the earth as conqueror and yet never for a moment to live without fear . But I , Bast-Ra , feared no one or nothing because I was a goddess and lived in a shrine , and because of me , all cats in the land might walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished by death , imprisonment or banishment , for those were times when men were wiser and trod softly in the presence of their superiors . In the days of my godhood when even my father the sun god Ra was referred to as The Great Cat , I represented the beneficent powers of the sun ; I concerned myself with the fertility of the fields and the fertility of women ; I was beauty and voluptuousness ; the hieroglyph for my name was the picture of a jar of perfume ; I comforted those maddened by the moon and contended with the desert jackal for the soul of the world . For the jackal is a liar and the Dog of Evil . Our world was directed by the gods of which I was one , and not a bird , not a lamb might be injured without justice being visited upon the perpetratorfor his violence . In the eternal struggle between good and evil , those who believed in the gods knew that in the end virtue must triumph and we must win . Storms darkened the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , yet in the end the sun returned and sailed its bark across the arc of the sky , the moon and the stars came out again , and all was right with the world once more . Those were the days of my power , when I could blast , forgive , arrange , preordain , punish , reward , grant favors and protection , produce sunshine for picnics and moonshine for lovers , when men swore " By Great Bast , " and I could work wonders when I felt so inclined.  |p117All  this seems changed now and my powers are diminished , for no one believes that I am a god or worships me or prays to me , not even Lori , though she loves and serves me and in her way performs those rites of morning and evening that I require . To remain a god , to keep the god-power , people must believe you are and that you hold it , as they did when I reigned in the temple of Khufu in far-off Bubastis . There was in us all , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow , as well as us cats , the sacredness which gave us the Power to be not as man or beast , but as God , the power to hearken to the groans of man , his fear and despair , and twist the skein to alter the threads of his destiny . For so he believed . We lived , we died , we gods and goddesses , but the Power stayed and so will remain as long as there is yet one who believes and calls upon it . It was strange that my priestess Lori did not know me for who and what I was , for she was a human whom the Power once at some time had touched . She lived more in my world than in hers . It was the world of little beasts to whom she was nurse , mother , friend , and priestess , serving them . Like us , Lori saw and communed with things out of the past , the little forgotten creature-gods that once had been man 's friend and allies on earth , elves and pixies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brownies and kobolds , nixies and sprites , faeries and things of the air , visible and invisible . And she saw and conversed , too , with that new heavenly host , angel and archangel , cherub , cherubim , and seraphim . Besides which , my Lori was a weaver . She spun wool into thread and gathered the thread into skeins , the skeins she wove upon her hand loom into cloth , and the cloth she returned to the sheep farmers and herders up in the hills and they gave her food in exchangeand enough money for her needs and sometimes they brought her things for the hospital where she tended the sick and injured beasts who came to her , or that she found in the woods ;  |p118bandages  and medicines , and simple grease and tallow from which she made the salves and unguents that she used out of the herbs she found and collected in the forest . In Lori 's household , in Inveranoch of Argyllshire , Scotland , in the summer of the year 1957 , I , Bast-Ra , goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1957 before the coming of the Christ god , I set up my sanctuary and entered into my temple again . I remember the day when my ka descended from heaven out of the hands of Hathor and entered a body once more , and Lori brought me forth . She set me down before the little stone cottage that was to be my temple and said to the others , " Here is a new friend for you , she shall be called Talitha . " The others were very ordinary beasts , three cats , a kitten or two , a jackdaw , a mangy Scots terrier , an old sheep dog , a hedgehog and a squirrel . The cats spit at me , the dogs barked , the jackdaw screeched , the hedgehog rolled himself into a ball , and the squirrel chattered and scolded . Lori said , " Come , t is no ' a kind way to welcome a stranger . Are ye not ashamed of yourselves ? " One of the cats , the yellow Tom with a scarred face , whose name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Wullie , a plain-looking ordinary black with no breeding whatsoever , but who was the oldest there , remembered something of manners and came forward and said , " Well then , before we welcomeyou , who are you and where do you come from ? Also what do you want ? As you can see , there are quite a lot of us , there is hardly enough to go around now and we could do very well withoutanother , thank you . " I replied , " I am Bast-Ra the sacred , the beautiful , the lustrous and the all powerful . I am Sekhmet-Bast-Ra ; my father is the sun , my mother the moon ; his name was Amen-Ra , hers Isis-Hathor . The world rides upon the arch of my back . I am sacred and venerated and called Lady of the East . ' "  |p119The  two kittens stopped playing with their tails and ran to their mother , a long-haired tabby named Dorcas , and Wullie said , " Ca n't say I ever heard of them , but I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " The anger of the gods flamed up in me and in another instant I should have summoned Horus the falcon to plummet from the sky and peck out their livers . But I decided to give them one more chance before blasting them . I fluffed up my tail and fur and stretched to my full height . " I am Bast-Ra , the divine , goddess of Bubastis , bow down before me and worship ; pray that I do not smite you from the face of the earth , fools , blasphemers , unbelievers , prostrate yourselves , look not upon my divine countenance lest my glory blind you . " I was greeted with roars of laughter , I , the sky goddess returned to earth . They shouted with laughter , holding their sides and rolling on the ground . The magpie flapped its wings and screamed , the squirrel ran up a tree , and the dogs became hysterical , the Scotty coming at me in short rushes , pretending to nip at my tail , until , not even bothering to blast him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave him something to think about . But the others were still shouting and rolling about , thumping one another on the back and wiping their eyes . Dorcas hurried her kittens away , while making motions toward her head as though I were mad . McMurdock said , with his back suddenly arched , " You try any blinding around here , my lass , and you 'll get what for . " There was then nothing left for me to do but to blast these impious ones , shiver , shrivel , burn , and slay them and let their carcasses be fed to the sacred crocodiles . I called upon Sopdu and Anubis , Mashes and the great and fearful serpent Apophis and his brothers , Besit and Mehen , Ammut who devoured the souls of the condemned and Aden , the demon of sickness . Yet none came and nothing happened to the blasphemers.  |p120The  earth failed to open and swallow them up . They remained there unharmed , howling with sacrilegious laughter . It was my first experience with those who did not believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage , and shame when Lori settled the matter . She picked me up , saying , " Well , if they wo n't be having you or be polite , you shall be my air puss then , " and she took me inside the little temple where she dwelt and where I was the only one allowed , though I was not permitted to go abovestairs where she slept . Instead she made me a shrine in a basket by the side of the fireplace in the room next , where her loom was kept , and I accepted her as my priestess and soon busied myself to find out where I was and to what kind of life I had returned . It was a strange and very sacred place , this forest temple , for few if any humans ever seemed to come there and then only when they brought a sick dog or injured wild thing to be healed . The shepherds from the hills , and the crofters from the wild country up glen sometimes came across some little beast of field or forest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury . Then they rang the silver Mercy Bell that hung from a branch of the great covin oak that stood outside my temple , and Lori came forth to learn their needs . They seemed to be afraid of Lori as indeed they should be of one who was a priestess now devoted to a true goddess . Rarely a shepherd would stay to have a wound upon his dog 's leg or foot bound up , but mostly if they had some small wild thing they would leave it at the foot of the rope beneath the bell and vanish before Lori appeared . Lori never answered a knock at her door , or a shout , but only the silvery ringing of the Mercy Bell , which reminded me of the shivery glitter of the sistra of the priestesses , shaken in my honor in that Bubastis , removed from me by nearly four thousand years . Later Wullie , who was a most knowledgeable cat , even if plain and common , told me that Lori had found thep121bell in the woods far up in the glen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the outlaw , to warn him of the coming of the King 's men . There were three rooms on the ground floor of the stone house I called my temple ; the kitchen , then the one with the fireplace , which was my shrine , and the big bare room where the loom was kept . There was a room up the stairs , a kind of loft where Lori slept , but I was not allowed to go up there even though I was a goddess . Behind the cottage there was a small barn of stone with a slate roof and here it was that Lori had her hospital for hurt things and there were several places on the roof where the tiles were off that McMurdock showed me , where one could climb up and peer down inside and watch Lori as she tended the sick and the wounded . There was a rabbit and several shrews and field mice , some birds that had fallen out of their nests , and a young stoat that had an injured foot . There were many vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that often it is quite full . Oh yes , it is " Mac " and " Wullie " now , and even Dorcas , who is a snob , is quite friendly and lets me wash her kittens sometimes ; the dogs have learned to keep their places . I never spoke of Bubastisagain , or my godhead , and nothing more was said , even though the jackdaw would sometimes flap his wings when he saw me coming and screech , " Hi there , Goddess , old girl . " The dogs thought it was very funny , but I must say the cats rallied round and did n't even seem to mind that I lived in Lori 's house . But I knew who I was and who and what I had been and that someday I would show them my power and what a goddess can do when she is determined . The Power would return and I would spin and weave like Lori and once again twist the threads of human destiny and bind the cloth of life . My ka felt at peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lori 's house , but from what I saw of myselfp122looking into the pool made by the burn near to the house , I was beautiful and not unlike in color and markings what I had been when I was the adored of all and man 's hope and guide in my temple by the Nile . There I had inspired love in my priestesses , who , in private , when there were no priests about or temple officials , used to stroke me and cuddle me and scratch me under my chin and let me listen to their gossip , where you may be sure I learned a great many things I used in my goddess business , and this was the case with Lori too , for she spoiled and hugged me and , when she was at her loom , sang to me , for she soon learned that I loved to be sung to and was used to it . Her voice was high and sweet like the reed flutes of Bubastis and sometimes when I shut my eyes I could fancy myself back there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my worshipers come to adore and petition me . I was not unhappy in my new incarnation as Talitha . Lori was attentive and kind . There was sufficient to eat , but it was forbidden to go out and catch something even if I had wished to do so , for Lori could not bear to see harm come to any living thing and through that alone I should have recognized her as a priestess and one of us . And so , soon , my life was proceeding peacefully and happily and would have no doubt continued to do so but for the coming of the Man with the Red Beard -- p123Mr . MacDhui was marching truculently through DumreithStreet , bareheaded , thrusting through the summer drizzle , having just paid what he considered an utterly useless call upon a spinster who kept her cat in a child 's crib , when a black umbrella sailed up alongside him , and he heard the quick patter of feet attempting to fall into stride and keep pace with him . " Would you wish me to try to have a word with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminaries or greetings , and then added seemingly inconsequentially , " You know it will be time soon for her to be thinking of attending the Sunday school . " The second speech served to distract and take the sting out of the first query , and the roar that had been gathering within MacDhui deflated , since he was not sure whether he had been presented with one idea or two . " I am not at all sure I want her to attend the Sunday school , " he growled , but then considered in softer vein , " I suppose , after all , her mother would have wished it and seen to it if she were here . " And a moment later , " Confound it , man , why do you have to come a-bothering me at this time with such business ? " It had been an unhappy fortnight for Mr. Veterinary MacDhui , living as an outcast in his own house , eating his meals in the chill of his daughter 's stony glare and silence , and listening to the nervous remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not again attempted the blackmail of compelling her to ask him for food . She had called his bluff from the first and that battle was lost . None of his attempts to break her silence had succeeded . She had suffered him to bathe her , but when he demanded that she say her prayers she had sealed her lips tightly , driving him from the room in a rage . His temper was not lessened when later he heard her saying them for Mrs. McKenzie . Neverthelesshe had listened to the list presented for God 's blessing . He rather expected the omission of " Daddy , " but when he did not hear his name immediately after " Mummy in heaven " it came nevertheless as a shock . He considered prayer to be mumbo jumbo and supplication unworthy of the dignity of man . Standing there in the hallway between his room and his daughter 's , he was filled with a miserable sense of desolation and a queer fantasy of a change being made in the books of heaven , a notation that he need no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I would speak with her about , " Mr. Peddie confessed , seeing that he had disarmed his friend somewhat , " was her not talking to you . It is an unhappy affair when a father and a daughter so young are separated by a wall of silence in their own home  --  whatever the cause --  " " Whatever the cause  --  whatever the cause , " MacDhui repeated savagely , " whatever WHAT cause ? There is no cause but her own stubbornness . " He turned a frown and a glare upon the little dominie , but found the black umbrella momentarily interposed . He shouted down through it , " If I have failed , do you suppose you can do any better ? She has the stubbornness of  --  of  --  of myself , I suppose , come by honestly . You will not succeed . " " Have you tried the child with another animal ? " " Oh , aye . The other night I brought home a beautiful beast , as beasts go , a Siamese kitten , an animal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap she brushed it off onto the floor and ran screaming to Mrs. McKenzie and buried her face in her apron.  |p125She  screamed until I took the animal out of the house and put it in a cage next door . The neighbors thought , no doubt , I was taking a strap to her . It might be better perhaps if I did -- - " " You can not beat a child into loving you , " Mr. Peddie remarked . MacDhui nodded gloomily . Was love then such a tenuous thing as to be destroyed by pique or anger or disappointment ? At that moment he felt the ache in his arms for his child , and his heart was filled with longing for the wondrous softness and fragrance of the skin at her temples when he pressed his lips there . And yet he knew that when she stared at him , the eyes hard in the young face and the lips tightly pressed together lest any vagrant sound escape , he would be possessed by the black rage of frustration and hatred for this female counterpart of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wretched cat ? And it was true , the neighbors were talking . The gossips had spread the tale of the silence in the house at the end of Argyll Lane and that Veterinary MacDhui 's daughter had not spoken to her father since he had needlessly chloroformed and killed her pet cat . It just went to show , the gossips further said , that when people remarked that Mr. MacDhui was altogether too quick with the chloroform rag it was the truth ; if , indeed , he would show no mercy to his little girl 's own pet , what use to bring an animal around to him ? Besides which , he was a surly , crotchety , and ungracious man who was like to bite your head off if you so much as spoke a word . MacDhui was well aware that this was bad for business and that there had been a noticeable falling-off in clients in his waiting room as word had got around that since the affair of his daughter 's cat he was no longer paying proper attention to his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outlying farms where , if not loved , he was at least respected . Calls for his servicesp126during the past fortnight seemed to have been fewer and farther between . " I do not know  --  I do not know  --  I can not understand it . " Mr. MacDhui groaned aloud , as though his friend were not there . " I would bring the brute back to life for her if I but could "  --  and then with a sudden angry shake of his shaggy head  --  " but , by God , I would chloroform it all over again if she brought it to me in the same state --  " " Some children are lonely , " Mr. Peddie said . " It may have taken away somewhat her loneliness . " Although the minister had left unsaid the concluding thought , " She is motherless , " nevertheless MacDhui heard the sentence in his inner ear as though it had been spoken . Had he been jealous of the animal and her affection for it ? Had this made him less than careful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? Well , it was over and done with now . And a child should not be lonely with plenty of playmates . She always seemed to be about with some small fry or other from the neighborhood . He had not noticed how alone she had been since the episode of the cat , that she had lost interest in her friends and in play and each day had taken to longer periods of silent brooding . Often when Mrs. McKenzie thought she was out with Hughie Stirling or Geordie McNabb she would be off by the loch shore , sitting on the beach looking into the water , unseeing , or shut away by herself in her room , grieving for her dead . Her friends fell away too , for children are more sensitive and quick to observe changes or odd behavior in companions of their own age than are adults ; quick too , to write them off and respect their moods . After several rebuffs , when Mary Ruadh had silently shaken her head and refused to accompany them to the quay , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the manor grounds , they had ceased to come . Imperceptibly Mary Ruadh hadp127begun her withdrawal from a world that had suddenly manifested itself as harsh , cruel , and unjust . Mr. MacDhui groaned again and said aloud , " Aye , but what 's to do ? I felt certain that after a time she would tire of the game , but , if anything she seems to grow more adamant . It is as though I were not there when she regards me --  " Mr. Peddie , who did not believe in putting things off , said , " I will go and have a word with her now and see if I can get at what lies behind her behavior . " They walked in silence to the end of Argyll Lane together , where Mr. MacDhui with a final " You 'll get nowhere  --  I promise you " went into the cottage housing his hospital and dispensary , while the minister padded up the stone path next door and entered the veterinarian 's home . He found Mary Ruadh sitting on the stairs looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without , but within . Also he was surprised to see how pale she was and she seemed to have lost weight as well . Certainly she was not the healthy , cheerful child he had seen over a fortnightbefore , holding her sick cat . Mr. Peddie put aside his hat and umbrella with gravity of demeanor , eschewing forced cheerfulness , and went and sat down a few steps below her . A father , with a brood of his own , he was familiar with some of the intricacies of a child 's mind , though not all . He opened with the safe gambit of the weather . " F0000sh , " he sighed , " will this mizzle of summer 's rain never end ? It keeps a parson 's clothes from drying and makes little girls stay indoors . Would n't you like to come over to our house and blow bubbles with Fiona and my young Andrew ? " He could see upon her the struggle to return and from how far , how very far away she seemed to have to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dream and stepped through them she regarded him solemnly and wordlessly and silently shook her head in the negative.  |p128Looking  up at her , Mr. Peddie suddenly felt himself indescribablymoved at the sight of this small , plain , red-haired Mary Ruadh , a little girl sitting alone upon the stairs in a stone house with no dolls at her side , no companions , and no four-footed friends . And because he was himself an instrument , he was astonished to find himself in the presence of that deep soul-sickness which heretofore he had encountered only in adults and which he was attuned to perceive , as some doctors can enter a sickroom and diagnose the illness by the atmosphere . " Mary Ruadh , " the round little man said , kindly but seriously , " I know that you are grieving sore for your cat Thomasina --  " The child 's stare turned quickly to a hostile glower . Then she looked away from him , but Mr. Peddie continued , " I recall Thomasina almost as though she were here at the foot of the steps . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not you shall tell me so . " Mary Ruadh looked back at him tentatively , unsure , but with this much of her attention he began : " She was so long "  --  holding his hands to illustrate  --  " so wide , and so high and her fur was the color of mixed ginger and honey biscuits in alternating stripes , but on her chest she had a pure white blaze in the shape of a triangle , something like this --  " and he made one with his fingers . Mary Ruadh shook her head decisively . " It was round  --  like this ! " The dominie nodded . " Now that I reflect and you remind me , it was round , and she had three white feet --  " " Four . " " And a white spot at the very tip of her tail --  " " Yes , but a little one --  " " Very well , then , " Peddie continued . " Her head was most beautifully formed , and her ears were rather delicate and pointed and large for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look most alert and knowing . "  |p129The  child was watching him closely now , taking in every word , checking every point . Her expression had softened . Color had come back to her pale cheeks and her eyes were alive again . " Now her nose . How well I seem to remember her nose ; it was the color of the terra-cotta tile on the roof of the vestry and there was one little speck of black on it . " " Two , " corrected Mary Ruadh , and held up two fingers with a triumphant and dimpled smile . " Um , yes , two , " admitted Mr. Peddie . " I seem to see the other now just a little to the south of the first one , but hardly to be noticed unless one looked most carefully . And now we come to her eyes . Do you remember her eyes , Mary Ruadh ? " She nodded excitedly but waited for him to go on with the description . He said , " Surely they were the most beautiful thing about Thomasina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And her tongue was the most delectable pink , just the color of my polyantha roses when they first begin to bud in the spring . I remember once seeing her sitting opposite you at your tea table at a tea party , with a white napkin about her neck and with just the tip of her tongue showing . I said to myself , Hullo ! Thomasina has been eating my polyantha and one of the petals is still showing . ' " Mary Ruadh laughed so that Mrs. McKenzie , at a sound that had been too long absent from that house , stuck her head through the kitchen door to see . " But it was n't . It was her tongue all the time , " the little girl cried . Peddie nodded . " Did n't I feel the fool when I found it out . And I do remember what perfect manners she had , how she sat up like a real lady at the table , not a-lapping of her cambric tea until she was bidden , and when you offered her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting it . " " She liked caraway cakes the best , " Mary Ruadh commented , and then asked , " Why did she bump them ? "  | " Well , " the minister replied reflectively , " you may have your choice . Either she was smelling of them first as a kind of precautionarymeasure , not a very polite thing to do at a company tea , or she was being most polite , and each bump meant , For me ?  --  Oh , but you are TOO kind !  --  Ah well , then , if you really insist . . . . ' " " She was being polite , " Mary Ruadh decided , with a firm and knowing shake of her head . " And I remember also how beautifully she moved , how lithe and graceful her long body was and how relaxed when you wore her around your neck sometimes , almost as though she were asleep . " " Thomasina slept with me in my bed at night , " Mary Ruadh said . The glow had spread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private call to you , what it sounded like ? I heard it once when I passed your house and you were both without and she wished for your attention . " Mary Ruadh thought deeply , a fist pressed under her small rounded chin , and then gave more than a passable imitation of the seldom heard love call of the late Thomasina : " PLLLLLILLiow . " " Yes , " Mr. Peddie agreed , " it was PnnlLarrrow ! ' exactly . And so you see , Mary Ruadh , Thomasina is not really dead at all . We have reassembled her , you and I , and here she is before us both again as large as life . " The child fell silent again as she stared at him , her young brow furrowed beneath the lock of ginger hair that fell over it , not quite comprehending . " She lives on , " the minister explained , " in your memory and mine . Do n't you see that as long as you and I are here to think of her and remember her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ever die ? You have but to close your eyes to see her . No one can ever take this memory from you , and sometimes when you are in bed asleep at night , she will come to you in your dreams , only tenp131times more beautiful and loving than she was before . Come , close your eyes and tell me ; do you not see her now as we have described her ? " Mary Ruadh screwed up her eyes and her face with the effort . She said , " Yes . " Nevertheless when she opened them she looked into those of Mr. Peddie with a clear and direct gaze and said quite simply , " But I want her . " The minister nodded and said , " Of course , and now that you have learned how , you have but to call her to your mind and she will come . When you are older , Mary Ruadh , you will know love of a different kind , and bereavement and grief and all that is a part of the difficult journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what I have been trying to tell you today  --  that there is no wound of sorrow and mourning so great that loving memory can not help to heal it . Do you think you understand this , Mary Ruadh ? " This time the child did not reply but only regarded him solemnly . Mr. Peddie then ventured to the crux of the matter . He said , " Thomasina lives in your father 's mind as in yours and mine . If you were to put your arms about his neck and give him an oldfashionedwhisper that you loved him , you and he could remember Thomasina together just as you and I have done and that would make the memory picture even brighter , for he would perhaps remember things we have left out --  " The child gave this suggestion a moment 's grave consideration and then shook her head slowly and firmly in the negative . " I ca n't , " she declared , " Daddy 's dead ! " Taken aback , it was now Mr. Peddie 's turn to stare at this strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was shocked at the sudden and unexpected turn the conversation had taken . " But , Mary Ruadh ! How can you say such a thing . Your father is not dead . . . . "  | " Yes , he is , " the little girl insisted gravely and unemotionally , and then added succinctly , " I killed him . " " Ah , " said Mr. Peddie softly  --  for he was beginning to see which way the wind was blowing  --  " That was not very kind . How did you kill your daddy ? " Mary Ruadh reflected the precise details , savoring them again with a pleased and slightly malevolent expression on her face and gave them to the nonplused minister , who was beginning to suspect that in spite of being a father and a minister of the gospel , his understanding of child psychology left something to be desired . " I put him on a long white table , " she narrated , " and poured something out of a bottle onto a rag and held it over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on him and held the rag there until he did n't wriggle anymore , but was dead . Then I put him out on the dust heap , but later I put him in a basket lined with silk and put on my mournings and we all went and buried him and Jamie Braid played the lament , but I was glad he was dead and did not cry at all . " The Reverend Peddie tried once more . " Then who is this man who comes home in the evening and sits across the table from you with his heart breaking because you will not greet him , or speak to him , or kiss him good night ? " he asked . Mary Ruadh reflected on this question seriously for a moment before she replied , " I do n't know , " and then added with unequivocalfinality , " I do n't like him . " Angus Peddie , who in his youth had been a considerable sports enthusiast and player of games , knew when he was beaten and also how to accept defeat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieving his hat and umbrella . Then going to her , he said , " Perhaps we will talk about this further some other time , Mary Ruadh , " and gently kissed the pale cheek , nor did she try to avoid his doing so , and he took his leave . But he noted and remembered that the paleness had returned top133the face and the lackluster quality of the deep blue eyes and that when he had last looked back upon her she had looked not like a child but a little bowed old lady , and he made up his mind to suggest to Andrew MacDhui to have a word with Dr. Strathsay the next time he saw him , to suggest that he drop by , perhaps , and have a look at the child just in case there was something organic troubling her as well . Mr. Peddie was a well-read man and knew something of the severity of the traumas that could result from imagined as well as genuine catastrophies . A young lady of seven who on one and the same day had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had revengedherself by the mental murdering of her father , might understandablyrequire the services of the family physician , if only to ascertain the extent of the damage done . The veterinary , however , was not in his office when the minister stopped by to tell him the results of his attempt and confess his failure , having gone out to a back-country call , and thus other matters intervened and in the end old Dr. Strathsay was not summoned until it was too late.  |p134I  Andrew MacDhui soon was left in no doubt that gossip about him and the affair of his daughter 's cat was all about Inveranoch and hurting his business with the locals . Now a hush would fall upon a knot of gabblers in front of the post office when he entered or left , or at the chemist 's ; he was conscious of drawing looks askance and could hear the whispers when his back was turned . Some of them reached to his ears and were to the effect that if he could not or would not cure his own child 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was supposed to be and a pity to take one 's own dear little thing to him , only to have him recommend to put it away . And furthermore , if his own child would neither speak to him nor have any dealings with him in his own home , as everyone knew was the case , there must be something very black indeed about the man and even more than met the eye at first . Irritation , anger , shame , and frustration had further caused a deterioration in the behavior of MacDhui toward his clients and patients and made him the more truculent , bullying , shorttempered , and argumentative . He spoke in even a louder , more rasping tone and seemed to be looking for veiled insults or allusionsin the most innocent remarks , until even the summer visitors thought him a most peculiar and unpleasant man , but since there was no other veterinarian within miles , they had to bear with himp135when their dogs acquired summer mange or suffered a sting from an insect or a bite from some bad-tempered local animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the townspeople who knew of the woman known as Daft or Mad Lori who lived by herself as a recluse up in the glen , talked with the Little Folk and the angels and had a way with winged and four-footed creatures that assuredly was not quite of this earth . Hence the silver Mercy Bell attached to the covin oak outside the little cottage rang more frequently now , as former clients of the animal doctor made the pilgrimage to the lair of the so-called Red Witch of Glen Ardrath . And thus inevitably , through whispers of these pilgrimages , Daft Lori swam into the ken of Andrew MacDhui as either a rival or a nuisance who must be dealt with . He had heard of her , of course , but merely as a kind of local character , boasted of by the town , like Rab McKechnie , who when sufficiently drunk could recite the poetry of Bobby Burns from memory by the hour and would take it into his head to do so outside the Queen 's Arms , his favorite pub , or old Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and string . Lori had long been accepted as a kind of fixture and curiosity , about whom no one really bothered except to regale a visitor with the story of the witchwoman who dwelled in a wild glen up the mountainside , who conversed with the spirit , understood the language of the animals , and frightened little boys and girls , who mortally feared to approach anywhere near to her cottage . Occasionally such a visitor shopping in the grocer 's or chemist 's or dry-goods emporium might encounter a quiet young woman with red hair and wide-spaced greenish eyes , plain-seeming , but if one looked again , revealing a great sweetness of expression , withoutever guessing or even surmising that this might be the Red Witch herself , Daft Lori McGregor down from the hills on one ofp136her rare excursions into town to lay in needed supplies for herself and her four-footed companions and patients . But Mr. MacDhui had never encountered her , for Inveranoch was a largish town and their paths were unlikely to cross . Nor had he ever felt any curiosity about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who live close to them . But now it was whisper , whisper , whisper . A word dropped here , or there , snatches of gossip picked up by large-eared Willie Bannock , whose loyalty to his employer remained undimmed , snatches of sentences overheard . " Oh , aye , there 's nae doot she has a way wi ' the wee beasties . The touch o ' her hand to its head is enough to set an old dog a-dying to frisking like a pup , " or , " They say she 's a powerful one wi ' spells , and dangerous if crossed "  --  and again  --  " Ring her silver bell o ' maircy and she 'll nae turn a sick animal frae her door , nor will she have so murkle 's a farthing for her pains . The wild beasts of the forest feed frae her hauns .... " Mr. MacDhui thought of these things with waxing indignation as he drove his jeep on one of his back-country rounds of sanitary inspection , passing the gypsy encampment that still remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smoke rose into the misty morning air from the horseshoe of wagons and caravans drawn up at one end of the field , brightly colored garments fluttered from wash lines , and a farrier was shoeing a horse , for MacDhui could hear the distant metallic beat of his hammer . At one end of the encampment was a row of wagons that had been converted into cages for the containment of wild animals , but as yet there appeared to have been no attempt made to exhibit them . The gypsies apparently had been making character with the police , at any rate there had been no complaints . The women told fortunes with greasy packs of tarot cards ; others derived an income from the sale of tin and copper utensils , at which , as followers ofp137the ancient gypsy trade of Calderai or tinkers , they were adepts . The townspeople remained aloof and suspicious , but the summer trippers , failing to observe the dirt and primitive cruelty and bestialitybehind the color of the encampment seen against the stark Highland background , thought them romantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MacDhui looked dourly upon the encampment ; he had no use for foreigners and they were dirty . Besides , through gossip with the farmers in the neighborhood , he knew more about this band probably than did the police . There was a bear trainer in their midst , a big , drunken brute of a fellow , probably a descendant of those gypsies known in the Balkans as bear drivers , and characterizedusually by their cruelty to their animals , and later they were planning to give some sort of show or performance to lure the summer visitors , judging they were far enough out of town not to attract the attention of the police . Whatever , it was none of MacDhui 's business . If the police were up to their duty , he felt they would have cleaned out the nest long ago , denied them permission to camp , and sent them on their way to infest some other community . But shortly thereafter occurred the incident which drove all reflections upon gypsies from his mind and furnished him at last with out-and-out corroborationof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the witchwoman who was said to have a way with sick animals and was not averse to practicing . On a rocky trail between Glen Ardrath and Bannockstyle , a farm hamlet further up in the hills , the veterinary encountered a tow-polled gad boy employed by one of the farmers , driving a curve-horned , dappled Ayrshire cow ahead of him with prods of a long gad pole cut from an ash sapling . MacDhui pulled up his jeep , leaned therefrom , and addressed the boy in the vernacular : " Hello there , young Jock . Where are ye gaun wi ' Fermer Kinkairlie 's Roselle , " MacDhui knew thep138name , pedigree , and markings of every cow , bull and plow horse in the district . The boy stopped likewise and gave the veterinarian that cold , unswerving Highland gaze indicative of that independence that considers any question an intrusion . After reflection he decided to reply , for as a matter of fact he was more than a little uneasy because of his errand and glad of a chance for a word with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yin milchkye 's gone off . She wis drony last nicht and this mairnen Fermer Kinkairlie says her clushets are as dry as a toom whuskey bottle and nae mair to be had frae yin than the ither . " MacDhui snorted . " Did ye think then to restore her by running her aboot the country like a fox hunter ? I am well come then and will have a look at what ails the beast . " The lanky , straw-headed gad boy looked alarmed as MacDhui made preparations to descend from the jeep with his bag and backed to the cow . " Na na ! " he cried , " ' T is not you that 's wanted . I 'm tae lead her tae the Red Witch o ' the glen , says the fermer , for what 's to do , and he 's gi'en me the siller to pay her . ' Twill be bogle-wark , I do n't doot , and I 'm no much of a one for dealins wi ' the evil eye . D'ye ken this Daft Lori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Outrage exploded in a roar from MacDhui . " Faugh ! Are ye all daft yersel 's ? Has Fernier Kinkairlie taken leave of his senses ? Yell draw pints o ' beer from yin kye 's clushets sooner than a drap o ' milk from the word o ' some loony auld spaewife back in the glen ! " A stubborn look came into the lad 's face . " Awecl , I ken ony what the fernier said . I 'm nae ower liking the errand mysel ' ! I 'll make the sign so , a ' the time I 'm in her sight --  " and he made a fist , with his thumb and little finger extended . MacDhui bawled , " Be off with you . I 'll call in and have a wordp139with the fermer and we 'll see who 's to be called for ailing beasts about here  --  " Farmer Kinkairlie was a rugged , stocky man with one of those large shaggy heads that looked too large for the body it topped . He was a pipe-sucker and a **25;10604;TOOLONG kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was not afraid to speak out . MacDhui , when he wheeled his jeep angrily into the forecourt of the farm where he found him hosing down his cow byre in sanitary enough fashion , accomplished nothing with abuse , shouting , and threats . " Mon , " Farmer Kinkairlie admonished the irate veterinarian , " yell bairst a blood veesal wi ' sic choler . " He let the smoke of his pipe curl up about his head while he contemplated MacDhui , continuing , " Yon coo nae has ony disease reportable under the Acts of the county . ' T is a matter between me and her whaur I send her when her milk fails . " MacDhui , calming some manner beneath the man 's demeanor , said , " Yer richt , Kinkairlie  --  I had no cause to shout at ye . But I do n't know what 's got into you all of a sudden , all of you . You 've been glad enough of my services in the past , without turning the pages back to medieval superstition and sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The farmer was not mollified . He sucked at his pipe for so long that MacDhui thought he was never going to speak . Finally he said , " Aweel , Meester MacDhui , times change . Pairhops they 're changing back again . For yin thing , they 're no ' so altered that I let any mon come here and tell me my business , no more do I pit my nose in yours . If you see onything here to rant aboot , sanitarywise , speak up , otherwise I 'll thank ye to remove yer presencefrom the premises , since I have nae sent for ye  --  " For an instant , MacDhui towered over the smaller farmer , a burly , menacing figure , red beard thrust forward , knotted fists thrust into the pockets of his leather jacket , eyes glaring . But thep140little man stared him back , and in another moment MacDhui felt that pipe smoke would be blown into his face , so he left off , turned on his heel , packed himself into his jeep , and roared forth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highlanders and no use wasting your breath upon them , once their minds were made up . However the woman known as Daft Lori was another matter and with her MacDhui meant to deal as swiftly as might be . When he entered his surgery Willie Bannock was busied with preparing sections for microscopic examination and had nothing to say . MacDhui scrubbed himself , donned his white coat , and thrust his head in through the door of the waiting room , but there was no one there but the Reverend Mr. Peddie with his pug dog Fin , who was wheezing , belching , and rolling up the whites of his eyes in his usual distress . The roly-poly little minister was himself looking sheepish and ill at ease to be back with his pet . MacDhui waved his friend inside the surgery , frowning at the empty waiting room , unaware of the incongruity of his emotions ; he was angry when it was full , and now put out when it was empty . He did not chaff Peddie this time but automatically reached up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth to tell , he was glad to see his friend , for he felt that if anyone were able to tell him something about the mysterious woman who lived in the glen , it would be the minister . He and Peddie had not encountered one another since the week before , when the dominie had briefly reported his failure to move or influenceMary Ruadh and had suggested that MacDhui let time take its course for the moment and in the meantime have the child looked over by the local practitioner as a precautionary measure . The veterinarian had taken the first bit of advice but not the second . MacDhui came at once to the crux of the matter he had so definitely established that day . " See here , Angus , " he said , " dop141you know anything about a half-witted woman by the name of Lori , who lives somewhere up in the glen and pretends she is a witch ? " The minister sat down . He had been expecting this query for some time . Now that it had come he hoped he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before he replied he uncorkedthe bottle and trickled a little of the liquid into the side of his dog 's mouth to ease its gastric disturbance , patting its back and round stomach until it brought up a resounding belch , which brought a smile of relief to the little clergyman 's face as well as to the wrinkled black countenance of the dog . Some of the sweetness of the smile still lingered at his lips as he replied , " I do not think she is half-witted , Andrew . Withdrawn , perhaps , in the modem sense of one who has found a world that is preferable to our own . And certainly she is no witch . " " Ahl Then you do know of her . Well , there must be some reason she is known as Daft Lori . And whatever , she is practicing veterinary medicine without a license and it must cease . This morning I encountered one of my clients sending a cow to her for a spell to cure dried-up clushets . And I suppose you did not fail to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I believe this woman is responsible . " For all his experience in dealing with human beings , Peddie was baffled as to how to remove the scales from the eyes of one who was so willfully blind to his own failings and shortcomings . To show him the truth would only lose him a friend . He saw the gulf between his MacDhui and himself over this point not so much as a flaw in character as rather a classic example of the difficultiesto be compounded through living in an accident-created pilotless world rather than a God-created and directed one . To Mr. Peddie , who was a profound theologist as well as a simple man , atheism carried its own punishment the unbeliever seemed almost to be carrying about a built-in rod . But he knew too wellp142that this was no time to voice such an opinion . And so he asked merely , " What is it you propose to do ? " " The simplest thing , I suppose , would be to turn her over to the police , or make a complaint to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterinary as well as human , without a license . " Mr. Peddie for the first time looked uncomfortable . " Dear me , " he said , " I think that might be most ill-advised . Lori , you know , has never taken a penny for anything she has ever done to help anyone . I should not , if I were you , appeal to the police . " The stubborn chin came out . " And why not ? Is there a law , or is there not ? Is a man to give a lifetime to study and work to be undermined by some creature who takes it into her head to spoil and pamper animals , or brews stinks out of herbs ? I think not . " Mr. Peddie sighed . " The law is indeed the law . That has always been the trouble with it . But you see , the police happen to think highly of Lori because she is a good woman , a really good person , and in the line of their duties they come in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prejudiced . . . . " " You mean they would refuse to do their duty when called upon ? " " Oh no . Not our police . They are staunch men with a true Scots sense of duty , only --  " " Only what ? If I charged this woman with ... " " Yes , yes , of course . But let me put it to you this way . " Here Mr. Peddie paused to gather Fin to him , holding the pug dog upside down and cradled in his arms like a baby , or a small , blackfacedpig , and no one could have managed to look more ridiculous , the white eyes of the dog , rolling adoringly out of the background of the minister 's dark clothing , the legs spraddled wide as Peddic gently massaged his stomach , and yet such was the man 's presencep143and inner gentleness , that no one but he could have managed to look so unridiculous as he outlined his parable . " Mrs. Clachan says to her neighbor Mrs. Culross , " T is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , Mrs. Culross : I can hardly get around on my two legs to do my work from the misery of it  --  and all the washing piling up . ' Mrs. Culross asks , Look you , Mrs. Clachan ; have you ever tried Evans ' mixture ? It 's the grand cure for just such a complaint as you are speaking of . Six months ago when I felt a chill coming on , it had me on my feet in no time . I believe I still have a half bottle of it in the cupboard beneath the stairs . Let me fetch it for you . ' " Mr. Peddie turned his dog over and moved his massage to the end of the spine whence the corkscrew tail began bringing a look of most ineffable bliss to the animal 's face . He continued : " She does so and Mrs. Clachan , who was suffering from nothing more serious than a severe case of washing piling up , partakes of some of the mixture , feels her stomach warmed and her head slightly addleddue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets on with it , cured . Is Dr. Strathsay to bring a suit against Mrs. Culross for practicing medicine without a license ? " He paused for a moment to let the idea percolate through his friend 's skull and then concluded , " No , friend Andrew , you would not look well in court , bristling and blustering against a woman who , the police would report , had done no more than help out a lonely shepherd or crofter with a sick or injured animal or given some child or woman advice about a dog or cat that needed worming . " MacDhui snorted , half in acquiescence , half in disgust . " Yes , yes , " he said , " I suppose you are right . Women are always objects of sentimental favoritism . Well , then you must go since you know her so well . " " Oh , " Mr. Peddie replied , " as for that  --  I do not know her at all well . No one does . "  | " Eh , what ? But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from somewhere , or have some story --  " Mr. Peddie mused for a moment and murmured half to himself , " Must everyone ? " and then answered , " I suppose in a way they must , but it seems a pity . Her name is Lori McGregor . The crofter 's cottage and barn in the glen had been deserted for years . She came there one day , but no one knows from where  --  or ever asks . She is a weaver . Perhaps she is one of the last of the fates , separated from her sisters --  " MacDhui snorted again . " Well , you 're just the one then to reasonwith her . These psychotics will often hearken to a dominie where --  " Mr. Peddie sighed and shook his head sadly . " I hoped you would see , " he said , " why I will not go . I will not interfere with Lori in any way or attempt to penetrate the sphere in which she lives . She strikes me as one who has looked upon our world and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts are other than ours ; her devotion is to the service of helpless things that are ill or hurt . She is what the French would call une vraie religieuse . ' There are not many left on earth . " MacDhui , whose patience was exhausted , said savagely , " All of whom were more than half mad , your religieuses --  Well , then , I trust you will have no objection if I go and deal with this woman personally and put an end to her interfering with my business and the business of the district . " Angus Peddie reflected , sitting on the edge of his chair , cuddling and scratching his dog , his mind awhirl with the problems set by MacDhui 's proposal . And yet he thought that he saw , or rather felt , a possible pattern and considered it his duty to warn his friend . He rose to his feet , setting the dog on the floor , clamped his hat onto the back of his head while he regarded MacDhui earnestly . " No , " he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butp145you know , Andrew , I should be careful if I were you . You may come into the greatest danger if you were to go ! " MacDhui exploded . " Danger ! Danger ? Are you mad yourself , Angus ? Explain yourself , man --  " For the first time the minister looked embarrased . " I --  " he began and then hesitated , leading MacDhui to say impatiently , " Well , well --  " " You must not be irritable with me when I bring in my God , " Peddie replied . " God , you see , is my business and my vocation . It is in a way as if I were to fly off the handle every time you mentioned that you were going to vaccinate for blackleg , or inoculate lambs against dysentery . " MacDhui said nothing but waited for him to go on . " Lori , I think is very close to God . Her life is the manner inwhich she worships and loves God  --  that is all .... " " And what danger would I be running , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog and his medicine and replied , " Of coming to love God too . " Then , tucking Fin beneath his arm , he pattered out . But no sooner had he closed the door than he popped his head back inside again . " Should you decide to risk it , " he said , " it will not do to go to Lori 's door , for she will not open to you or to anyone . But there is a bell with a rope attached to a covin-tree , a large oak that stands before her house . It is rung by humans and sometimes , I understand , even animals who have need of her . It is called the Mercy Bell . " MacDhui glared . " I 'm damned if I do . What need have I --  ? " The little man 's eyes glittered curiously at this and he did not mince words this time . " If ever a man had need of mercy , it is you , Andrew MacDhui , " he said , and went out , closing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bubastis , now called Talitha , remember the day of the coming of the Man with the Red Beard . I saw him first as in a vision , striding through a dream of proph-ecywith flaming hair , for I , Sekhmet-Bast-Ra , the lady of Sept , have first , second , and third sight . And I cried out aloud in the night of the doom-dream , " Death ! Death ! Death and doom await the slayers of cats ! He is Duamutef , son of Horus , brother of Anubis , the jackal of death . Red is the beard of his chin , the hair of his head , and the glare of his eyes ; red is the blood that drips from his talons and fangs ; red is the doom that envelops his ka , for he has transgressed and I , Bast-Ra , shall set the seal upon that doom . For it is writ in the Book of the Dead that whosoever causes the death of one of us shall not go unpunished . " And in the dream he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in his hands he bore a red ax of copper and there was red stain upon the blade . He came , fearful and mighty as Sopdu and even I , Bast-Ra , was filled with fear and cried out so that I awoke . I was at my fireside then in the cottage temple and the glow of the dying fire was as red as blood . In the next room I heard the sweet singing of Lori and the thumping of the loom as she finished her weaving . Even so she ceased her singing and called to me ,  | " Talitha ! Poor puss ! Have ye had a bad dream then ? Och , but ye have nowt to fear --  " and she came and lifted me up , cradled and stroked me . Yet I knew that a doom had commenced  --  perhaps Lori herself had threaded it upon her loom  --  and must go on to its appointed end . The day when I would encounter the Man with the Red Beard was not far off , and in spite of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could not take comfort . It is not easy to be a goddess and know too much . It all began next day hard by the covin-tree . Other times , other customs . Had you heard of the covin or coglan tree ? As Wullie , who explained it to me , said , " Och , any Scot , or even Scottish cat would know that . Ye can not be a true Scot , Talitha . " The covin-tree is the great oak or beech that stood in front of the manor house , or in the castle courtyard , where it spread its branches , offering shade from the sun or shelter from the rain . It is peaceful beneath its canopy . Now , Wullie explained further , it is not that the Scot is inhospitable ; far from it . When he kens you he is the most hospitable man on earth . But first  --  and danger taught him this  --  before he welcomes you within he must know who you are and what your business . And thus it was under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the traveler , and the seeker , to have a word with them as to their purpose and their antecedents , before admitting them into the house . We had such a one growing two gallops and a jump away from the front of the cottage temple , an oak that towered twice as high As any palm I knew in my ancient home and a hundred times as t hick around . The branches towered over the roof of the cottage , t heir leaves scraping the slate in a wind , and the topmost crown was yet again as high , and from that vantage point one could see far down the glen and into the fields of the valley below and even t h e smoke rising from the chimneys of the town.  |p148The  Mercy Bell , of which I have already spoken , hung from the lowest branch . To its clapper was tied a rope which fell loosely to the ground , trailing there . Sometimes the rope was tugged by a human bringing some animal in distress for my priestess to heal , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sometimes the bell was rung by the animal itself , for Lori to come forth from her weaving and help it . Oh , you who are so clever and full of knowledge about the ways of your world and know and understand so little of that realm of gods and goddesses that is mine will ridicule and scoff at the idea of an injured animal somewhere deep in the forest determiningto seek out Lori 's help . You will not believe that it could drag itself for miles through woods and across icy burns to arrive at the covin-oak before the cottage , there to ring the Mercy Bell . Yet in the days when I was God this would have surprised no one , for the beasts of the field and the birds of the air , the gods and the humans were as one brotherhood living with and for one another and sharing the knowledge of their magic and wisdom . Man saw in the winged and four-footed creatures who shared the earth with him powers that were beyond him , and worshiped them . Magic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was surprised at anything that happened , for the gods were everywhere and dwelt in every object animate and inanimate . From what I have learned since my return , the gods no longer live and magic has gone out of style . We were all about our business that pleasant summer 's morning when the Mercy Bell was touched , shivered twice in the clear air , and was still . The jackdaw came a-screaming , " Danger ! Great danger ! Beware ! " and we assembled , afluff with curiosity , I , and Mac , and Wullie , and Dorcas , with Peter the Scottie and Shep the sheep dog , to see what was toward , but with care because of the jackdaw 's warning , for Jackie was a clever bird , and we came to the covin-oak warily , as Lori appeared at the cottage door , shadingp149her eyes from the sun , and there we all saw the badger that had rung the bell . The trap was clamped about his leg , with the length of chain where the badger had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this had crossed the rope trailing to the ground from the clapper of the bell , causing it to ring . There was no magic in that part of it . The magic lay in how the badger , more dead than alive , the white of the bone showing at the shoulder and foreleg where a dog had attacked and worried it while it was trapped , had known where to come and had dragged itself perhaps more than a mile to our temple and my priestess of healing . We cats sat down at a respectful distance , for the beast was half mad with pain from its festered wounds ; there was white slaver at its mouth and its yellow teeth snapped and bit in every direction . But the dogs were beginning to yield to that hysteria which is so characteristic of them and wanted to attack and kill the badger , which might have been all for the best , since it was more than half dead anyway . But Lori ordered , " Sit . Leave him be , " and they sat . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , while the wicked teeth snicked and snacked , and in my eye of prophecy I could already see them sink into the flesh of Lori 's hand , and as she knelt at the side of the beast , I quickly put a spell upon the badger and a blessing upon Lori . Bending over , she freed the crushed hind leg from the trap and , gently lifting him up , cradled him in her arms and whisperedsomething to him . And she was safe because of my spell and my blessing . From the first touch of her fingers , stroking his panting flank , the badger had become calm . His head was fallen to one side as she held him , but his eyes were rolling like a dog 's , so that all of us could see the cream of their whites as he gazed up at Lori . She rose to her feet and carried him back to thep50stables where she tended her sick , with most of us following soberly after . Old Wullie expressed the relief we all felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a miracle Lori 's hands and arms were n't torn to shreds . " I held my peace . I had learned my lessons . As I said before ; other times , other customs . There was no use in my telling them that it was my miracle , one which , when I was an acknowledged goddess in the temple of Khufu where the Nile divided about the isle of Bubastis , I used to work all the time , keeping rivermen who worshiped me properly unharmed from the tusks of enraged hippopotami or hungry crocodiles when they upset or fell into the river . Instead , I put my tail up in a dignified manner and accompanied her to the stone building she used as her lazaret . I sat down in the doorway and watched as she gently laid the badger on the table of the room where she kept her bandages , salves , and medicines on shelves . Under it she then spread a clean white cloth , placing a basin and a sponge beside it , and then went to the kitchen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she returned with it she put it on the floor for a moment , placed one of her hands beneath the badger 's head and with the other stroked it gently , her eyes filled with love and pity . From the badger issued the saddest sound I ever heard . It squeaked . There was no more growl or snarl left in it . It was partly a whimper too , but really more a squeak . Is it not strange how quickly hate and fear can be replaced by love ? When something fierce and dangerous , of which you have reason to be afraid , is hurt so that it is rendered helpless and suddenly squeaks like a mouse , it breaks your heart . I turned my head away for an instant and washed my back furiously . ' When I looked again , the tears were falling from Lori 's eyes as she sponged the mangled leg and the awful festered wound at the shoulder where the white bone lay bare and the flesh of thep151forepaw was shredded . The shoulder was broken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tatters . As for the crushed hindquarter  --  Lori said to me , " Do you see , Talitha ? This poor beastie is sorely hurt , and me not knowing what to do for him . Look what has happened . A dog attacked him while he was caught in the trap and laid the bone bare . Yet he must have fought him and driven him off . One so brave and gallant must no ' be allowed to die . " Carefully Lori laid out fur , skin , flesh , and bones and the claws of the badger on the white cloth and bathed them tenderly . Only one eye of the brute was to be seen , but it was rolled upward towardLori and regarded her with trust and pleading . Then Lori looked once more upon the fearful injuries and shook her head , saying so sadly , " I do not know what to do , Talitha ; oh , not at all . I do not know even where to begin and he will die unless something is done . See how beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God did not send him here to me to die . " Her hands fell to her sides for a moment in despair . But soon her head was lifted in resolve , and courage came into her eyes . She turned to me and said , " We will ask then for help , Talitha , you and I. " Ah , had she but asked help of me , recognized and acknowledged my godhead , I should have had the power ; I would have made her a miracle . She came over to where I was and sat down upon the threshold , and for a moment caressed my head and back and rubbed me softly underneath the chin . Then she folded her hands in her lap and raised her eyes to the sky . Her lips moved silently ; her eyes were filled with confidence , and a smile of trust played about her mouth as she prayed . I prayed then , too , as I had been taught in the long ago , to Ra ,  |p152my  father and Hathor my mother , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mut and Nun , and even to dread Anubis to turn his face from the lintel of our door . I called upon the oldest of the gods , Khonsu and Amen-Ra the Creator of all . After a time we heard the sound of the ringing of the Mercy Bell . I gathered myself up and with two gallops , a leap , and the bound , I flew around the side of the cottage to see who or what it was had touched the silver bell for the second time that morning . And I stopped in my tracks , frozen with horror and filled with fear . My fur stood up on end and a dark ridge crept up my back from tail to crown . My ears flattened back against the side of my head . A low , angry growl came into my throat , to be replaced by the long hiss of hate . A man , a stranger , stood by the bell on the other side of the covin-tree . The sight of him filled me with loathing , disgust , and fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster who was having such a terrible effect upon me . He was huge ; huge and terrifying in aspect . He had fox-colored hair and a fox-colored beard covering his chin and wild and rolling eyes and he stood there pulling again and again upon the rope as though he would pull the Mercy Bell out of the tree . And then I knew . I had never seen him in this life before , but it was he of my doom-dream , he the red monster , the slayer of cats , upon whom lay the curse of Bubastis . Doom lay across his brow , and yet it was I who was filled to the marrow of my bones with fear . He had not yet seen me when I crossed the distance from the house to the tree with one bound and the next moment I was clawing my way up the tree , nor did I stop until I was lost in the very topmost branches , so high that I could no longer see or hear what transpired below . And there I remained until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night.  |p153Yes  , I , Bast-Ra , a goddess , succumbed to the fear of a mortal man and fled from him . Nor was I able to say why this had happened.  |p154Now  that he was there , Mr. MacDhui was beginning to feel something of a fool . During the long march up through the glen along the narrow track from the spot where he had had to park his jeep , there had been time to reflect upon what his friend Peddie had said about the figure he might cut in court . Thus the forthcoming spectacle of himself in the midst of a woods , bullying some creature who was touched in the head and hardly responsible for her actions , did not appear to him to be very attractive either . Nevertheless there was his sense of duty toward his profession , and if farmers took to sending their sick cattle or sheep to this half-witted woman , there would be an end to the discipline he had installed in the valley . But by the time MacDhui had reached sight of Lori 's cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reassert itself , defensively in a sense , for he resented the eeriness of the feeling the place gave him . He took in the silent cottage with the blinds and curtains drawn , sleeping in the cool and gloom of the forest of oak , pine , larches , and old smooth beeches , but which yet was surrounded by an intensity of wildlife , heard rather than seen , which was startling . The house slumbered at the heart of the rustle and whir of myriads of forest creatures . He glimpsed the cottontails of a pair of hares disappearing fromp155the open space in front of the house ; a squirrel scolded , hidden somewhere above his head . Birds went into nervous wheelings and chirpings , in flashes of color about the chimney and eaves at his intrusion , and something large went flapping off through the forest aisles on the slapping beat of powerful wings , laughing to itself . MacDhui paused now before the giant oak , from the lowest branch of which hung the silver bell with the pull rope tied to its clapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not march forthwith and stoutly to the door of the cottage and pound upon it with his knuckles , or yank at a bell pull if there were one , in the manner of custom and civilization . But neither the house nor its surroundings invited such brazen intrusion . Quietly and effectively it had cast its spell over him so that he did nothing but stand there , uncertain and fuming , his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his jacket . A moment later he recalled that the Reverend Angus Peddie , who believed not in witches but in an unseen , all-powerful Creator and Director of the universe , had given him directions as to how to come to grips with the woman who was the center of this little forest mystery , and thrusting his head and shoulders forward with something of his former aggressive truculence , he pulled hard upon the bell rope . The sweetness and brightness of the shivery note of the vibrating metal startled him , as well as causing the birds to whir and flutter more loudly . A roe deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment her liquid eyes stared curiously into his before she turned and galloped away . But there was no other response . Mr. MacDhui yanked again and again at the clapper rope , setting the bell to crashing and dancing . He felt , more than saw , a streak of something , some small animal that darted to the tree and for an instant , between peals of the bell , heard the dry scrabble of claws as it vanished up into the jungle of high foliage . Andp156he was in no wise prepared for the sight of the plain-looking girl with red hair who appeared suddenly from behind the crofter 's cottage and came toward him . MacDhui had gathered from his talk with Mr. Peddie that Lori was no hook-nosed old crone in the tradition of witch and simple women , but he was not prepared for her youth and simplicity  --  at first glimpse he judged her to be twenty-six , perhaps twenty-seven at the most  --  but what startled him , for its contrast with the marks of blood upon her green smock , and upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no other word for it , MacDhui decided , even at first glance , or rather this was the word he was aware of . She was not beautiful , she was not striking , but her bearing , her walk , the carriage of her head upon her shoulders , the flow of her limbs and the white arms , suggested gentleness and tenderness . He was conscious of surprise even that so plain and ordinary a person should have impressed as hardheaded a community as Inveranoch to name her the Red Witch of Glen Ardrath and led children to fear and avoid her neighborhood . And yet he was likewise aware that with her presence , all at once everything seemed to fall into perspective about the place , the feeling of many shy , inquisitive animals , unseen but present , the stirring and whirring of the many birds and even the thing that had flapped off laughing into the forest . If it was a piece from a fairy tale , it remained to be determined whether she was a good or bad fairy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came striding toward him , accompanied by what , he reflected grimly to himself , might have been her familiars , two cats , one yellow , one black , an aged sheep dog and a rollicking black Scots terrier . The red squirrel ran down the bark of the tree , flirting his tail . But be noted that the stains of blood upon her hands and smockp157were fresh , and the sight worked the needed disenchantment upon him , closing his mind to all else but the fact that if he needed any proof that she was practicing veterinary medicine without authority , here it was before him . She had apparently answered the summons of the silver bell straight from the operating table of her surgery . It needed no more to evoke all the choler and indignation he had been storing for this visit , and as she drew near but without speaking , he cried out harshly , " Are you Lori ? " " Aye . I am Lori . " Tender . Tender and gentle . It surged through his mind again as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursed and coddled his anger too long to have it thus put off by soft speaking and in voice no less harsh he rasped , " Do you know who I am ? " " No . That I do not . " He revealed it then with voice and demeanor that wanted only Jovian thunders and lightnings to accompany , and the trembling of the ground : " I am Mr. Andrew MacDhui , veterinary surgeon and sanitary officer for Inveranoch and district ! " If he expected her to be embarrassed , chagrined , or taken aback at this confrontation , another surprise awaited him . For she becamesuffused with a great joy , as one who can hardly believe her ears . A glow of relief and gratitude came into her expressive eyes , and for a moment all plainness vanished from her features as her face became illuminated from within . " Och , " she cried , with a smile of acknowledgment , " then you will have been sent in answer to my prayer . Oh , you are sair needed and very welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late --  " Mr. MacDhui suddenly found himself drained of all choler by the strangeness of this welcome . He , come to read the riot act to her , the answer to her prayers ? What manner of talk and behavior was this ? And then he thought he knew . For the moment he hadp158forgotten that other name that she was called and what was said of her . Daft , he thought to himself , daft as a cat under a full moon , poor thing , and never realized that he had characterized her to himself as " poor thing " instead of " wicked " or " scheming . " Yet he found himself following in her train as she glided ahead , as graceful as the red roe deer he had glimpsed , he walking soberly with the entourage of animals weaving about his ankles . They skirted the house and went on to the stone outbuilding , into which she led him , the outer door opening into a small room in which stood a table , covered with a white cloth , now blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a badger . MacDhui 's practiced eye at once took in the nature and extent of the damage , the crushed hindquarter , the cracked shoulder and shredded forepaw , while his nose acknowledged the sour odor of the infection . He screwed up his face in distaste and said , " Faugh ! Here 's a mess . " Then he asked briefly , " Trap ? " Lori replied , " Aye . And surely a dog must have been at him while he was fast . Then he broke the chain and came here ... . I could do no more for him . I am not very skilled . That is why I asked for help . " Mr. MacDhui nodded absently , not quite having caught the point of WHO had been asked for help , or the immediate irony of his having come there to put the quietus on an unauthorized rival , only to be called in consultation . However there was obviouslyno use lingering over the matter and he came to the point quickly . " Have you a can of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can have the beast out of his misery , for that is the best that can be done for him . " Lori said softly and confidingly , " God didna send him here todie , or you to be the instrument of his death , Mr. MacDhui . " He drew back somewhat and stared at her . " Eh ? How do youp159know ? " And then he added curtly , " I do not believe in God . " Lori said , " It does not matter . God believes in you , else ye would not be here . " She looked into his face with trust , and a soft , mysterious smile appeared at the corner 's of Lori 's mouth , a smile with almost a wisp of mischief in it , and which , for some reason he could not fathom , pierced straight to Mr. MacDhui 's heart , touchinghim and moving him most unaccountably almost to tears , so that he drew back yet further , gazing at her with astonishment . . . . He was remembering then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note he had almost forgotten . He became aware for the first time of the clarity of her gaze and the curiously endearingsimplicity and containment of her features . He was so shaken that he gestured rather too strongly and ridiculously toward the injuries of the animal on the table , saying loudly , as though addressing a particularly obtuse client in his own surgery , " But do n't you see it is impossible , madame ? " and then added , " Besides I have not my case with me  --  having come on a somewhat different errand . " Lori cried , " Oh no , no . It was because of your great skill you were sent . " Andrew MacDhui looked down upon the suffering badger again , noting the condition of the forepaw , the gashed flesh and torn tendons , the nasty three-day-old fracture at the clavicle , the mangled hindquarter further damaged by infection . And he experiencedsuddenly the most curiously young , almost boyish desire to show off before this strange creature , to shine in her eyes , to bring back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stole a glance now at this country girl whose copper-red hair fell loosely to her shoulder , noting the line of the nose that emerged so straight from the base of the wide , calm brow and gave such an expression of gentle and intimate wisdom to her face , but a wisdom and knowledge of things other than mundane . He had quite for-gottenthat she was mad.  | " Och , " he said , " this is a very poor business  --  still , the major tendon is still attached  --  we must see now to what extent the nerves have been  --  you will have nothing to tie the beast down and no bit of chloroform either , I suspect --  " Lori said simply , " I will hold him . He trusts me . " She slipped a hand beneath the head of the wounded badger , laid the other on his flank and , bending down , leaned her cheek to the beast 's jowl close to his muzzle , while making sweet , soft sounds in her throat . The badger whimpered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood out upon the brow of the veterinary . " For God 's sake , child , " he cried , " that was a mad thing to do . " Lori lifted her head , the rueful expression had pre-empted her mouth . She regarded him with a stabbing simplicity and said , " They call me Mad Lori . " Then she added , " I will keep him quiet . He will not stir --  " MacDhui did not reply but merely glanced at her again and thereafter , using what few primitive instruments and equipment she possessed , went to work , patching , sewing , building , and lecturingas he worked in the manner of a college professor to an audience of students : " Hm  --  so . Now we have built an anchor for the muscle with a good blood supply  --  you see where I have attached it to the undamagedportion  --  of course we shall have to see how it takes  --  still these are hardy beasts with great vitality . Ah , ah ! This nerve here ; note how it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruptured and so there is a chance if we can find a way to nourish it --  " He stopped suddenly and asked a question of her . " What is this power you exert over the animal , Lori ? It should be snarling and snapping . " " He trusts me . " Lori replied , her eyes riveted fascinated upon the near miracles the skilled fingers of the surgeon were performing . MacDhui improvised brilliantly with the broken shoulder ,  |p161|punching  two holes in a sixpence and using it in lieu of a silver plate to rivet it together . He said , " If this succeeds , here will be one badger who will never lack for bus fare . " As he worked he questionedLori again . " And where did you find this poor beast ? " " It came here . " " I see . And how did it know to come here ? " " The angels guided it . " " Have you ever seen an angel , Lori ? " " I have heard their voices and the rush of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unaccountablesadness , the sadness that results sometimes from a forgotten dream , or some hidden hurt to the soul that is touched off by something accidental or ordinary in life . He bestowed a long and searching look upon the girl standing beside him , gazing with undisguised admiration upon his work , and his sadness did not diminish . He shrugged , completed the bandaging of the animal , and having finished , stepped back , and spreading his hands almost like a stage magician who has performed a trick , said , " There now . It is done ! " Lori 's thanks caught him unprepared . She took one of his hands in both hers and bent her head over it . MacDhui felt the moisture of a teardrop and then the soft touch of her lips . The sadness welled up in him a hundred times intensified . He said gruffly , " I have done the best I could under the circumstances . The important thing is to keep the beast quiet . Tomorrow I will come and put a plaster cast on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some place to keep it ? " Lori replied , " Aye . Come . " She raised up the badger in her arms with infinite care and led Mr. MacDhui through a . door opening to the other part of the building divided into stalls and a few cages partitioned off . Here was indeed a small hospital , but if the animal doctor expected to find any of his ex-patients quartered here , he was mis/taken ; they were all wild creatures . He saw a fawn with a broken leg that had been well set and splinted , a red squirrel with one eye out , and a rolled-up ball of a hedgehog that seemed to have no visible wound . He encountered hares that had been victims of weasel bites , a fox cub that had become separated from its mother , and a family of field mice in a box . A burden seemed momentarily lifted from MacDhui . He had a sudden humorous intuition . " I think the hedgehog is m-a-l-i-ng-e-r-i-n-g , " he spelled out . He was rewarded . Lori 's wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " she replied , " but I let him . It makes him so happy . " " And this is your treatment ? " Beneath the eye of the huge man Lori was momentarily troubled . She replied , " I keep them warm and try to make them comfortable . I let them rest and give them food and drink "  --  her voice fell to a whisper  --  " and love --  " Mr. MacDhui smiled . The prescription was the old stand-by that he and other veterinarians had used for years  --  with the exceptionof the last , which he was sure in his case was supplied by Willie Bannock . MacDhui would have added only , "  --  and let nature take its course . " He asked of Lori then , " Well , and when people bring their pets to you ? " " They have their own to care for them . It is the wild and lost , the lonely and hurt things of the forest that need me . " Mr. MacDhui suddenly remembered something . " And Farmer Kinkairlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that the veterinary should be in possession of this piece of intelligence . The touch of mischief returned to her mouth . She said , " I sent her back with the message to be kinder to her and she would then yield milk again . " MacDhui threw back his head and roared with laughter . He hadp163a vision of the expression on the face of Farmer Kinkairlie when this message reached him . They went out . When they came back to the cottage Lori said , " Will ye no ' come in for a moment ? " Curiosity led MacDhui to follow her inside , his eyes roving swiftly over the simple furnishings and the great loom that he could see through the door in another room . His attention was momentarily caught by a glass bowl that stood on a table . It contained some rocks , a miniature wooden ladder , water , and a small green frog . Something stirred in MacDhui 's memory and he pressed his face close to the bowl , his gaze directed at the legs of the frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red bristle of his beard in a delighted grin . Sure enough , there it was , the little lump and swelling indicating there had once been a fracture which had healed . " He too ? " he asked . " Aye , " Lori replied . " I found him one morning on my doorstep in a box . He had a broken leg . " MacDhui said , " I can describe the delivering angel . He was aged eight , with a bullet head , freckles , a runny nose , and was dressed in a scout uniform . " Lori looked troubled . " I didna see it , " she said , " I only heard the bell --  " MacDhui wished he had not made the joke . Lori said , " I have no ' much siller to pay --  " " There is no need , Lori . I have been repaid . " On a sudden impulse she darted past him and ran into the room where she did her weaving . She returned carrying a scarf of natural-colored wool of incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she pleaded . " It  --  it will keep ye warm  --  when the winds blow . " " Yes , thank you , Lori . I will . " He wondered whether she knew how moved he was . At the door he repeated , " Thank you ,  |p164Lori  . I shall be glad of this  --  when the winds blow . I will come tomorrow or the next day and fix a proper cast . " He turned and went out , leaving her standing in the middle of the room , watching him go . But he had the curious last-minute impression that she no longer saw him , that the gentle eyes seemed to be turned inward , an expression of pain and sorrow was etched momentarily on her lips . He went down the path of the glen remembering the name by which she was known  --  Daft Lori . Mr. MacDhui climbed into his parked jeep , placing the wool scarf beside him . On an impulse he picked it up and settled it about his neck . It was as soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness returned to fill him once more , nor could he shake it off as he drove away in the direction of home.  |p165le  Driving toward Inveranoch and all that awaited him there and which now took on the aspect of another world situated almost in another universe from the one where he had dwelt the last hours since he had come to the glen , Andrew MacDhui pondered Lori and Lori 's God . Was it a part of the God-madness that afflicted those whose religious devotion crossed the line of sanity to fail to question the cruelty and capriciousness of a God who would first condemn one of His creatures to the steel trap , there to be worried half to death by a savage dog , before relenting and guiding it to the home of the one human being in the vicinity capable of helping it ? Was it a gigantic Jovian puppet game , when the badger 's case had proved too much for her , to arrange with dramatic timing the fortuitous arrival of an Edinburgh-trained veterinary to perform the necessary surgery at just the right moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone there for the purpose of giving an interfering and meddling half-wit a piece of his mind ? Lori in her simplicity had seen none of this . She had said only that he had been sent in answer to her prayer . For a moment MacDhui entertained the notion to have at his friend Angus Peddie about this and then put it out of his head for an odd reason . He was genuinely and wholeheartedly fond of the little man . He enjoyed arguing with him , but he loved himp166sufficiently not to wish to triumph over him and leave him embarrassedand demolished . Besides , he had a suspicion that when he found himself in sore straits Peddie simply retired behind the theologian 's wall by holding that the ways of God were mysterious , that His all-over designs and purposes were not to be discerned in immediate events , and above all that He was unanswerable to man . If He chose to let a dozen million Chinese starve , or the Russians slaughter the patriots of a neighbor nation , or He put a wild thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to be revealed later , or perhaps , God being God , never revealed at all . He reflected that there seemed to be an uncomfortable affinity between the long and often unpleasant arm of coincidence , God , and Moloch . And yet there was  --  Lori . She was touched  --  of that he had no doubt . Her way of living and her behavior were abnormal , and yet he knew that if there was one over-all characteristic , one key , one clue to her being , it was compassion . And here his thoughts turned again to that God whom , in her mild and sweet aberration , she served in such a strange and faithful manner . Was compassion the link between them ? Supposing God had made man , not in His own image , but in some reflection of His own love and spirit , and turned him loose on earth to work out his own destiny . Must not His heart , must not any great , creative , all-embracing heart be wrung with compassionfor what His children had turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth was a cosmic test tube of the universe , a dead star on which the spores of life had been scattered to see how they would flourish , then it was already one of God 's colossal failures . Yet , too , He must be riven with pity for the fate of the wicked and miserable victims of the experiment . Were the faithful like Peddie and the half mad like Lori all that He could look upon as salvage ? Surely there was no place inp167any theological catalogue for one of His more signal fiascos , Mr. Veterinary MacDhui . Well , as he was , so was he . At the outskirts of Inveranoch he pulled himself erect to show the town the old , well-known figure of bristle and defiance , shoulders back , chin out -- Yet now that he was there he did not drive at once to the houses in the lane , but cut around behind the street to the track that ran through the lush green strip of woods leading toward Stirling Manor . Here he parked and got out and sat beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt-blue of the loch shining through , for he was not yet done with thinking . But now that he had found a peaceful place and a peaceful moment , his thoughts , as so often happened , refused to be marshaledor submit to order . Instead they provided him with an uncomfortable kaleidoscope , flashes of past and present , presentimentsof the future in jumbled array . He produced his pipe from his pocket , packed and lit it . A lesser egotist might have suspected that the man who had returned from Glen Ardrath was no longer the same one who had driven up there , and in some ways would never be again . But he was not used to solving his difficulties , his turmoils and confusions , through sober reflection . Introspection was something new to him and he did not know how to begin . And as yet he could not foresee the fearful and apparently insoluble dilemma that was to face him , or the trials that were in store for him , the dogs that would bait and worry him before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and drag his remains in search of succor . From above his head came a familiar chittering and scolding and a red squirrel slanted down the tree trunk beside him in fits and starts with nervous pauses . But he was hungry , familiar with humans , and had been hand fed before . When he reached the ground he sat up prettily on his bushy tail , his black paws folded over the white blaze on his dark red breast.  |p168Mr  . MacDhui reached into his left-hand jacket pocket , where he was wont to carry tidbits to distract or win the confidence of nervous animals , and fished up a piece of carrot . The squirrel came close , accepted it with tentative daintiness , whisked off , a red streak , sonic five paces , and sat up nibbling it . Mr. MacDhui puffed on his pipe and said , " Contented now , are n't you ? " It was easier to watch and talk to the squirrel than to think . " Do not eat too quickly , " he admonished , " or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other form of parasite to which you little chaps seem to be prone , and that would n't be very comfortable . " The squirrel turned the carrot over rapidly two or three times in its paws and munched on , but sat so that he could keep a wary eye upon this talking man . " If I may introduce myself , " Mr. MacDhui suggested , " my name is Andrew MacDhui , a veterinary surgeon by profession . That should interest you , since it is a doctor who treats animals belonging to people when they are ill . I am not very much liked hereabouts . Furthermore I do not believe in God or a higher power . And I have a daughter , a child of mine own flesh and blood , who will not speak to me because when her cat contracted a form of meningitic paralysis I had it killed to save its suffering . " The squirrel ceased munching for a moment and looked up , masticating what it had in its cheek pouches , the carrot nearly finished . " Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented Mr. l/lacDhui , " and the exception is well taken . It is a query I have put to myself often enough in the past days . Could I have saved the beast or did I destroy it because I was jealous of Mary Ruadh ? Did I even diagnose its ailment correctly ? Mary Ruadh is my daughter 's name . She is called Ruadh because her hair is a shade between your coat and mine . She carried the wretched animal about with her wherever she went and slept with it at night . I would see her buryp169her face in its flank and hug it to her like a living doll and perhaps I could not bide that . The child is motherless , you know , and I have tried to be both to her . Now she cries and longs for her dead cat , but to me , her father , she will not speak . " The squirrel finished the carrot and got down on all fours , whisking its tail . The voice of the man was making him nervous and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " pleaded Mr.MacDhui . " Do not leave me yet . It is good to have someone to talk to . Look here ; I will bribe you to stay a little longer . " He produced another carrot and made clucking noises . " And we wo n't speak of my troubles any longer , but yours . " The squirrel reflected , accepted the carrot , and this time , soothed by familiarity coupled with generosity , sat up quite close by . " What do you do when you are ill ? " Mr. MacDhui asked , for it struck him that , strangely , he had never thought of this before . " To whom do you go ? Is there a wise old squirrel who tells you what herbs or roots to eat , or does your instinct tell you ? Or do you just crawl away under a bush and die , with no one to know or care ? Angus Peddie , my neighbor and a minister , says of his God that not a sparrow falleth but that He is concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never come upon a dead squirrel or hedgehog or deer . What happens to you ? Are you all eaten by the birds or the carnivores ? Where ii are your graveyards ? " MacDhui continued to catechize : " Do you have friends ? Are you ever lonely ? And what about your young ? Do you understand and feel for them ? Do they touch your heart so that when you look at them sometimes you think you can not bear the grief caused by the gulf between you and the fact that you can not communicate with them , that their little minds have already gone out from you ? Do you , too , love them and lose them so quickly ? "  |p170And  he asked finally , " Do you live out a whole life of your own , with love and happiness , or worry and heartbreak ? Or is there nothing but food and flight , nesting , mating , and dying , and are you more fortunate to be born a little forest animal without a soul than I , a human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer me that ? " The squirrel , the carrot finished , prepared to pack up . " Well , I can see that you are not going to , " Mr. MacDhui concluded , and arose . The squirrel ran off but stopped short a few yards away , sat up and winked an eye , and then vanished up the far side of a tree . Mr. MacDhui , sucking on his pipe , feeling curiously relieved , walked to his jeep , got in , and drove home . It was shortly before Mary Ruadh 's bath and supper time . Each night that he returned Mr. MacDhui hoped that his daughter would be waiting for him in the entryway ; each time he suffered disappointment . His anger had long since given way to bewilderment and heartache . On the advice of Mr. Peddie , he tried to take no notice of her silence . He talked to her even though she would not reply and behaved toward her as much as possible as though nothing had happened . He bathed her as usual , supped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one difference . She refused to say her prayers while he was in the room and he had had to defer , while Mrs. McKenzie came and heard them . But he had made it a point to return to her room each night , bend over her cot , and kiss her good night . She suffered him to do so without protest , her eyes staring upward at the ceiling , her gaze and thoughts turned inward or far from him . She never kissed him back . As he came in , the entry and hall were bare . MacDhui could hear Mrs. McKenzie at work in the kitchen . He went on into his daughter 's room , which was on the ground floor on the oppositep171side of the hall from his . She was sitting on one of her play chairs . Her favorite dolls were in a corner . She was doing nothing . He picked her up in his arms , saying , " Hi , chicken . Your daddy 's home . Anything to say to him ? " No one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  red hair , blue eyes , and each with truculent , immovable , stubborn chin turned toward the other . As he held her in his arms , silent and irreconcilable as ever , he noted that her skin was clammy . " Hello , " he said , " I do n't much like the feel of this . Perhaps we will have Dr. Strathsay stop by in the morning and have a look at you . Are you feeling ill , Mary Ruadh ? " When she maintained her accustomed silence , he said , " Right then . Let 's have our bath and supper and early to bed , warm and snug . And while I am bathing you I 'll tell you a story of a brave badger who lived in the woods above Glen Ardrath and how the Red Faery of the glen who dwells in a stone house with her friends of the forest , field , and stream , saved his life . " He saw then , as she sat naked at the bottom of the tub that she had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not good , and that she was no longer the little pink frog who used to splash her toys in the water , or squirt the cake of soap out of her hand , or make noises , and who did not even try to avert her face from the trial of washing . Nevertheless he was aware that she was listening to his story . He was surprised himself how it grew in the telling , and the strange affection he felt for the animal as he visualized it for his child . In the story the badger became a person , heroic , noble , brave , possessed of feelings and a soul . It ranged the forest , loving life and the world in which it found itself . When it was caught in the trap he felt the pang at his own heart , and a cry was wrung **25;10631;TOOLONG opened last , and he was not surprised to see them all there , waiting . " Jackson says the word has just come through from Berlin , " he said quietly . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand closed on Jeff 's sleeve , and Virginia laid a reassuring arm across Mab 's shoulders , drawing her closer . Dinah came through the door beside Bracken , tying the cord of her dressing-gown . " You 'll want something to eat before you go back to the office , " she said to him , her head down . " I 'll make scrambled eggs for everybody , while you dress . We might as well , we wo n't sleep now . " Lights came on ahead of her , down the stairs . Mab and Virginia followed her , getting into their dressing-gowns as they went , with the spaniel pattering behind . Sylvia stayed in their room with Jeff while he dressed , and they were the last to appear , just after Bracken , both men shaved and immaculate and composed , if a trifle grim . Mab had laid the table . Virginia had made the tea and toast . Dinah produced a platter of bacon and eggs . Unbelievablythey all sat down and ate . Only Mab refused the eggs , nibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . Only Sylvia had to force the food down her throat against an aching lump which threatened to burst and choke her . " They 're trying at the Shop to get through to Johnny in Berlin , " said Bracken as he ate . " No doubt he is trying to get through to us . This will have shooken ' em up at the Taverne , where the correspondents hang out . Of course as long as the British Ambassador is still in Berlin there 's some hope . The House is meeting this afternoon , and then we may know what his plans are . " " Do you think he 'll confide in us all ? " asked Virginia . " My dear , when the British Ambassador to Germany asksp51for his passports , that will be news and we shall hear about it , never fear . " Still understated and collected , Jeff and Bracken departed for Fleet Street , and their womenfolk trailed wearily back to the dishevelled bedrooms and lay down to wait , if not to sleep , while the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke to its headlines . Soon after that the telephone was ringing again , and Dinah stilled it , answering from her room . It was Irene , urgingthat Virginia start at once for Farthingale with the children . Dinah explained that Bracken would be in the House that afternoon , and would report home as soon as Chamberlain had spoken . " You surely do n't think the P.M. can wangle again ! " said Irene crossly , and hung up . While they sat around the table in Dinah 's dining-room having a second breakfast , heavy-eyed and rather silent , but fully dressed now and tidy , Mona rang up to say that Michael had gone to join his ship without even time for more than a telephoned good-bye , and Dinah asked her to lunch . " I suppose the Navy is gathering at Scapa Flow , " she said , returning to her chair . " Last time it was submarines we worried about . This time it will be planes carrying bombs . " " I can remember , " said Virginia eerily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battleship on the ground at the Hendon air show , and a plane going about forty-five miles an hour flew over and hit it with a plaster-of-Paris bomb from a thousand feet up , and we all clapped and thought how clever it was . " " Yes , well  --  " Dinah agreed vaguely . " I suppose now we had better start putting things together here . Ian says we shall be blacked out soon , no matter what happens . There 's a grim little Home Office pamphlet about ARP in my desk  --   |p52not  that I do n't know it by heart , but we might as well run through it again  --  " Unemotional and efficient , they checked the pamphlet 's requirements . There was no last-minute scurry , for Bracken had already had a comfortable refuge-room built in a reinforcedcorner of the basement , equipped with electrical outlets , and furnished with bunks and bedding , heavy tables and easy chairs , storage for drinking-water , even a rug . Then Dinah had assembled in it some useful extras such as candles , First-Aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a battery , books , tinned food , and bottled drinks . It was time now , Dinah decided , to hang the dark draperies which were ready to go inside the fitted blackout blinds at the windows on all floors of the house . " I will not live like a mole , " she had said when they were ordered some months ago . " We must be able to have all the light we want inside . " Virginia was leafing through the pamphlet for the hundredthtime . " What a swot these incendiary bombs are going to be , " she grumbled . " Have you got all the bits and pieces to cope with them ? " " In the cupboard in the passage . " " Two buckets , one full of sand , the other with about four inches of sand in it , and a shovel with a pole or broomstick lashed to it to lengthen the handle , ' " Virginia read out ponderously . " You throw the sand from the full bucket on to the bomb to smother it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other bucket ! ' " they chanted in unison . " It 's not possible , of course , " said Dinah cheerfully . " But here are the buckets and the sand and the shovel ! Not to mention a stirrup-pump as well . " " But I thought you were n't supposed to put water on them . " " Oh , Virginia , how do we know ? And if we 've all gone down to the shelter who 's going to be mucking about withp53buckets and sand ? Sylvia says it 's exactly like a first night without a prop rehearsal ! " Mab drifted about in Virginia 's wake , being as useful as she could , feeling an uncomfortable detachment . These preparationswere for other people 's safety , after she had gone back to Farthingale . Children would be no use in London , she knew , but nevertheless it was a guilty knowledge that one was oneself exempt from the immediate emergency only by one 's lack of years . That is , if they got away in time , before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go now , at once , that she dreaded being caught in the general evacuationundertow , and that she was  --  yes , afraid to stay in London . To discover that one was a coward , Mab thought , handing up curtain rings to Bracken 's manservant on a stepladderin the drawing-room , was really the last straw . To know this sick churning in one 's insides , to long to start packinga bag , to watch the clock , to prevent oneself by main force from asking when they were going to start  --  But Bracken did n't intend to let them run any risk ... . Her hands were cold and clammy , and she took great care not to touch Gregson 's fingers as she handed things up the ladder , lest he notice and suspect that she was afraid . Gregson had been in the last war  --  all through it , twice wounded and gassed . Gregson knew he could stand fire . Gregson was brave ... . Sylvia looked in at the drawing-room door with her hat on . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to come round to Cromwell Road with me and see about the animal ARP ? I 've been talking to some nice woman on the telephone , and she says I can put my name down to be an Animal Guard . I thought it was worth looking into  --  " Mab accepted with relief . It was always comforting to be with Sylvia . As they walked through the streets on that Thursdayp54morning they felt the tempo of London quickening all round them . Men were at work reducing the traffic signals at the corners to thin colored crosses . Men were painting white lines along the curbs and traffic islands . Museums were loading their treasures into vans which would take them to prepared hideaways in the country . Police notices in unemotionalblack and white had gone up on walls and windows about masking your house lights and screening your motor lamps . And  --  this brought a sinking sensation when they realized it  --  live ammunition was being stacked around the A.A. guns in the parks . And yet London was strangely calm , they felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned . Not hopeful that it was all just another false alarm , either . But steady . Not the desperate composure of will power , like last September . Now there was a deep , unreasoning , illogical serenity . The British had put their foot down . And only by the periodic , inevitable secret wave of nausea in each individualmidriff , resolutely downed unmentioned , did their nerves betray them . Sylvia bought the noon edition of the Standard and they read it in the bus . The American Ambassador was advising Americans to leave England at once , and there was a rush for bookings on the SS Washington sailing at midnight . " I 'm glad that does n't mean me , " said Sylvia . " They 'll pack in like sardines , the way it was last year before Munich . " " But you are an American , " Mab said almost with envy . " And so is Jeff . " " Foreign correspondents are a kind of maverick , " Sylvia remarked with a certain pride . " They 're hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks too , if necessary . It says here that volunteers are still needed to take charge of children in the evacuation  --  which may be ordered at any timep55now . That 's the sort of thing I ought to be doing , you know  --  instead of fretting about mere dogs and cats . " " The children will get along , " said Mab unsympathetically . " That 's the way I feel , " Sylvia agreed gratefully . " They 've been organizing to deal with the children for months , I tell myself . Well , anyway  --  we 'll see what 's going on about the pets before I give up on it . " When the House convened that afternoon at Westminster , Bracken was in the Press Gallery , noting tension but not gloom . The Prime Minister in a quiet , rueful speech admitted that there was imminent danger of war , but reiterated the pledge to Poland . Winston Churchill was not in his accustomedplace , which indicated that he had not yet returned from his holiday in France . They would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything Happened . The House , having met and issued its warning and its reassurances , adjourned till the following Tuesday the twenty-ninth . Mab and Sylvia returned at tea time to Upper Brook Street , full of information about the animal ARP , which was indeed glad of another volunteer , and enthused by an irresponsibledetour to the Radiolympia Show , where they had been entranced by the miracle of television , which would be like having a tiny cinema theater in your own living-room , they explained , as easy to turn on and off as a radio . For only thirty-two guineas , said Sylvia , and not taking up any more room than a sideboard  --  and Dinah had n't the heart to remind her that all television entertainment would cease instantly once war was declared . Jeff turned up for tea , having done his own tour of the London streets and handed in his story . There was the usual patient , undemonstrative crowd in Downing Street , he said , watching the Foreign Office and the Prime Minister 's residence . There was increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing mufti came and went . The King was back at the Palace from his holiday in Scotland . The Fleet was admitted to be at war stations . All leave was stopped , and everywhere key men were disappearingquietly from their offices and clubs and homes . " Take it easy , " said Bracken again to Virginia , when he came in for dinner . " We 're all right over the coming weekendapparently . Somebody is still trying . Ambassador Hendersonfor one , in Berlin . We got hold of Johnny on the phone there , to our intense surprise  --  had quite a chat . He says the British Embassy has begun to burn its papers . Well , they did that last year too , before Munich . Most of the British journalists have left for the Danish frontier . Warsaw is said to be gay and defiant , with beautiful weather  --  but Johnny thinks the big story is still in Berlin . It 's a very baffled Hitler  --  up against a fed-up world . The question is , Will he be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munich compromise ? " Jeff was broadcasting to America at midnight , and they were going to try for one of their three-way roundups , bringing in Johnny from Berlin and also the man at the Paris bureau . Beamed at New York , Jeff 's broadcasts were not received over the English wave-lengths , so Dinah always joined Bracken in the little studio at the BBC and heard Jeff through the earphones . She arranged to meet them there tonight as usual . During dinner Jackson at the office rang up to say that a cable had just been received from Evadne in New York . After two postponements because of her enchantment with life in America while Stephen and his father worked on the new show , they were sailing at once for England  --  there was no difficulty to get passage in that direction . Bracken dictated a cable right back insisting that they wait for an American boat . Returning to the table , he met Virginia 's anxious eyes with a smile.  | " That settles that , " he said . " They 'll be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lusitania . " Sylvia began to wonder if Evadne might be disappointed in her for trying to save the animals when children and old people would be in need of help . Evadne had the strength of character to come back from Williamsburg when she did n't have to , because of her warden 's post in Bayswater . That brought Stephen into the war zone with her , and the new show would have to wait . Stephen would n't just sit around while Evadne worked at the post , he would get that mobile canteen going , and , if there were no theaters in London , he would organize entertainment for the forces ... . They were all in it , up to the ears , Sylvia was thinking . Dinah went every day to the WVS office in London , Mona had her ambulance , Jeff would be out chasing the fire engines  --  they would all be on a job when the bombs started coming down , and they would have a right to expect Jeff 's wife to do something constructive too . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go were better destroyed .... Midge could go to Farthingale with the children to be really safe , but he would n't understand that , he would want to be with her , and she had to be with Jeff in London . The people at the animal ARP had welcomed her , and she had committed herself for training and brought back their leaflets . There were plans for animal ambulances , she had learned , which in most cases would consist of private cars dedicated to the task . There were to be shelters for pets , underground or properly braced , with two exits , and intelligent humans in attendance ; separate pens for each dog and cat , space for separate bird-cages , an identity tag for each inmate , registered and numbered so that it could always be traced .... Midge already had his luggage tag for travelling , with her address on it . Everybody must have a tag like Midge 's now .. There was n't to be any charge , because it was the people whop58could n't afford to pay who would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could buy a stock of food , Sylvia thought , and they would n't have to bring it with them  --  often there might n't be time  --  and there will be strays , the woman said . Even without tags , the strays must be fed . There was still so much to do before it started , before rationing began , and they needed contributions terribly , and fortunately she had some money of her own ... . But she wondered if it looked as though she was funking it , working with creatures who had no souls and could n't tell their trouble . Maybe it was funk , not to face the human fright and pain and blood . At least Mab seemed not to think less of her this afternoon , when she finally chose her war work and signed up as an Animal Guard , though it was often hard to tell what Mab thought behind that unchildlike composure . Apparently Mab had more courage than Jeff 's wife , who found herself sick and shaky with what must be sheer cowardice when everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Mab was brave , thought Sylvia  --  and it was humiliating to remember , unfairly , that Mab would be sent to Farthingale before it began ... . When Dinah set out for the BBC to hear Jeff 's broadcast , Mab and Virginia decided to try bed , but Sylvia was still mooching about in the drawing-room , where Midge 's cage stood covered in a corner , when they all returned after midnight . Bracken said he had given up sleeping for the duration , and they sat a while with drinks and sandwiches , discussing the telephone conversation which he had had with Johnny before the broadcast began . The Taverne , where the correspondents gathered in Berlin , was reduced to its neutral customers now , after having drunk the Russian Pact in with champagne the night before as a gesture of defiance and to relieve their feelings ; neutrals and the smirking German editors who were now suddenly denying everything they had been taught by the Nazis to say about Russia for sixp59years , in a brazen overnight about-face fantastic even for the mindless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments had turned pretty nasty , and some of the lessneutral , like Johnny , had had to take a turn in the Tiergarten to cool off . He would never forget Camilla 's face when he got home , Johnny said , roused out of a belated sleep to hear his latest news . " Sitting up in bed jawing me ! " he reported with something like a snicker . " I had to remind her that I had n't gone to Moscow ! " They smiled rather feebly at the story , and their own dawn , twenty-four hours later , was greying the streets outside . Johnny thought the Berlin rumors last night of an immediate march into Poland were premature , because the German people had n't been sufficiently worked up to it . The Germans were awfully happy so far about the whole thing at Moscow , Johnny said  --  too happy even to feel sheepish , for the terms of the Pact precluded a Soviet alliance with Britain and France now , and banished the carefully nurtured German nightmare of encirclement . Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which did n't count . Johnny said the bar at the Adlon where he and Camilla lived was very lonely tonight with the British gone . He had been hanging out there with an American just out of Warsaw  --  some sort of Unofficial guy , just a Tourist , Johnny explainedin his code voice which capitalized the vital word ever so slightly  --  one of those professional Globe-trotters on Holiday , as you might say . This American said the Poles would fight like hell , he bet , and even then he gave them about a month , without help . They were too charming , and too confident , and too old-world , and too bloody ill-equipped . And by the way , said Johnny , ask Virginia if she remembered anything about October , 1918 . Virginia would naturally remember several things about October , 1918 , but she had gone to bed for once , andp60Johnny had not told them what sort of thing she was supposedto remember . Something about the American in the Adlon bar , apparently . Not much to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went off to lie down a while , if not to sleep , before the new day caught up with them . " Of course I remember October , 19 r 8 , " said Virginia at breakfast when they put it to her . " They went right on gettingkilled . What else do you want to know ? " " We sort of wondered if you recalled any Americans , " Jeff said mildly . " Quite a few . Why ? " " We do n't know why , " Bracken admitted . " Johnny was trying to get something across last night on the ' phone . He 's met up with an American tourist type  --  he says  --  who is in and out of Warsaw , and then he said to ask you . " " Intelligence man , " said Virginia , not batting an eye , pouring out more tea . " Probably , " Bracken conceded with respect . " What 's his name ? " " No names , " said Bracken . " I see , " said Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacup and she did nothing so obvious as catch her breath or change color , Bracken could have sworn that she thought of something . He waited , while a silence spread . " Well , it 's not much to go on , is it , " said Virginia , her eyes still lowered , and they agreed it was n't and went on waiting . " There were dozens of them , " she remarked , and lifted her cup . " Most of them I would n't know now from a hole in the wall . Why ? Is it important ? " " Hard to tell . It could be , " Bracken said cautiously.  | " He 'll get himself killed , no matter who he is , mucking about in Warsaw , once the fun starts , " said Virginia . " The American Embassy has taken a villa outside Warsaw as a refuge in case of air raids , " Bracken said . " No flies on Biddle . " " Well , so they have here , at Epsom or somewhere , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biddle 's Embassyvilla outside Warsaw from anybody else 's villa when the time comes  --  or will they care ? " " Remains to be seen , " said Bracken , handing his cup for more tea . He perceived that there would be nothing more forthcoming now , and when Virginia remarked that believe it or not the annual cricket party at Farthingale village was tomorrow and she had to be seen there as usual , he allowed Johnny 's mysterious American to sink into temporary oblivion . " You 'd think they 'd call the cricket off this year , " Sylvia remarked . " What , and let Hitler have the satisfaction ? " Virginia demanded . " They begin to plan these August festivals in January . This one has already sustained the march into Prague and the death of Albania . We are n't going to miscarrynow ! " " But surely everybody 's called up , " said Sylvia . " Regulars and reservists , yes . But there are still enough old crocks and schoolboys to make a team , and the village expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , though , so we 'll be off right after lunch , if we can have the car . " " Certainly , take the car . But there 's no real rush yet , " Bracken said . The morning papers lay beside him , folded so that only one headline was visible . Hitler 's Midnight Conference , it said . Next to that there was a column about all Warsawp62digging trenches , even expensively dressed women swinging picks and shovels in the dramatic eleventh hour effort . The breakfast table party broke up reluctantly , and Virginia kissed her brother and Jeff good-bye with a secret dread of what might happen in the interval before she saw them again . Telephone service to the country areas was curtailed and belated even now , and once down in Gloucestershireshe would feel cut off and out of touch . Except for the children , she would have much preferred to stay in London . Putting the last overnight things into her bags for the drive to Farthingale , she felt the same uneasy finality  --  when would she see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sudden preciousness of commonplace things and everyday people took her mind back again to 1918 . October . There had been dozens of Americans , yes , and one of them was now in and out of Warsaw where the bombs would fall first . Intelligence work , if that was it , was no joke nowadays , even for a neutral . Worse than ever before , because bombs did n't care about neutrals , for one thing , and much good Ambassador Biddle 's suburban villa would be once the Nazi planes began on Warsaw .... October . . . . Twenty-one years ago , less a month . Virginia stood by the window of her bedroom , looking out at the muggy , drizzling London day . What weather , she thought , trying not to think of the other thing . Beastly day for the drive home . But you do n't know if he is still alive , she thought . He went back into the Line that October . You do n't know if he was still alive when the Armistice came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might expect Tracy Marsh to be doing .... Did they say my name last night , there at the Adlon or wherever it was ? Camilla would hear , and wonder . Camilla was a kid VAD in 1918 , preoccupied with her own unhappy affairs , which had nothing to do with stray American wounded passing through the hospital where they both worked . Anyway , itp63could n't be . . . . But then why did Johnny say to ask me .. . In Dinah 's town Rolls , with the aging chauffeur to drive it , Virginia and Mab and Noel the spaniel left London in the early afternoon , going round to pick up Basil and his nurse  --  who was fortunately a sensible woman , thought Virginia , and was doing her best to prevent him from growing up a self-satisfied prig like Ian . It was a mild day of clouds and sun , with showers , and except that they kept passing lorry loads of Air Territorials going somewhere in a hurry , England looked entirely peacefuland normal . Mab found Virginia a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the people they had left behind them in London , for Mab hated that part of it too . Sylvia was grown up and Sylvia was brave and so Sylvia had the right to stay with Jeff . Dinah stayed with Bracken . Irene stayed with Ian . And in Berlin , Camilla stayed with Johnny . Children and grandmothers were spared the awful glory of sticking with a husband no matter what happened . You said Good-bye to Jeff , you felt his lips briefly on your cheek , his coat was rough and warm under your hands , and then the door closed behind him and Bracken , off to Fleet Street and the tickers . But Sylvia would be there when he came home tonight . And when the bombs came ? But Sylvia was brave . Virginia bought a local afternoon paper at the end of the journey to Gloucestershire . It said that Hitler had sent for the British Ambassador , which might be interpreted as a good sign . It said there was a feeling of relief , however faint , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , the Echo concluded , the Nazis had miscalculatedthe effect of the deal with Russia . Instead of cavingin , Britain and France were more determined than ever to see the end of a situation full of unpleasant surprises , intolerable tension , and suspense . Everybody was sick of Hitler . One way or another , Hitler had to go.  |p64They  arrived at Farthingale at sundown unreasonably tired , to find the elderly parlormaid and the ancient gardener coping with blackout preparations in the drawing-room . Virginia threw down her hat and stood facing the great west window where the tea-table was always laid . Fitted plywood shutters  --  black sateen curtains on extra rods  --  in Gloucester-shire ! " Oh , what a swot it 's going to be , blacking out every night ! " she cried in despair . She had felt rather foolish last spring having part of the cellar reinforced to construct a refuge-room  --  but now it was done and ready , like the blackoutarrangements . Tomorrow it must be stocked like Dinah 's with emergency stores .. . Basil was asking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there in the morning . Virginia rounded on him . " Nobody will have their mummies with them pretty soon ! " she said a bit sharply . " And most people wo n't even have their grannies ! " Basil was tactfully removed nurserywards by his nurse , who knew her way around the house from previous visits . " That reminds me , madam , " the elderly maid Melchett remarked with some reluctance and an anxious smoothing of her apron . " Lady Laverham rang up and I was to tell you that we have been alerted for the reception of the children from Birmingham . " " Good Lord , wizen ? " " That 's not definite yet , madam . She said the people from the Bank that is booked in there at Cleeve are expected too . And there 's been a gentleman here again about the billeting , and I let him look at the rooms . That 's the third time . " " All right , " said Virginia , resigned . " Let ' em all come . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , and a dish of salted almonds . " As Melchett left the room on the errand and the gardenerp65eclipsed the westward window with his blackout rehearsal , Virginia turned away to snap on a table lamp , which illuminedthe small satirical smile on her lips . It sounded like praying , she thought . Please God , let me always have a nice dry Martini first . " Gran . " " Yes , darling . " She noticed with compassion that Mab had not sat down either . " I have n't got a job . In the war , I mean . " " Later , darling . " Virginia sighed . Thirteen . " But everybody has to do something , " said Mab , standing helplessly in the middle of the rug . " And with the Bank people billeted here in the house we wo n't have any of the Birmingham children  --  " " Thank God , " said Virginia piously . " The village will be full of them , never fear . We 'll have to have working-parties to make warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to arrive . You can knit and sew quite nicely , so you can help with that . And something must be done for their entertainment , I suppose , because the cinemas will all be closed . " " Shall we get bombs down here , do you think ? " Mab asked , trying to sound academic and detached . " Theoretically , no . We are a reception area . But they 'll try for Cardiff and Birmingham , and the observers ' post on the hill beyond Cleeve will catch it  --  which takes them right over our heads , " Virginia conceded wearily , and came to lay her arm around the small , lonely figure in the middle of the room , as a different window , on the south , went dark in its turn . " We 're all groping , Mab , if that 's any comfort to you . Nobody knows much more than you do about what 's going to happen . And nobody 's any braver than you are , either . Does that help ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brave  --  "  | " They have to find courage , " Virginia said . " It 's not quite the same thing . Deep down inside , everybody 's scared , believe me . It 's how you behave in spite of being scared that counts . " Melchett returned with a pale stemmed glass on a silver tray beside a dish of almonds . She cast a disparaging eye on the gardener 's achievement , and when Virginia had taken the glass Melchett set the tray on a table and went to tweak the dark masking draperies into more seemly folds in the gardener 's wake . " We turned out the whole house , madam , while you were away , " she announced . " Upstairs and down . Might as well start the war with everything tidy and shipshape , I said to'Y  --  " Well , yes  --  why not , " Virginia agreed , sipping . " That was very thoughtful of you , Melchett . " " There was n't time , the other war , " Melchett reminded her , snapping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might say . We may as well get down to it now , it 's the only way to teach ' im . " The cricket party took place the next day in perfect weather , proceeding with a sort of dogged frivolity along its usual course . Everything went off exactly as planned under the firm guidance of Charles Laverham , who was one of those so lightly referred to by Virginia as old crocks , and who as lord of the manor of Cleeve since the last war was confidently relied upon to see that the next one was not allowed to spoil the fun . And still the slow-motion crisis dragged on , with the whole world balanced on the knife-edge of rumor and suspense . As the days ticked by , Ambassador Henderson flew to London , and flew back to Berlin . Hitler was said to be locked in hisp67room , fuming and dangerous  --  and possibly hesitant for the first time . The obstinate , battered hope that not even Hitler could face the consequences would not quite expire . But when on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on Friday morning , September first , " as a precautionary measure " everyone felt again the familiar sick crunch in the middle and recognized it for plain old-fashioned Fear . Somebody in Whitehall knew something  --  smelled something  --  sensed something . " It 's no good their saying now that war is not inevitable , " Virginia muttered . " Somebody is already sure . " All over England that Thursday night the pitiful travelkitsof the children were checked through again , packed and re-packed for the zillionth time  --  toothbrush , face-cloth , change of underwear ( if possible ) , extra chocolate , some comic books or a favorite toy , gas-mask  --  the inevitable gasmask .... All over England children were sleeping in their own beds for the last night for who knew how long , and parents creeping in for another look stood wretchedly wonderingonce more if it were really for the best to send them away . These doubts mostly vanished at breakfast time on Friday , when the first BBC bulletin began with the ominous words : " There is grave news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the German war machine had been rolling across the Polish border since dawn . Open towns and refugee trains in Poland were being bombed from the air . England stiffened again , and resolutely surrendered its children to the trains and buses which were to carry them to safer areas in the countryside . There were tears . But most of those were on the faces of the people who saw them go . As the news from Poland worsened during the day , and censorship and blackout were announced to begin at once in England , there still remained a question  --  the British Ambassadorhad not left Berlin  --  England was still not at war.  | " If anyone had told me the day I left London that one week later we would still be waiting for the other shoe to drop ! " Virginia exclaimed when Charles and Rosalind Laverham arrived at Farthingale for a nightcap drink and a conference late on Friday evening . " Not much like last time , is it ! " said Charles , who had been in the Household Cavalry then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick one before dinner , and Bang ! I was in France ! " " No radio then , " said Virginia . " Sometimes I almost thought this war would talk itself to death before it hap-pened . " " Too late for that now , " Charles said . " They 're bombing Warsaw . You ca n't take back a bomb and say it was no such thing . " " Then why are n't we at war ? " " My dear , we are . " " It does n't say so on the BBC . " " The House is sitting . We 'll get it on the late News tonight , no doubt . " They all glanced at the radio , which was playing what the BBC called " light music " softly in a corner . It was seldom turned off any more , but it seemed to tell them very little . " Well , we were lucky today at the reception center , " Rosalind said , stifling a yawn . " Fewer children than we expected . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody must have got our missing ones , which would swamp them . And it may all even up tomorrow . " " Thirty-nine babies in that nursery school that 's taken Overcreech House , " said Virginia with a shudder . " One matron , and how many girls to help ? " " I could n't see for babies . Not enough , you may be sure . " " Have your Bank people arrived ? " Virginia asked . " Only five or six , so far . The advance guard . I thought Ijust could n't bear it last year when Charles arranged withp69the Bank to take over Cleeve , and they started putting in fitted basins and electric fires and partitions and blocking out windows . But I see now it was all for the best . The Bank is at least adult ! " As Charles and Rosalind had occupied the Dower House since 1917 , the dislocation at Cleeve was relatively slight , except for the heart-breaking alterations to the elegant seventeenth-century manor house which had been completed during the past summer so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loftier personnel . All the spare rooms at the Dower House and at Farthingale , as well as at the village inn , had been taken as billets for the smaller fry , some of whom had already arrived , escorting the lorry loads of records and files . Secretaries , typists , file clerks , and other underlings were arriving tomorrow . And in the village they would be expected to cope with more children , and more pregnant mothers with the ominous pink cards which meant that anything could happen any minute . " Perhaps the delay on the declaration here is to get our children away before there is any excuse to bomb our railways and reception areas , " suggested Rosalind , who was never afraid to face facts . " That will take three days at least , " Charles said . " Have you heard anything direct from London ? " " Three minutes on the telephone with Bracken yesterday , " Virginia replied . " We try not to use it , of course . They ca n't get Berlin now , except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if Johnny will be allowed to go on broadcasting from there . I wonder if his American has disappeared into Warsaw again as Bracken thought . " " What American ? " Charles asked , and Virginia 's eyes came to rest on him , puzzled and grave . " Do you remember Tracy Marsh ? " she asked , and Charles 's reply was just a fraction of a second slow , and then all he said was , " Yes . "  | " He was Intelligence , was n't he , in 1918  --  behind that bona fide captain 's uniform ? " " What makes you think of him now ? " asked Charles . Melchett came in with the tray of glasses and sandwiches which she placed on a coffee-table in front of Virginia beside the tray of decanters , and went away again . At a hospitable gesture from Virginia Charles rose at once to deal with the drinks , and while he measured and poured the silence lengthened . " Oh , all right , " said Virginia with a sigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Have you ever heard from him since he left here before the Armistice ? " " Soda ? " said Charles , her glass poised at the syphon . " Just a splash , dammit . " She accepted the glass from his hand and glanced at Rosalind . " I thought Charles was out of it for good , " she complained . " Is he going to clam up again this war too ? " " There are n't enough of them who can remember what he can , " Rosalind said with her unshakable serenity . " Too many of them died . So they want him back . " " I 'd have you know I 'm an extremely valuable antique , " Charles said with dignity , presenting his wife with her glass . " Beginning Monday , I am to be mounted in a glass case in an office in Whitehall  --  or its evacuated equivalent . " " Oh , but Charles , we need you here ! " Virginia cried in dismay , for it was always Charles they ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas-lectures and the billeting and the clinic and the maternity home  --  well , Rosalind there , but behind Rosalind , Charles , steady and patient and kind and knowing ; even without a war they could n't get along unless Charles was at Cleeve to be run to . " There are things still imprinted in the mouldy recesses of my aging brain , " Charles explained , " which may conceivably be of some use to a Government which finds itself at war with Germany  --  again . "  | " But  --  is Rosalind going up to London with you ? " Virginia looked from one to the other with compassion , for the Laverhams were never apart . " No . She 's got things to do here . A good many more things than she had before I was called back . " " Well , I do call that hard luck , " Virginia said to Rosalind . " I do think , at Charles 's age  --  " Charles bristled . " I 'm no older than Churchill ! " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't run a war without him at the Admiralty . Even Chamberlain knows that . " " Well , this is like old times , " Virginia said thoughtfully . " And there 's Oliver in London gone into wardening because the War Office does n't want any gaffers from 1914 . " " The term is dug-outs , " Charles corrected gently . " RememberBuffy ? " " Yes , of course . Good old Cousin Buffy in the Hussars ! " " At the War Office now , " said Charles . " Not such an ass , you know , if he is my Uncle Aubrey 's son . I 've got him to thank for this . And you can tell Oliver from me that the wardens may have most of the fun before this is over . " " Suppose we get thousands of German planes all at once in a colossal raid to start with , " Virginia suggested . " Not practicable . They 'll come a few at a time , all day long . Nights too . No time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear us down . " " Charles , darling , how do you know ? " " I do n't . Just guessing . " He retired hastily behind his glass . " Nobody knows anything yet . Anybody says he does is just throwing his weight around . " " Charles , would you answer just one question , yes or no ? " Virginia leaned forward , fixing him with an innocent , appealinggaze . " Have you any reason to believe that Tracy Marsh is still alive ? "  |p72Once  more that fraction of a second 's delay occurred . Then Charles said , " I have no reason to believe that he is dead . " " And could he be in Warsaw now ? " " I suppose he could . " " But he 's not a lot younger than you are ! " " Not a lot . Maybe he has n't got a game leg . " " I suppose we 'll never know now , " said Virginia , looking into her glass , and the Laverhams exchanged glances , for everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-one years ago when he was in London , wounded , after Saint-Mihiel , and when he vanished again across the Channel a month before the Armistice . " Did n't you ever hear from him ? " Rosalind asked sympathetically . " No . No , of course not , I  --  meant it to be that way . That is  --  " Virginia flushed and floundered before their eyes . "  --  I mean , I never expected to , " she finished lamely . " This is the BBC Home Service . And here is the twelve o'clock News , " said the radio crisply into the quiet room , and Virginia rose at once to turn up the volume . There was no declaration of war . They sat looking at each other incredulously . Chamberlain had spoken briefly and belatedly in the House , announcing the delivery of a last warning to Hitler by Ambassador Henderson in Berlin . " If the reply to this is unfavorable , and I do not suggest that it is likely to be otherwise , His Majesty'sAmbassador is instructed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it , " said Charles at last . " There was n't even any mention of a time limit for Hitler 's reply . " " Charles , do you honestly not know what 's going on ? " Virginia said uncertainly . " No more than you , my dear . " " B-but that glass case in Whitehall  --  " " Ah , " said Charles . " But I 'm not in it yet . "  | " Well , in that case , " said Virginia , " let 's all have another drink . " Although they had been spared the additional turmoil of evacuated children and pregnant mothers at Farthingale and Cleeve , owing to the Bank billeting , both Rosalind and Virginia had served at the reception center in the village and it had been a long , tense day . They were all glad to sit a while , nursing their tall glasses , in a midnight haze of fatigue and bodily comfort . Old , old friends since the turn of the century when Charles came back from South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world where that meant something pretty special , they clung now to their mutual memories , and their love for each other 's company enfolded them warmly in a brief illusion of peace and security . Like every other old soldier , Charles was in a speechless private rage of his own . They had seen to it once , in Belgium , at enormous cost . And now the same old enemy was on his feet again and coming for them . Less than a generation  --  and the Somme and Passchendaele and Verdun had all gone for nothing . Once more , the main event was London and Berlin . And this time it would have to be finished . This time there must be no Armistice , while the German Army marched home with banners . This time Berlin must be taken . Germans had always had the gift of offence . But now the Germans were n't people any more . They were robots . You can not reason with a robot , and he has no honor . You can only smash him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start from behind . He is always readier to attack than you are , because none of the things that matter to you  --  this kind of room , this kind of women , confiding , casual children , the gentle routine of country life and little luxuries  --  none of that is comprehensible to robots . And before it could be demonstrated  --  again  --  that England could be pushed just so far , the very thing that England strove to defend must bep74sacrificed again , in the hope that it could be saved again . We beat ' em once , and we 'll beat ' em again , the old soldiers said . But before that .. . Morbid , unaccustomed thoughts for Charles , who presented to the world a deceptively stolid Guardsman 's countenance . In view of the standard British joke that the War Office is always preparing for the last war , the off-hand way in which he had been summoned to London , at a time when most of the dug-outs from 1918 were a drug on the market , was to him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as for Tracy Marsh  --  if he was in Warsaw now , and if he ever got out , he , Charles , would give his game leg for a chance just to listen to him . A sound at the door turned their heads towards it . Mab stood there , apologetic in a dressing-gown and slippers , with purple shadows under her eyes . " I could n't sleep , " she said . " I got terribly hungry  --  " Charles rose instantly , holding out welcoming hands . " Come and join the wake , " he said . " You can have all thesandwiches . " " Suppose I pop down to the kitchen and warm some milk , " said Virginia , rising too . " Would n't you like a cup of Oval-tine ? " " I can get it , " Mab said , holding to Charles . " Melchett 's gone to bed , I expect . " " I 'll do it . You sit down here with Charles and Rosalind . " It 's worse for the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose you were thirteen , and had never seen a war , and had to keep a stiff upper lip . Suppose you were Mona , and in love . What will they all have to bear before this is over ! We had our fun , we had the last of it , before the other one . And what can we do now to help them ? Ovaltine ! And love . Lashings of love , for all of them , even the ones out of Birmingham  --  especially the ones out of Birmingham , God help them ... .  |p75Saturday  produced glorious weather , and the atrocity stories began to come out of Poland . While evacuation proceededmethodically in England , the trains full of women and children leaving Warsaw were bombed , creating chaos and horror . And England had not declared war . " We 're right to wait , " Virginia said , white-faced , laying aside the newspaper . " We 're right to get ours out before he can get at them . " Driving into the village after breakfast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virginia joined Rosalind who was already there , surrounded by her lists and billeting vouchers and accommodation forms , in a group of competent women who were dealing with small crises left over from yesterday and preparing for new complicationswhich would begin with the first busload expected before noon today . " Hullo , " said Rosalind , looking wrung out but composed . " Charles got off to London early this morning . " " Today ? I thought  --  " " They ' phoned through and wanted him at once . Things are speeding up . " " There 's no real news this morning . " " The House meets at three . It will come then . " Meanwhile , rumor invented reasons for the delay , especially in the pubs . Paris was wobbling , they said  --  there was something sinister going on at the top in France . Mussolini had stepped in  --  Russia had tripped up Hitler already  --  Roosevelt was going to do something  --  there would be another Munich  --  they had discovered too late that there was no way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over England would come without warning before the declaration could be made  --  there was a Ray  --  there was a new gas  --  something sensational in the way of defence from bombing would be revealed . . . . " I am not going to believe anything unless I hear it on the BBC , " Virginia said firmly.  |p76Some  things they did know , even down in Gloucestershire . There would be no more weather forecasts in Britain , but it was the most beautiful day of the whole year . The observers ' post on the hill behind Cleeve was fully manned , on duty round the clock , and the Specials were out on patrol . The wardens ' posts were at full strength , with somebody always on the telephone , with maps hung and gas-masks and decontaminationsuits smelling up the passage . One glanced up instinctively at planes in the sky and thought subconsciously , " Ours . " One saw cattle grazing in a field , ancient horses livingout their placid existence in a mechanized age , and thought of low-flying German planes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parish Hall with his grisly supplies  --  sealed dressings , bottles of Dettol , bandages and lint and splints  --  not much of it , really  --  how much ' would be enough , in Gloucestershire ? More children arrived , dismal or over-excited as the case might be , and more pregnant mothers with those sinister pink cards ... . At the back of everyone 's efficiency and good humor there lurked a common rage  --  that bloody awful little man called Hitler ... . Working side by side , unemotionally , doggedly , right through lunch and on to tea time , Virginia and Rosalind got the new consignment from Birmingham off to its lodgings before the blackout , without anything which could be called disaster . Nothing was born on the spot , Virginia remarked with visible relief , and nobody threw up on the floor . And when they parted from each other with weary smiles the knowledge that they must not use the telephone for nonessentialchat gave them a lonely cut-off feeling . The loss of Charles 's week-end at home was a blow . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official reluctance to make use of that generation which was so terrifyingly scarce , even in Charles 's exalted field . She arrived back at Farthingale to learn that in herp77absence four female secretaries and four typists ditto had taken up their quarters in the house , and she went upstairs to make them welcome . She found them much as she had expected  --  well-dressed , personable girls , tired to death , a little on the defensive in these strange surroundings , anxious to please , and perhaps somewhat awed at sight of her . As usual there was one among the lot that stood out . " I never thought anything nice could come of this war , " said the secretary whose name was Anne Phillips . " But living in a house like this one will make up for a lot . " Virginia , who loved the house so passionately herself , at once warmed to the girl . " Come downstairs and have a look round before the blackout , " she suggested . " You 're to have the small drawing-room for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coop up in your bedrooms all the time . " " Two drawing-rooms in the house ? " Anne exclaimed , impressed . " Well  --  card-room , music-room , back-parlor  --  whatever you want to call it . There 's a piano in it , and a radio of course . It 's on the left at the foot of the stairs . Come along , I 'll show you . " Claudia Merton , who shared the bedroom with Anne , said she 'd rather get settled in first , thanks , and Anne followed Virginia downstairs , walking lightly , trailing one hand down the polished banister . She was a frail blonde with enormous eyes and a generous mouth . Her silk-clad ankles looked breakable , like a deer 's . Virginia wondered if she had ever had quite enough to eat , but her voice was well-placed and her vowels were unself-conscious and correct . " I 've always dreamed of a house like this , " Anne was saying as they reached the lower hall . " And to think it took Hitler to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never meant to oblige you , " Virginia said . " And would n't he be furious if he knew ! " They laughedp78together , and Anne admired the little parlor set aside for their use , and then paused on the bottom step on her way back to finish unpacking . " I hope you wo n't mind Claudia 's bad manners , " she said unhappily . " Her boy 's been called up , and she 's taking it very hard . It makes her seem cross . " " And how about your boy ? " Virginia asked kindly . " I 'm lucky . I have n't got one . " She skipped away up the stairs , with a graceful little wave from the top . What a nice child , Virginia thought , and forgot all about her . Not until evening did the Prime Minister announce to a troubled , unruly House that there had been no reply from Hitler and that no further conference could take place while the invasion of Poland continued . Although there was still no formal declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now implied . The House was to assemble tomorrow for its first Sunday session in modern times . The prolonged agony of delay and seeming indecision caused only exasperation when the late News was read by the BBC . " What are they doing ! " cried Virginia , switching off the radio and rumpling her hair with the same impatient hand . " It seems as though they do n't know what to do , " Mab said , longing for Jeff 's opinion , which was only as far away as the telephone one could not use . " They know well enough . We shall be a laughing-stock if this goes on . I 've got to talk to Bracken ! " " It 's like the crocodile 's clock , " Mab remarked thoughtfully , and Virginia sent her an inquiring look . " In Peter Pan , " Mab explained . " You hear it ticking . You know it 's coming . Finally you only want to get it over with . " The telephone rang , and they both rushed to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one little three minutes from London . A cable had come to say that Evadnep79and Stephen were sailing today . On an American boat , so Virginia need n't worry , Hitler would n't touch that . " How do we know he wo n't ? " asked Virginia grimly . " Tell us more , we 're starving for news . " " We do n't know any more here , " Dinah said wearily . " Unless at Whitehall , and censorship is on even there . I must talk fast , let me see  --  there was a violent thunderstorm tonight while the House was still sitting , and everybody thought it was the first air raid . You 're supposed to laugh at that . " " Ha-ha , " Virginia obliged mirthlessly . " Go on  --  quick . " " Churchill was in the House tonight , and Lloyd-George  --  like 1914 over again . All the barrage balloons are up over London and everybody is standing to . Mona is with her ambulance , helping to empty the hospitals of movable patients to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that figure is based on what happened at Barcelona and Warsaw . Yes , I know , our defences are better ! Sandbags everywhere now , and plate glass windows all taped in pretty patterns . Theaters closing , people out of work . We ca n't go on like this , it will come tomorrow morning .  --  There go the time-pips , I 'll have to stop  --  " The connection ended . As Virginia hung up , the door of the small parlor opened across the hall and the Bank girls came out , having listened to the News on their radio there . " What does it mean ? " asked Anne from the foot of the stairs . " Are we going to back down ? " " That was my sister-in-law calling from London , " saidVirginia . " They do n't seem to know any more than we do . " " It would be ten times worse than Munich , " said Anne . " We ca n't hold up our heads if we do n't do something now . " " Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon . " She watched them trailing up the stairs . The one who wasp80taking it badly mopped at her eyes , and Anne laid a consoling arm around her waist . Then it was Sunday morning , September third  --  bright warm sunshine  --  a blaze of autumn color in the gardens and the parks  --  green , tidy England  --  ten o'clock , and keep your radio turned on for an announcement at eleven  --  as though anyone 's radio was ever turned off , any more  --  eleven o'clock , here it comes  --  Bow bells , the BBC signal that a special bulletin was due  --  bells , like a wedding ... . Virginia gathered the Bank girls in the big drawing-room with the family . " We 'll swallow it together , " she said . They found places on the edges of the chairs and sofas , only Anne seeming at ease as a guest . Claudia Merton sniffed audibly and blew into her handkerchief while they waited . Basil was there , restless and oppressed , with his sensible nurse . Mab was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sim the governess , returned only yesterday from Scotland , sat upright in a corner with her knitting . Virginia lighted a cigarette ... . At eleven-fifteen the familiar schoolmasterish voice of the Prime Minister emerged at last from the radio : " I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room of Number ro Downing Street . This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by eleven o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland a state of war would exist between us . I now have to tell you that no such undertaking has been received .... " " Well , " said Virginia quietly when it was over , " now we can hold up our heads , Miss Phillips . Now we are at war . Do n't anyone go away , I 'll only be a minute  --  " When she had left the room they sat almost motionless and silent , obediently waiting for her to return . She was followed by Melchett wheeling a trolley on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icebucket . " Dutch courage , " said Virginia , watching while Melchett popped the cork and began to fill the glasses , and the girls , wide-eyed and speechless , were almost as stunned by the elegance of champagne at eleven o'clock on a Sunday morningas by the declaration of war . So they drank to victory , while the BBC read out again the air-raid instructions and precautions they already knew by heart . And Virginia thought of Jeff 's mother Phoebe , who by a miracle had survived when the Lusitania went down in 1915  --  but Evadne was on an American boat , Hitler would never touch that . And she thought of Dinah and Sylvia , who would stick with their husbands in London , which might at any moment now become the firing line . And of Camilla in Berlin , sticking to Johnny , which would be much worse . And of Charles and Oliver , who could remember a war in South Africa , to say nothing of the one in Belgium , and who were too old now for fighting , praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was required of them in all the previous , predictable wars ... . Most of all , Virginia thought about her only son Nigel , who had grown up so like his father , even to being a barrister with chambers in the Temple  --  a rather dim and stranded copy of his father , since the sudden death of his young wife after only two years of marriage . They thought it was just a cold  --  then she started to cough  --  and then it was pneumoniaand she was gone . No children  --  nothing for Nigel to go on with . Nobody saw him any more , he was at Winchester about a will case the week Virginia and Mab had left London . Since then he had rung up once or twice , but he was always bad about writing , and now it was n't the thing to use the telephone ... . She supposed she would hear soon , what Nigel meant top82do about the war . At thirty-one he would hardly be called up , not at first , and he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any use to the Air Force . There was no demand for enlistment now , except in civil defence , and he was already wardening at the Temple . Nigel had gone into himself with his heart-break , which was hard for her to get used to , but it seemed best to let him alone . Archie would have known what to do about his son , Archie would have helped him through it when poor Phyllis died , Archie would have turned sixty now , if he had lived , but Archie was safe , Archie was out of it , they would have to do without him this war .... Sylvia had gone out with Jeff that Sunday morning in London to watch the orderly , self-contained crowds in the streets . A warm sun shone there too , women wore bright summer frocks and no hats , young men had left their collars open . Everyone carried the little brown box which held the gas-mask . There were almost no children , almost no dogs . News of the actual declaration of war was called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow reporter who had just heard it on the radio . He came down and joined them , young Denis Arnold , hatless and grave , with his gas-mask slung over his shoulder , and they all drifted westward towards Buckingham Palace , where in 1914 a shouting , singing crowd full of ignorant enthusiasm had surged . Today there was no visible change in the face of London as the eleven o'clock deadline passed . No one was taken by surprise , everyone had a fair idea of what it would mean , no one seemed to look backward with regret . But there was no bravado . It was like having a tooth out . You did n't argue with the dentist at the last minute , you screwed yourself upp83to it . England was now of a mind to have the tooth out and be done with it . The three of them were at the edge of the crowd around the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of the Palace when the promised " Warbling Note " of the air-raid warning began , about eleven-thirty . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after the first upheaval in her own middle she felt Jeff 's fingers close tight round her elbow . " There they come ! " cried a woman 's voice lightly behind them in Mayfair garden-party tones , and Denis said , " B'God , they are n't wasting any time ! " and laughed . Wardens wearing helmets and arm-bands , and police on bicycles with TAKE COVER signs hung round their necks appeared from nowhere , shepherding everybody towards the shelters in St. James 's Park . No one hurried very much . " Five to ten minutes , between warning and raiders , " Jeff was saying . " They must have been already on the way  --  " The shelter entrance , with its stout wooden railings , was not crowded , and there was room on the benches inside for a third again as many people . They sat down and lighted cigarettes . The lighter in Jeff 's hand was steady , and Sylvia glanced up at him under her lashes and away . His heart had stood up to Prague last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleepless waiting . But would it weather a London air raid without going into the wild overbeat that left him prostrate and unable to stand until it had passed ? She had never seen him during an attack , for he had not had one since their marriage , but he had told her in a few brief graphic words what could happen . " I wonder if Bracken is already inside the House , " she allowed herself to say , after the first puff . " Sure to be , " said Jeff . " They would have set out for there as soon as Chamberlain finished speaking . " " Good shelter there  --  they 'll all be in it , wise-cracking , "  |p84said  Denis , and she supposed she looked a little green under his kindly eyes . Jeff was gazing thoughtfully towards the entrance of the shelter , guarded by a helmeted warden . " Do you think if we showed our Press cards he would let us see what 's going on up above ? " he suggested , and Denis said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented herself from saying , " No  --  stay here with me . " But it was all very new and serious to the warden , and he refused to let them pass . The Alert did n't last long , and the All-Clear sang out its high , sustained note before noon . A mistake ? Or had the raiders been turned back at the coast ? Everybody trouped up the steps again into the sunshine , feeling excessively jolly , as though the tooth was already out . The three of them had a late lunch at the Savoy , which except for sandbags was exactly as usual , and by then speculationabout the delay in France had become embarrassing . " It does make you think , " said Denis rather hollowly , " about those ugly rumors that something very queer is going on at the top over there . " But when they got home for tea Bracken was able to reassure them . The declaration had come through from Paris at last . The French had not ratted after all . They listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , word by difficult word , and then Bracken handed round drinks . As usual the nervous reaction made them hungry , and dinner was a little early . Bracken was finally showing the strain of tension and loss of sleep , and Dinah persuaded him to go to bed early and let Jeff handle the Sunday midnight broadcast to America , when they hoped also to call in Johnny from Berlin . Jeff promised to ring up the house if anything sensational developed , and then took up the vigil at the BBC , with the intention of returningfor a last look round at the Fleet Street office afterp85his broadcast . They were not to be alarmed if he decided to sleep there on one of the cots which had been set up several weeks before . Before he set out , and Bracken went wearily to bed on Dinah 's orders , they knew that Churchill was back in his old room at the Admiralty  --  and that when the signal went out to the Fleet : Winston is back , there were happy cheers . They knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lack of bombs on London brought a guilty feeling , almost as though Britain had not fulfilled her duty and declared war . There was a story from Poland that AmbassadorBiddle 's suburban villa had been bombed , apparently without injury to himself or his family  --  the German airmen either had not known or had not cared whose it was , or that America was not in the war . Because Dinah was engaged in what she called sitting on Bracken 's head till he rested , there would be no one at the studio to hear Jeff through the earphones unless Sylvia went with him , and this he refused to allow , on the grounds that he had enough on his mind already . After he left the house she went wearily to bed alone except for Midge in the room they shared . There was a bad moment when a taxi at the corner ground its gears like the opening growl of the siren , and then she sank into a trance of exhaustion . It seemed to her only moments later that she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , authentic siren wail filled the air again . It was two A.M. Monday morning and Jeff had not come in . She wondered if he was still at the office , where there was a shelter , or if he had been caught in the streets on the way home . Bracken knocked on her door and set it ajar . " May as well go down to the shelter , I think , " he said calmly . " They may mean it this time . " Her hands were not quite steady as she pulled on a pair of slacks over her pyjamas and added socks and slippers . To/night was going to be harder because Jeff was n't with her  --  no one even knew where he was by now . There was going to be a lot of this , she realized , when they were not together . I must n't be a baby , I must n't hang on to him , think of the women whose men are away in the Army . ... I must be steadier than this when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ashamed . That 's tomorrow night . Tomorrow night I will be on duty , on my own . If Evadne can do it , so can I. But Evadne got it licked last year , training to be a warden . Evadne is brave ... . She collected Midge in his covered cage from a table in the corner farthest from the window , snatched up her gasmask , and joined Dinah and Bracken on the stairs . Midge 's gas-mask , she had learned from the Animal ARP , would be a small blanket dipped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda and laid over the cage . The solution and the blanket awaited him below  --  unnecessary until the hand-rattles of the wardensshould signal an actual gas attack . Bracken saw them settled in and then , taking his gas-mask , returned to the upper floor and the street outside , where he encountered the warden on his beat and as an old friend was permitted to stay outside and watch while nothing happened . For nearly two hours Dinah and Sylvia sat in the comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric kettle , reading , or trying to , dozing , listening  --  there were no loud bangs , and the All-Clear was plainly heard . " Maybe we really have got something that stops them , " Sylvia said hopefully as they climbed the stairs again and met Bracken in the hall . " Scouts , " said Bracken . " Try-ons . Still working on our nerves . Well , so much for my nice early night . " The telephone stopped them before they reached their bedrooms and Bracken turned back and snatched up the instrument in the hall . Once more they saw incredulity and horror grow on his face as he listened  --  something worse thanp87a Russian Pact this time . He thoughtfully tilted the receiver so they could be sure it was Jeff 's voice at the other end of the line . " It took ' em nearly a year to work up to that last time , " he said . " Where will the survivors come in  --  Glasgow ? She sailed from there , yes .  --  All right , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag and go up to Glasgow tomorrow and talk to survivors . " He hung up and turned back grimly to the anxious women . " They have sunk a liner , " he said . " The Athenia . Heavy loss of life . It 's the Lusitania all over again . Well , my dears , the war is on , all right ! It may last quite a while . I suppose we had better learn to go back to bed . Jeff 's on his way here . " They separated silently , with reassuring smiles , closing the doors behind them gently as though there had been a death in the house . Sylvia replaced Midge on his night table and leaving her light on against the new nightmare turned the unseen pages of a book till Jeff let himself in quietly and came to take her in his arms . His coat smelled of tobacco smoke and outdoors as she buried her face against it . " It 's going to be a tough war , " he said . " Well , we knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few days  --  " Instantly she faced him , tousled and indignant . " Now , Jeff , you know I 'm booked to go round to the animal shelter tomorrow morning just as always  --  " " All right , all right , I only asked a civil question , " he said , half amused . " I keep thinking about Stephen and Evadne , " Sylvia said . " If they sailed last Saturday  --  " " They 're on an American boat . Hitler wo n't do anything now to bring America in . " " You ca n't tell what he 'll do . It wo n't be very comfortable at sea right now . "  | " Honey , let 's face it . Nobody 's going to be very comfortableanywhere , for a while ! " said Jeff . " Except in America . " " Land of the free . How about going back there for a visit ? You could take Mab with you , she 's always  --  " " Jeff Day , if I was willing to desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the Atlantic now for a million dollars ! " Sylvia told him with a shudder . " Whatever comes , I 'll take it on dry land , and together . " " Maybe you 're wise , at that . " Jeff kissed her and put out the bed lamp and went to part the heavy curtains on the dark room and raise the window . Moonlight streamed across the floor , and he stood a minute , leaning on the sill looking out . " Come and look , " he said , and she got out of bed and joined him at the window . All she saw was bright moonlight over the housetops . He turned his head towards her uncomprehending silence . " Notice anything ? " he asked quietly . " There 's not a sound , " she whispered . " Look again . It could be a hundred  --  two hundred years ago . No lights  --  no traffic . I noticed , walking home tonight  --  a lot of London is just the same now as when Wren put up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery and artificial light , a lot of London is still pretty much the way our great-great-grandfathers saw it . London has gone back  --  ' way back  --  nobody 's seen it like this since George III was King . And you know what ? It 's the loveliest city in the world tonight . And I would n't be anywhere else for a million dollars . " He straightened with a sigh . " Make sure I hear the alarm , " he said , and fell into bed and was asleep . But Sylvia lay awake now , listening , wondering , watching the moon-shadows creep across the room  --  remembering the safe , dreaming streets of Williamsburg under other Septem/ber moons , the silky , whispering night air , the wafts of sudden fragrance , the gay Negro voices , the unquestioning security . ... Oh , God , make me brave , make me do the right thing here , do n't let me disgrace myself ... . " Of course Evadne had n't thought about Williamsburg all her life the way I have , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday a week later . " It would be all new to her . But now she 's seen it , with her very own eyes , and if we take a map and some pictures I can ask her  --  " " Sweetheart , you get so carried away by Williamsburg , it 's rather worrying sometimes , " Virginia said , mindful of what she could only call a spooky letter from Evadne , all about Tibby 's portrait being Mab , and Jeff looking like Julian 's , as everyone knew , and the Mawes cottage down by the Landing which nobody but Fitz remembered any more ... . " Worrying how ? " asked Mab with her upward , candid look , and Virginia found herself fumbling a little , which she was not accustomed to . " It seems rather odd , " she said lamely . " A place you 've never seen , and yet sometimes you sound almost homesick for it . Mab 's eyes widened . " That 's exactly how it feels ! " she agreed . " Like wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's as though I had been there as a very small child , too small really to remember , and yet  --  Are you sure I was n't ? " " Quite sure . " " And yet it 's as though I might remember if I saw it again . I ) o you think I could ? " " Remember ? " asked Virginia uneasily , wondering if she ought to change the subject , aware that changing the subjectp90was rarely any solution to the matter involved , divided between a wish somehow to get to the bottom of it with Mab and a doubt of the wisdom of encouraging her to dwell on her obsession even to discuss it in cold blood . " Remember ? " asked Virginia , with a slight frown on her serene brow . " No , silly , see it again ! Jeff used to promise I could go there some times  --  but now the war has upset everything , " Mab sighed . " I suppose it will end eventually , and we can do as we like again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go to Williamsburg because of the war you  --  " " Oh , I could n't do that , " Mab said positively . " That 's cheating . Not while you and Jeff and Mummy  --  everybody that matters-stay here , anyway . It 's only  --  before the war began there seemed to be some sense in hoping to see Williamsburg for myself . And now you ca n't count on anything , can you ! " " I see what you mean , " Virginia said gently , flooded again with pity for the young , trapped as she herself had never been in the old days , between uncertainty and despair . And she added with what she felt was base compromise with her own caution , " Williamsburg has been there a long time , through a lot of wars , has n't it . It will still be there , when this one ends . " " Well , yes , I suppose we can count on that ! " said Mab , more cheerfully . To Virginia , who had not been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love had been lived in Gloucestershire , and who at present was face to face with the second great war of her lifetime , what Evadne called Mab 's Williamsburgcomplex did seem a trifle fantastic and remote . Some day , when Hitler had been disposed of , it might be possible to look further into this lifelong obsession with a background which Mab knew only through her bloodstream , the involuntary recognition of a tie which went back throughp91Virginia herself to her mother who had married a Yankee and whose father was Julian 's grandson . It was a hundred and fifty years , more or less , back to Julian 's marriage with the woman in the portrait , only dimly recalled by Virginia , which had so startled Evadne by its resemblance to Mab . And even now , at the beginning of Hitler 's war , Virginia found herself anxious to talk to Evadne about it , anxious to ask her  --  well , what ? The travellers were expected at Farthingale by tea time , having arrived at Southampton the night before , and disembarkedinto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into policemen , biting their tongues by stepping off curbs they did n't know were there , falling into friendly taxi-cabs , reduced to whispers in the train under the light of the spectral blue bulbs which were all the railwayallowed , they finally reached London and their flat in Bayswater , where they found Jeff and Sylvia waiting , with the blackout done and all the lights on and hot food ready . Everybody asked questions at once . What sort of voyage was it , had they heard about the Athena while they were at sea , how had the passengers reacted , did they see any submarines  --  hadthere been any raids in England , what did Bracken think about Poland , could they still reach Johnny in Berlin ... . " We heard Chamberlain 's speech over the ship 's radio on the second day out , " Stephen said . " And then we got the news about the Athenia . And then they cut off the radio and even took away the portables from the passengers , which I think was a mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship so long as we were still neutral , " said Evadne . " The Germans would n't have dared to touch it . " " If they knew it was an American ship , " Jeff reminded them . " They could hardly make any mistake about that ! Thep92crew painted American flags on the sides and the hatchcoversas we went . The flag at the masthead was spotlighted at night and we ran with all our lights blazing ! " " Were n't you scared anyway ? " Sylvia asked . " We said we were n't . We promised each other that no submarine would fire into a neutral ship , much less one that wore that flag . But the bar was a pretty busy place , I thought , and there was a certain tendency to sit around with lots of company . And when we got to Southampton and could n't see a thing  --  I listened . Every taxi-motor cocked my errs like a bird-dog 's ! " " Buses are the worst , " said Sylvia . " I think they r ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had any raids in England ? " Evadne sounded almost disappointed , for the war was a week old . " Wait , " Jeff said . " Wait till Poland is finished . It wo n't be long now . " " But surely the Germans ca n't be doing all they claim in Poland , " Stephen objected , having read the evening papers . " Nazis are only men . They must be dead beat , hot and tired and hungry . And their machines must run down . What are they using for petrol ? " " We 've stopped talking like that over here , " Jeff replied wearily . " They do n't run down , neither men nor machines , they keep on going . They are at the gates of Warsaw . It 's for real . They 're doing it . " " Verdun held out , " said Stephen , still arguing by the book of rules . " And Madrid . And there was the Marne , too . " " And Wellington won at Waterloo , " Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are n't we doing anything , on our side ? " " Look , it 's eight hundred and fifty miles by air from England to Poland , " Jeff pointed out with patience which was a little overdone . " And you have to fly across Germanyp93to get there . And the Polish aerodromes are already destroyed . No plane that got there could re-fuel and get back . Somebody should have thought of that . " " Then why do n't we bear down on the Western Front ? " Stephen insisted . " That 's for General Gamelin to say . He 's in charge there . " " But the British are in France now  --  " " Just arriving . And quick work too . " " Maybe General Gort will start something . " " Gort is under the French command . It 's still Gamelin 's show in France , " Jeff said . " Is he any good ? " " I ask myself , " Jeff said . On that Sunday morning Evadne and Stephen went round to the warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it occupied by the same tweedy Miss Piggott and her nephew Mr. Tilton , a dour young man with enormous spectacles . They seemed very glad to have her back , and their greeting was a little extra cordial to make up for having entertained doubts as to whether she would have the guts to return to England when she did n't have to . For an hour or so they briefed her on the ARP developmentswhile she was away , and discussed the strange exhilaration , which one must not give way to , of not being bombed . Miss Piggott was of the dark opinion that They Had SomethingUp Their Sleeves  --  with Something Worse implied . Mr. Tilton thought that London was sure to catch it as soon as Warsaw fell , which would be any day now . And when the Post Warden came in , a stout jolly type who might not have been quite sober , they boiled a kettle on the spirit-stove and had cups of tea all round and told funny stories  --  mostly apocryphal  --  about the blackout and the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Post Warden , whose name was Smedley , to pop down to the country at once , before petrolp94rationing began , if she wanted to see her mother . The war would still be here when she got back , he promised . It was nearly lunch time when they borrowed Jeff 's twoseater , as their own car had been left at Farthingale , and made a quick tour of the West End before starting for Gloucestershire . The Sunday morning parks were full of relaxed people in deck-chairs , reading the Sunday papers , with their gas-masks in their little brown boxes on the ground beside them . Nearby , industrious people were filling sandbagsfrom great craters dug in the turf . The A.A. gun emplacementswere fully manned inside their tidy sandbag redoubts , and the ground crews of the barrage balloons sunned themselves in their little encampments on the broad green lawns beneath their serene silver charges . The paper strips which had been pasted on the plate glass windows of the big stores to absorb concussions made ingenious designs which had been planned and executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow gas detectors at the street corners , and the Palace Guard had come out in khaki , their towering bearskins and scarlet coats laid away for the duration . All of Whitehall , and the Cenotaph , and the entrances to hotels and clubs and stores were banked high with sandbagslike the wardens ' posts . " You feel as though it 's just a movie , " said Evadne suddenly . " The whole of London has turned itself into a set for The Shape of Things to Come . " " The theaters are closed ! " Stephen suddenly realized it . " I knew I missed something ! No cinemas , even . What will they do for work , all these people ? Besides  --  everybody needs shows . They went to the theater all through the raids in the last war . " " I bet they are n't going to shows in Warsaw now . " " We 're not in Warsaw . Anyway , Hitler can never get at London to bomb it the way he can Warsaw . The Channel isp95between , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own defence system . " " You do n't think we 'll catch it , then ? " " Sure we 'll catch it ! But we 're not set down in the middle of a flat plain at Germany 's doorstep . England is still an island . That 's bound to make it harder . " And England had never looked more English than when they drove to Farthingale that sunny afternoon . Petrol rationing was due at the end of the month , but today every roadside tea-house was busy , especially those with tables set outside in a garden . As they neared the end of the journey Evadne raised the question they had not yet solved . " What are we going to do about Mab ? " she asked at last . " She is going to ask a lot of queer questions about Williamsburg . Your mother was afraid it ought n't to be encouraged . " " Let 's see what your mother says . " " I suppose we must just give her the books and pictures we brought , and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harmless sort of game  --  I hope , " said Stephen . " Give her something to dream about . Every kid needs that , especially now . How about the pictures of the portraits , though ? Should she see those ? " " We 'll ask Mummy first . " They had had the portraits of Tibby and Julian photographedin order to bring the disturbing likenesses home to Virginia , who had been away from Williamsburg so long . But they doubted the wisdom of allowing Mab to identify herself with Tibby Mawes , and the reproductions had been kept separate from the parcel of souvenirs they had brought for her collection , to which Jeff and Sylvia had been adding for years . When they saw her again , running to meet the car as it pulled up at the front steps of the house , her knitted jumper and tweed skirt and her childish animation a little dispelled the look of Tibby which they had anticipated . It was whenp96she was silent and thoughtful that the likeness to the painted face was most noticeable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual kid of thirteen . At first all her questions were about immediate matters such as what Jeff thought about the war now , and how was Sylvia , and had they seen any submarines , and when was Jeff coming down for a week-end 's rest  --  and what was it like in London now , and had they heard any sirens , and was Evadne really going to be a warden with an arm-band and a helmet , and had Jeff stopped looking worn to a frazzleThey told her about Jeff going up to Glasgow to see the Athenia survivors , and about Sylvia 's job with NARPAC  --  the National ARP for Animals Committee  --  and how recklesslypeople had been having their pets put to sleep without waiting to see if it was necessary , and how bitterly many of them already regretted it . And they tried to tell how London looked , sand-bagged , paper-stripped , and blacked out for the raids that had not yet begun . They comforted Virginia with a description of the cosy warden 's post in Bayswater , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against blast , furnished inside with some old but useful chairs and tables , an electric kettle , plain crockery , and a tin biscuit box  --  even a private lavatory , which was very posh for that neighborhood  --  and the jolly old Post Warden who did n't throw his weight about and did n't object if somebodyhappened to drop in at tea time , and was himself perhaps not always quite sober ... . And they in turn heard about Mona , sleeping with her ambulance nowadays , she said , and not hearing a peep out of Michael since he joined his ship , but not seeming to worry about that in her shining confidence that nothing could possiblyhappen to a man who was so much loved as he was  --  and about Nigel 's dull warden 's beat at the Temple , and about the evacuees in the village , and about the Bank girlsp97in the house , who had proved to be not such a nuisance as you might think ... . Then Evadne produced the presents and pictures they had brought Mab and they watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family picnic at Jamestownjust before Stephen and Evadne left for New York she returned to again and again . The presence of the stone wall between the water and the grassy shore seemed to bother her . " It spoils it , " she said more than once . " You ca n't hear the River now . It 's spoiled . " " Hear the River ? " Virginia repeated , watching her , and Evadne glanced at Stephen and he shook his head . " Yes , when the wind is up you could hear the River against the bank , " said Mab , as though they ought to have known that without being told , and now Virginia 's eyes met Evadne 's , and they both looked away quickly as though Mab might read their thoughts . " We could n't find a trace of the Green Spring house you wrote about , " Evadne remarked then . " We saw the ruins of Jamestown church , but  --  " " Green Spring is n't on the Island , " Mab said quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over the other side of the road , before you come to the ford  --  " She hesitated , and frowned . " No  --  after you pass the turning to the ford . I ca n't be sure . The wounded were all over the lawn there after the battle , " she added casually , and Evadne said , to test her , " What battle ? " " Jamestown , " said Mab matter-of-factly . " It was the last before Yorktown , you know . Lafayette was there . " Again she paused with a slight frown , her eyes resting on the picturesspread out before her , seeming almost to read from them the words she spoke . " Julian was riding courier for him . General Wayne made a fool of himself , it was almost an ambush  --  we had to fight and fall back , up the Neck after dark , and they moved the wounded in anything that wouldp98carry them  --  even wheel-barrows -- the lanterns were like fireflies  --  the aides clanked about looking for each other and swearing  --  there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and horse  --  it was hot , and some of the horses fell down and could n't get up again , and the wounded in the wagons groaned and cursed and begged for water  --  there were n't enough surgeons , and they were all over blood , like butchers  --  it was a miracle how the officers kept themselves so neat , no matter what happened in the field  --  Lafayette 's lace was always fresh  --  Julian was always shaved and tidy  --  the British wore powder in their hair , even on the march  --  the French uniforms were all white , with colored pipings , and their flags  --  the French regimental flags were beautiful  --  when the French came to Williamsburg before Yorktown it was like a garden-party , everyone wore their best clothes all the time  --  the day Washington 's army marched out at dawn to begin the siege we heard the drums as they went through the streets  --  " The radio which had been playing light music quietly in the corner spoke suddenly with its usual authority : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it said crisply , and Evadne rose at once to turn up the volume . Virginia realized they had all been sitting motionless , hardly breathing , while they listened to Mab . She watched anxiously while the announcer 's dreadful formula : " The defence of Warsaw continues .... " brought them ruthlessly back to the present , and she saw Mab come into focus without visible effort , unaware of what she had done before them all in those few moments of revelation . It was like sleep-walking , thought Virginia , and might have been difficult to adjust to if it had had some other awakening . Here was the most complete evidence of Mab 's secret world that anyone had yet witnessed , and while the announcer'svoice flowed on , Virginia sat staring at the radio cabinet , pretending to hear , hoping that when the Newsp99finished they need not return to the subject of Williamsburg that evening . Memory was stirring in Virginia now , bringing up long forgotten family legends  --  had anyone ever told Mab , she was wondering , that Julian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have seen the lanterns and heard the wounded ? Jeff probably knew the story , he might have mentioned it to Mab long ago , so that it became embedded in her subconscious .... Fitz would remember it too , and might have told Evadne ... . When the News ended Mab had apparently forgotten where they had left off , and it was possible to divert the conversation , perhaps a little feverishly , while Evadne helped her gather up the pictures and postcards , and Mab made no objection to leaving it all behind in the drawing room when her bedtime came . Unconscious of having unnervedthem all , she kissed everybody good-night and went upstairs . Evadne went with her , casually , an arm around her waist , left her at the door of the room Mab was sharing with Virginia to make room for the guests , and returned at once to the drawing-room with the photographs of the portraits . Entering on a silence , she laid them without comment in front of Virginia , who at once said , " Good Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still say she could have read it  --  about the surgeons and the horses , even , " Stephen insisted , striving for sanity . " She has memorized dozens of history books by now . " " She could have , " Evadne conceded generously . " And what history book says that you could always hear the River against the bank when the wind was up ? " " Now , listen to me , the both of you , " Virginia said firmly . " We must be sensible about this . Jeff might have told her about the River  --  " " Except that he was n't there either , before the sea-wall went in  --  which happened to be about 1900 , " said Evadne.  | " He might have heard about it from somebody like Fitz , then , when he was there as a boy , " Virginia argued . " Fitz goes back to 1900 . Did you talk to Jeff about this while you were in London ? " " No . Frankly , I did n't have the nerve in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mummy , you 're losing your grip , " Evadne said kindly . " Sylvia is Jeff 's wife . And Tibby was Julian 's . And Jeff is Julian . Somehow I came over all self-conscious about the whole thing . Mab is just a kid now . But she 's going to grow up . We do n't want to plant any ideas . Anywhere . " " Mother goes so far as to suggest it might be better if Mab never saw Williamsburg , " Stephen said . " She feels it would be asking for trouble . " " Well , I do n't know about that , " Virginia sighed . " Do you think anything we do or do n't do will make much difference in the long run ? The trick has already been played on Mab . Call it heredity . We ca n't undo that . " And they all went off to bed , not knowing , because Evadne had been afraid to ask , that Jeff was the first to see that Mab was cast in Tibby 's mold.  |p101N  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to London for Christmas , Virginia felt obliged to set an example and leave Mab behind when she made a shopping trip early in December . Furious German threats of secret weapons and blood baths and even of an actual invasion of England had come to nothing at all , and there had been only false alarms in London so far . But when a week before she planned to start , Russia fell upon Finland there was a general impression that the somnambulistic pause in the war since Poland surrenderedmight be at an end . One of the things everyone found hardest to bear was the loss of easy communication and travel . One felt utterly cut off . Virginia said she thought she would burst if she could n't get up to Town and see and hear for herself what was going on and what people were saying . " You ca n't but feel that somebody must know something if you could only shake it out of them , " she said to Rosalind , who drove her to the station the day she left , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties to spend Christmas in London with Charles . " Just wait till I catch Bracken , he 's been to Paris and Geneva , where Johnny and102Camilla came to meet him , and it ca n't all be Hush-hush ! " " I suppose you ca n't blame people for manufacturing rumors to fill up the vacuum the BBC creates , " Rosalind agreed . " What now ? That little man with the Ray again ? " " Now there will be five hundred bombers every fifteen minutes for twenty-four hours , to knock out our ports and railway centers , " Rosalind recited solemnly as they drew up in the station yard . " Would n't they get in each other 's way ? England 's a small country . " Virginia kissed her and stepped out of the car . " Who starts these things  --  fifth columnists ? Thank you for the lift . Keep an eye on Mab , wo n't you . I 'll get hold of Charles at once and bring him up to date on things here . And I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will . And bring me a siren suit , " said Rosalind , waving her off . Virginia found London emerged from its first buttoned-up tension of waiting for raids , and except for the blackout and the sandbags and the taped windows and the A.A. guns in the parks , the West End was pretty much itself in a weird sort of way . Theaters and cinemas were re-opening with earlier , staggered hours , and Bracken had got tickets for them to see Design for Living at the Savoy . Restaurants were busy and people got about somehow , even at night , when the moon assumed an importance it had not enjoyed for generations . And yet to Virginia 's loving eyes , London was tired , strained , and trying only to behave sanely while living in a bad dream . Wearing a war correspondent 's uniform for the third time in his life , Bracken had just returned from the Continent and British Headquarters near Arras , which he said was full of obliging lady spies in wait for foreign journalists at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay in the possession of an RAF bomber contingent . Johnny atp103Geneva said that Germany was dreary , bitterly cold , and severely rationed , and that despite Hitler 's success in Poland there was little enthusiasm for the war . " By the way , " said Bracken to Virginia at dinner on her first night in Town , " it was Tracy Marsh in Warsaw . " " Bound to be , " said Virginia without blinking . " They seem to have lost him now , though . He went back there and has not been heard of since the surrender . He could have got out through Rumania with the remnants of the Polish Government , Johnny thought , but in that case he should have turned up in Paris by now . Ambassador Biddle is there , so I inquired on my way back , and they had no news of him . Everybody very cagey . Nobody knew what he was up to in Poland , or said they did n't . Must have been a Government job , though . Johnny said not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's alive , we ca n't help . If he is n't  --  we ca n't help . " " No , " said Virginia , not looking at him . " Why did n't they use gas in Poland , do you think ? " " There was no necessity . German mechanized equipment was paralyzing enough . The Poles had cavalry instead of tanks  --  horses , mind you , against the Panzer troops ! And a handful of old-fashioned planes against the Luftwaffe . " " Then you think gas might still be a last resort , if they could n't win any other way . " Bracken hesitated . " We ca n't assume they wo n't use it here , trying for a quick decision , if that 's what you 're asking , " he said . " Englandis a different proposition altogether . They ca n't get at it , except by air . " " Yes , " said Virginia , finding that she had very little appetite . " I see . " Bracken had no patience with the fashionable attitude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mentality pained him . He knew that good use was being made in England ofp104the time during which the Germans failed to carry out their promised attack . And Virginia was impressed when she visited the various members of the family at their posts in London . Stephen had gone out with a concert party to entertain the troops , and Evadne was alone at their flat , except when Mona used the spare room for a night , so Virginia stayed with her instead of in Upper Brook Street with Dinah and Bracken . Evadne 's warden 's post had stuck doggedly to its routine throughout the autumn , like all the others , in spite of some short-sighted criticism and derision by the sort of people who would be the first to demand service if the need for it arose . Virginia was made welcome when she went round to the basement to see how Evadne spent her hours on duty  --  Evadne was popular with her associates , especially with Smedley the Post Warden , who had always an eye for a pretty face and was thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their uniforms had not come yet  --  they had only a black helmet , which Evadne wore cocked at the Beattie angle , and an armlet and a silver badge , won by a stiff course of First Aid and gas-lectures and a detailed knowledge of every house and fire hydrant and dead end in their sector . They were prodded out of their boredom by periodic practice drills staged realistically to test their memory and wits in supposed emergency . " I do n't really know which is worse , " Evadne said , as they prepared for bed the first night of Virginia 's visit . " Hanging about on duty , knitting , trying to read , making cups of tea , listening to tiresome stuff on my portable radio  --  or the mock raids they get up every now and then to relieve the stagnation . An umpire pops along to the post and says such and such a point has theoretically been bombed or set on fire , and we 're supposed to get the right equipment there in the shortest possible time , and pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches from the floor and bring outp105an unconscious casualty , or some such nonsense . You do feel such a fool , and there are solemn post-mortems with the umpire afterwards about what you did wrong and should have done instead . I 've an idea the bombs are n't going to do what 's expected of them either . After all , they have n't rehearsed it with us , they 're going to have ideas of their own about exploding . " " And how do you get an unconscious person out of a burningroom ? " Virginia asked , taking an unwilling but fascinated interest . " Have n't they told you ? Tie his hands together and hook them round your neck and drag him . " " I see , " said Virginia , repressing a shudder . " I manage all right with that one . But it 's really too much for old Smedley , though he 'd never admit it , and Miss Piggottis too fat . Sometimes I think I ought to leave wardening and get a more useful job . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then I take another look at the collection of crocks at our post and decide to stay . I 'm the only ablebodiedone there , as a matter of fact . Tilton ca n't see a foot in front of him without his specs and he ca n't wear them inside a gas-mask , so he 'd be next to useless in smoke , or even in the dark . You ca n't wear eye-black inside a mask , either , I suppose you know  --  if it ran and made your eyes water you 'd be done . Now , that 's a hardship , if you like ! I feel very unfinished without it ! " " Evadne  --  I do n't want to be embarrassing  --  but may I say I think you 're wonderful ? " " Why , thank you , Mummy , it 's nice to hear a little praise for a change , " said Evadne , and put her arms around Virginia for a hearty kiss . " I 'm lucky , really , because on our post we get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one down the road is saddled with a woman who happened to see somethingof the war in Snain , and she never lets them forget it , besides a couple of foreigners who have had a bad timep106already and are sure to go to pieces . We may be a little on the dull side where I am , but we all pull together and nobody puts on any airs . " Virginia paid a call too at the Animal First-Aid Post , which was manned at all times as conscientiously as the human ARP . Things seemed if possible even more futile there as the long lull continued , but there was no slackening of effort in the paper work to publicize their plans and put a stop to the hasty sacrifice of pets which had gone on in the early days of the war . They were established in the back room of a bookshop , where a half dozen unpaid volunteers like Sylvia had furnisheda corner for themselves with donated chairs and a table , and had made pens out of cardboard boxes , a few fruit-crates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had collected assorted drinking bowls and feeding dishes which had seen better days in the kitchens and pantries of their friends , and had stored various kinds of food in all shapes and sizes of tins . They had a cupboard which housed a small supply of medicines and dressings and splints , and the local vet had given them instruction in how to use the remedies he had himself supplied . They had gone round the neighborhood with a notebook and registered all the animals for a numbered disc to be attached to its collar or cage , and they solicited donations shamelessly . Virginia emptied her change purse on the table , and looked round the stuffy , ill-lighted room , crowded with improvised comfort for the helpless creatures who so far knew no apprehension , and felt a stinging in her eyelids . " I do n't want to sound ridiculous , " she said . " But may I say I think you 're wonderful ? " " Why , thank you ! " said the girl who was sharing the shift with Sylvia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mona was doing her night duty that week . She had a little the best of it so far , Virginia thought , in quarters in what hadp107been a pleasant upstairs cafe next door to the garage where the ambulances slept . Tin hats , gas-masks , and rubbery gasrepellentsuits hung in redolent rows at the entrance . Inside , except for the cots and sleeping-bags which occupied most of the floor space , it was rather like a club , with a table full of magazines and books , a radio always turned on , a small canteen , a dart game , and a few odd chairs , none of them very comfortable . The girl ambulance drivers , wearing the dark blue sweaters and trousers of the corps , were knitting , reading , and nappingwhen Virginia looked in round midnight . Mona laid aside Gone With the Wind , which she said would last out the war if she was careful , and made introductions , and asked for news of Gloucestershire and America . Enrolled in what might become the most exacting and hazardous service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a bad war , even including the occasional yellow signals which meant a stand-to , never knowing if this time it was real . And here too the monotony was systematically relieved by practice-runs with make-believe casualties who could never refrain from wise-cracks . A driver had to know her way through the blackout over a large district of London . It would be her duty to stand by the target fires with her car , waiting for a load while more stuff came down , and then dodge through the streets to the nearest hospital , and return as fast as possible to the scene of what was officially known as the incident , for another load . " But when you can back a loaded ambulance while wearing a gas-mask , in the blackout , with the inspector sitting in the seat beside you , and not foul it all up , everything else is easy ! " Mona assured her happily . Virginia asked about Michael , because with the unexpected quiet on the so-called fighting fronts , everybody was hoping for Christmas leave for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brunt of things as usual.  | " Lots of people are planning to get married on Christmas leave , " said Mona , with a sigh . " I do n't know  --  I have n't heard for a long time now . But if he does turn up , I 'm not going to stand for any more nonsense ! " Nigel at his warden 's post in the Temple was in fairly congenial company , but felt very thwarted and elderly and superfluous . Urged to come to Farthingale for Christmas , he looked haunted and unhappy and said he thought not , thanks . And then , reaching out to her with compunction , " I 'd be a death 's head , Mummy . You 'll do better without me . " Virginia stood clasping his hand in both hers , and swallowedwith difficulty before she spoke . " Nigel , you ought n't to be like this . I do n't want to be tiresome  --  but it 's time you stopped sulking . " " Sulking ! " He stared at her , outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very careful about words . " She kissed him , and went away , without withdrawing it . From there she took a bus to Woolworth 's and bought the small toys and trinkets for the evacuees ' tree , and then she stopped at Dinah 's WVS office , which was tidy and efficient and more philosophical than the rest , as evacuation still furnishedthem with plenty of problems to keep them from going stale . " I feel very frivolous , " she said as she rose to go without taking up more than a few minutes of Dinah 's time . " Doing Christmas shopping while everybody else slaves at a war job . I 've finished at Woolworth 's and now there 's only the family left to do . " " There 's not supposed to be extravagance about gifts any more , " Dinah reminded her firmly . " I know . I thought some Fortnum goodies in bottles and tins for the store cupboards  --  warm things to wear  --  and things that are getting scarce like electric torches and batteries  --  "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And thermos flasks , if you can find them . And get yourself a siren suit , they 're heavenly if you have to turn out in the night . All in one piece , with a hood . " " Rosalind wants one too , we wear the same size . Where 's the best place to go ? " The conversation , though brief , became technical . Before she returned to Farthingale , bitter cold had set in , and Finland seemed the grim answer to the dreadful query , What Next ? which had overhung them all since the Polish surrender . If Finland went under , which seemed inevitable , it would be the eighth small nation in two years to be obliterated by dictator tactics . " This Christmas will be even stranger than last year , " said Mab as they sat in Virginia 's room wrapping toys for the children 's tree on the night of Virginia 's return from London . " Will any of the family be able to come away from Town , do you think ? " " Whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofas and what-not , " said Virginia cheerfully . " Unless some of the Bank get leave to go home , which could happen , please God . " " Anne Phillips has n't got much of anywhere to go , " Mab said thoughtfully . " She said I could call her Anne . Before she came here she lived with some kind of cousins that she does n't seem to care about . I like her the best of our lot . I 'd like to invite her to be one of our family for Christmas . " " If you like , " Virginia agreed , for the girl 's gentle humor and reticence appealed to her too . " But that means we will have to take in any of the rest of them that are stuck here , along with her . " " Would n't we have to anyway ? " " Oh , dear , I suppose so , " Virginia sighed . " It ca n't be much fun for them either . " " It 's funny how some of them just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Claudia Merton , moping around about her precious Harold when he 's still safe in England anyway  --  and then look at Mona , I bet there 's never a peep , out of her about Michael ! " " Miss Merton has been awfully good with the children in the village , " Virginia pointed out fairly , for Claudia had coaxed and bullied and bribed the little evacuees into learning a Christmas play to be presented in the Parish Hall on the twenty-second , which was a Saturday . " She 's taken endless trouble with those poor little snotty-nosed infants , I 'm afraid I never would even have tried . " " Yes . I do n't think they thank her for it , " Mab said with her sometimes frightening penetration . " I think they 'd much rather be let alone to bore themselves in their own way . " " Perhaps . But with the weather what it is now , though we must n't mention that where Hitler can hear , they ca n't be turned outside to play and something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go mad . " " Shall we all have to go to the performance on Saturday and applaud ? " asked Mab resignedly , knowing the answer . " Certainly we shall . " " Do n't tell them that in London , they might not come at all . " " How can you ? " cried Virginia , pretending to be shocked . " When the poor girl has tried so hard ! " " The vackies are all crazy about you , " Mab reminded her . " And you never lift a finger at them . " " I do , I do ! I 've had countless working-parties to make flannellette nighties for them , and I 've sat up with Rosalind devising a way to feed them better in batches , and we 've swapped them round in their lodgings to get them satisfied and break up feuds  --  " " But you do n't bother them , " Mab explained placidly . " For their own good , I mean . " " Because with an American income I can satisfy my con/science by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerking a red bow into place on the knobby parcel a toy anti-aircraft gun made no matter how you wrapped it . " I hope we 're right to give them these modern war-machines to play with . I can remember when one bought a whole model farm , tree by tree and cow by cow , for the young . Nowadays you set up a miniature war on the nursery floor cven to barrage balloons and barbed wire and dugouts . It ca n't be good for their what-you-may-call-its . Even the dolls are in uniform this year ! " " Yes , I 'm glad I was young before it began , " Mab nodded , looking down from her new teens . " I had a toy garden , remember  --  it would be fun to get it out again , just for old times if Sylvia comes . " And if Jeff comes , she thought secretly . She and Jeff had chosen most of the garden together  --  tree by tree , just as Virginia had said , and three-inch lengths of cream-colored balustrade and inch-square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bracken surely would n't send Jeff to Finland now  --  there was already a staff man in Rome and in Brussels  --  Bracken had recently gone to Geneva himself  --  andit was n't as though the raids on London had started ... . Like everyone with any sense , Mab was quite aware that the raids would start some time . The war could not be won by sitting behind fortified lines on the Continent . And Germanynever packed up , Bracken said . The Germans were used to hardship , they had known nothing else for twenty-five years . Germans did n't miss peace and security and freedomto do as they pleased with their lives , because they had n't had it to lose , last September . Bracken said it was childish of people to count on the Germans ' cracking , or starting underground plots to get rid of Hitler . They believed in Hitler , and so far , said Bracken , he had delivered the goods . The Germans would not givep112up Hitler until he was hauled out of the Siegfried Line by the scruff of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlain had recently told the House that the war might last three years , which would be September , 1942 , and Virginia had at once recalled that when Kitchener said the same thing in 1914 he underestimated the Germans even then . And what would it be like , Mab wondered , tying up a Red Cross nurse doll , for these Birmingham children in the villageto go home after three years away , after they had got used to the country and had got fond of the people they were staying with ? The little ones would n't remember anything else . After three years nobody would be able to remember exactly what it was like before last September  --  except as Virginia remembered the time before the Kaiser 's war , like a different world . And after the raids came , they might not have homes to go to , their parents might not be alive to claim them , and their war-time hosts , many of them very unwilling still , might find themselves saddled forever with what began as an emergency duty . Mab had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German bombers had finished with it , and she understood that British cities might look the same in a few months ' time . When the crocuses bloomed again , they said , Hitler would strike at England . March was his month . He always broke loose then . It was horrifying to find oneself dreading the spring . The uncertainty , Mab thought , feeling it like a cold draught down the back of her neck . The daily knife-edge of not knowing . It must have taken courage for Evadne to come back from Williamsburg to the warden 's post in Bayswater . I could n't have done it , Mab thought humbly . I 'd have made some humiliating , transparent excuse and stayed safe in America . But then , I 'm a coward . . . . " Mona is hoping Michael may get leave for Christmas , " Virginia was saying , for she felt the silence had lasted longp113enough . " Nobody knows where he has got to by now , of course . " " Will they get married if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Michael has other ideas . He 's afraid of coming back maimed and useless . Most of them dread that as much as dying , I think , if they really stop to think about it . They used to say in the last war that everybody has their own particular secret nightmare  --  blindness , amputation , disfigurement , fire  --  " " Or the roof falling in , " said Mab , and her eyes were lowered to the tissue paper in her hands . " If I were ever in a raid that 's what I 'd think of first . I 'd hate more than anythingbeing in an underground shelter , for fear it would all come down on top of me . " " That 's claustrophobia , " said Virginia , deliberately unemotional . " Some people have it so badly they ca n't even bear going into a lift . " And she thought , So that 's what 's been going on behind her face all this time . I knew there must be something  --  nobody could be as unconcerned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never give me a clue . They 've got such pride , not to let you know they 're afraid . We were n't like that , we 'd have confided more and let ourselves be comforted . Or would we ? How do I know how I would have reacted to all this , it had n't been dreamed of when I was Mab 's age . Even when the Zeppelins came over , it was nothing like this . Even when it happened in Spain , we never really thought of it in terms of London . It was all waiting  --  building up  --  for Mab . I must say something , I must keep on talking , what can I offer her , how can I help , I must n't shirk this , perhaps she ought to be drawn out now that it 's come up at last " Tell me more about London , " Mab said steadily , closing the crack again . " What else have they done , in London ? " " Well , I told about the sandbags , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the pillar boxes are allp114ringed with white and have yellow gas-detector paint on top . Curbs and traffic islands are checkerboarded black and white , it 's quite gay , really , in the daytime . When you come out of hotels or theaters into the blackout the commissionaire says , Three steps , madam , ' as though you were blind . There 's no more evening dress , women go dancing in uniform , even in trousers . Everybody 's likely to sing Run , Rabbit , Run as it gets towards closing time . The pigeons are still on duty , and the policemen . But the policemen wear blue steel helmets and gas-masks  --  " " And the pigeons have n't got any , " said Mab . Virginia bit her lip . Nothing was safe to say any more . Had Sylvia thought about the pigeons ? One gas raid and the pavement would be thick with dead pigeons ... . All because of one man  --  one bloody awful little man called Hitler ... . As Christmas drew near , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of Government pleas and warnings , and most of the bereaved country households found it hard to refrain from encouraging it , if only for a few days ' respite from unaccustomed crowding , confusion , dirt , and dissension  --  to say nothing of regaining a spare room for a relative on leave . There were children who preferred to stay with their sometimes embarrassed hosts , and were yanked back to London anyhow . There were wives who wanted to go back and whose husbands wanted them to stay away . And there were violent quarrels between parents who took oppositeviews on where the children should spend Christmas . Virginia 's thankfulness for her eight adult Bank guests increased when six of them proved to have devoted families and all wangled trips home for the holidays , while Claudia and Anne gratefully accepted the invitation to share the Farthingale festivities . It was the last feast while this ab/normally normal interval lasted , before rationing and economyset in in dead earnest . Bracken and Dinah elected to stay in London where they had so many friends who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country for a few days . Jeff 's mother Phoebe and her second husband Oliver found oppositenumbers with London ties to cover their Red Cross and warden jobs for the Christmas week-end . Stephen was pinned down with a Christmas show in the North and Evadne was released from duty by Smedley , who was in a visibly convivial mood , to join him there . Everyone 's plans were of course hedged thickly round with ifs and buts , and a single raid could have thrown them all endwise . The moon would be full on Christmas Eve , which was a blessing for those who wanted to travel , even across London to a party , but at the same time everyone realized that it might tempt Hitler 's bombers to open the ball over England . It would be just like him , people said , to try to spoil Christmas . On Friday morning a telegram arrived at Farthingale : Homesick . Past-sick . A sofa will do . Arriving tea time today . Nigel . And Virginia caught herself singing . She had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult not to cling on to him because of his likeness to his father . Slender and fair , with a deceptive gravity which had once masked a very subtle wit , and which now since his sorrow was without the relief of drollery which made Archie such an enchanting companion , Nigel embodied for Virginia the very essence of all she had lost in 1918 . Just to look at Nigel she found comforting proof that such a man as Archie had once existed . Nigel 's choice of the Bar as a career , his manner of speaking even across a dinner table , his quick , legal turn of mind even on a joke , and particularly his profile in his barrister 's wig , twisted her heart between memory and present joy . And to have him turn homeward at last , volun/tarily and doubtless at some pains , made up more than a little for Evadne 's second absence on Christmas Day . Nigel arrived by the same train which brought Phoebe and Oliver , and having hoarded petrol for that purpose Virginia was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual way . With them as they descended from the train was a tall boy in Air Force blue , whom Virginia identified after a startled moment as her sister-in-law Clare 's youngest , Roger Flood , grown a foot since she last saw him , and carryinghimself with the easy grace of his Campion uncles . " I am a homeless orphan , " he announced tragically , posing before her on the platform . " I got holiday leave all of a sudden and there is no one to care . Nigel said you might give me a dry crust and a straw pallet by the fire . " " Fool , " said Virginia with affection , kissing him on tiptoe . " Where have all your rafts of relations got to ? " " Gone , " said Roger , drooping dramatically between her hands . " All gone with the wind , to Scotland and Wales and who knows where ! " " Seriously , " said Virginia , " does your mother know you 're out ? " " She 's in Edinburgh with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left . " She said to ring you up and ask , but Nigel said that nowadays we must n't use the telephone for idle gossip , so I just came . " " And I am delighted to have you , of course , " said Virginia , making swift mental calculations about sofas and blankets and bathrooms and butter . " You can amuse the Bank . " " The what ? " He stood still , dripping with bags . " I 've got two Bank secretaries left over  --  Anne Phillips and Claudia Merton . You 're just the thing . " " I 'll take Claudia , " said Roger , starting for the car . " She 's spoken for , by somebody named Harold , who is somewhere in the North . And the other one is nicer . "  | " I say , that reminds me ! Mona is getting married tomorrow ! " " That 's wonderful ! " said Virginia . " She finally talked him into it , " Roger said lightly . " He 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave he 'll have for ages , and almost nobody will be at the wedding , and it 's only a Registry Office do , and they 'll have to honeymoon at some hotel . None of that matters to Mona , she 's determined to have him anyhow . " " She 's in love with him ! " said Virginia . " She must be , " said Roger , piling the bags into the car . " Dinah and Bracken will see them married , so it will be legal , and nobody is to send them wedding presents till later because they 've no place to put them . May I drive ? " " If you 'll try to keep it on the ground , " said Virginia , getting in beside him . Roger 's nonsense had smothered other , more intimate greetings . Soon they were all gathered round the fire in the drawing-room inside the blackout , having tea with Mab . Virginia looked round at them with a rather tremulous smile  --  so many other Christmases , good and bad  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Phoebe , with her firm dimpled chin and the white streak in her hair , who had come out of Williamsburg so long ago for the coronation summer  --  there had been two coronations since then , not counting Edward VIII  --  and had fallen in love with Archie 's brother Oliver , and yet had married her Williamsburg cousin and borne his child , which was Jeff . Phoebe 's life was far more improbable than any of the two dozen novels she had written , Virginia was thinking , not for the first time . And not for the first time she entertained a secret speculation about Jeff 's part in it . To let Bracken raise Jeff as his heir to the newspaper made perfectly good sense in the closely knit family tradition , to be sure . Handicapped with a rheumatic heart from child/hood , Jeff could not have followed Oliver into the Army in any circumstances . But it meant that Jeff 's daily life was lived in Bracken 's spacious household and not in the small Westminster flat near the War Office which Phoebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other war . It meant that Jeff travelled abroad with Bracken and a tutor instead of receiving the English public school education he would have had as Oliver 's stepson . It meant that Jeff and his mother met like this , as fellow guests and relations , not as a family unit . And it occurred to Virginia to wonder , not for the first time , about Oliver , whose only child by his first marriage had become an acid spinster shirkingthe war by living with some rather doubtful friends in the Lake District , where there was absolutely nothing to bomb . It was conceivable that Oliver had been robbed of a companionshiphe might have valued , as Jeff grew up . But to look at him now , the soul of contentment , sitting as he always chose to do within reach of Phoebe , his brilliant , caressing gaze often on her face , anticipating the moment she finished her tea so that he could take the empty cup away , or the moment she was ready for a cigarette so that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years a man devotedly in love . And Phoebe ? Not the maternal type , certainly , and honest enough to admit it  --  true granddaughter of Louise Day , whose children always recognized without surprise or resentmentthat nothing ever mattered to her , really mattered , to her dying day , but their father . Once more , Virginia gave it up , baffled again by the obvious satisfaction of all concerned with the arrangement as it stood . It worked . It did n't deserve to , but it did . Jeff had a job , Bracken had an heir , Dinah had a son , and Phoebe and Oliver had each other . Just then , as though on cue , Jeff and Sylvia appeared , driving their little two-seater on petrol kept for the trip sop119they could leave it at Farthingale for the duration , going back by train . And soon it was time for drinks , and the two remainders of the Bank were brought in and introduced and given sherry in which to drink the healths of Mona and Michael , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , Virginia argued , there was never anything you could call news anyway , outside of Finland  --  and an almost pre-war relaxation briefly prevailed . " How well I remember the 1918 Christmas , " Phoebe was saying dreamily through the smoke from her cigarette , looking like a very modern oracle . And the Bank regarded her with interest and respect , for it had barely been born in 1918 , and yet she seemed almost as young as anybody . " Just think , Virginia  --  you and I can remember the first Peace Christmas from the old war . " " So can I , " said Jeff unexpectedly , and his eyes went to his stepfather and found his eyes waiting , and they smiled at each other . " It was the first time I saw Oliver . " " I never heard about that . " Mab 's interest in the family history roused at once , and she went to stand beside Jeff . " What happened ? " " I was tickled to death , " said Jeff simply . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia in intense surprise . And here I was under the impression that everybody but me had forgotten . ... Right here in this very room , twenty-one years ago , she thought . . . . Phoebe dropping to her knees to greet the selfpossessedlittle boy she had left in Dinah 's care  --  and Jeff when he had kissed his mother , advancing confidently to her new husband without an introduction , his face alight with something like recognition , giving the tall man in the redtabbeduniform both his hands , smiling , somehow proud  --  " It 's Oliver , " little Jeff said , as though the rest of them might not know . " My mother 's married to him . " And amid the general astonishment it was Oliver who gave them allp120the cue , casually accepting without any fuss that he was somehowalready known to the child Phoebe had borne to another man while rebelliously loving himself in spite of everything . But nothing came of it , Virginia was protesting silently to herself . We all noticed , but we all tried not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . Jeff already belonged to Bracken and Dinah , it never made any difference in their plans that he knew Oliver by a kind of instinct . Oliver taught him to ride , like a favorite uncle  --  gave him a dog  --  they were often together when Jeff was small , they must have talked about the bond between them as Jeff grew older , and about the newspaper , and Jeff 's strange divorce of the blood . That year Jeff was so ill  --  Oliver often sat with him , brought him presents , read to him . What did they say to each other then , Jeff lying in bed , Oliver sitting beside it in a big chair  --  talking and laughing together  --  they must have discussed Jeff 's destiny then , and faced it together . It was Oliver , Virginia discovered now in a blinding light  --  it was Oliver who stood behind Jeff , and somehow kept him straight on it ! Dear old dark horse Oliver , Archie 's favorite brother  --  Archie would have known  --  Archie would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . " All sorts of things happened , " Jeff was saying easily to Mab . " I learned how not to fall off a horse  --  much . I got my first dog . I had a lot of fun . " " You see , he 'd been living in New York with Dinah during the war , " Phoebe explained to Mab . " And that 's no place to have dogs and horses . It was n't Dinah 's fault . " " I always had a very good time with Dinah , " Jeff said instantly , and so he had , as far as it went . Melchett came in to say that dinner was served . Nigel , occupying what had been his father 's chair at , the end of the table opposite Virginia , felt once again the subtle enchantment of her company , and the love and contentment which was like a fragrance in the house she cherished asp121though it was one of her children . How very fortunate it was for them all , thought Nigel , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser evil of the Bank billeting , and allowed it to escape the devastation which sometimes accompanied the less desirable evacuees like the Birmingham children and mothers who were lodged roundabout the village . She had given freely of her time and energy and resources to the almost insoluble problems of the evacuees . It was only fair that she should have a little peace at the end of the day , of course , but it seemed that fairness had ceased to operate for the duration , and so one could only call it luck . Erect in her chair , smiling and serene , she looked neverthelessvery fine-drawn and weary  --  as who did n't , he reminded himself severely , curbing again his lifelong tendency to sentimentalize his mother , when she herself would have been the last to encourage or even passively to endure it . But he wondered once more , while carrying on a comfortable conversation with Phoebe on his right , why no one had ever contrived to marry Virginia during the long widowhood which had begun before she turned forty . Doubtless the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somme , or at Passchendaele . She was not the only woman of her generation to be wasted and lonely in the years between the wars . And now it was beginning all over again , and the cream would be skimmed off the new generation , just as things had begun to right themselves again a little , in England . And this time , even with American money to help out , the kind of life his mother had maintained at Farthingale would be finished , perhaps forever ... . At this moment she caught his eyes down the table and indicated the silent girl on his left , momentarily stranded by Roger 's interest in something Oliver was saying . Obediently , Nigel turned to his left , and encountered the most enormous eyes he had ever seen  --  grey , black-fringed , with the lidsp122deeply indented below the brows so that she looked as though she had just waked up , or had been crying . Anne . Well , she was young enough for last names not to matter now . Nigel had done no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss than Virginia , and in his solitude in chambers and his inactive war job he had acquired a somewhat elderly state of mind for thirty-one . While he was trying to think of something suitable to say to her , Anne relieved him of the necessity . " It 's like a play , " she said . " A play ? " he repeated densely . " All this . " Her small , embarrassed gesture embraced the whole house and its occupants . " Like  --  Noel Coward , al-most . " " What ? " said Nigel , rather horrified . " Well , I mean  --  " Her generous mouth spread into a rueful smile . " To you it 's an old story , you belong here . But to me , every day I live in this house is as though I had bought a ticket and the curtain had just gone up . You do n't see what I mean , do you . You do n't have any idea what it 's like to somebody who  --  who is n't at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said slowly , giving it his undivided attention in his flattering barrister 's way . " As a matter of fact , I was thinking something like that myself a minute ago  --  even though I am at home here . You mean it 's a survival from another world  --  a museum piece . " " You certainly ca n't call your mother a museum piece , " she said sensibly . " There was never anybody less obsolete . It 's just as I told her the first day I came here  --  I 've read about it , I 've bought tickets to it , and now here I am living in it , only  --  I do n't know my lines . " " And where did you live before you came here ? " he asked , with the kindly interest he always showed to children and kittens and earnest young women he had never seen before . " Wimbledon . With my cousins . It always sounds silly top123say it , but I 'm an orphan , and you need n't say you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's not sad any more . I was brought up by my mother 's aunt , if you can follow that , and it 's been very dull and dreary at times , but now that I 'm earning my way I felt I ought to go on living there at least long enough to pay them back a little money for keeping me all these years . " " Surely not as many years as all that ! " he protested , smiling . " Well , it seems a long time , " Anne said . " To all of us , I fancy . It 's a small house , and rather crowded . You 're a lawyer , are n't you . I suppose that 's why one instinctively tells you the story of one 's life , with some dim idea that you 'll see to it that everything comes out all right . " " Is that your impression of the law ? " He was amused . " Well , yes  --  as soon as the innocent man puts himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved from the gallows . " " And what gallows must I save you from ? " " From Wimbledon , maybe . " Her gaze faltered and dropped . " But you 've already done that , without trying . It can never be as bad again , because once I was here . " " That 's very charming of you , " said Nigel , a little at a loss , unaccountably touched . " I did n't intend to be charming , " she said briefly , and " I say , " said Roger on her other hand , " we 're organizing a Christmas party for the Observers ' Post on the hill tomorrow afternoon . There 's no petrol , so we 'll put the girls in the pony-cart with the food and the rest of us can go on bikes , and we 'll surprise them  --  " " Surprise them too much and we 'll get shot at , " said Jeff . " Well , it 's a very dull job up there with nothing to do , " Roger said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up a bit forthem . Virginia says we can have some sandwiches and mincepies , and tea in thermos bottles . You 'll go , wo n't you , Anne ? "  | " Yes , of course , " she said quickly . " I 've got some chocolate . I could give them that . " What a nice little creature it is , Nigel thought . Giving up her chocolate to a bunch of strangers on a cold job . I ' 71 buy her the biggest box of Cadbury 's best that I can find , with a pink ribbon on it , for a Christmas present . " You 'll have to carry out your errand of mercy in the morning tomorrow or get caught in the blackout , " Virginia reminded them . " Because in the afternoon we 're all going to the Parish Hall to see Miss Merton 's children do their Christmas play . " And there was nothing to do , with Claudia sitting right there , but express polite enthusiasm and acceptance . " Of course if we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the cart with a torch and Jeff could follow behind with a torch  --  " Roger reflected wistfully . " You 'll go in the morning , " said Virginia . " A pony-cart on the road after dark now is a good way to get killed . " In the old days when the family Christmas parties were really large , they used to roll up the rugs in the drawingroomand dance to the gramophone . Tonight they drank their coffee round the fire , content with conversation and the BBC Light Music till the nine o'clock News , which as usual told them nothing . Roger sat on the sofa beside Anne , watching her knit , and asking rather personal questions about her life before she came to Farthingale and her plans if ever she was free to leave again . He seemed to find it extraordinary that she had no particular ambitions beyond keeping her job and possibly working her way up to a really good secretaryship , and maybe some day having a little flat of her own somewhere in London  --  Kensington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get married ? " asked Roger , amused . " A pretty girl like you ? "  | " Well , now , whom would I marry ? " she asked sensibly . " Not got your eye on anybody ? At your age ? " " What do you mean , my age ? I 'm twenty-six . " " Old enough to look round , " said Roger . " I have looked round . And saw nothing to get excited about . " " Maybe you were n't looking in the right place . " " What 's wrong with wanting to be on my own ? If you 'd always had to share a room with somebody else you 'd understand that even the tiniest place of your own would look like heaven . " " So you would n't have a husband as a gift ! What are we coming to ! " said Roger , his masculine amour propre bristling . " I did n't say that , " she denied placidly , her eyes on her knitting . " Well , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Girls were never like this in my day . " And Nigel , watching them benevolently from Archie 's chair by the hearth , thought what an attractive pair they were to look at , secret and smiling on the sofa , and how without the war they would never have crossed each other 's paths or had a chance to find each other interesting . It 's going to level things off a bit , Nigel thought . I suppose that will be good for us , in the end . Of course it 's more than likely that she 'll never see Roger again . I wonder , Nigel asked himself with some chagrin , if that would be a good thing . Rather early the following morning Jeff left Sylvia still asleep and descended to the dining-room , where he found Oliver alone at the table eating breakfast . " Bacon ! " Oliver said , by way of greeting . " Stacks of it ! Ca n't think how she does it , we never see bacon in London and it 's not even rationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff , helping himself from the hot plates on the sideboard , and sitting down on OLiver 's left . " Better than the last war . Rationing did n't start till 1918 and things had got into a terrible state . " " I wonder why we say the last war , " Jeff ruminated . " It was anything but . " " It 's not going to be the Great War , either , much longer . This one will be far greater , once it gets going . " " The late war , " said Jeff experimentally . " The other war . The little war . The little , old war . " " The Kaiser 's war , " said Oliver . " And now Hitler 's war . Render unto Caesar , why not . " " Caesar would n't own either one of ' em if you gave it to him , I 'm thinking . " They ate in companionable silence for some minutes . " Well , how does it feel ? " Oliver asked then , lighting a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You told me I 'd have a box seat for the next war , if I went ahead with Bracken on the newspaper , " Jeff recited obediently . " And that I 'd never regret it , and would n't change places with you then . And so I did , and I have , and I do n't , and I would n't . But it feels pretty scarey , now that the time has come . " " I know . You have n't got a lot of other fellows doing the same thing at the same time , the way it is in the Army . " " Maybe that 's it , " Jeff agreed . " It feels scarey that way too , " said Oliver , and Jeff looked at him with surprise and disbelief . " You mean to sit there with your record , and tell me  --  " he began , and his quiet voice rose a half tone . " Record , what 's that worth ! " Oliver waved away the double row of ribbons he was entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the whistle blows . I can promise you one thing , though . When you 've had your first bomb you 'll be all right . " And then , as Jeff only stared at him quizzically  --  " Oh , you wo n't stop being scared . There 's no cure for that . But you can deal with it . You 'll be all right . " " We 've had some false alarms in London , " Jeff reminded him . " And every time the siren goes I  --  " He broke off , jabbing at a piece of toast with his fork . " That 's because they were only false alarms . Wait till it 's happened once , Jeff , and then tell me you ca n't take it and I 'll listen . " " You always listen , " said Jeff humbly and gratefully . " And I always believe what you say  --  until now . I thought  --  since you must have been under fire so many times your-self  --  " " You thought I might have discovered some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is n't one . Oh , in the old days of cavalry charges , once the troop was in motion behind you , you got a sort of battle-joy from sheer excitement . To stand still under fire is harder . To be a sitting duck , as you are in an air raid , is still worse . I grant you that . But after the first one  --  you 'll know where you are , I 'll guarantee it . " " Are you going to let Mother stay in Town when the raids start ? " " What choice have I got ? " Oliver spread his hands . " She nursed in Belgium  --  she was here under the Zeppelins  --  she knows she 's as good a soldier as I am . Women , " said Oliver , " can be braver than men . True , some of them go to pieces , and some of them do n't even attempt to stand up to it . But by and large , if properly trained they 're as steady as any man . Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And Sylvia ? " " I know , " Oliver said again , with sympathy . " It 's hard . But do n't quarrel with her about it . There are no noncombatantsin this war . We 'll be lucky if we can keep people like Mab out of it till they 're eighteen at least . " " Will it go on till Mab is eighteen ? "  | " I 'm afraid so . " " Five years ? But London will be pulverized ! " " You 'd be surprised how much high explosive it takes to knock out a city . " " Warsaw  --  ? " " Had no defences worth mentioning . " " I suppose you could n't give me a glimmer about what 's going on at the War Office ? " " I suppose not , " said Oliver with a sweet smile . " Are you going back to work there ? " " No . Charles will . I 'm being sent round to lecture to the poor civilians . " " What about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that smells of mouse . " " There is . As near as makes no difference . " There was another silence . Then Jeff drew an unconscious sigh and poured out another cup of tea . " Well , I feel better than I did , " he said . " That 's always the way , is n't it , if I can have it out endwise with you . " " Anybody else would have said about the same as I have , " Oliver told him , not naming any names . " Probably . But now I 've got it straight from the horse 's mouth . " They grinned at each other affectionately . " Oliver , sometimes I think I ought to say  --  " He hesitated . " It 's all right , son , do n't try . " That word , so rare between them , and only when they were alone . That word , to which Oliver had no real right , a word so carelessly used by men who were only good friends , like Stevie  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as always , and he could not speak . It had seen him through some bad times before now , and he heard it again with the same involuntary lift of the spirit , recognizing as his motherp129had done many years ago the strength and serenity of Oliver 's soldier philosophy , which went so far beyond fatalism . You lived whatever was ahead of you and enjoyed it the best you could , in Oliver 's book of rules  --  whether it was leading a cavalry charge in South Africa , or lying flat on your back in bed for a whole year to give a rheumatic heart a chance as Jeff had done at fourteen , or waiting like a sitting duck for bombs over London . There was always something to be said for most of it , and the main thing was , you were n't dead . It was a new challenge for Jeff  --  to be as good a sitting duck as Oliver had been a cavalryman . " It 's a funny thing , " he was able to say at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so far my heart has n't jumped the track once . " " It wo n't , " said Oliver . " How do you account for it ? Sylvia ? " " In a way , yes . She 's made you forget it . Oh , you thought of it with your mind sometimes , but your subconscious forgot it . That seems the wrong way round , does n't it . " " It makes sense , " said Jeff . " In a goofy sort of way . " Mab came in then , looking less tense and self-contained than she had for weeks , and was delighted to find them still at table . " Where is everybody this morning ? " she asked happily as Jeff rose to pull out a chair for her and took her plate to the sideboard . " Catching up on sleep , I expect . " Oliver poured out her tea , passed her the toast and jam . " I meant to myself , but somehow I 've got out of the habit of sleeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Jeff set a plate of bacon and eggs in front of her . " This feels more like Farthingale again . Has anyone listened to the News ? " " We clean forgot it , " said Jeff guiltily with a glance at the silent radio in the corner . " They 're saying that we must expect Hitler to do some/thing horrible just because it 's Christmas . Well  --  not in so many words officially  --  but that 's what they mean . " " Too cold , " said Oliver . " Snow coming , I think . " " Sh ! " said Mab . " He 'll hear you ! Jeff , will you have time after breakfast to look at the Williamsburg things Evadne brought me ? " " Time any time , " said Jeff , sitting down beside her . " How nice that sounds . Are n't you going on the Observers ' Post expedition ? " " Not if you 'd rather I stayed here , " he said simply . " And how long before you have to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So soon ? " she sighed . " Look , Mab , I 'm lucky to be here at all ! " " Yes , I know , I 'm very thankful , " she said seriously . " I'vehad nightmares you might have to go to Finland . " " I 'm afraid the war would be over before I could get therenow . " " Are they beaten ? " " Yes . They 'll go down fighting , but they 're beaten . " " And then what ? " asked Mab . " Holland , maybe . Maybe Switzerland . Or Belgium again . " " Before Easter ? " " Probably . " " I was only wondering if you would be here again for Easter . " " It will be Bracken 's turn to come away , at Easter . " " The only time you can be sure of any more is now , " said Mab . " I 'm going up and get the Williamsburg things this minute . " She slipped from her chair and left the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And her tea has got cold . " He found Oliver looking at him . " I do n't know , " he said , to a question which had not been spoken . He rose and carried Mab 's cooling cup of tea to the sideboard and left itp132there , took a clean cup from a setting further down the table and put it at Mab 's place . " I do n't know , " he removingrestlessly round the room . " She 's always been crazy about Williamsburg , you know  --  like a sort of second sight . If there is such a thing as reincarnation , maybe that 's what it is . I never encouraged her in it , honestly I did n't  --  well , one time I did promise that I 'd see that she got there for a visit . But now I do n't know . I 'm not sure that it would be a good idea for her to go there . The veil is too thin . Oliver , I admit I do n't know quite how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , dodge talking about it , forbid her to dwell on it any more  --  well , maybe that 's the wrong way to come at it . But if I go along with it , as I have been doing , answer questions , confirm her ideas , and some of them are pretty uncanny  --  if I go on pretending there 's nothing unusualabout any of it , where does it end ? I  --  " " Jeff . Mab is growing up . " " I know that . I used to think maybe it was just a childish sort of game , something she might outgrow  --  but  --  " " But now you know better . " Oliver glanced at the door and lowered his voice . " Why do we worry about a war , with this going on under our very noses ? " Jeff stood stock still in his tracks , staring at the carpet in front of him . " Oh , no  --  " he said , like a prayer . " Mab is n't a child , Jeff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jeff told him unargumentatively . " I 've been careful for years . But I ca n't just start avoiding her , all of a sudden . That would be  --  noticeable . " " So will it be noticeable like this , soon . " " To you , yes , but you  --  " " To anyone , Jeff . You ca n't expect her to hide it , she 's not wise enough . " " But everybody 's used to Mab and me , it 's nothing new , we 've always  --  She 's only thirteen , " said Jeff.  | " She 's not going to stay thirteen . And it 's not just Mab I mean , Jeff . " " Oh , not me too , I give you my word , I  --  there 's nothing but Sylvia for me , ever , we fell in love when we were kids , I could never  --  " Jeff passed a fretful hand across his face , as thought to mask it even for a moment from the thoughtful eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really got me worried , " he said . " I think you should be . " " Oliver , do n't for God 's sake sound as though it was my fault  --  I  --  " Mab returned to the room , rather breathless , with her hands full of photographs and postcards . " It 's this Jamestown thing , " she was saying , as she laid them down beside her plate . " When did they wall up the River bank with stones ? " " Before I can remember . Why ? " He came slowly to sit beside her . " Well , why on earth should they do a thing like that ? The grass always went right down to the water . " " It did ? " He glanced at her quickly . " They found the land was being slowly eaten away by the current . That tree stump sticking up in the water way out from the shore shows you how the bank had already receded before the wall went in . " " Jeff , what 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Was there something in the News ? " " I have n't heard it . Was there ? " " I do n't know , I  --  just thought you looked sort of funny . " " I ca n't help that , " said Jeff . " I 've got a funny face . " " I like it , " she said , and laughed , and laid one hand brieflyalong his cheek . " Tell me what you know about the housecalled Green Spring . " " They fit a battle there , " Jeff obliged . " Lafayette and Wayne  --  before Washington came South . "  | " What 's become of the house ? " " It 's gone . Burned down , I guess . The chimney is supposed to be there , but I never found it . Probably was n't looking in the right place . " " I bet I could find it , " said Mab . " Evadne brought me the map I wanted  --  look , an old one , the way it was then . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She unfolded the map and laid her fingertip north of the Capitol building . " She says there 's a paved road there now , with motor courts and petrol pumps . " " Mm-hm . " " Jeff ? " Her look was searching . " I 'm listening . What about your breakfast ? Virginia wo n't let you go with us to the Observers ' Post if you have n't had some food . " " Could n't you and I stay home ? There 's so much here I want to talk about  --  " " Do n't you think we ought to lend Roger a hand with this picnic ? " he suggested cautiously . " All right , if you say so . " She began to fold up the map . " Good-morning , all , " said Sylvia at the door , with Virginia just behind her . " Look at the early birds . Any worms left for us ? " She went confidently to the sideboard . Jeff rose instantly and joined her there . " We found a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff ! " cried Virginia in furious denial . The dining-room filled up . Nigel  --  Phoebe  --  Roger  --  the Bank girls , a little shy at sharing the family meals during the holidays instead of bicycling over to the canteen at Cleeve . There was bustle and chatter over collecting the party for the Observers ' Post . Eventually the pony-cart was brought round , drawn by a fat little horse left over from Evadne 's childhood , and hampers were loaded into it , bikes were rolled up beside it , and everybody went away to bundle up , for it was biting cold , with a wind.  | " Are n't you coming ? " said Anne to Nigel1 glancing back on her way to the door . " Well , I  --  " " You can take my bike , Sylvia has asked me to ride in the cart . Claudia ca n't go because she has to see to the children for this afternoon . " " I have n't been on a bike for years , " said Nigel , with a certain wistfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anne advised him . " Soon we ca n't get round any other way . " " All right , " said Nigel , to his own surprise . " I 'd like to come . " " Have you got overshoes , it 's frightfully cold . " " Yes  --  I must have , somewhere . Mummy , " said Nigel , using the little word without self-consciousness , " I used to have overshoes here , did n't I ? " " In the cupboard under the stairs , I should think . Do shut the outside door , somebody , as soon as you can . " The dining-room was suddenly very quiet , as the commotionwas all drained away to the hall . Virginia , Phoebe , and Oliver were left at the table together in an empty silence . " I 'm only glad I 'm not trying to be young now , " said Virginia . " I 'm glad I was young when it was easy . " " They do n't miss it , because they ca n't remember how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like saying dumb animals do n't suffer the way human beings do , " said Virginia . " How do we know ? " Roger reappeared in the doorway . " I say , Aunt Viriginia , " he said in a stage whisper . " Gary Cooper 's big brother has just driven up in a Consulate car and says he knew you when . Shall we bring him in here ? " " G  --  ? " Virginia began , and something like a sunburst began in the pit of her stomach and spread to her fingertips . Roger had put a careless finger on the resemblance which left no doubt about the visitor.  |p135She  rose . " Yes , bring him in here , he 'll want a cup of coffee , " she said , and rang the bell . And to Phoebe and Oliver , who sat gazing at her from their places at the table , she said quite calmly , " Do you remember Tracy Marsh ? " He filled the doorway , making Nigel look like a stripling beside him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat in the hall . His country tweeds had come from the right London tailor and were not new . In twenty years he had not put on more than five pounds , and he was always six foot three . His long , lined , humorous face was tanned  --  a used-looking face , Phoebe thought , observing for the first time the man they had all wondered about in 1918 . Having escorted him in , Nigel faded from view , and sounds in the drive soon indicated the departure of the picnic mission . " Well , Tracy , " said Virginia steadily , and advanced with her hand held out , " where on earth have you dropped from ? " He stood still and let her come to him . It made no difference to him that two people he had never seen before were also in the room with nothing to do but look on at his meeting with Virginia . Without a glance in their direction , sublimely unself-conscious he stood with her hand in his , looking down at her . " I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But when we found I was headed for Cheltenham today , Charles said it would be all right if I stopped here on the way . " " Indeed it is , " said Virginia , recovering her hand . " And I suppose you ca n't say what brings you to Cheltenham . " " Sure , I can say , " he drawled . " Man I 've got to see happens to be there . "  | " You remember Phoebe and Oliver Campion , " she said , walking beside him into the room towards the table . " I remember hearing about them , but we never met , I guess . " He shook hands composedly , and Virginia said to Melchett , who had answered the bell and stood waiting  --  " Bring a pot of coffee for Captain  --  I mean Mr.  --  what is it now , Tracy , General ? " " Colonel , I guess , will have to do . " " Colonel Marsh would like some coffee , " Virginia said to Melchett . " Do sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How about some eggs and bacon ? " " No , thanks , I 've had breakfast . Just some coffee would be nice . " He sat down easily at the corner of the table , and Virginia removed the plate before him and brought a fresh setting from the sideboard . " You 'll stay to lunch , wo n't you ? " she suggested as she did so , and his slate-grey gaze came up to her face . " I did n't expect to , " he said . " Could we persuade you ? " " If I could make a phone call . " " Make a dozen , " said Virginia , smiling down at him . " It would n't inconvenience you ? " " Of course not , we 'd all be delighted . You wo n't mind if the family tries to pump you , will you ! Are you allowed to tell about Warsaw ? " " Some . " " And about Johnny and Camilla in Berlin ? " " Have n't seen ' em lately , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters and gas-masks and things in Berlin ? " " They 're living at the Adlon . Its bar is better than its shelter . Between the two , I guess they 're best off . So far . "  |p137The  coffee came , and Virginia poured it out for him . Phoebe and Oliver exchanged glances and on the flimsiest excuses drifted away . Virginia sat with a cigarette , facing Tracy and his cup of coffee across the table . " Well , " he said , and the long laughter lines each side of his mouth deepened . " It took another war , but here I am again . It 's amazing how you do n't change . " " What did you expect ? A doddering old woman ? " " I expected you to be different . And you are n't . " His eyes ran affectionately over her slim figure , the short , greying curls , the heart-shaped , cleverly made-up face . " You know I am , and I know I am , but thank you anyhow . Men have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say  --  neither are you ! " " Yes , " he said . " I 'm just the same . " He glanced round the sunny room . " So this is Farthingale , " he said . " It 's hard to realize we never met except in London . " " You showed me some pictures of it once  --  while I was in the hospital . I used to try to imagine what it would be like , instead of counting sheep at night . I knew where I was the minute I came to the entrance today . It 's a beautiful house . I 'm glad it did n't have to be overrun with city kids . " " I was fortunate . I got the Bank overflow from Cleeve . " " So Charles said . You stuck to what you told me  --  that day at the hospital . You did n't marry again . " " No . What about you ? " He nodded . " You told me to . So I tried . It was n't any good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was n't in it the right way . She soon took up with an Air Force man who had more time to spare . " " Divorce ? " " Yep . She married him . Got a couple of kids now . Must be she knew what she wanted . Me , I 'm back on the old beat . "  | " What were you doing in Warsaw , Tracy ? " " Snooping . " He grinned . " How did you get out ? Bracken asked in Paris  --  Biddle did n't know . " " He knows now . " " It must have been pretty ghastly , was n't it  --  in Poland . " " It was rough , " he conceded . " Will it be as bad here ? In London , I mean . Is it coming ? " She watched him light a cigarette  --  his lean , fine hands , brown from the sun . How had his summer tan lasted like this , into December ? Where had he been , since Warsaw fell ? Italy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to try to fool you , " he was sayingslowly . " You know as well as I do , this is a new kind of war . Spain was the test-tube . Barcelona  --  Guernica  --  that was the experiment . Then Warsaw . They 're learning fast . " " And now Helsinki . What 's next ? London ? Paris ? " " The Lowlands , " he said with quiet assurance . " Theywant the coast , before they go for London . " " Holland ? But , Tracy , the dikes  --  they can flood it . How long could Holland hold out ? " " A month . " " Tracy ! What about Belgium ? " " A little longer , with a lot of help . Denmark they could take any minute by long distance telephone . " " But France ? " she urged , feeling a draught . " Surely France will hold ? " " Yes , the French Army is all right . " Eager for reassurance , she missed the reservation , if there was one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and as he made no reply , " I suppose we are n't supposed to . " " You always smelled so sweet , " he said , apparently atrandom . " Even if I could n't see you , after all these yearsI 'd still know you were in the . room now . "  | " Tracy  --  " " Where 's the harm ? " he asked reasonably . " There 's a war on , Virginia . Again . We 're right back where we started from . " " Or where we stopped . " " You ca n't blame me , can you ? You 've no right to look so much the same . Women are supposed to age , as time goeson. , , " Oh , Tracy , I have , I have ! I  --  " " And it would n't matter anyway . If you had . " " But Tracy  --  " " You do n't want the others to know , is that it ? You do n't want to be kidded about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I guess . I 'm off to France very soon . " She looked up at him doubtfully , drawn as always , resistingstill . " It 's what you said before . " " Almost . I said something else too . " " Now , Tracy , please , I  --  " " I said  --  Let me come back , if I can . " A moment more she sat with her eyes on his . Then with a swift , impulsive movement she was standing beside his chair , his head held against her breast , his arms around her . " I was wrong that time  --  I was wrong  --  I did n't think it would last  --  Tracy , I 'm sorry  --  I spoilt your life  --  I 'm sorry  --  " She was crying helplessly . He shifted in the chair and drew her down on his knees . " Now , now , " he said . " Everybody has to learn the hardway , I guess . It could have been worse . I got here , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Who says it is ? " " - We 've got another war  --  " " What 's a war ? You never did this before . " She took the folded handkerchief from his breast pocketp140and mopped herself with it , while he sat with his hands around her waist , looking up at her . " I 'm behaving like a schoolgirl , " she said unsteadily . " Maybe it 's time . Maybe it 's time you acted young again . " With a faint , final sniff she replaced the handkerchief andremoved herself from his lap . He let her go , but his handslingered . " I thought you must be dead , " she said . " It was much worse not to know , after I began to suspect you were in Warsaw . And then Bracken said they had lost you  --  " " Yep , I sure thought I was a goner for a while , " he admitted cheerfully , with no further details . " Remember that , wo n't you , when it hots up here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aimed at you personally , signed , sealed , and delivered . And then it lands a half a mile away . " " Tracy , what do you do about being scared ? " His slow smile spread affectionately . " You rise above it , " he drawled . " I suppose I shall be afraid when the time comes , " Virginia said thoughtfully . " I suppose I was last time , when we had the Zeppelins , but somehow I ca n't remember much about that . Is n't it odd how long ago it seems ? We talked about invasion then , did n't we  --  more than we do now , I think . So far , my worst time this war was the week before Munich last year . By the time it really began I had grown a sort of callous . I hope it lasts . " " Oh , come , " he said gently . " You 've heard gunfire before . You 'll be all right . " " One thing we did n't foresee last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindly at the window behind him . " It was bad enough to have the young men go . Now it 's the girls too . My Evadne  --  Edward 's Mona  --  and wait till you see Mab , she 's only thirteen  --  "  |p141When  the pony-cart returned just before lunch , Virginia was sitting in the drawing-room with Tracy Marsh , drinking sherry . The rest of them gathered round the fire with their own glasses , trying not to stare at him , but obviously mesmerized by so glamorous a figure , fresh out of Warsaw , and on top of that an American , and furthermore a beau of Virginia 's . Jeff contained himself with difficulty , restrained by the awful unwritten law you ca n't print that . When a man is at his ease among friends with a drink in his hand , you do n't pump him for the newspaper . He may talk a million dollars ' worth of front-page stuff , but you ca n't use it . He told them very little anyway that had not already been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it . His mere presence in their midst , untalkative , unexcitable , unpretentious , but authentic , made the nightmare of Warsaw real . It was plain that he had digested his experience , accepted it , made his deductions , and reported accordingly to those who sent him there . He had no desire to shock or frighten his present audience with hair-raising tales . But small anecdotes and word vignettes could not help but emerge if he so much as opened his mouth  --  the flame-streaked rubble and blood and terror of a bombed city  --  the raw-boned Stukas in a screaming dive on the target  --  the stumbling , sobbing lines of refugees shattered and panicked by a hail of machine-gun bullets from above  --  the old lady dressed in her Sunday best and riding in a wheel-barrow  --  the child who carried a dead bird in a bent and battered wire cage  --  the boy who wept beside a dying cart-horse . . . . He had seen a fallen Government go into exile in the crowded border towns of countries which were so far safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faces in the roadside camps set up by people who had no money top142buy shelter and nowhere to go . A world had ended . A nation had perished . Tracy was there when it happened , and it had marked him , but he was not one to dramatize it . Virginia , watching and listening with the rest , was wrung with pride and pity . Here was a man to love and to cherish . And some fool of a woman had bungled it and gone off with some one easier . Well , that made two fool women , did n't it . In an hour or so he would be gone again . What could you do in an hour to make up for twenty years ? Better to let it go now . Do n't look back . Do n't entangle him . There was no future . There was only a war . The talk had moved on to Finland , where the Russians were being made to pay for every inch of ground , but where there was no chloroform for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ? " Anne cried unexpectedly , and then flushed as they all looked at her with surprise and affection . " Ca n't we even send them hospital supplies ? Performing amputations without anaesthetics is goingback to the dark ages ! " And Virginia said , out of her reverie " Not as far back as that . It happened in Richmond when my mother was a girl . She was caught trying to carry opiates through the Yankee blockade in her hoop . " " Oh , Gran , they might have thought she was a spy ! " cried Mab , entranced . " That 's what they did think , " Virginia smiled . " But she had red hair , and she told off the whole Union Army , up one side and down the other , and they let her go  --  with the drugs ! " " Those were the days ! " Jeff sighed . " I 'm afraid it would n't work with the Russians ! " " But one would have to try , " Anne muttered , still smouldering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that she sent him a grateful glance and retreated again behind her eternal knitting.  |p143And  Nigel thought , A dear creature . Generous and tenderhearted , and brave . And lonely , I should think . Why has n't some one seen before now , she 's well out of her teens . Roger is n't making the most of his time . Younger than she is , probably . Besides , she wants looking after , and he 's not able , even if it occurred to him . And then , perceiving the direction of his thoughts , Nigel was astonished and , suddenly reckless , looked at her again ... . Luncheon was a bit overhung by the clock , as Tracy was soon due at Cheltenham and the family had to attend the children 's play in the village . When they left the diningroomVirginia found that she had been tactfully maneuvered into seeing Tracy off alone while the others scattered on their lawful occasions . With his hand on the inner knob of the front door he paused to look down at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter cold , " he said , and took her hand in his free one . " I sha n't see you again for a while , I 'm afraid . This was just a crazy piece of luck today . Do you ever come up to London ? " " Only once since September , to do the Christmas shopping . I do n't know when I 'll get away again . How long have we got here in England , Tracy ? When will it start ? " " In the spring . " " Where will you be ? " " Hard to say , by then . " " If you are in London  --  when you are in London  --  can you let me know ? " She had not meant to say that , and she instantly regretted the flare of hope in his face . " I probably ca n't give you much notice . But you 'll hear from me , " he promised , gripping her hand and letting it go . " Now and then . " The heavy door closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panels as though she could see through them to where his car moved away down the drive.  |p144As  she turned back into the hall Sylvia was coming down the stairs with her floating dancer 's tread which made no sound on the carpet . " He is a lamb , " said Sylvia . " Mind you have the good sense to keep track of him ! " " It 's a bit hard to do , " Virginia smiled . " But worth some effort , " said Sylvia . She was wearing a brown fur cap on her honey-colored hair , and carried a furlinedcoat over her arm . " The cart is coming round again , and the bikes are still there . How do you mean to transport this gang to the Parish Hall ? " " I had n't thought , " said Virginia , with unaccustomed vagueness . " Shall I cope ? " Sylvia asked sympathetically . " Please . " " Very well , you and Phoebe and I in the cart . Jeff and Mab can take the footpath , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . O.K. ? " There was nothing to do but nod assent , though Virginia felt a dim reservation somewhere . " We can switch round coming home , if we like , " said Sylvia , and sat down on an oak chest to put on her overshoes , glancing wisely at Virginia as she did so . " He 'll be safe enough at Cheltenham , " she said , and Virginia laughed . " At least he does n't seem to be headed for Finland , " she remarked with relief . " He 's been to Finland , " said Sylvia , stamping into her boots . " Or St. Moritz . That was a snow-tan . You do n't get it sitting round the Ritz bar in Paris . " Her direct blue gaze dwelt affectionately on Virginia 's confusion . " That 's quite a boy you 've got there , I only hope you gave him a little encouragement ! " " Well , I  --  nobody knows when he 'll turn up again . " " Keep your fingers crossed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trickle down the stairs  |p145Jeff  felt that to object to Sylvia 's innocent arrangements would have been more noticeable than to accede to them without comment , and so found himself setting out alone with Mab along the narrow path which wound through a little wood and across a stream and past the old grey church to the village . It was probably only an accident that they had never walked there alone together since the time a few days before his marriage to Sylvia when he tried to find words to comfort a broken-hearted child who would not admit even to him that she was suffering . You must n't hold this against Sylvia , he had said that day . We grew up together , we 've always been in love  --  some day I 'll be coming to your wedding , he had said , feeling futile and heavy-handed . Promise to let me look him over first , wo n't you  --  promise to wait for me , wherever I may be . . . . But that was n't at all what he had meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking with suppressed sobs , he had thought , but she 's a child , she 'll get over this  --  it 's worse than I thought , I mind it myself , he discovered . And then the swift inner uncertainty  --  shallI feel like this when Mab marries ?  --  what is this between us , as though she was n't a child at all ?  --  if it was n't for Sylvia , he had thought in astonishment  --  but it is Sylvia , it 's always been Sylvia , for me ... . Now it was three years later , and Mab was less of a child . And only this morning Oliver had said he must be careful . She was taller now , walking beside him in one of their easy silences  --  more self-possessed , more knowing . But still not wise enough to hide it , Oliver said . She had hidden it at the wedding , though , composed and smiling in her pink bridesmaid'sdress . How does it feel , he had wondered then , to watch the person you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? And now he thought unwillingly , Some day I shall know . Some day it will be my turn , to see Mab married . Because she must marry , he thought , walking besidep146her in the narrow path , their shoulders brushing . She must not be allowed to waste her life , because of me . Somehow I must make her see that she must look beyond me , for love . Perhaps if she did go to Williamsburg  --  that might be the pattern  --  there might be some boy there who is meant to make her forget me . . . . But he knew very well that Williamsburgwas not the answer . At Williamsburg she would find Julian . " Are you thinking about the last time we walked here ? " Mab asked quietly at last . " Well , no , I was n't  --  not exactly , " he answered with his new caution . " When was that ? " " You know when , " said Mab . " It was just before your wedding and you were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to come back here if there was a war , and you said , What kind of heel did I take you for ? And you said I was the one who would be in America if there was a war , and I said I was n't a coward . " " So we agreed to ride it out together , did n't we , " said Jeff . " Well , here we go . " " I 'm afraid I 'm not so brave as I thought I was . " " You mean you 'd like to go to Williamsburg now ? " " Oh , no , I could n't leave Gran ! But I hate the waiting ! It 's a funny thing to say , but I think we 'll all feel better once the bombs begin ! " " Well , yes , I think you 've got something there , " said Jeff . " As a matter of fact , Oliver was saying somewhat the same thing only this morning . " " People like Oliver must be pretty disgusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years back , and now look ! " " It was only an armistice in 1918 , " said Jeff . " Funny how we got used to that word , forgot its real meaning , and expectedit to last . "  | " Funny how you get used to almost anything , if it goes on long enough . " " Do you , Mab ? " He glanced at her quickly . " Oh , Jeff , I ca n't stand all this tip-toeing ! " she cried , half laughing , half exasperated . " Everybody but Sylvia goes round holding their breath for fear Sylvia will find out that I love you more than anybody in the world ! Sylvia already knows that , she 's always known it ! It 's nothing new , it has n't made any difference to Sylvia and me , I love her too , and you 'd be lost without her , I can see that ! She 's not afraid I 'll put poison in her tea , in fact when you 're away we hold each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with some difficulty . " What brought this on ? " " It 's just something in the air , lately , as though  --  as though there was something wrong about my feeling the way I do about you , and about Williamsburg ! Well , after all , it 's not a book we 're living in , is it , or a play ! Nobody 's jealous or miserable or going crazy or committing suicide to provide a third-act curtain ! Suppose I do know that there 'll never be anyone to hold a candle to you as long as I live , I 'm not going to die of it ! That 's what I mean about getting used to things , though I suppose I have n't said it very well . When you married Sylvia I thought it would kill me , but I realize now how childish that was . I see you all the time just the same , and Sylvia and I depend on each other . I could n't do without her now , any more than you could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I see , " he assented , still groping . " The thing is , Mab  --  Well , it 's looking ahead a bit , but perhaps it 's a question of your not being willing to give anybody else a chance to make good later on , if you go on thinking I 'm so all-fired perfect  --  " " You 're not perfect ! " she cried , and laughed at him . " Oh , is that so ! What 's wrong with me , then ? " he de/manded , pretending dudgeon , and she laughed again , and pausing in the path threw her arms around him gaily , her face buried in his coat . " I do n't know , I just had to say that , you looked so smug , there must be something , but I do n't know , do n't you see , I 'll never know , because I love you so  --  " He was silent , standing still in the path with one arm laid lightly around her while she clasped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head came up . Their eyes met , his smiling , puzzled , and compassionate , hers questioning and alert , for she had felt through the heavy coat the muffled drumbeat of his heart . " Jeff ? " " Yes , dear ? " He could find no other words to answer the sudden uncertainty in her tone . Her hands were still on his sleeves , her upturned face was very near  --  green eyes , like Tibby 's  --  it was as though the portrait stood there , breathing , between his hands  --  as though time itself had slipped and shifted , and Julian stood with Tibby in his arms again  --  my darling  --  Tibby , my darling .... " Jeff , is it all right now ? " " You are sure nothing will cure you of this ? " he said , unaware that they were Julian 's words , not his . " You are quite sure you wo n't just wake up some morning able to see that I am a very ordinary sort of man , no better than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I shall never see that , as long as I live . " She laid a small warm hand  --  Tibby 's hand  --  against his cheek . " What is it ? " she whispered . " You look very queer . " He drew in a giddy breath , not moving under her hands . " I feel very queer , " he said . " Why ? Why do you look like that , Jeff ? " " Like what , my darling ? " " Almost as though you were sorry for me . " The bright , cold world in which they stood steadied roundp149him again . He found her hands , and loosed them from his sleeves . " I would n't presume , " he said gravely , and she was not sure what he meant , but moved on with him obediently in silence , till they came to the church at the top of the village street , and life engulfed them again.  |p150W  HAT with Finland 's surrender in March , and Denmarkoverrun in a single day in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in , it got so you dreaded to turn on the radio each morning . Virginia had a portable in her bedroom , and Mab usually joined her there for early tea . Together each day they learned what Virginia called the Worst , before they faced the world ' downstairs . After dinner each evening in the drawing-room the nine o'clock News awaited them again , inevitable as doom . Spring had come in with a rush , after the coldest winter in living memory . Easter was in March , and it seemed as though everybody but Michael had four days ' leave , and got about with hoarded petrol and did reckless shopping and noted  --  with an inward prickle of apprehension  --  that the crocuses were out , and it was Time . ARP tightened up , after the winter 's sag . Gas-masks were dusted off , though nobody carried them any more . The Lowlandsbraced themselves again , obstinately refusing Allied offers of what was tactfully called " preventive aid " and clinging desperately to their forlorn and futile neutrality . When the blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . Hitler had gone for Norway instead.  | " Caught on the wrong foot again , " said Virginia crossly . " Everybody 's in France , watching the other mousehole ! " Everybody but the Fleet , which at once began to distinguishitself and take punishment . Michael was there , on a destroyer  --  not one of those that were sunk at once . And Mona 's chin was well up . " Now we 're getting somewhere , " she said . But it was n't enough . Poland had gone down before sheer , crashing weight and numbers , rolling in over a flat defencelesscountryside . In Norway Hitler uncorked a new technique  --  theback door , the dagger from behind , wholesale blackmail and treachery and murder , the Fifth Column . Once more the free world had to watch , angry and impotent , while a brave , bewildered nation went down fighting . Courage was not enough in Norway either , and neutrality was a delusion . If Norway had not been so busy being neutral while Finland was defending itself Iast winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance now . Neutrals wanted to have it both ways . But even now , if Belgium and Holland could learn quickly from Norway 's dreadful lesson .. . Finland had held out one hundred and three days against the Russians . After twenty-five days the Norwegian Governmentwas evacuated by British ships under heavy fire , and British troops were admitted to be falling back towards their embarkation ports from impossible positions . The country was lost . " We will never win this war with Chamberlain in DowningStreet ! " cried Virginia , and there was acrimonious debate in the House along the same lines , and shouts of " Resign ! " But the stubborn , unspectacular , pathetic old man would not concede defeat . " Who else is there ? " Mab asked , for it was hard to remember a time when Neville Chamberlain had not been Prime Minister . " Winston , " said Virginia without hesitation.  | " But he 's got the Admiralty ! " " They should move him up . He could run this war singlehandedbetter than Chamberlain and his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said he was wrong when  --  " " Of course he 's been wrong sometimes ! " Virginia interruptedimpatiently . " They all make mistakes ! But I 'd rather have Winston at Number Ten making his kind of mistakes than put up any longer with Chamberlain 's howlers ! " " Was it a howler to try to help Norway ? " " No , we had to do something ! " ( Nobody could discuss Norway any more without shouting , Bracken said . ) " But somehow it was n't done right ! I do n't know , but we 've got to do better than this ! There 's got to be a change , this wo n't do at all ! " Virginia rose briskly and rang for Melchett . " Let 's have some tea  --  port wine  --  Ovaltine  --  what 'll it be ? I need something to brace me up , do n't you ? " " I 'd like some hot tea , " said Mab . " And some cinnamon toast . " " All right . Whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mab , rubbing her fingers and hunching her shoulders . " And it 's too late to start a fire . " Melchett came , and the order was given . As she turned to go , she hesitated . " Perhaps you ought to know , madam , that one of the Bank young ladies has had bad news from Norway . " " Oh , dear . Which one ? " " Miss Merton , madam . " The one called Claudia , Virginia thought . The one who wept all the time anyway . Her boy . It would be . " Is he  --  does she know  --  ? " " He 's dead , madam . " Melchett went away to get the tea . In the quiet room , which was so suddenly cold , Mab and Virginia looked at each other in silence . Somebody killed.  |p153First  blood for the house this war . It had moved much closer , in one tick of the clock . The long , horrifying casualty lists of the other war had not yet begun . By Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it was starting again . " I suppose it 's wrong to be glad it was n't Michael , " said Mab finally . " What shall we do ? " " What can we do ? " Virginia threw out her hands . " She 'll be giving Anne Phillips a bad time , though . " " We might send them up our tea when it comes , " Mab suggested practically . " Brandy , more likely . Perhaps I should take it up myself . " Virginia stood a minute , gazing blankly at the empty hearth . " We should have had a fire tonight , " she murmured . " It 's this war  --  you go without common comforts  --  no more this  --  no more that . Well , there 's still some brandy . " She moved with decision towards the door . " You go ahead with your tea when it comes . I wo n't be long . " When Melchett returned with the tray Mab was still sitting motionless , her hands pressed together in her lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a correspondent'suniform . Just a routine job , he said  --  Paris , Nancy , Arras , Luxembourg  --  it was a sort of joke that everybodywent to Luxembourg , where you could watch the guns in France firing while you drank your coffee on the hotel terrace . The tourist 's war , said Jeff with sarcasm . But after months on the diplomatic run , writing think-pieces in London , he was thankful for any change . A group of them had all gone together  --  like a guided tour , said Jeff . British Headquarters were very fussy about who saw their war , and the French had wound themselves up in a web of red tape in Paris which was even worse . Still , it was a step in the right direction , said Jeff . Mab and Sylvia were only thankful that it was a step across the Channel instead of northward , towardsp154Norway . He would be perfectly all right in France , they had assured themselves . Mab thanked Melchett for the tea and said Good-night as usual , but made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown boy had got killed in Norway did not mean that Jeff was any less safe in France than he had been while that boy was still alive . But it brought the war in . It made the war a member of the household , even though Claudia Merton 's Harold was not one of the family . It set you counting up the ones that belonged to you  --  Michael somewhereoff Narvik , Roger at an East Coast aerodrome , all those at their posts in London , Jeff on his correspondent 's beat  --  and everybody knew he was not the kind to write the war from the Ritz bar in Paris ... . Virginia came in , looking puzzled . " I 'll never understand that girl . She 's been snivelling for weeks and now she keeps saying , I knew this was going to happen , I knew he was going to die ! ' Perhaps a little more faith might have saved him ! " She sat down and began to pour out their tea . " Sylvia says we can only lose him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , staring down at her cup , and Virginia gave her a compassionate glance . " Jeff 's all right where he is , " she said gently . " There 's precious little shooting in France so far ! " The next day brought a message from Mona . Michael had been wounded , not badly . He was in London , and if they could both get leave might they come down for the Whitsun week-end ? Virginia replied cordially that Mab would give them her room and double up in Virginia 's and everyone was more than pleased . And so on that Friday morning when Virginia woke-and turned on the early News , she and Mab sat up in bed staring at each other while the neat , precise voice of the BBC announced in its pear-shaped tones that Amsterdam and Brus/.sels had been bombed at dawn , and the German invasion of the Lowlands had begun . Churchill was moved up in a hurry then , and by nine , o'clock News time that evening he was Prime Minister . Well , now we 're for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then  --  inevitably  --  everybody chuckled . It was another oddity of an odd war that when the longawaitedattack finally came , Michael should be safe at Farthingalewith his arm in a sling , and Jeff , the non-combatant , should be missing . He had been in Paris on the Wednesday , doing his regular weekly broadcast . He had found Paris still eating well , going to the theater , cheating on its blackout , hoarding its man-power  --  and criticizing the British for what happened in Norway . Jeff 's French was too good . He heard too much . He was riled at Paris . More than he could say out loud . So far as Bracken knew , Jeff was to have left Paris with a group of correspondents on Thursday for a motor trip to the British sector . He was due to report from there on the Saturday , visiting the fighting squadrons of the RAF and spending a night among the blockhouses of the British Line facing the Belgian frontier . Therefore the first news of the invasion must have caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivably a lot going on . By Saturday night , when he should have made contact with London , the British Army had hurled themselves forward into Belgium to meet the German advance , and the whereabouts of the Press units had become hazy . The Sunday papers were full of horrors , and once again a new one  --  this time Hitler was dropping parachute troops behind the lines among a defenceless civilian population ; ruthless fighting men and saboteurs , often wearing civilianp156disguises or Allied uniforms , and speaking the common tongue , so that they came upon their objectives unsuspected , as it were unseen , and things blew up , and crossroads were held , and false rumor and panic were started like a prairie fire in the rear of the defending army . It was a refinement of the old two-front war  --  an embroidery on treachery that crisped the nerves . Suppose , thought Virginia , Germans just suddenly rained down out of the sky into the garden , and walked in with guns . Invasion ? But this was Martian . By Sunday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the air wardens  --  who were unarmed  --  had been ordered out on a dusk to dawn patrol to watch for parachute landings . But surely the Germans had enough on their hands on the Continent just now ? Surely they could n't just hurdle the war there and start on England too ? Now , thought Virginia , lying in bed on Sunday night with Mab apparently asleep beside her , now I am going to be afraid . I remember now how it feels . I thought I was awfully sensible and not a bit nervous and could cope with the whole thing quite steadily and be a credit to everybody . Bombing did n't seem very likely down here , and gas did n't seem very likely anywhere  --  but parachutists in the garden ! What would I do ? Should I get out a gun ? What if Mab just suddenly met a German coming at her , what would I do ? This is nightmare , thought Virginia . This is going to tell on me ... . Whitsun was forgotten . Michael and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to London for Mona 's stand-to with the ambulance , though Michael 's leave had still two weeks to run . He was furious . The lilacs were out , the weather was perfect , it was going to be a honeymoon . That bloody awful little man Hitler again . " It 's like having the war begin all over again , " saidp157Virginia , trying to sound casual . And when once more the raids over England did n't come  --  " It 's that same feeling we had last September  --  as though you 've stepped down a bottom stair that was n't there . " There was one difference , though , Mab thought . When the war first began they knew where Jeff was . Useless to comfort oneself now with the capital C for correspondent in gold thread on his cap and the green tab with its gilt legend on the shoulder of his uniform to show he was not a combat man . The dive-bombers screaming down over Belgium would n't notice that . Sylvia in London would be the first to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass on any news at once . Now was the time , Mab reminded herself , not to let go and get frightened . On Monday the Dutch Royal Family found refuge in England , safely transported by the British Navy , and there were sinister German references to a " secret weapon " in use in their swift advance . The same evening on the BBC Mr. Eden appealed for men over and under the military age or otherwise exempt , to form a new force to be called Local Defence Volunteers  --  for special training to deal with possiblelandings of German parachute troops in England . Virginia 's midriff went cold when she heard . If the Secretary for War was entertaining the same nightmare as her own , things were really bad . But she felt in a way comforted . She was not alone . She glanced at Mab , sitting silent and self-contained on the other end of the sofa listening to the News , and wondered what Mab thought about parachutists  --  if Mab had room for any anxiety beyond Jeff 's immediate safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled andapprehensive , as they both moved towards it . It was so littleused these days , this would have to be something important . It was Bracken , calling from London to say that Jeff hadfiled a dispatch at Lille that morning , passed through thep158British censors . He had been as far forward as Brussels and Louvain , which were now behind the new British lines . He had seen the long , agonizing processions of Belgian refugees bombed and machine-gunned on the roads by German planes , had seen the smoking , deserted villages they had left behind them  --  as Tracy had seen in Poland last September . The American Ambassador was still in Brussels . So far , the main German pressure appeared to be on the French Army around Sedan , and the British in their sector to the north were not as yet heavily engaged . Holland was all through , Bracken said  --  done in by expert Fifth Column and parachute work . The Dutch had lasted four days . When Bracken 's three minutes were up they returned to the drawing-room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the BBC Light Music which followed the News burbled gently in the corner . Mab pressed her hands together and kept her eyes down , striving to conceal even from Virginia the mixed relief and apprehension which possessed her . He was safe , as late as this morning . But there was nothing said about his coming away from the war in France . Almost by accident he had got caught in it , and being Jeff he would stay on the story , which was the British sector of the Belgian Front . And the secret hope that she and Sylvia had shared that Jeff might by good fortune write the war from England was lost . Virginia , also with something to hide , was thinking that when the German Army established itself on the Dutch coastline as they were now free to do , they would be less than two hundred miles by air from London , whereas the German cities were still as far from British bases as they ever were . But surely the French Army was still formidable ? Surely the Belgians would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Channel before he could spare planes and troops to invade England too ? Unless hep159risked everything all at once in one colossal knockout blow ... Louvain , Liege , Namur , Dinant  --  all the old , haunted , dreadful names again , till people who could remember 1914 began to feel as though they were living in one of those vivid dreams where everything has a weird familiarity  --  I have been here before  --  I have already done this  --  howwhen  --  whoam I ... . Jeff was reporting now from Boulogne , where the correspondentshad been ( they felt ) unfairly and too hastily shunted as the British Army continued to fall back to protectits exposed right flank facing the crumbling French divisions around Sedan . Boulogne was being bombed , as the Germans came nearer . Cambrai , Peronne , St. Quentin . . . . The British front line continued to withdraw as the French continued to reel back upon them , and the Germans kept on coming . General Gamelin was replaced by General Weygand . Churchill 's broadcast on the Sunday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned , he said , making no bones about it  --  the French had nevertheless promised to fight to the end  --  ( how else ? )  --  and finally , said Churchill , would come the battle for what he called Our Island  --  blood , toil , tears , and sweat ... , Winston knew how to talk to his countrymen . Arras , Amiens , Abbeville ... . " The men who fought in the old war and are treading the same ground in this one must feel like ghosts , " Virginia said to Rosalind on Tuesday afternoon , when she and Mab had bicycled over to the Dower House for a Red Cross workingpartyand stayed on to have a drink after the other members had scattered homewards in time for the six o'clock News . " The old war , " Rosalind said thoughtfully , turning her glass . " Have you noticed how often we say that ? Almost with a fondness , because this one is so much more terrible . "  | " And have you noticed , " said Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly full of beans ? Old Mrs. Thingummy this afternoon , with the feather in her hat  --  instead of beetling off to the back of Wales , she 's been getting out her father 's cutlass , or whatever , and wants to make kerosene bombs ! And darling Winifredorganizing the First-Aid Post all over again , and apparentlyvisualizing streams of refugees arriving from our own coast towns ! And the men  --  old crocks and babes-inarmsdrilling with rook-rifles and spears ! Are n't people wonderful ? " " Does it seem to you , " Rosalind began a little too casually , " that the French are keeping very quiet ? " Virginia stared at her . " Well , there 's not much news  --  I mean , how do we know they are n't reacting the same as we are ? " " I do n't know how I know , " said Rosalind . " You mean you think they 're going to let us down ? " " I ca n't help wondering . " " What an idea ! " said Virginia , shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Rosalind agreed guiltily . " Jeff mentioned it , ' way back at Christmas time when he was here , " Mab said , having been very silent all afternoon , and they both looked at her in surprise . " To you , maybe , " said Virginia . " What did he say ? " " He said there must be something we did n't know about the French . I did n't think much about it at the time , there were so many other things going on . But if Mr. Churchill had to go over to Paris just to prop them up a few days ago  --  " " Was that why he went , do you think ? " " Well , it looks that way , " Mab said apologetically . The evening News after dinner did nothing to hearten them . Virginia turned with a sigh from the map hung up onp161the wall  --  Archie 's map from the old war , where twenty-six years ago the same French towns had been marked with the same little red pins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , it had looked the worst , just before the tide turned towards what became the November Armistice . The Germans would finally have to stop for breath this time too  --  neither men nor machines could keep the pace . They would run out of bridges and petrol soon . Unless there was something one did n't know about the French ... . Somehow by the twenty-first of May the German Army had swung clean round against the British right , away from Paris . And with Abbeville gone , Boulogne was next . That night at bedtime Mab put out the light in her room , opened the blackout curtains and the window , and slid to her knees with her arms along the sill and her face buried from the full moon which streamed down over the fragrant garden . It was not praying , it was not crying . She stayed there a long time , and then rose , chilled and stiff , and got into bed . It was quite a while before she could keep her teeth from chattering . Finally she dozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor of a car , doors closing , voices  --  she sat up , holding her breath , trying to hear more above the thumping of her heart . Noel was erect on his cushion in the corner , rumbling in his throat , glancing at her for a clue  --  a sharp , nervous bark escaped him as they listened , and she hushed him with a quick word ... . Running footsteps came down the passage , some one tapped at her door and opened it briskly . " Mab ! Wake up ! He 's here ! He 's got back safe , come and see ! " It was Sylvia . Generous , loving Sylvia , sharing the first hours of Jeff 's return by coming to Farthingale , and where had they got the petrol ! She was closing the window and the curtains , and Mab reached for the bedside light and a dressing-gown.  | " He was asleep on his feet when he got to London  --  the correspondents had a very lively time at Boulogne and were taken off by the Navy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down all over the place ! " Sylvia was saying . " He and Bracken talked while he changed and had some food , and then I put him into the back seat of the car to sleep while I drove  --  you never saw such a thing as the trip we 've just had getting here , they 've got road-blocks and barbed-wire the whole way from London , and they kept waking Jeff up and shoving a light into his face to make sure I was n't carrying a German spy unawares ! It took both his Press pass and my face , besides our identity cards , to get us here . At one road-block they said nobody but an American girl would have thought she could get out of London tonight , and what was the hurry , and I said Jeff had to rest fast and get back on the job . And at another they said , Give us a song , Miss Sprague ! ' and I said , Hush , you 'll wake my husband , he 's just back from Boulogne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Careless talk ! ' and everybody was very jolly , and I sang ' em a song since Jeff was awake anyhow , and here we are ! Bracken 's given Jeff a few days off to pull himself together and do a story on the LDV 's down here , and Evadne found some one to take my duty at the Animal Post so I could get away too . " By now she had bustled Mab , dazed and delighted , to the staircase , and with the dog in a joyful scamper behind they ran down to the drawing-room to find the lights all on and Virginia in a dressing-gown administering a Scotch and soda to Jeff , who looked pretty much at the fag end , in spite of a bath and a shave and fresh clothes in London . Without a second thought Mab flung herself headlong into his arms and he swung her clean off her feet and set her down again in their standard greeting after overseas absence , and Sylvia said , " I 'm starving , let 's go and scramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war on , are there any eggs ? " Andp163Virginia , who was still shaking because she had been quite sure it had to be German parachutists knocking up the house at that time of night , said there was some nice meat paste which would make sandwiches and that would have to do . And with the characteristic family disregard for the clock they all adjourned to the kitchen to have a snack . Boulogne went on the Thursday , and from then on the news became more hair-raising every day . On Sunday the Observer so far abandoned the national policy of understatementas to come out with a headline which said : Britain At Bay . Jeff spent a night out with the LDV patrol under the searchlights and the waning moon , got his story , and went back to London with Sylvia . When he had gone and it was too late , Virginia realized she had not asked him what to do about parachutists if they came , and Mab discovered that she had had no chance to talk to him without a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like seeing somebody off on a journey  --  you think of all the things you meant to say after the train has pulled out . And there was no knowing when he would get another chance to come to Farthingale . Every day the British Army was pushed back in a diminishingsemi-circle around Dunkirk , their backs to the sea . It was plain now that Hitler cared less to take Paris than to take that Army where it stood , and then try for London . England was his objective , not France . England he hated , France he could deal with . And he still did not comprehend that the easygoing English now meant to have his head if they never had anything else again . One woke each morning dreading what the day would bring . One kept one 's face on straight and ate and smiled andp164answered when spoken to , and performed the necessary tasks of living , and the additional jobs imposed by the effort to meet whatever might be coming , and regained the privacy of one 's room at night with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one faced perpetually the threat of the Unknown . How would it come ? When ? Where ? and let me not disgrace myself ... . So far as possible no one deviated from the normal routine , in order not to give Hitler the satisfaction . Small social engagements were faithfully kept , family anniversaries were soberly observed , shopping , queueing , working-parties , ' local entertainments , all proceeded as usual . Virginia had arrangedearly in the spring for Mab to have tennis lessons from one of the young women at the infant school who had been a games-mistress . It made something definite for Mab to do , Virginia maintained , and for the uprooted gamesmistressit meant a little welcome pocket-money . Twice a week Mab walked or bicycled to the village and from there a penny bus ride took her to the gates of Overcreech House where the infants and their attendants were housed , and she returned home the same way in time for lunch , after a workout on the neglected tennis court which had seen such gay parties in Virginia 's not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from her tennis lesson breathless , and flung herself at the silent radio in the drawing-room . When it responded the midday News had gone by . She snapped it off and ran for the stairs , where she encountered Virginia on the way down for lunch . " They 're saying in the village that Belgium has quit ! " she cried . " Without any warning ! They say that leaves our Army uncovered on the left ! They say we 're going to bring them back in rowboats ! " " Good Lord , I missed the News ! " Virginia looked at her watch . " Who told you this ? " " Some people in a queue at the grocer 's , first . Then I askedp165at the Post Office and they had heard it too . Old Mrs. Pelhamsays King Leopold ought to be put up against a wall . He asked for our Army , did n't he ! " " When it was already too late . " " Jeff was worrying about the French ! " said Mab . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were descendingthe stairs hand in hand towards the dining-room where the table was laid for lunch , and fresh flowers filled the vases , and sunlight sparkled on the silver and mahogany . " What if the French should cave in too ? " said Mab . " Oh , it 's not possible ! " said Virginia sanely . " We 're so cut off down here , for tuppence I 'd run up to Town on the 2:10 and ask Bracken what on earth is going on ! " " Oh , do let 's ! We could spend the night with Dinah and see Gone With the Wind ! " " Not a good idea , I 'm afraid , " Virginia said hastily , abandoning her impulsive jaunt to Upper Brook Street . A second evacuation was already being talked of . " Oh , well , we shall know soon enough , I expect , if we stay right here . " Belgium had lasted eighteen days . For a matter of hours , then , England staggered and groped . Their Army was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanks uncovered . They had been let down , right and left . Then slowly the word began to spread , even down in the West . There were trains full of weary , cheerful troops , unshaven , still damp and sandy from the Dunkirk beaches , but safe home again  --  the miracle of the little boats had happened , the inspired civilian rescue of an army had come off . Dunkirk had passed into history . What next ? Everyone felt a little silly to mention it , but the invasion of England was probably next . The weather was still heartlessly beautiful the day Mona 's letter came  --  very brief , too unemotional . With several days of his leave still to run , Michael had fallen in with some Navy cronies who had got hold of a Dutch skoot lying inp166the port of London  --  and when it headed for the Dunkirk beaches in the fleet of small craft which flowed towards the sea , often without charts or instruments , Michael was aboard . German dive-bombers machine-gunned the decks off La Panne and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring back her load to Dover . All that brightness , all that joy  --  finished . He had n't had to go . He was n't with his own ship when the call came . He might have stood back . But not Michael . Not Mona . They had always gone to meet things . The war was moving in . " We are told , " said Mr. Churchill in the House on June fourth , " that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the British Isles . This has often been thought of before . " There was laughter in the House , of course , for Winston was at his best that day . But buried in the majestic rumble of his trumpet call to arms was a phrase which few of his hearers failed to notice with a suspicion shared by those who read the speech next day . He said : " I have myself full confidence that if all do their duty , if nothing is neglected , and if the best arrangements are made , as they are being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Island home , to ride out the storm of war , and to outlive the menace of tyranny , if necessary for years , if necessary alone . " There was no emphasis on the word , but England 's ears went up . Alone . Winston had been in Paris again last Friday for a meeting of the Supreme War Council . People looked at each other . And there was more . " Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grasp of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule , we shall not flag or fail , " the speech rolled on . " We shall go on to the end , we shall fight in France , we shall fight on the seas andp167oceans , we shall fight with growing confidence and strength in the air , we shall defend our Island , whatever the cost may be , we shall fight on the beaches , we shall fight on the landing-grounds , we shall fight in the fields and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never surrender , and even if , which I do not for a moment believe , this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving , then our Empire beyond the seas , armed and guarded by the British Fleet , would carry on the struggle .... " All very true . Very well said . But what had Winston learned in Paris last Friday ? It was a thing which Bracken too wanted very much to know , as Hitler pressed home a new attack on the Somme where two British divisions remained in the line with the French , besides a considerable number of RAF squadrons . Hitler was now in a real hurry . The British Army at Dunkirkhad got away from him , and might some day be in shape to return and fight again . But the French kept on falling back . On June tenth Jeff returned to France with a Press unit , bound for the new British Headquarters at Le Mans . It was inconceivable that the French would not make a stand before Paris , as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . And that would be a story . At six P.M. the same day , about the time Jeff went ashore at Le Havre , Italy declared war and attacked on the Alpine Front . France lasted about three weeks longer than Belgium . The French Government fled to Tours , then to Bordeaux , and the Germans walked into Paris unopposed , and Marshal Retain asked for an armistice . " So now we know what Winston meant by alone ! " said Virginia , not at all in despair , but with a visible satisfacti ' . , a that a mystery was solved.  |p168And  then the thing that no one had foreseen and that Hitler would never comprehend took place in England . When Belgium went under , England had reeled with angry protest . Now , with France gone too and America standing well back out of Hitler 's way , overnight the English steadied , spit on their hands , and went round grinning . Let ' em all come . There 's nobody to desert us now . We 've nobody to count on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . The Army was home , the family was together again , inside the moated fortress with the drawbridge up . Alone . Just let him try . Virginia had reacted like everybody else , with an unreasoningelation . It made no sense . Things could hardly have been worse , without Hitler actually coming ashore from the Channel . But there it was . They were in the Finals now . The main event , as usual , was between Germany and England . The Island-devil , mentioned by that unfashionable fellow Kipling a generation ago , was now awake , and as he had pointed out , never cool for being curbed . In the midst of the characteristic upsurge of British morale now that the worst had happened , there arrived at Farthingalea letter from Irene , announcing her decision to evacuate Basil and Mab to America at once . Bracken had had a cable from Fitz and Gwen at Williamsburg , offering to take as many children as they cared to send , whether members of the family or not , to be met in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it an excellent opportunity , and several of her friends preferred it to the Government scheme for sending children to the Dominions , which was already under discussion in the House . No bomb could have caused more consternation in the Farthingalehousehold . Even Basil 's nurse was against it . " That 's all very well for the Dutch , " she said , referring to Princess Juliana 's recent arrival in Canada with her little daughters . " Their country was shot out from under them ,  |p169as  you might say . But he 's not in England yet , nor ever will be , if you ask me . " What they were asking her , Virginia tried to explain through a certain gratification at Nurse 's attitude , was if she would act as escort to the children during the voyage , and stay at Williamsburg with them , at least for a while , if that could be arranged . " Well , madam , I do n't say I wo n't , " said Nurse cautiously . " If it 's decided on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit much at this time , if you ask me . " " Then I can tell Mrs. Poynter that you are willing to go , " said Virginia , who heartily agreed with everything Nurse said , but could not admit it . " Well , I suppose if it came right down to it  --  " said Nurse , obviously with many reservations . " But Basil is sure to be upset , being sent away from his Mummy like that , and he 's always a bit of a handful when he 's upset . " Basil , of course , was not consulted about going to Williamsburg . If he had been , he would have voiced a strong preference for staying as near as possible to his Mummy . But Mab was of an age where her views had to be heard , and Virginia was not surprised when she dug in her heels . " That 's all very well for small children like Basil , " said Mab . " But I shall be fourteen in August . " " But I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . But not like that , " said Mab . " There 's no disgrace about it , you know . Lots of children will be leaping at the chance . There was something about it on the BBC and I thought at the time  --  " " And I thought at the time what mugs they were to thinkof such a thing ! " said Mab , who very seldom interrupted . " They 'll all feel pretty silly if Hitler does n't come after all ! " " Perhaps we ought to try to get your mother on the tele/phone , " Virginia murmured weakly , for she could n't but agree with Mab . " It 's Basil they 're worried about , " Mab said without resentment . " He can go , he 's too little to understand . " " Well , after all , Mab , the bombing is sure to start now , if not an actual invasion , and if Hitler should go into Ireland , and some people think he will , it wo n't be any safer here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Jeff left England I was here , " said Mab , too quietly . " How would it look if I was n't here when he came back ? " Jeff had last reported on Press Wireless from Tours , which was an extension of chaos and the French censors had allowed him to say so . At that time he intended to follow the Government , which had already gone to Bordeaux . And there he was expected to find a boat which would bring him to England . " I 'm sure if we could consult Jeff he would recommend a trip to Williamsburg now , " Virginia insisted , hoping she was right . " A voyage in convoy is no great risk these days , and we might even get you on an American ship  --  " " There wo n't be any more American ships , " said Mab , who read the newspapers . " Unless they send one specially for evacuation , there 's some talk of that . " " Gran , it 's for children ! I 'm almost fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell your mother ? " " Tell her Basil will go , and I wo n't . " " But do n't you think it would save a lot of trouble and argument if  --  " " No , no , no , I wo n't leave England while Jeff is away ! " cried Mab , and ran out of the room . Oh , dear , well , I ca n't tell Irene that , thought Virginia . And then  --  I suppose it 's a good thing , she thought . In some ways Williamsburg might be more dangerous for Mab thanp171anywhere in England . Perhaps this way she will escape a different kind of risk . This way she wo n't see the portraits of Julian and Tibby . Gwen seems to have forgotten about that in her anxiety about invasion . The next day Nigel arrived on the afternoon train from London , preceding his telegram by an hour or so , so that he had had to share the only taxi as far as the crossroads and walk the rest of the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him . " I could n't use the telephone , " he explained , " and I have only twenty-four hours clear , but I felt I had to come and make sure you were all right . " " We 're just the same as usual , " Virginia said . " That 's what I was afraid of , " said Nigel . " Now , there are certain things you must attend to at once . " " Such as burying the silver in the garden ? " she asked flippantly . " Such as having your passport and identity papers and spare cash in a safe place . And a bag packed with necessities . I know that sounds fantastic and futile , but I 'd feel better if you 'd pay attention and take a few precautions . " " Nigel , do you really think they 're coming ? " " No , " said Nigel deliberately . " But if they do , I shall be stuck in London and you will be here , practically alone , and I shall want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took out his wallet and removed from it a number of crisp banknotes . " I do n't want to seem theatrical , but first of all I want you to sew some of these inside the lining of a warm coat which you will keep handy , and have some of them always on you , somehow , and hide some in your room  --  in the lining of the curtains , or some such place . " " But Nigel , I could go to the bank here  --  " " If you like , but do n't draw out a lot , not down here . I want you to find a stout bag or knapsack , and pack it with what I have written down here  --  " He gave her a neat list.  | " Most of it will be in your store cupboard , I expect . What sort of shape is your passport in ? " " Bracken keeps it up to date . But I wo n't  --  " " Where is it ? " " In my desk . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do you carry it ? " " In my hand-bag . " " Let me see . " While they were in the midst of this , Mab came hunting for Virginia , and was charmed to find Nigel too . She was carrying a sort of circular , printed on both sides , which looked rather like a cheap advertisement . " I say , have you seen this ? " she said , handing it to Virginia . " Is n't it gruesome ? " The paper was headed by the Royal Arms , Issued by the Ministry of Information , and began in large type : IF THE INVADER COMES . What to do  --  and how to do it . With their three heads together , silent , with a growing incredulity that the thing had actually entered their lives , they read the seven numbered paragraphs . . . . You must remain where you are . The order is " Stay Putt ! ' . . . When you receive an order make quite sure that it is a true order and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give any German anything . Do not tell him anything .... Be ready to help the military in any way . . . felling trees , wiring them together or blocking roads with cars .... Remember always that the best defence of Great Britain is the courage of her men and women ... . Why , Virginia wondered angrily , aware that her hand holding the flimsy sheet was not quite steady , why should it be so frightening ! It was designed to inform and reassure . There was really no excuse for the sickening wave of pure terror which had run through her as she read . Make sure that no invader will be able to get hold of your cars , petrol , maps , or bicycles .... Make sure how ?  | " Maybe old Mrs. Pelham was right to oil up her grandfather'sduelling pistols , " she heard herself saying . " Darling , you must be serious , " said poor Nigel . " And do you think Mrs. Pelham is n't ? " she heard herselfask lightly . " Irene expects to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nigel went on , deciding to ignore her . " Nurse 's too , of course . They 'll go by way of Montreal and will have to take a train to New York . The Spragues will meet them there . " " I had an idiotic letter from Gwen , begging me to come home with the children , " said Virginia , folding the paper once across and laying it aside , wondering if her face looked as stiff as it felt , hoping her voice sounded right . " I was n't taking any notice of it till Irene went off her head too . They seem to think in America that England is all through , and we have n't started yet ! " she added , as though she had not seen the seven rules sent out by the Ministry , emerging to her own surprise from the first paralyzing shock . " Anybody 'd think we were Belgium ! " " Mummy , they 're only facing facts , in America , " Nigel told her patiently . " Even Churchill said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was nothing about sending our children away . " Virginia began to listen to herself with an impersonal admiration . " What 's got into you , Nigel , I never thought that any son of mine  --  " " I have n't given up , any more than you have , " he assured her firmly . " But now Hitler has got to try , and it 's going to be hell 's delight here for a while . If I had a child  --  " He hesitated . " Well ? " said Virginia relentlessly . " I can only thank God I do n't have to decide , " he concluded , with his rare , slanting smile . " Anyway , in the case of Mab and Basil , it 's all in the family , and Mab has always wanted to see Williamsburg. "  |p174There  was a silence . He looked from one to the other inquiringly . " I 'm not going , " said Mab . " Just Basil and Nurse . " " Oh , Lord . " Nigel put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled for you to go . What does your mother say ? " " She thinks I 'll come round , but I wo n't . Even Nurse is against it . She says it will upset Basil far worse than a few bombs here . " " My dear child , it 's not just a question of a few bombs here any longer , " Nigel explained , as though he spoke to some one who was a little lacking . " If the Germans contrive to occupy even a part of this country , even for a short time  --  " " You do n't really think they will , " said Mab . " No , I do n't , " he agreed promptly . " But neither did the Dutch and look at them now . We have to assume the worst and prepare for it . I should think you 'd jump at the chance to go to Williamsburg for a while . " " Grandmother Tibby did n't go looking for a refuge when the war came to Williamsburg , " said Mab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in your pocket . " " The colonists were ragged and hungry and short of guns and men , and far worse off than we are now , " said Mab . " And the British Army must have looked just as bad to them as the Nazis do to us . " " Now , look here  --  " Nigel began . " Anne says I 'm right not to go , " said Mab , producing the clincher . " Anne says that when it 's all over and Hitler never set foot in England after all , the ones that ran away wo n't know where to look . " " You see ? " said Virginia to Nigel , with an expressive gesture . " Young England ! " Nigel , worried as he was , could n't but grin . " I must see Anne while I am here , " he said , almost to himself.  | " She came in when I did . I 'll tell her you 're here . " Mab started for the door . " Ask her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is telling us what to do and what not to do , better than the Ministry can . " And when Mab had gone she added , " I suppose they have n't much extra money , those girls . We shall have to look after them too , you know , if anything really bad begins . " " Yes , please let 's not lose sight of Anne , " said Nigel , and Virginia glanced up at him with interest , and then took a good look at Anne as she entered the room , holding back a little on Mab 's hand , smiling her wide , unself-conscious smile at sight of the visitor . " Hullo , are you the man about the invasion ? " Anne asked cheekily , and sobered under his steady gaze . " Have you got a passport ? " Nigel asked her in his most legal manner . " No . I 've never had one . It 's a bit late now , is n't it ? Holidays abroad are n't what they used to be . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what you mean by spare , I 've got about two pounds , nine , and thruppence . " " But have n't you got a bank account ? " Nigel insisted , rather like a kindly uncle . " No . I only work there . " " You mean that two pounds is all you 've got in the world ? " " Just about . I sent some money home last week , they 're fixing up their shelter . " " Then you really must allow me  --  " Nigel 's hand went again to his breast pocket . " What for ? " Anne asked bluntly . " Emergencies , " Nigel , replied as bluntly , and held out to her two five-pound notes . " Call it a loan , " he said . " Well , thank you very much , but I do n't see any need forp176it , " said Anne , making no move to take the money . " We 're told to stay where we are and not go on the roads if there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us here . Unless , of course  --  " She turned a suddenly apprehensive look on Virginia . "  --  unless your mother wants to close up the house or  --  " " Nigel is behaving a bit like a mother hen , " Virginia said unfairly . " I have already assured him that I 'll look after you like my own , no matter what happens . " " That 's awfully kind of you both , but I really have no right to  --  " " Do n't be so stiff-necked and obtuse , " said Nigel in his incisive lawyer 's voice . " When this war is over I want to know where you are , and I want to find you alive and well . " Three pairs of eyes stared at him in varying degrees of doubt , suspicion , and incredulity  --  Anne , Mab , and Virginia could think of no possible explanation of the above statementexcept that Nigel must be  --  well , interested . It came as an equal astonishment to each of them , in a different way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake personally , " she said . " Thank you , " said Nigel formally , and as Anne would not take the money , he laid it down in front of Virginia . " I 'm sorry to be so abrupt , but I feel rather pressed for time . " And Mab , looking from him to Anne , saw that Anne was blushing from the V of her blouse to the roots of her hair , and wondered if Nigel had just proposed , right there in front of everybody , and what Anne was going to do about it . " And now , " said Virginia , rising with all the bank-notes in her hand and the list of things to be packed in a bag , " Mab and I will go and gather all this together  --  " Mab followed her from the room , resisting a backward glance as she closed the door.  |p177There  was a long silence when they had gone . " I am most terribly sorry , " said Nigel at last , not a bit like a lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , except that I 'm a bit rattled like everybody else . Will you forgive me ? It 's only Mummy , after all , and she was bound to catch on soon . " " But  --  I do n't  --  " Anne put both hands to her face with a sound half gasp , half laugh . " Naturally , you do n't , " said Nigel . " I ca n't expect you to . But now that I 've put my foot in it , I might as well say that there has n't been a day since I last saw you that I have n't thought of you  --  wondered about you  --  and looked forward to seeing you again . This warden job I 'm in now leaves a lot of time for thinking , when one might otherwise be reading , working , killing time with friends  --  especially on the night shift , as I am . When you came in the door just now , so smiling and sweet and safe , I got it right between the eyes  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it was clumsy of me , I do apologize . " " Oh , no  --  " Both her hands started towards him , protectively , and then were withheld . " You must n't sound as though you had done something rude ! It was only  --  " Again the lovely blush swept upward , and this time he saw it . " Only  --  ? " he prompted , watching . " It was as though you had read my mind , I-did n't know where to look . " " Read your mind ? " he repeated , and took her hands , and when she tried to draw them away he held them , still resisting , in his . " Anne  --  ? " he said , with a question . " I had let myself dream , " she confessed , looking down at their hands . " I had let myself pretend . I 've always told myselffairy stories , it 's childish of me , I know , but as soon as I came to this house it set me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , yes  --  but where was I ? " And when she would not answer  --  " Anne ? " " We  --  do n't know each other , " she gasped , pulling at her hands , and he let them go , and she rose and walked away from him down the room . " Anne , was I in the dream ? " He waited , standing where he was . " Oh , yes , I know it 's all too sudden and too soon . It 's not fair to press you now , when everyone is over-wrought . " " Yes , that 's it , " she agreed faintly . " You might  --  feel quite differently when things are normal again . And I feel sure they will be , do n't you ? " " You misunderstand me , " he said gently . " My mind is quite made up . But you have a right to some sort of proper courtship when things permit . " " C-courtship  --  ? " said Anne incredulously , and turned to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  dancing  --  house-parties  --  if those things ever come again . Anyway , a chance to know me well enough to decide if you can put up with me . " " B-but you ca n't mean  --  how can you possibly  --  " " I do n't know how it came about , if that 's what you 're asking . I only know that you 're always with me now  --  your eyes , your voice  --  I 'm just as surprised as you are , I suppose  --  except that I 'm getting used to it and it 's just been sprung on you entirely in the wrong way , I admit . Perhaps it 's those long lonely hours on night duty . Perhaps it 's the long lonely days and nights before that began . I was going quietly crazy with my loneliness , until I saw you . I could n't seem to lay hold of anything  --  there did n't seem to be anybody I needed or wanted  --  I was empty and dreary and old before my time . And now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love you very much . Do you mind ? " " Oh , my dear  --  ! " said Anne , and opened her arms.  |p179It  was not a thing which Virginia had anticipated , but she was quite content that an engagement should exist between Nigel and Anne Phillips , whose first name she had never used till the toasts were being drunk . Anne was gentle and sweet and soft , and plainly would worship Nigel all her life , and that would be good for him , which was all that mattered these days . The wedding would come later , when things had a little resolved themselves . Meanwhile there would be the deep satisfaction to each that the other was aware  --  and there was the post , which still functioned regularly . Anne , watching timidly for reservations on the part of Nigel 's mother , began gradually to hope that it was n't just good manners , and that she might be welcome in this magic household where she had so allowed her imagination to run away with her . She still could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the family  --  she understood that it was a formidable family , headed by the fabulous Bracken Murray , who was Nigel 's uncle  --  but so far there was nothing to make her feel an outsider . Anne bloomed during dinner that night , with a new brilliance in her mysterious , heavy-lidded eyes and a new tilt to her generous mouth . Being engaged makes a girl feel pretty very quickly , and it shows . During the evening they listened to Churchill 's broadcast , and thanked God again for such a leader : " Therefore , in casting up this dread balance sheet and contemplating our dangers with a disillusioned eye , I see great reason for intense vigilance and exertion , but none whatever for panic or despair , " the strong , fighting voice declared into the quiet room . " The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us . Hitler knows that he will have to break this Island or lose the war . If we can stand up to him , all Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move forward intop180the broad , sunny uplands . But if we fail , then the whole world , including the United States , including all we have known and cared for , will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the lights of perverted science . Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties , and so bear ourselves ttat if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years , men will still say , This was their finest hour . ' " When they realized that he had finished , they looked at each other , their throats too tight for speech . Tears were slipping quietly down Anne 's face . She wiped them away with her fingers , and her eyes followed Nigel 's tall figure as he moved to shut off the radio . It was Mab who first found words . " He sounds like a tired lion , " she said . Not even Virginia knew what it had cost to make the decisionfrom which Mab never wavered after that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , but with too high a price-tag . To see it without Jeff there would have been disappointing enough at best . To use it as a bolt-hole while Jeff was out reporting a war which was being fought to preserve what Williamsburg stood for became impossible . And yet one lived with fear . It was fear which rolled in across one 's consciousness like surf on a beach as one woke to each new day , and set one 's insides to churning so that one was never sure that food would stay down  --  though one ate conscientious meals as they came in order not to be conspicuousin the general self-possession which prevailed . To go off one 's feed now would be regarded as dramatization , which was always frowned on in the family , and which ' as a rule only Basil descended to . Once Jeff was back in England , she promised herself , it would be easier . More than half the fear was for him.  |p181His  telegram came the same day the French armistice terms were published . After four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at Falmouth and sent off identical messages to Farthingale and London : Home again . Love . Jeff . Then he got into a crowded train and walked in the door at Upper Brook Street an hour ahead of his telegram . So there was still time for Mab to accompany Basil and Nurse to Williamsburg with Jeff 's approval , and the pressure was still on from everybody but Virginia and Nurse . The fear was still there too , in the pit of her stomach , for the French were going to be even less use than anyone had supposed . Mab fought it out again that night in her room . No fair waiting just to see what Jeff would say . She was old enough to make up her own mind . A long time before war had come to England Jeff had once recounted to her a family legend to the effect that a hundred and fifty years ago Tibby at the age of sixteen had dressed herself in her twin brother 's clothes and gone to meet Lafayette 's army before Jamestown , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aides . There was nothing to prove that Tibby was not frightened too . When the time came for Basil and Nurse to sail , Hitler had begun to bomb the English ports as foreseen , and getting aboard a liner was likely to be a nervous business . Jeff came down with Irene to escort them to Liverpool , but this time Sylvia stayed on duty at the Animal Post in London , where there were occasional alerts without bombs . Irene had reluctantly surrendered Mab 's passage to another child , giving up on the long distance argument . As usual her attention was centered on Basil but now she had begun to have qualms about losing sight of him , and for his safety on the way.  |p182Mab  sat next to Jeff at dinner that night , in a quiet ecstasy at his being there within reach of her hand , although nothing but general conversation was possible in so small a gathering . After coffee in the drawing-room Irene went up to see Basil in bed , assuming that Virginia had nothing better to do than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mab found Jeff 's speculative eyes upon her and hunched her shoulders in a small , derisive movement . " I 'm in disgrace with Mummy , " she said . " So I gather . " He set down his coffee-cup and prepared to give her his undivided attention . " I was kind of surprised myself . It 's a good chance for you to see Williamsburg , is n't it ? " " Now , do n't you start ! " said Mab . " I 'm probably wrong , " Jeff said , " but I happen to think it 's better this way . " " You mean you think he wo n't come . " " When I left France I thought he would . There is something about defeatism that spreads and penetrates . I shall never understand what happened over there . As a matter of fact , I do n't understand what has happened here , either . But now I 've got a funny sort of feeling that he is not going to take England . " " Well , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat looking at her in silence a long moment . He was still readjusting to Churchill 's Island . He had returned to London in time , he thought , to assist at the end of the world . And once there , he found England happily convinced that it was " just going in . " When he expressed surprise , Bracken had said only , " The English are tough . You 'll see . " Jeff 's first retreat from France before Dunkirk had been more or less official in nature , and he had crossed the Channel in a British destroyer . There had been , for all the haste andp183confusion , morale  --  dignity and discipline and decency . Since then , returning to Paris only a day before the Germans overranit , he had seen France crumble from the top down . Instead of barricades and mounted guns he had found only deserted boulevards , shops with all the shutters drawn , hotels which refused admittance  --  and instead of gunfire , a great silence . He had made his way on foot to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and angry and incredulous . He was not expected , and was freely advised that unless he meant to wait for the Occupation  --  which the Boss in London would not approve  --  he had better get going . For a moment he had hesitated . But the Paris story would be covered , and the Government had gone South . He was able to locate and join a carful of fellow journalists who were headed for Tours and bedlam , where Press Wireless still functioned , at eightpence a word . Stocking the car with what food and drink and petrol they could buy at Tours , they had set out the next day for Bordeaux , to which the Government had preceded them . They travelled by roundabout lanes away from the main highways , which were choked with hysteria and horror . They passed sunny villages whose inhabitants seemed still unaware that the Germans were in Paris . But as they neared Bordeaux the panic there overflowed and swamped them . They had stopped for coffee at a small cafe when Petain 's voice came over the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans for terms . The waitress who served them was in tears , and the gilt letters which spelled American War Correspondent on the shoulders of their uniforms drew hostile glances in the hot , frantic streets . Through the Embassy they got passage on a small Dutch cargo boat which was on its way back from South Africa . The harbor at Le Verdon was bombed as they steamed out , with roughly eight times the ship 's normal complement aboard . And although few could have survived a hit in the circum/stances , the exhausted passengers on the crowded decks remained almost indifferent to this final hazard . Food was short , and they lived on two skimpy meals a day for an endless , blistering voyage . At Falmouth a group of cool , smiling women from the WVS had met them with tea and sandwiches . Looking into their serene faces , Jeff could only conclude that no one in England had been listening to the news from across the Channel . Not so , but quite otherwise , said Bracken . Look around you . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sentries and barbed wire in Whitehall , and the old carts and ploughs strewn on the fields against troopcarryingplanes , and the guerilla warfare school at Osterley ... . And now Mab , as tough as any of them . " Tell me something , " he said . " Why are n't you afraid ? " " But I am ! " She glanced over her shoulder towards the stairs . " I 'm terrified . Do n't give me away . " He made a rueful shrug of laughter , with an affectionate smile . " You do n't believe me , do you , " she accused him . " Well , it 's true . I 'm not like the rest of you . I 'm a coward . I 'm only praying that by the grace of God it wo n't show when the time comes . " " Well , believe it or not , by the grace of God it usually does n't , " he said . " What happens ? " She was watching him intently , for now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen people die , in France . " You find you have a sort of extra gadget , " he explained . " They call it adrenalin , I think . But they 're only guessing . It 's really just your own personal gadget , and it works . I promise you it will work . " " So that nobody knows you 're afraid ? "  | " So that you do n't disgrace yourself , " said Jeff . " So that sometimes you even surprise yourself . " " How do I know I 've got one too ? " " I 'll bet you , " said Jeff , and took out a half-crown and laid it on the mantelpiece . " Let it stay there . If ever you have hysterics  --  it 's yours , I lose . " " Oh , Jeff , if only we could be together now  --  ! " She went to him blindly and buried her face against his coat , while he held her , his cheek against her hair . " The worst part is worryingabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen to us down here in the country , unless the invasion actually comes off . But in London you 'll be in the front line , whatever happens ! Every time they drop a bomb on London I 'll wonder about you  --  and you ca n't be forever ringing up to say you 're all right ! I promised myself that if you just got back to England I could bear the rest . But it 's hard to make do with that . It 's hard ! " " I know , " he said , holding her . " If only I could be in London too  --  " she heard herself saying to her own astonishment , for she had always believed she was thankful  --  and ashamed  --  that she was not obliged to be in London . Now it seemed to her suddenly that the one thing that mattered was to be beside him , wherever he went  --  so that if anything happened to him she would be there , so that she need not sit helplessly miles away waiting for second-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all the more reason not to lose sight of him now  --  because if Jeff were going to die she had to die too , beside him where she belonged ... . " That would be worse for me , " he said quietly , and she looked up at him , in his arms . " I can worry about you less if you 're here at Farthingale , " he said , appalled to find that his voice was not quite steady . Her eyes  --  the green eyes of Tibby 's portrait  --  were swimming with tears , which dazzled him  --  her lips were set against the working of herp186small throat . He felt her trembling from head to foot , and it ran through his own body from hers , like a current ... . Tibby-mot felt like this with Tibby .... He was keyed very high with controlled nerves , he had gone short of sleep for weeks , braced for an ordeal which no one could predict . And now he recalled suddenly , in a dizzy wave , a night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel and he had come to lying on the floor in the approved air-raid posture , face down , hands locked behind his head , and in the reverberating silence of the wrecked room had distinctly heard himself saying , aloud : " I will come back to you , never fear  --  you are mine , Tibby , I want you  --  " In the press of more recent sensations he had forgotten that lightheadedinterlude at Boulogne . The Times man had come shouting down the corridor to rescue him , and they had prudentlyretired , shaken but unhurt , to the basement shelter where restoratives were available . Now , in Virginia 's drawingroom , he heard his own voice again saying , " I will come back to you , my darling , never fear  --  " and checked himself on the brink of the abyss , a ringing in his ears . " Jeff , I want to say a sort of charm , do you mind ? " He shook his head , unable to speak , and voluntarily she drew away from him till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . " ' There shall no evil befall thee , ' " said Mab , looking into hi eyes . " For He shall give His angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways . They shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone . ' " Then she bent , and laid her lips against his hands that held hers . Neither of them was aware that Tibby had spoken again across the generations , the same words Julian had heard in the Sprague parlor in Williamsburg the night before the army marched to Yorktown . " Mab  --  " Jeff drew her to the sofa and made her sit downp187beside him , her hands in his . " Mab , I feel very humble . I do n't deserve all this . " " It is n't something we can choose or refuse , " she said simply . " I was born loving you , that 's all . We ca n't do anything about that now . " " No , " he agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it . Remember that part of it , wo n't you , Mab . "  |p188LIFE  in London itself at first remained fantastically normal , and many evacuation areas heard sirens and bombs before London had so much as an alert . But even at Dover , which was being shelled now as well as bombed , the British were staying put . Well , if they think they can scare us , people said , sweeping up glass and digging each other out of debris . Meanwhile , methodical as a white mouse in a laboratory , Hitler pursued his terrible pattern . After the war of nerves and prophecies of doom came the bombing of shipping and the Channel ports , the attacks on the forward aerodromes , the surprise spot-bombing to confuse and scatter the defending forces  --  all gathering momentum as July ran into August . The RAF had its own pattern , prompt and deadly , rising to meet each new onslaught , taking toll , taking losses . Unmoved except to derision by horrendous German threats to " make England blind and deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of grim gaiety that got things done . The beaches bristled with barbed wire and blockhouses , concrete road-blocks went up , every field and golf course that provided landing-room for a horsefly was ploughed into ridges or strewn with derelict vehicles andp189machinery . It was everybody 's war . And " You can always take one with you " became a kind of password . Jeff had been fascinated and amused . What he had experiencedwithin himself , he now saw happening to a whole country . When it came , you stood up to it . More than once in France it had seemed to him as though his heart hit the roof of his mouth , during the long downward scream of the bombs , but when the bang was over and the walls had bulged and settled back again and the floor had ceased to heave , his heart was still there on the job , still in the groove . He was n't an invalid , he was n't even a handicap case , he did n't have to depend on the bottle of pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take it just as well as people who did n't have dicky hearts . And this was in itself a miracle . " That 's not to say I never turn a hair or bat an eye , " he told Sylvia after his second return from France . " I 'm not bragging , understand that . I 'm all green around the gills , no doubt , but I do n't have to lie down flat the way I used to if I so much as tried to catch a train . " " Oh , stuff , " said Sylvia , pleased . " You 've been catching trains ever since I married you . " " That 's what I mean , " he said earnestly . " If you had n't married me , I 'd probably have my knees under a nice safe desk in the New York office . " " And you 'd probably live longer , " said Sylvia . " Not necessarily . I was n't a very good risk a few years ago . " " And now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Just about . No more . No less . But it 's not my heart I 'll die of . " She came and sat down on his lap , rubbing her cheek along his . " It 's been good , has n't it , " she said . " Even with all this hanging over us , has n't it been good ! "  | " Honey , there 's no need to sound as though it was over ! " he objected , cradling her . " I never said it was . But even if there was n't any more  --  oh , Jeff , nobody 's better off ! " " So you would n't trade me for some guy with a red band on his cap and three rows of ribbons ? " " Nope . " " Thank you , " said Jeff politely . Even if there was n't any more . She could not have told why she said that , so casually , without apprehension  --  except that the future no longer stretched ahead to a comfortable three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever was coming arrived . The future was what you could make out of whatever you had left , for it was no longer possible to assume that everything would be the same a year , a month , a week from now . There was only today , and what you already had . Tomorrow might not be so good . Tomorrow , in fact , might not bear thinking of . But today , thought Sylvia , nobody was luckier , nobody was better off . And because tomorrow could n't change that , could n't spoil what had already been , because that much was already perfect , inviolate , and safe , tomorrow could come , and do its worst . You were still ahead . And this , though she did not know it , was the turning point of Sylvia 's war . Like Jeff , in her own way she had crossed the bridge and left panic behind . Like Jeff , she knew without ringing any bells or blowing any trumpets that by the grace of God she could take it . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his triumph , he had n't even dropped a bomb on it , and people were laughing about a German broadcast which described the English population as fear-crazed . " It 's a British panic  --  they 've got it backwards , " said one of the American correspondents at the Savoy . On the twentieth , Churchill 's ringing tribute to the boys of the RAF somewhatp191explained why Hitler was delayed  --  the English still owned the air over their island . On the twenty-fourth German bombers actually got to London and the sirens went , and there were bombs at last , and casualties . But the Germans had losses too . Three to one in planes , fifteen to one in personnel . He 'll have to do better than that , people said , , digging out . And so Mab 's birthday had come round again , in a world at war . Jeff sent regrets that he could not take his eye off Hitler long enough to come down to Farthingale and drink her health . He also sent a hamper of goodies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for blackout reading . Hitler took no particular notice of the day . At the end of the month , however , he made another speech  --  he would raze British cities , he said , in retaliation for recent visits from the RAF to the Reich , which had apparentlybegun to get under his skin . Let him get on with it , . then , people said . Three months since Dunkirk , a year since the declaration of war , and no invasion yet , they said . If he ca n't do it now he can never do it . What 's he waiting for ? There was a general feeling that the mid-September tides and moon would be his last chance this year , and that now he must make his try . Along with what Bracken called the Come-on-damn-you attitude , a growing tightness in the midriff had begun again , as the London raids got heavier . He was due to spring something new again . He always had something up his sleeve . Now for the secret weapon . Glider &; full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undreamed-of scale was mentioned seriously . Or gas . As September came in , the pattern changed . He had given up trying to destroy the ports , to knock out the aerodromes , to kill off the RAF . He had gone to work on London 's nerves . Day and night now the sirens went . At first people watched the dogfights from the streets , cheered the Spitfires , and scattered from machine-gun bullets when the Germanp192planes flew low . Harrod 's Store got a hole in its roof which upset its sprinkler system , and its shoppers got the giggles . Even with the nervous ones , the strange adaptability of the human fabric began to operate . It was almost impossible to be frightened to death half a dozen times a day . You finally had to eat and sleep and work , without bolting into a shelter every time there was a warning , even without rushing up to the roof to see the fun . Theaters and restaurants resumed their routine , functioned steadily right through the alerts . People began to ask one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had forgotten to listen for the All-Clearthoughyou could always tell by looking at the nearest policeman , he wore his gas-mask round in front at the ready , if there was a raid on .. . But Hitler was getting down to it now . His time was running out . He was always a dirty fighter , anything could happen now .... The household in Upper Brook Street was having tea , that first Saturday afternoon in September . Bracken had happened to come home early , it was Sylvia 's day off , and Dinah was just arriving from her office at the WVS when the sirens went . Only Jeff was absent . " They 're at it again down the River , " Dinah said , in the queer moment of dead silence which always seemed to follow the first howl of the alert . " I thought I heard crumps even before I started for home . Apparently they 're coming up this way now . " She poured her tea with a steady hand , and carried it to the window , still wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south . " " Churchill paid a visit to Dover the other day , " Bracken said . " Maybe they 're going to raze it in retaliation . " " They 're nearer than Dover , " said Dinah , and the telephone rang , which , when a raid had started , meant something pretty drastic . " Blast , " muttered Bracken as he reached for it . " I 'd justp193got settled in . " The conversation was very brief . " Man ca n't even get a cup of tea any more , " he complained . " Take it easy , now  --  I 'm off . " " What 's happened ? " Sylvia set down her cup with a clink . " Where are you off to ? " " The East End . Something 's up . If you get hold of Jeff ask him to get in touch with the office . " He collected his gas-mask , for they were being done again , and his tin hat , and kissed his womenfolk , and was gone . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him , " that this is going to be a nasty one . " " Just in time to spoil dinner , " Sylvia remarked , for one had to say something . She wondered if any amount of familiarity with the sound of the siren would ever eliminate that first sick crunch in the stomach . It was humiliating , degrading , and silly , and she was perfectly sure that it did n't happen to anyone else . Not that one could ask . " That bomb in Regent Street has n't gone off yet , " said Dinah . " You have to go round it . " They ate a rather silent dinner in the dining-room . Bracken did not return and Sylvia began to wrestle again with the familiar necessity to worry about where Jeff was . The maid who served them reported as she brought the coffee that the sky over the City was as pink as dawn , and it would n't be much of a blackout tonight . When they had finished coffee they went out on the front steps to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of burning . There were tremendous great fires down at the docks , which would act as targets all night long for more German planes . In contrast to what was happening down the River the West End streets were ominously quiet , almost deserted . But even while they stood there a fire company dashed by towards the pink sky . Their warden passed along his beat , and touched the brim of his helmet with a forefinger.  | " Better make yourselves cosy in the shelter tonight , " he said . " They 're really letting go this time ! " But there was nothing directly overhead and they returned to the drawing-room and sat down together , with books and cigarettes , trying to get through the evening . Slowly they became conscious of a vibration in the air , like a giant mosquito with hiccups . A.A. guns barked angrily , and the crump of bombs in the distance came nearer as they listened . Midge , who had gone to bed in his swing , woke up , went down briskly for a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused looks , and Dinah said , " Bother , I suppose we may as well go downstairs . " Carrying their books and knitting and Midge in his cage , they resettled themselves in the comfortable shelter room , not for the first time , to wait out the night . Sylvia 's hands were cold , and she felt a little queasy . Jeff had gone down to Dover again that morning , because once you had been to Dover you could n't stay away . There was also a conviction among the correspondents that Dover was the place to be when It happened . Sylvia , who would have preferred to have him nearer at hand when the Germans came ashore , told herself once more in exasperation at her own reflexes that she must get used to it . Look at Dinah , she told herself . And Bracken 's out in it too . Towards midnight , in what seemed to be a lull , they went upstairs again and opened the street door . Instinctively they drew back , as from a furnace . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the sky , the red glow of fire illumined London like infernal day . The smell of burning was everywhere , and ashes settled in their hair . The lull , if there had been one , was suddenly over . Ack-ack fire , the crump , crump , CRUMP of a stick of bombs approaching , the mumble and whine of planes , the patter of falling metal , struck them like a blow . Dinah closed the door and stood a moment with her backp195against it in the darkened hall  --  futilely shutting out the sight and sound of London on fire . " Well ! " she said , more in indignation than dismay . " What a night ! " They made their way back to the basement room , and in its comforting light they looked at each other silently and sat down . Where did the flames stop ? How much longer could they sit there in safety ? How would they know ? What about the rest of them  --  Bracken  --  Jeff  --  Evadne  --  Mona  --  Nigel .... " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinah said at last . " I do n't know  --  being on duty helps to hold you up , some-how  --  " " I was thinking of me , " said Dinah with a little smile . " It helps to hold me up to have you here . " Sylvia could find nothing to say . It was the first time Dinah had left any such opening . Sylvia decided it was probablyjust tact , to make her feel better . She watched Dinah light a cigarette , noticing that her fingers were quite steady . Sylvia wanted one herself , but knew her own hands would betray her . She had never learned , because one did n't discuss it , that everybody had his own secret soft spot of fear  --  and hers was fire . She had always promised herself that she could stand up to anythingbut fire , and her knowledge of incendiary bomb drill was exceeded only by her hatred of it . She knew that you could n't beat an incendiary bomb to death , nor kick it into the gutter , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tongs , shovel , and sand was the admiration of everyone . Tonight all London was on fire . It was only a question of time , Sylvia thought , till the flames reached the street outside . Dinah put a record on the portable gramophone and sat down again , her face set in its usual serene composure.  |p196Almost  immediately the house jarred and shuddered from a new impact . " That 's enough , " said Dinah , rising again . " They really must come down here . " Gregson , the butler , veteran of the old war , worked at a First-Aid Post around the corner . His elderly wife and the parlormaid insisted they felt most comfortable in the kitchen during a raid , where with their feet on the fender and knittingin their hands and a pot of tea alongside , they kept each other company in the best of humors till the All-Clear came . Tonight Dinah went up and exercised her authority . Mrs. Gregson and Foster the parlormaid descended to the shelter , bringing their knitting and a fresh pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking companionably while the gramophone played Gilbert and Sullivan with impromptu twentieth century off-stage effects . At intervals during the night they groped up to the street door and looked out , marvelling that the fire seemed to come no nearer though it burned higher and brighter as dawn broke , and the air was full of ash and fumes . Their warden caught them there and admonished them , and said the Fire Service was a marvel , and he thought they had tried for Waterloo Bridge , but nothing had landed in this sector so far . " Ca n't tell it from daybreak , " he said , ruefully staring Citywards . " What 's left , I wonder . What 's left down there . Well , this is the way we thought it would be . He 's a bit late starting , but , " he concluded with the cheerful cockneyism ,  --  we ca n't complain !  --  Fleet Street , where Bracken was  --  and the Temple , where Nigel lived  --  what was left , down there ... . The All-Clear went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stolid city which nevertheless still stood , except for dreadful pockets of disaster . Near the River there were areas of smouldering ruin , and groups of dazed , homeless peoplep197who carried in their hands all they had left . There were the dead and injured . And there were exhausted , blackened , singed , and undefeated fire-fighters , wardens , rescue squads , and the white-faced , self-controlled ambulance girls , their dark blue sweaters and slacks grey with ash and plaster , their hands scraped and gritty , from crawling about trying to reach something which still moved . The sun was well up when Bracken returned home . Havingfound a willing taxi man he had checked up on Evadne and Mona on his way . Both had hailed his arrival jauntily , with drawn , determined smiles . Mona had had the worst of it this time , while Evadne 's sector nearby was without incidents . Stephen , she was thankful to say , was out on tour with a concert party , and had had a lively time in Liverpool a few nights previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on first nights . Bracken was black as a fireman himself , and his grey suit was pocked with little brown holes where cinders had fallen , and smudged dark with mud from around a firehose , and on top of that streaked with white plaster dust . Tired as he was , there was a kind of exhilaration about him . " He ca n't do it , " he said , drinking cup after cup of tea in the dining-room before he went up to bathe and change . " He threw down everything he had tonight , for hours on end , and these people are not stampeded . It 's the same everywhereyou go  --  in the shelters , in the rest centers , in the Services  --  these people will not give in . " " But if it goes on and on like this  --  " said Sylvia . " They 'll sit out worse , " said Bracken with conviction . " I 've always said so  --  and now I 'm surer than ever . I saw an old lady out sweeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come unhinged for sure  --  and she explainedthat horses came that way every day and the glass would be bad for their feet ! Some of the glass had come out of her own windows . I saw women carrying jugs of waterp198and mugs of tea out to the firemen around the target fires , and standing by joking while they drank it . I helped pull a girl-child out of a cave-in and she would n't budge even for First Aid till we dug out her mother  --  dead . I talked to some bombed-out people in a queue waiting for a bus to take them somewhere  --  they had no idea where . Nobody was having hysterics . Nobody had any idea of asking for mercy . This wo n't do him any good , ' they said . I tell you Hitler is licked ! " said Bracken , thumping the table . " It may take a while , but London can do it ! " He went away to take a bath . He said Jeff was travelling by car , and would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things cooled off . He said not to worry , Jeff would turn up . Which Jeff did , about eight o'clock , when the sirens had just let off again . He was much cleaner than Bracken , but showed the effects of a sleepless night which he had spent with Denis Arnold and another American correspondent between a ditch and a hilltop beyond Gravesend , trying to count the planes as they streamed towards London  --  picking out the sound of interceptors , and the chatter of machinegunsand ack-ack , and the thunder of bombs as they landed  --  watching the flames and the fireworks as they mounted the sky over London , and the occasional fiery comet of a falling plane or barrage balloon . Within sight of the unexpected holocaust , they had got very cold and frightened , Jeff said , waiting for daylight on the roads . Common sense told them that the petroleum tanks on the docks had caught  --  imagination insisted that they would find the whole of London a burnt-out shell . In the clear , sunny dawn of that Sunday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fires which still burned , and the homeless , and the rescue workers . Gradually they perceived that London was still there . Incredulously they beheld the calm , untouched dome of St. Paul 's . And thep199bridges , all intact . And the Tower . And Fleet Street . And Trafalgar Square . And with a solemn elation they had becomeconvinced that London would always be there . " But you know a fire always looks worse than it is , " said Bracken , the old-timer , to Jeff , who had been weaned , they said , on printer 's ink . " Sure I know , " said Jeff . " That 's so we can look forward to hell . " That Saturday had begun early at Farthingale , with a lone German plane crashing in a field near the house . In the remarkably short time before the Home Guard arrived on the scene the pilot had extricated himself and was found lying a few feet clear of the wreckage , cursing in German and bleeding freely . They pulled him further from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to probe the remnants for other survivors by the whole thing bursting into flames . His sidearms were confiscated , First Aid was applied , and he was half-carried to the terrace at Farthingale , while the local policeman took over from Captain Westley of the Home Guard and telephoned for the local ambulance . While they awaited it the pilot sat , surrounded by his captors , with his back against the balustrade and his knees drawn up , sullen , silent , and obviously suffering . " We ought n't to stare at him , " Virginia murmured to Mab as they went out through the French doors to the terrace . " Perhaps you should bring him inside and let him lie down ? " she suggested to the policeman , who said better not move him again , thanks , which was doubtless more wise than callous . The man raised his head to look at them , seeming still incredulous that this thing had happened to him . Then he looked carefully around him , as though memorizing hisp200surroundings  --  and back to the woman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not occur to any of them that what most occupied his thoughts was the total absence of excitement or confusion . These people had not been at all panic-stricken by his arrival , and now that he was at their mercy they were not angry or threatening . He understood that an ambulance was coming for him . Where was the terror ? Where was the revenge ? Did they not know that their cities were in ruins ? Another thing they did not know was that his navigator , who could still walk though his right shoulder was smashed , had gained the shelter of the hedgerow before anyone reached the scene of the crash . The ambulance came . He was helped on to a stretcher and driven away . That girl , he was thinking with nothing but indignation  --  on her face there was only pity . No fear . The German plane burnt itself out , and the cows in the field soon forgot about it and began to graze again . People drove round to look at it , and some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gossip . And sometimes one of them would say , " Is this the beginning ? " It was a question which had crossed Mab 's mind too , as she was returning home from Overcreech House later that morning . Virginia believed firmly in doing everything just as usual until the Germans actually landed , and so Mab had continued to work on her backhand with instruction from the ex-games-mistress at the infant school . She had come back by bus as far as the village and then , accompanied of course by Noel the spaniel and carrying her racquet and wearing her tennis shoes , she had taken the footpath through the wood by the stream where she and Jeff had walked together last Christmas . She often came here with the dog , to sit on a fallen logand think about Jeff , who always seemed very near if she stayed quiet and listened for him . And this was the most dangerous of all the Williamsburg games she played  --  that therep201existed in the little wood a certain place where she and Jeff were always together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had heedlessly thrown her arms around him and heard his heart beating underneath his coat . Standing where they had stood that day , she would shut her eyes and wait  --  and somehow it would come again , that secret inner upheaval which had happened when he said with such cornpassion  --  " Likewhat , my darling ? " Unconsciously today she had paused again in the path ; waiting for Jeff  --  and then Noel was barking and scuffling somewhere on the left and she turned , always dreading that he would really manage to catch a rabbit and she would have to rescue it from his jaws . As she ran towards the sound it changed abruptly to a snarling growl , and there was a thrashing in the thicket  --  and she saw a blur of grey-green cloth on the ground and a snarling , kicking flurry of black dog beside it . A powerful hand had Noel by the collar and was trying to choke him into silence . For a single incredulous second Mab felt ice-water in her veins , felt rooted , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground with the dog struggling in his grasp , but struggling less effectively , gagging and gasping , growing limp " Drop him ! " cried Mab , and ran in swinging the tennis racquet . " Let my dog alone  --  let him go ! " The racquet bounced harmlessly once , on the strings , and she swung again with the edge of it forward  --  hard  --  and again with the edge downwards , hard . Noel wriggled free and scrambled away , choking , sneezing , growling , turning at once to face the enemy , groggy but game , coming in again with his teeth showing . But the man lay still on the ground , with a bleeding red welt across his forehead where the edge of the racquet had hit . He was not unconscious . He stirred at once , and raised a hand to his head , and muttered . Mab dropped the racquet , scooped up Noel in her arms , and ran.  |p202In  a very few minutes she emerged from the wood into open ground at the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running towards her  --  people who had heard a dog barking in the wood . She dropped to her knees on the ground then , still holding Noel and trying to get her breath , a stitch in her side , a pain in her chest , feelingsick , wanting to scream , wanting to cry ... . The first man reached her , panting . " What happened ? What did you see ? " " He 's by the stream  --  he tried to kill my dog  --  I hit him  --  look out , he 's not dead  --  " The man ran on . Others came up and passed her without pausing for questions , racing into the wood . She sat still on the ground while the pain in her chest receded , making sure that Noel was not damaged . He was too heavy for her to carry except in desperate necessity , and she wondered how she had got him as far as she did . They were still sitting there , congratulating themselves , when the search party returned , leading the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazedly to his head while the other arm dangled uselessly at his side . " My God , girl , you might have been killed ! " cried Captain Westley , who had appeared again from somewhere and was carrying her tennis racquet in his hand . " Mean to say you sloshed him with this ? " " He was lying down , " she explained faintly . More people were arriving , there were questions , exclamations , even some laughter  --  " He might have shot her at sight  --  wrong arm , very awkward for him  --  lying on his gun when she went for him  --  in bad shape to start with , lucky for her  --  does n't mean she did n't do a job on him  --  dog ' all right , my dear ?  --  good for him  --  could have been worse  --  " " Come along up , " said Captain Westley hastily , raising her to her feet as though she might be made of glass . " Getp203you out of this now , or your grandmother will have me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step , supported by his efficient grip on her upper arm , with Noel trotting confidently ahead , Mab reached the terrace at Farthingale where Virginia met them , heard the story with incredulity which became amusement , and sent for drinks all round . He who would be known henceforth as Mab 's German was carted off to the hospital , where he informed them all in perfect English that but for the damned dog he would have been able to evade capture until the arrival of the Fuehrer , who was due in England any day now . And when a nurse bent over him during the dressing of his wound he spat up into her face . There were no alerts at dusk that night , and the household at Farthingale went to bed as usual , except that Mab had an eggnogg with a drop of brandy in it to ward off nightmares about Germans in the wood . So now I know what happens when she encounters a German , Virginia thought , closing the door of her own room at last on the excitements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than I could have done . She does n't weigh ninety pounds , but she was able to save her dog . Not for the first time since noon Virginia put both hands to her eyes and allowed a long shudder to run through her . Suppose I had had to tell Jeff that Mab had been shot to death in our own wood , she thought . Jeff  --  not Irene . Unreasonablyshe had thought first of Jeff in reckoning up the aftermath of Mab 's adventure . All very well to say , with hindsight , that the German would not have wanted to call attention to himself by firing a gun . He carried a gun in a shoulder holster , and there was no telling what he might have done if his right arm had not been disabled , making a difficult draw . Mab had not thought of that , when she swung the tennis racquet at his head . Must I keep her always withp204me now , Virginia thought wearily , for the impulse was never to let Mab out of her sight again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on just as usual . It was n't enough to watch for parachutes , neither of these Germans had used one . From now on , Germans could be anywhere . Virginia herself always supervised the locking up each night . Glass doors into the garden were not much use , she thought as she got into bed . She had no sooner begun to drop off than she was roused again by the ringing of her bedside telephone . " Westley here , " a calm voice said . " The word has gone out . Have everybody get dressed and be prepared . " " You d-do n't mean inv  --  " The line clicked and he was gone . Outwardly composed , inwardly what she would have called twittering , Virginia went round knocking on doors , saying the same thing to each startled question from within , moving on before more questions could detain her : " Get dressed and come downstairs . There 's some kind of alert on . " Only one reply made any real impression on her mind . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd better make some tea . " Virginia had left Mab till the last . She opened the door quietly and went in . Mab was reading in bed , with the blackoutcertain still drawn . Noel , who had somehow stolen a lot of the limelight and after being regarded all his life as rather timid and too highly strung had now proved himself a mass of leonine courage , lay on the coverlet guarding her feet  --  which was not as a rule allowed . When Virginia appeared he rolled his eyes at her warily without moving , his chin comfortably pillowed on Mab 's ankles . Somewhat to his surprise , no one ordered him down . " We 're supposed to get dressed , " Virginia said , as though it was eight A.M. of an ordinary morning . " I 've just had ap205phone call from Captain Westley . Some kind of general alarm has gone out . " Mab felt again that trickle of ice through her veins  --  more Germans  --  able-bodied ones , capable of shooting a small black dog that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw a German uniform . She reached for him and pulled him along the coverlet into her arms , as Virginia said , " Darling , you must jump into some clothes at once . " " Listen ! " said Mab , sitting rigid with Noel in her arms . The churchbells  --  silent since mid-June all over England in order that their ringing might be the signal that invasion had begun  --  the churchbells in the village were ringing . " They 've come ! " gasped Mab , and swung out of bed , grabbing for her slippers . Virginia went to the wardrobe and chose warm clothes , though the night was mild  --  a tweed skirt , a woolen jumper  --  and tossed them at Mab . " Get into those quickly and come along to my room . " Outside Mab 's door , she ran . By the time Mab joined her , clothed and composed and very white , with Noel on a leash he seldom wore , Virginia was ready too . She had even put on lipstick . Together they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the lights on , inside the blackout , almost in silence they waited . Melchett brought in a tea-tray , exactly as though it was the usual time of day for tea , and as she set it down a car drew up outside and there was a certain amount of tramping about , and the knocker on the front door banged three times . Nobody in the room said anything . Virginia followed Melchett into the hall . " Ask who it is before you open the door , " she whispered , and waited just inside the curtain which masked the shaded light in the hall from the steps when the door was open . " Westley of the Home Guard ! " rang through the oakp206panels , and Melchett snatched open the door and he came round the curtain  --  an elderly , competent man who was somehow able to impart smartness even to that rough uniform with the Mons ribbon on its tunic , blinking a little even in the dim hall , a rifle in his hands  --  and Virginia could have kissed him for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good evening , Captain Westley . What now ? " " Apparently they 're here , " he announced gently . " Somewhere . Anyway , the password for invasion has been phoned in , and everyone is standing to . You 'll be all right , of course , except for parachutists . I want to leave a man here on your telephone , and two outside , so some one will have to stand by on this door . I should make ready if I were you . " " Ready for what ? We 're not supposed to move . " " No question of moving . But do n't anybody go back to bed . Stay all together , I would . You know the rules-bicycles  --  maps  --  petrol ? " She shook her head . " Kept locked up and hidden . There 's a bit of food available , of course " Ca n't do much about what 's in the larder now . Besides  --  you 're a household of women . No heroics , mind  --  use com-monsense . " He stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lowered voice outside . Following him to the steps , she made out a small force of men in the Home Guard uniform , a car , a couple of motor-cycles , and what appeared to be a Bren gun . A lad with a rifle passed her and was shown the telephone by Melchett , took possession of it and at once began a cryptic conversation with some one he called Fred . " It sounds awfully silly , " said Virginia , standing on the top step beside Westley in the dark . " But would anybody like some refreshment while you 're here ? " " Later , if we do n't have too much company , " he said . " Thanks very much . "  |p207He  got into the car and it moved away , followed by the motor-cycles and the gun . That sounded as though he might be back . Virginia returned to the drawing-room , unreasonably comforted . There were men about the house . Mab was sitting on the sofa drinking tea , with Noel lying at her feet . She found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided by Melchett were beyond her , but she managed to sip the tea . Everyone looked at Virginia in well-behaved silence as she came in . " The Guard is here , " she said , going to the tray to fill her own cup . " One of them will be on the telephone and two outside . Captain Westley again , God bless him . " " Have they landed ? " Mab asked , for somebody had to . " He does n't know . The code signal for invasion has been sent out . Now we just have to wait . " They waited all night . Sometimes the telephone in the hall rang , and the lad posted there talked into it . But nothing else happened . Some of the girls went to sleep on the chairs and sofas where they sat . Some of them smoked endlessly , some tried to knit or read . Putting on the gramophone would drown outside sounds , and everyone wanted to listen  --  for what ? At dawn the birds began . Mab had brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guide the needles for trembling , which shamed her , and she pretended to doze , leaning against Virginia 's shoulder . With her eyes closed she visualized Jeff 's half-crown on the mantelpiece . He had already won it once today , when she managed not to go to pieces in the wood . Whatever he had bet on had worked and she had even surprised herself , as he had prophesied . But now was the second time round . If she did anything wrong now he could still lose it . And this was worse , this time you had time to think , and imagine things . If there **28;10658;TOOLONG frightened her ) the forbidden horror , the dreadful eyeless face of our existence . In a desperation how different from the placid firmness with which Arthur Winner 's mother successfully rejected knowledges she did not care to have , Helen pushed back the horror ; refused to look . On the world she never made , she imposed with all her strength a pattern of the world she wanted  --  a place of peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; the abode of gentle people , who , kind-minded , fair-minded , clean-minded , remarked the perfect man and beheldthe upright ; and who , once believed into existence , could alleviate  --  their unspotted life was serene ; their end was peace  --  Helen 's recurrent anguish of trying not to know , yet always knowing , that in the midst of life we are in death . On a Saturday evening toward the end of the May of thirteen years ago , George Detweiler ; his wife , Alice ; his daughter , Helen , who was sixteen ; and his son , Ralph , who was five , were at their lakeside bungalow . May was early in the Ponemah Associationseason ; and the only other people up that weekend were the Iendersons  --  Tom Henderson ; his wife , Edith ; and their daughters , Clarissa , who was twenty-one , and Adelaide , who was eighteen . Like the Detweilers , the Hendersons had come to open their bungalow , which was on the point , a quartermilealong the lake from the Detweilers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pleasantly busy all day with small jobs of carpentry and painting . For the jobs he had noted to do tomorrow , he needed a number of small items that the generalstore at Hancock , a village five or six miles away on the Eatontown pike , would probably have . After supper , a list prepared , Clarissa and Adelaide took the station wagon to get them . They stopped to see if the Detweilers wanted anything ; and Helen Detweiler thought she would go with them for the ride . The station wagon left . Darkness fell , with a fine full moon rising . At the Detweiler bungalow , little Ralph was put to bed . The night was balmy , the moonlight brilliant on the lake . George Detweiler carried a canoe down to the water . He helped Alice , who was recovering from a surgical operation , and was40still not very strong , to settle herself in the canoe ; and they went for a paddle . About fifteen minutes later , while the canoe idled along well out from shore , something happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been handling canoes since he was a boy , and the lake was perfectly calm ; yet the canoe , in one way or another , overturned . The mishap , though awkward and inconvenientenough , was hardly to be regarded as serious . George , a strong man and a fine swimmer , aided by the floating canoe , could not have anticipated the least difficulty in getting himself and his wife to land , only a few hundred yards away , even if no other help was to be had . As it happened , there was help . The full moonlight had brought Tom and Edith Henderson out to sit on their veranda overlooking the lake . They saw the Detweilers ' canoe glide by ; and though they did not see whatever the accident was , George 's prompt shouts reached them easily . Tom Henderson ran down to his float . Moored there was a rowboat with an outboard motor . The motor , by bad luck , refused to start ; and Tom Henderson lost time with that ; but he had called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy ; they were all right ; they could hold on . Tom Henderson hurried to his boathouse for a pair of oars . Returning with them , he unclamped the outboard motor and tipped it up onto the float . Plain to be seen in the bright night was the upside-down canoe , perhaps two hundred yards away . George and Alice , with no apparent trouble , were holding on . George , swimming , had even begun to steer the canoe and his wife toward shore . Casting off , Tom Henderson swung his bow at them , and rowed . A practiced rower , he had no need to look over his shoulder to keep his course , so he did n't look until he judged himself near at hand . Turning then , he saw the driftingcanoe , right enough , some twenty feet from him , but no one was holding to it . Even after the bodies were recovered , what happened to George and Alice Detweiler was as hard to say as what overturnedthe canoe . Though Tom Henderson had his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't have failed to41hear a cry , or any considerable disturbance in the quiet water . Ile had heard nothing . The likeliest-seeming explanation would be that Alice Detweiler , with no warning , lost consciousness . George , when she let go the canoe , moved hastily to keep her from sinking . The lake was chilly still ; possibly , his muscles were chilled . A too-sudden movement might have set on general , totally incapacitating , cramps . Aghast to find the canoe floating alone , Tom Henderson shot his rowboat up . In the water , he saw a movement ; or perhaps only imagined that he did . He pulled off his sweater and trousers , kicked his shoes away , and dived in . The dive found him nothing ; and neither did succeeding dives , which he made from the surface , until he was obliged to stop , exhausted , and hang onto the gunwale of his boat . Edith Henderson had left the bungalow veranda and come down to the float . Now she was calling , frightened ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the boat ; and since he could do nothing more , he rowed for shore . Arriving at the float , he found waiting for him not only Edith , but Clarissa and Adelaide , and Helen Detweiler . They were late , because , not able to get all the things at Hancock , they had been to Brocton . As the station wagon passed the Hendersonplace to take Helen home , they heard those last calls across the water . Knowing something must be wrong , they stopped , and came running down . Tom Henderson tied his boat to the float . Iie was obliged to tell them , including Helen , what had happened . Sitting in his wet clothes in the boat , he told them with difficulty , greatly winded . Stepping onto the moonlit float , still unable to get his breath , Tom Henderson suddenly suffered a heart attack . Telephoned for , young Doctor Shaw drove right out ; but when he reached the Hendersons ' , the only service he could perform was to pronounce Tom Henderson dead . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind , that moment 's shock , Arthur Winner must admit , might well do so . The hideous , the incredible , impossible  --  a few hours ago the Detweilers were at supper , and what danger threatened anyone ?  --  news was spoken up to Helen by a hardbreathing , moonlit man  --  how little like the Mr. Henderson Helen had always knownl  --  in a boat . The wet man , gaining the float , shaking in the silver light as he tried to straighten himself , was suddenly struck dumb , collapsing on his bony bare knees , falling forward , his face on the planking under which lapped the lake water . Hours of night , of horror , of terror had to follow before Helen , in spite of everything , was no longer able to stay awake . The exact effect of such a shock could never be predictablepeoplehave supped full of horrors with no result other than that direness can not start them ; people , after the most dreadful griefs and losses , will in more cases than not , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in ordinary self-occupation quite themselves again . In Helen 's case , the indubitable effect  --  Helen would never be the same again  --  the observable markingof the mind , might be a matter as much of this blow 's timing as of this blow 's force . For some years now not a child , yet with final adjustments to being a woman far from complete , Helen , by her unsureness , was left in the open , in every direction defenseless . The Helen thus caught might be thought of as destroyed root and branch  --  not only the hesitant but mostly unalarmed girl of the past ( the happy-enough Helen , having fun helping her mother earlier with the evening meal ; the carefree Helen , pleased to be treated as a grownup , allowed to drive off , for the ride , with girls as old as Tom Henderson 's daughters ) , but also a future woman , very different from Helen today , that Helen was , until then , going to be . Feeling the brute blow of death , made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical body must be , seeing that death was its appointed portion ! How bad , then , must Helen be  --  how bad , perhaps , had Helen been ? Were there wicked thoughts or secret experimental acts , known to her , which made her deserve her punishment ? Had her parents done that which , half known to her , made them deserve theirs ? 42 43From the now-loathed body of this death , what , what would deliver Helen ? Next day , the world went on . Doctor Shaw had taken Helen , and little Ralph , roused in the middle of the night , back with him to his Roylan home . They remained there , while the whole of Brocton , staggered , really stunned , talked over and over the grotesque compounding of tragedy ; while the lake was dragged ; and while Noah Tuttle , George Detweiler 's attorney , and Arthur Winner Junior , coexecutor with the First National Bank of George 's will , went into George 's affairs . These in- volved mostly the First National Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George 's great-grandfather had been one of the bank 's founders ; his grandfather had been pres- ident , and so had his father , and so had his Uncle Ned  --  though developments were to suggest that Uncle Ned did not bring much to the management but his name . When Uncle Ned , a certain pressure put on him , retired , George , though then a mere assistant cashier and no more than thirty-five , was hastily elected to succeed him . I-Iigh time ! If not exactly known to be , the First National un- der Uncle Ned was strongly suspected of being overextended  --  in difficulties . Later , George Detweiler was to tell Arthur Winner that the suspicions were well founded , that " in difficul- ties " was a gross understatement . For several months they did n't know from day to day whether they could keep their doors open ; and there had been one desperate session with the bank examiners , who only at the very last minute let themselves be persuaded that part of the bank 's actually worthless paper might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ; though , in his extenuation , it might be fair to note that the nearly fatal bad management or judgment could have proved of little real consequence if a then country-wide depression had not conjoined with a local financial catastrophe  --  the final going- out-of-business of the Brocton Rapid Transit Company , an elec- tric interurban railway in whose expensive construction and44always unprofitable operation many Brocton people had unwisely invested . George Detweiler ( not unhelped by better times ; and by a succession of payments , at first thought out of the question , on the transit company 's bonded indebtedness ) put the bank back on its feet . Five years after George became president , the First National was in good shape ; once again Brocton County 's leadingbank ; and obviously thriving . As befitted a banker , George was closemouthed about matters of policy and management . What arrangement he and the directors had , only they and he knew ; but with the bank prosperous ( thanks to him ) it seemed safe to guess that the board would have no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , niggardly . So guessing , both Noah Tuttle and Arthur Winner Junior ( who had taken legal custody of George 's papers ) were astonished to discover that George as the bank 's president received in salary exactly what he had received as assistant cashier . Of course , this went a long way to explain the next discovery  --  that George 's estate was , for a man of his position , modest , or , even , meager . Helen and little Ralph would take a good-sized GreenwoodAvenue house ( with a good-sized mortgage ) ; an unimprovedproperty out at Roylan whose tumble-down relic of an old fieldstone farmhouse George was planning someday to restoreas a country home ; and the bungalow at the lake . In addition to real property , George had qualifying shares of bank stock and a certain amount of savings and insurance  --  much less of both than a man like George Detweiler , clear-sighted and careful , would be expected to have . Further investigation did something to resolve these perplexities . George , the size of it was , had not intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many a year . It had not , naturally , been any niggardliness of a directors ' board that determined George 's salary . George meant to hold down the bank 's expenses . To make his compensation commensurate with his services , he was accepting options to buy stock . At no present cost to the bank , options would enable him to take , in due course , an ever-larger share of profits he had good reason to believe the45bank , managed by him , was bound to earn . A shrewd and forward-looking man , George had planned well . By his prudenceand economy he was making as good as certain that before he was old he would be rich . As it was , this exiguous and insufficient estate  --  by no means the provision , ample , secure , and ordered that George , far in advance of possible need , would certainly have meant to prepare  --  presentedproblems . As it was  --  well , Noah hawed and hummed , those options , for instance ! The bank , in order to expressregret , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; still , nothing like what George might one day have realized . Then , the Roylan acreage  - -  other Roylan property owners had first refusal ; and they might  --  Then , at the lake ; that could n't go on the open market ! Shaking his old head sadly , Noah would see what would be best . Arthur Winner Junior , the actual executor , was sent , with a nod , about his business . All that could be done , Noah Tuttle duly and quickly did . In two weeks he came up with a worked-out settlement that must excite everyone 's admiration . The estate , liquidated as he proposed , and the resulting funds handled as he proposed , could be made to give the Detweiler children an assured income to more than pay their expenses if they lived , as he supposed they would , with some cousins of theirs at Eatontown until such time as Ilclen might normally expect to marry , and Ralph would be old enough to earn a living . Noah went over his figures very carefully with Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Arthur Winner Junior what had been decided . To Helen , still pale in a silence of seeming extended shock , Noah then undertook to explain his plan , fully but simply , so a child could understand . Helen heard him with understanding . When he was clone , Helen thanked Mr. Tuttle for his trouble . She then answered with a plan of her own , putting things fully but simply , so Mr. Tuttle could understand . Most of the selling that Noah proposed she approved of ; but , no , she did not wish to sell the Greenwood Avenue house . She did not wish to live with the Eatontown cousins ; nor did she wish them to be appointed guardians . She hoped that Mr. Tut-46tle would consent to act as guardian for her and Ralph until she came of age , when she would ask to be appointed Ralph 's guardian . A little money spent on the Greenwood Avenue house would make it possible to take boarders . Long employed by the Detweilers was a colored cook , one of the estimable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Marigold would stay ; so they could manage . Helen herself meant to get a job as soon as possible . In this way , Ralph 's home would not have to be broken up ; current expenses would be met ; and when the time came , there would be money for Ralph to go through college on . The really extraordinary thing was that Helen , sixteen , with no practical or financial experience , in the end overbore Noah Tuttle , sixty-nine , ripe with such experience . At the time , Arthur Winner Junior was filled with astonishment . He was even dismayed . This was not business ! Helen purposed to put money , a good deal , into an enterprise  --  taking boarders  --  which she knew nothing about . What made her think she could meet her expenses ? Helen 's plan was open to a dozen obvious objections . Moreover , Arthur Winner Junior , disapproving , was fairly sure that he understood Noah 's unbusinesslike reason for not raising objections , or not raising them conclusively . The reason was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion , her thought-out complete scheme of selfabnegation . Helen was a good girl and a brave girl , and Noah was touched . He revered goodness and bravery . Helen 's candid innocentface and slight girl 's figure touched him . Toward women as women , Noah held an attitude shaped by the conventions , the presumptions , the social uses of the nineteenth century 's notion of chivalry . This chivalry required not only a genteel , a courteous looking-away from anything that the notion must exclude , but also an actively constructive idealization that could , for instance , associate rosebuds or lilies with young females , girls still maiden . Resulting feelings , softening an old man 's brusque manner and even moistening his matter-of-fact eye , appearedgravely to have impaired his judgment . Could Arthur Winner Junior in seriousness recommend a scheme devised by47ra child to his coexecutor , the bank ? He had been disturbed enough to speak to his father . Arthur Winner Junior 's astonishment at this going-into-reverse of Noah 's was not , he found , shared by his father . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forty years  --  and such a partner !  --  be ignorant of Noah 's occasionalpropensity to act emotionally , of Noah 's sometimes sentimental sensibilities ? Required to pass on Noah 's almost certainlyemotional capitulation , Arthur Winner Senior 's cool , inquiring mind would not waste time on causes ; he weighed consequences . To judge those , he had only to bend on George Detweiler 's young daughter his detached acuteness . Though far from disparaging them , though acknowledging their personal and social utility , his father , Arthur Winner felt sure , never would submit to being moved by mere goodness and mere bravery as Noah was moved by them . The idle question with which Noah so involved himself  --  ought goodness and bravery , ought Helen 's valiancy and selflessness , to be revered ?  --  Noah 's partner dismissedat once . His question was : Could this thing work ? Detached acuteness 's survey seemed to have satisfied Arthur Winner 's father that work this could . When he had listened , patientand reflective , to his son 's statements of concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dry , but spoken as usual to help rather than to reprove : " No ; you 're not able to be sure the plan 's safe or wise . But it 's what Helen wants to do . Son , when you can , always advise people to do what you see they really want to do . So long as what they want to do is n't dangerously unlawful , stupidly unsocial , or obviously impossible , you can , and you should . Doing what they want to do , they may succeed ; doing what they do n't want to do , they wo n't succeed . " In an understanding of his father , even then almost fullgrown , Arthur Winner could take his father 's meaning . The penetrative eye , quietly considering Helen , had come on and identified that type of true resolve whose force is as nearly inflexibleas any human force can be . What Helen proposed was no momentary notion which she would be free to tire of or to think better of . To this plan of hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fixed in her fiber ; the compulsion was applied at levels of unconscious desirethat reason with reason 's counterarguments of unhappiness , of disappointment , of exhaustion , could never hope to reach . Do n't worry , in short ! Helen 's surface proposal , that part of her plan she had outlined to Noah Tuttle , was not beyond her physicaland mental capacities . The plan  --  to make a home for little Ralph ; to support him , and bring him up  --  in so far as doing it depended on Helen , was , then , practicable . No faltering need be feared , no possible conflict arising later between Helen 's own interests and those interests of little Ralph to which she meant to give her life . To that anguished inquiry : What , what would deliver her from the body of this death ? an answer had miraculouslycome . Little Ralph would ! Arthur Winner did not doubt that his father divined this truth , that he saw this inflexible resolve 's real object . In the way of that too , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years  --  Helen was putting the most formidableimpediment she could devise . Through years when Helen would be looked on as most nubile , when all the other girls were marrying and having children , when men were most likely to press her to marry , no one could be really surprised if 1-Ielen refused . For everybody to see , she had a child already : and the duty of taking care of him wholly occupied her . Afterward , because she had never married , people would hardly expecther to . Having undoubtedly divined so much , did Arthur Winner Senior go on , divine more by applying himself to why this should be ? Arthur Winner could not say . Though blinking no truths , his father , like Noah Tuttle , like the well-bred of that whole generation , preferred , unless he had a practical  --  say , legal  --  reason , not to spell some truths out . And , indeed , no certain spelling-out would ever be possible here . From a marriage bed , from that loathed warmth , Ralph was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little girl , outside a big bedroom 's blank closed door in the perfect quiet of a hall 's late night or early morning , heard a big bed , during the day always neatly made , silent , and motionless , now soundingwith dim persistence , with the quicker and quicker rhythmic49creak of a horror that was in the end to prove punishable by drowning ? Who knew ? Helen herself might not be allowed to remember ! No ; on the whole ; Arthur Winner Senior had probablysought no further . What he did not need to know , he did not care to know . What he needed to know , he did know . Helen had a practicable plan ; very well , Helen would be helped . Of good omen might be the fact that he and Noah had at hand the very means to help Helen . Noah Tuttle 's secretary was a Mrs. Hunt , a woman of sixty  --  actually , an inheritance from the days when old Judge Lauderdale was the firm 's senior partner . To Mrs. Hunt , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could stop working : but for a few years , Mrs. Hunt worked on  --  as a matter of habit , perhaps ; or because she did not know what else to do with herself . Now she had begun to express a wish to retire  --  though only , of course , when Mr. Tuttle had been able to find someone to suit him . Noah , therefore , proposed to Arthur Winner 's father  --  to consult Arthur Winner Junior , or Julius Penrose , who had just joined the firm , was not deemed necessary  --  that Helen be taken into the office . Helen would start a secretarial course at the Brocton Business Institute ; and in the afternoons she could do filing , things like that ; and let Mrs. Hunt show her the work . Eventually , when Helen 's typing and shorthand became good enough , she would take Mrs. Hunt 's place . In six months , Helen 's plan was fully operative . She had her proposed job ; she had her house ; she and Marigold had their selected paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured ; and with his , hers  --  the future she wanted , at heart , for herself . Arthur Winner Senior was not wrong ; this plan , so far as the plan depended on Helen , had proved feasible . Helen made it work . She would go right on making it work . And in so far as this plan , that assured future , did n't depend on Helen ? Looking at her with a strengthened stir of compassion , eying with compassion Helen 's tired face and tense body , Arthur Winner said : " We  --  everyone who knows you  --  know50what you are perhaps better than you do , Helen . All of us will help you any way we can  --  " The door of Judge Lowe 's chambers opened . Edna Keating , refolding her dictation book , crossed to her desk . She said : " The judge will only be a minute now , Mr. Winner . He had to go on the bench again . He 's through . He 'll be right out . " To Helen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake tonight ; so I 'll be in early tomorrow . We wo n't be going on with the hearing until ten ; so if you want me to see what I can do with Ralph , tell him I 'd like to have a talk with him  --  around nine . Possibly I can change his mind about college ; but if I ca n't , we ought at least to be able to work out something definite for him to do instead . " ( No doubt that " business loan " Ralph did n't get from Noah ! ) Helen said : " Oh , if you would , please , Mr. Winner ! I 'll tell him . You 're so kind  --  " Arthur Winner said : " Good night , my dear . I 've a feeling this will turn out all right . " From beyond the open door , Judge Lowe called : " That , Arthur , did my heart good ! Work 's not often such a pleasure . " Coming into the room , Judge Lowe unhooked his robe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His massive domed forehead gleamed lightly with sweat ; his solid cheeks showed a color of heat ; but his strong-lipped mouth had a humorous twist and his eyes shone with grim amusement . " This Ballard fellow has been in a couple of times  --  nonsupport ; would n't live with his wife . Been before a justice of the peace once or twice ; assault and battery on her  --  that sort of thing . Last time they were in , Lew Studdiford , who 's appearing for him for some reason , asked me to continue  --  thought they could be got together ; and meanwhileLew said Ballard agreed to give her some money each week . I did n't put much stock in the getting-together ; but I did n't mind continuing , because I wanted Morris 's office to have a chance to find out what Ballard really earned  --  I knew he was lying about that . Well , I had a letter from the wife early this week ; he had n't paid her anything . I told Morris to send him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was a51little too much . So I said : ' Let a bench warrant issue . I want him picked up right now and brought right in . ' " Judge Lowe nodded his head several times . Producing an enormous yellow silk handkerchief , he thoroughly wiped his forehead . " Well , Lew , who was here  --  he 's also appearing for the Dummer girl  --  said he was sure it was some mistake ; fellow had the day wrong . He 'd find him , bring him in . So I had the warrant held . Fifteen minutes ago , Lew turned up with him . Ballard admitted right away he had n't paid any money . When I asked him why not , had n't he agreed he would ; he said that was then . Mr. Studdiford had been saying they 'd get back togetherso he supposed she 'd be giving him a little . She said no ; so he 'd just tell me now she would n't see any of his money while she acted that way . The idea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail you have lots of time to think . ' Your personalrelations , ' I said , ' do n't concern me ; that 's between you and your wife . You have n't paid ; and you 've just told me you have no intention of paying . Take this man , Sheriff ; I 'm holding him in contempt . ' Up pipes Lew : ' No order yet , your Honor . ' " The grim shine of amusement in Judge Lowe 's eyes increased . IIe said : " One on me ! True , I 'd continued without making an order . I could n't very well cite him for noncompliance . That really hurt ; I could see this lout getting off ; and what to do ? " Then , I had it . I said : ' There 's an order as of now . Forty dollars a week for the support of wife Carol , and minor children , Doris , three , and Donald , two . The court further ordersthat a bond he entered , with surety , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he in a position to post that bond , Mr. Studdiford ? ' Lew whispered with him for a while ; and then said he was n't . Just what I 'd been hoping ! I said : ' Then he 'll have to stand committed until he can . The sheriff ' will take him to jail . ' " Judge Lowe chuckled . " Pretty quick thinking for an old man , if I do say so ! Are you driving me to the lake ? What are we waiting here for ? I 'll have to stop by Roylan for a report Reggie Shaw has on the Dummer girl . " Edna Keating said : " Oh ; Judge ; will you want me to start52typing the Fabian opinion again ? I thought maybe Mr. Winner would know about Mr. Penrose  --  " " So he might , so he might , " Judge Lowe said . " When 's Julius coming back from this Washington jaunt ? " " Monday , perhaps , " Arthur Winner said . " Well , I 'm preparing to gladden his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions I want him to answer . He 's right . I 'm going to hold ; no analogy between a personal action against aminor and a tax sale of a minor 's property for nonpayment . Of course , the legal effect of a judgment against a minor not representedby a guardian ad litem  --  yes ; a very nice point ! In principle , I think it really goes back to the right of cestui qui use asan equitable title  --  distinct from legal title vested in a trustee . Noah see the brief ? " " He made a few suggestions . The brief was Julius 's , though . " " And , as Blackstone would have said , a bloody good one ! Yes ; when he gets back , tell him I 'd like to talk to him . Good night , Edna . " Edna Keating said : " Good night , Judge . Good night , Mr. Winner . " 53FIE MASSED FOLIAGE of those bigtrees more than half hid the marble-cased courthouse building , classic in conception , but in execution falsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear against the sky 's hot haze , a small dome . The dome was surmounted by a pillared cupola in whose round base four faces of the courthouse clock were set . Crowning the cupola , stiffly poised on the summit , stood a bronze effigy  --  Justice . The copper carbonates of time had turned this effigy greenish-blue . The epicene figure 's verdigrised hands held the verdigrised sword and balance . The verdigrised head stared south with blindfolded eyes . From the cupola 's base now issued a mighty bong , whose power of sound could carry everywhere in the not-very-large borough of Brocton . Given grave deliberation by the full second 's pause , another bong followed ; and another ; and another . Over the way , diagonally across the intersection of High Street and Greenwood Avenue , Christ Church 's heavy-shaped tower of brown sandstone I88o Gothic seemed to hear and answer . Out high louvers , a sudden airy burst of musical sounds volumed , the chiming , quite equal in power , of simulated bells . A fouroctaveclavier attached to Christ Church 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit and rebound on a range of metal bars chromatically tuned . An electric pickup fed the struck tones into stages of amplification . Instantly , they were delivered to speakers in the tower , from which could issue a range of harmonic effects that trueTHREE54campaniform chimes could never compass . In the ingeniously added , artificial sweetness , down floated the tumble of reverbrating notes on the three-sided close formed by church , parish house , and rectory . Words learned long ago , wedded to the simple hymn tune , produced themselves in Arthur Winner 's head : There 's a friend for little children above the bright blue shy .... At the carillon 's sudden outbreak , Judge Lowe and Arthur Winner had exchanged glances . Starting his car engine , Arthur Winner said : " Yes ; I suppose something should be done . I still do n't know quite what  --  nor , I think , does the rector . " To Mr. Woolf , in the back seat with him , Judge Lowe courteouslysaid : " That 's our church organist , Mr. Woolf  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and playing the carillon  --  it'san electronic one  --  for fifteen minutes every afternoon , maybe at four , maybe at five , maybe at six . We 've just inducted a new rector , who feels that the hour should be fixed . Mr. Abbott , one deduces , does not feel that way . His services have been many and devoted ; and he 's never been willing to be paid for them  --  so , as Arthur says , we hardly know what to do . " With cordial pleasure , Mr. Woolf said : " Are you an Episcopalian , Judge ? So am I. I attend St. Bartholomew 's in New York . " By the blink of eye , Arthur Winner could see that Judge Lowe had involuntarily composed , then voluntarily put away , a question that Arthur Winner , too , had asked himself when , earlier , Mr. Woolf had felt called on to declare this religious affiliation . What line of thought brought Mr. Woolf to perceive error in the faith of his fathers ? What considerations produced the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little this side of Damascus ? Had he , like Saint Peter , seen a multitude of fishes and fallen on his knees ? The blink , the second 's silence , must be not unfamiliar to Mr. Woolf , for his handling of it showed practice . On his own last words , without waiting for an answer , he craned over , as the car turned the corner , to look into Christ Church 's cloistered close , where the reproduction of an English market cross was centered at a meeting of flagged walks . With casual alacrity , he went on : " You have a very attractive church here , Judge . " 55Judge Lowe said : " About that , sir , I understand opinions now differ . What was supposed to be the best ecclesiastical architect in the country at the time designed it ; and everybody , at the time , admired it . Now , I hear it called fake Gothic . Like our courthouse , it does n't recommend itself to what I 'm told is the best taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tart , made plain enough his human irritation at having to acknowledge that what seemed all right to him did not seem all right to those who claimed to know . " Well , I 'm afraid Brocton will have to put up with both for a while longer ! Whatever they look like , they were built to last ; and we 'll be some time finding any good excuse for tearing them down . " Meditating on what he had just said , he gave an incensed grunt . " Arthur , did Harry Minieri tell you about the interior partitioning he found in the rectory when they started work upstairs on the second bathroom ? Our new rector 's to be a married man , Mr. Woolf . The arrangements of our former rector for forty years , Doctor Ives , would n't have been convenient ; so we 've just now finished , or nearly finished , a remodeling of the rectory . " Over his shoulder , Arthur Winner said : " I do n't think he did . " To Mr. Woolf , Judge Lowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; fourteen inches thick ! Where could you find work like that nowadays ? Our Union League clubhouse was built the same way . " There , they supported the floors with three-by-ten joists , spaced on sixteen-inch centers , double cross-braced , and with every eighth joist also doubled . Elephants could walk around on them ! Yes , sir , taste they may have lacked ; but when they wanted to do a job , they knew how to do one . " " I guess labor was cheaper in those days , Judge , " Mr. Woolf said . " And materials . Even so , that kind of work must have come to a lot of money . " " It did , " Judge Lowe said . " No doubt there 's far more money in Brocton now than there was then , even if you reckon one of their dollars as worth three or four of ours ; but then money was concentrated in the hands of the relatively few . You had no taxes to speak of ; so a rich man , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes such as church-building no individualcould lay out today . " " You can say that again , Judge ! " Mr. Woolf spoke with eagerness . " We see it all the time . Fortunes once pretty considerable , practically expropriated ! The power to tax is the power to destroy , all right ; and even the law 's no protection  --  quite the opposite ; they destroy you by statute ! Winning an action against the commissioner of internal revenue in the tax courts we find , under present ruling cases , practically impossible . If we carry up , all we can really expect to get is more costs on petitioner . You 're simply reduced to working out ways to escape tax liability . And as soon as you do , the act 's amended to stop you ; you have to start over . " Judge Lowe said : " Well , sir , I do n't think it 's all to the bad . In principle , I approve . " Silently amused , Arthur Winner felt sure that , behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw . Judge Lowe said : " A society 's not stable where the rich are very rich and the poor are very poor . When the disproportion of wealth becomes glaring , I regard the state as having , in the public interest , not only a right but a duty to rectify by due process a socially dangerous condition . A man is , of course , entitled to any reliefs or advantages that he , or counselfor him , can find in the statute as written . But I would n't , in a court where I was sitting , feel much sympathy for maneuvers whose object was nullification  --  a defeat by chicanery of the legislativeintent to make large incomes pay large taxes . " " Oh , there I entirely agree with you , Judge ! " Mr. Woolf said . Fast on his mental feet , Mr. Woolf , however astounded , repairedhis mistake with zeal . " The law 's the law . We make sure our clients understand that . If they have anything irregular in mind , they know they need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just said . If they retain us , we 'll undertake to see they are n't deprived of benefits they 're legally entitled to  --  something our experience , they all realize , makes us better informed about than they are . " Mr. Woolf paused , for what , Arthur Winner could see , must be a quick , a lightning , check on how he was doing . He went on : " I agree , too , Judge , about the danger of57 too much money in a few hands  --  conspicuous waste , and so on . But I think it must disturb us all a little when we see good peo- pie , like those you mention , no longer in the position to do the charitable works they once did . I do n't know what size fortune these benefactors of your church had  --  " Judge Lowe said : " They owned the Brocton Potteries  --  once , enormously profitable . They were among the first to make modern porcelain-covered plumbing fixtures , and held some vital patents  --  since expired , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millionaire . His gifts made a new church , or at least a church on the scale you saw , possible . So much so , that the irreverent for many years used to refer to it as St. Sam 's Cathe- dral . " Mr. Woolf uttered an obliging laugh . " Not bad ! " he said . " Yes , " said Judge Lowe , " the Orcutts did very well by Christ Church . And the good was n't all interred with their bones either . Even with shrunken values , we 're one of the best- endowed churches in the diocese  --  most of it , Orcutt money . They 're gone now . None of the name left in Brocton ; though I believe a grandnephew of Sam 's  --  he must be an old man  --  is still living , I think , in Philadelphia ; or , perhaps , Baltimore . They had quite a history , locally  --  well , local history only interests local people . Even to them , old Brocton names now mean nothing . " In Judge Lowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him by his own words . The days of the Orcutts were gone ; and those days were really his days , too ; so where slid that leave him ? Judge Lowe said : " A good exam- pie 's Mike McCarthy , whose estate you 're working on , Mr. Woolf . Twenty years ago , everyone in Brocton knew that name . A little after that , Mike moved away . If the widow 's election to take against the will has come up yet , I daresay you learned some of the circumstances . You know how such things are in small towns , Mr. Woolf  --  or perhaps you do n't . His second marriage amounted to a sensation  --  many people said , a scandal . Everybody knew about it , and everybody talked about it . Today , it 's all forgotten . Mike 's name 's unknown . " Mr. Woolf said : " Yes , I heard enough to get the idea , Judge . " Arthur Winner did not , for a moment , identify the faintest pos- 58 Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was the entry , covered with care , yet not altogether covered , of an aroused interest . Mr. Woolf was entertaining an idea . Gatheringhis sharp wits about him , he hovered in alert speculation . Was it practicable ? Was it feasible ? He said : " Mr. Winner , and I thought him very right , ruled that the matter of the election would be heard first , going as it did to a first claim on the corpus . So Mr. Davis presented his argument for Mrs. McCarthy ; and then we heard her ; and Mr. Winner permitted me to crossexamineher . From the fact of the postnuptial settlementagreement , I mean  --  I could see the marriage could n't have been very  --  well , happy ; and that was confirmed in testimony . Being so much older than she was  --  " " Yes , there was that , " Judge Lowe said . " Her age , the age of this then June Day  --  so-called  --  was unproved or uncertain . I believe she put down twenty-nine on the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer the truth . I 'm afraid that what really weighed in the matter of scandal was the sort of person she was . Her previous life had n't been exactly secluded . Let 's leave it at that , since I presume she 's representingherself as having lived respectably from the marriage until Mike 's death . " Arthur Winner admired Judge Lowe 's reticence  --  a charitablenessthat sought to bury old scandal . If Mr. Woolf had n't found out , why need Mr. Woolf know what everyone knew at the time  --  that the second Mrs. McCarthy was an entertainer at a roadhouse the police often raided ; that she had a record of arrests for prostitution ; that Mike first laid eyes on her at a stag party . Put upon a banquet table , " June Day " there stripped herselfand danced naked for fifty men . Judge Lowe said : " No ; there were no elements likely to make for success . On Mike 's part , we can suppose an aberration of a kind not uncommon in men of a certain age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form , very sad and painful , of indictableoffenses . Those , we have to punish ; though often they seem to be less willful acts than irresistible compulsions , not perhaps essentially different from any normal falling-in-love . On the new Mrs. McCarthy 's part , I think mistake could be pleaded . I59do n't think she realized that Mike had lost almost all his money . In exchange for making her person available to the old man , she expected , I suppose , to be well-off for life . " " That 's interesting , Judge , " Mr. Woolf said . He spoke again with studied casualness ; but his project was now plain . You could imagine Mr. Woolf , behind the desponding eye and melancholymouth , secretly exultant , whispering to himself that here might be a gold mine , a means to mend one disadvantage he had been at throughout the hearing . This old boy , this Judge Lowe , had shown that he knew all about Michael McCarthy , deceased  --  the whole background , the ancient situations ; everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Tuttle , knew . A smart man , Mr. Woolf doubtless kicked himself for the error he 'd fallen into there . A smart man , his mistake made , did n't proceed to the mistake , still more serious , of pretending to himself that he had n't made one . That first mistake was irreparable ; there it stood ; but , as the alert and heedful so often do , had Mr. Woolf stumbled on a possible chance to make up , to recoup ? If Mr. Woolf kept , as Arthur Winner would n't doubt he did , a careful mental register of mistakes to the end that two of the same kind could never occur , he might have been obliged to enterthat mistake as a bad one ; yet , if it was any comfort to Mr. Woolf , the mistake was not fairly to be called a fool 's . A fool , because his observation was slipshod and his powers of conclusionslow and inefficient , would very likely not have made it . Meeting Mr. Tuttle , Mr. Woolf inspected him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of snowy , silky hair . IIe took note of the doubtful poutings and workings of the shaky-looking blubber lips , the seeming aphasia of statementsdelayed . IIe considered the presbyopic fussing , so full of what seemed uncertainty , with papers . There 'd be no trouble here ! A stern manner ought to be enough to alarm this ineffectualold gaffer into obedience . A firm line would then keep him doing what he was told . Of course , Mr. Woolf could n't have been more wrong . In the way of law , of legal acumen , he was to find that he might as profitably try teaching his grandmother to suck eggs . In the rencounter of minds , of sparring practice , he6owas offering to course a rabbit . He met an old lion , whose still doughty paw swung him a swipe or two that tumbled him . Far from defeated , indeed , dumbfounded more than hurt , Mr. Woolf picked himself up . He promptly continued the engage- ment ; but from a prudent or respectful distance , warily . Reconnoitering Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) again wary . To help him , he would have the well- known craving of the elderly to talk , to be listened to ; but the matter was , after all , in the judge 's court . One misstep , and the judge might decide that something to be regarded as sub judice was touched on . Mr. Woolf perhaps heard his own too-interested undertone . That would not do ! Things must not be rushed . The risks of openly going after what he wanted were too great ; what he wanted must be caused to come to him . His tone now simply obliging , Mr. Woolf repeated : " Very in- teresting ! That 's all very interesting . Of course , I never had any personal acquaintanceship with old Mr. McCarthy , Judge . We 'd done a good deal of legal business for the McCarthy sons , so I knew them well ; but this was only brought to us after their fa- ther was dead . " He interrupted himself adeptly . " I see you have some fine early houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm interested in history . History 's a hobby of mine . " The claim , by being so general , naturally denied itself . Judge Lowe , somewhat dubious in tone , said : " Yes ; Brocton still has a few eighteenth-century houses left . Perhaps the oldest structure around here is a gristmill at Roylan , where we 'll be stopping on the way to the lake . The mill is known to have been in opera- tion in seventeen twenty . You 'll see the walls . Those along there  --  " his gesture , seen by Arthur Winner in the rearview mir- ror , was toward the east side of Court Street , warm in a refulgency of afternoon sunlight beyond the tree-ranged wide sidewalk of old brick  --  " are n't as early as that . The large building , inciden- tally , is the Union League 's house I mentioned . " He himself gazed a moment at the red brick mass peppered with the trim of white stone pediments over doors and windows and the consoles that supported them . " People do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Of course , that 's very much later  --  eighteen sixty-nine . Several houses on the other side do date back a long way . Well , 6tI think you 've seen Arthur 's office . Perhaps you found that in- teresting ? " " Yes , I did , Judge , " Mr. Woolf said . " Yes , I had an oppor- tunity to see that . I had n't known I 'd have to stay over , so I needed to make some long-distance calls . Mr. Winner was kind enough to take me there , and put a room at my disposal . " Judge Lowe said : " That was built about eighteen hundred  --  a little more elaborate than the earlier ones . The old Tuttle house . Noah 's great-grandfather built it . Noah was born in it , as a matter of fact . When the Tuttles moved to a new house out Greenwood Avenue in the late nineties , Noah and Arthur 's fa- ther , and former Judge Lauderdale , whose partners they were then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down Market Street to the river , Arthur Winner glanced in the rearview mirror again . Swayed a little by the turn , Mr. Woolf 's face appeared . A shift of change , a darkening or shadowing went over the full pale cheeks at the naming of Noah Tuttle . Judge Lowe must have seen the change ; for he said suddenly : " A stubborn man , Mr. Woolf . Sometimes he can be difficult . At his age  --  and I 'm near enough there my- self to speak  --  one is n't always in the best of moods . He can be fractious , I know . But in law , in his field , eighty-odd or not , you wo n't find many abler . The truth is , we 're very proud of him . He 's truly learned in the law , Mr. Woolf . This is a small town , and our bar 's not large , so you 'd hardly expect it ; but he was chosen , out of the whole state , to be chairman of the advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dece- dents Estates Law was undertaken . He himself drafted entire the new , the present , Fiduciaries Act and Fiduciaries Investment Act . The committee , wanted to change in the drafts . As Noah wrote them , they were enacted into law . A number of other jurisdictions , perhaps you know , have since used them as models . " Mr. Woolf said : " Oh , I can quite believe you , Judge . From what I saw today , I have every respect for his abilities . " Judge Lowe said : " We who know him can go further than that . We have every respect for his character . A man of complete 62 probity , of absolute integrity , Mr. Woolf . He may differ with you ; and he may even be unpleasant about it ; but you can trust him  --  you need never fear anything even faintly smacking of trickery , of underhandedness . We must both , I think , admit the painful truth that that 's not invariably the case in our profes-sion . " By a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts . He said then : " Well , Judge , I 'm really very glad to have you tell me that . I 'll have to confess , he and I did have one or two little arguments . I mean , I 'm glad if I can think he has them with other people , too  --  not just me . I could n't see quite what I 'd done to make the old gentlemanso angry . He said some things I 'm sure he did n't mean ; but 1 . suppose I must have provoked him . I 'd be glad  --  I 'll say this to you , too , Mr. Winner  --  to express my regrets , if you think that would help matters tomorrow . And if I knew what to express them for ! I mean , I 'd be happy to show Mr. Tuttle there 're no hard feelings on my part . " " That 's handsomely spoken , sir , " Judge Lowe said . " All of us who are getting older must sometimes pray the indulgence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know that I 'd speak to Mr. Tuttle . He 's as likely as not to be in better humortomorrow . If lie did n't behave very well , he 'll express his regrets . If you have no hard feelings , you could tell him then . " " Oh , absolutely , Judge , " Mr. Woolf said . " I realize he 's all you say . I 'd like to be his friend . I 'll certainly do all I can to be . " Glimpsing Mr. Woolf 's face in the mirror again , Arthur Winner could see his lips form a smile , deprecatory , **25;10688;TOOLONG . Was something there of the patient shrug , something of the bated breath and whispering humbleness ? Were you right or wrong , were you fair or unfair , to guess the kept account ? Had you been warned ? Did you forget at your peril the ancient grudge that might be fed if Mr. Woolf could catch you once upon the hip ? Arthur Winner touched his brakes , slowing the car ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the63Eatontown pike , blew warmer across his face . Planted at the roadside to the right , a small metal shield on a metal standardbore the words : HISTORICAL MARKER AHEAD . In the rear seat , Judge Lowe was saying : " Yes , I think I know what you have in mind , Mr. Woolf . I was getting to that . Communitystanding , we might say . Well , of course , Mike was Irish , a Roman Catholic . Those things were more attended to then than they would be now . A certain prejudice existed . " Judge Lowe paused ; clearly considering how best to phrase a point that Mr. Woolf might find a sore one . He said : " At the time , I mean , when Mike was a boy or young man , I do n't know that the prejudice was altogether arbitrary or unreasoned . Seventyyears ago  --  and even thirty years ago , the number of people still around whose attitude had been formed seventy years ago was great enough to make them a majority  --  the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant the base and obscurevulgar . Few had anything that could be called education . Their mostly low standards of living  --  all they could afford  --  resulted in objectionable habits and manners . Politically , they were a troublesome mass vote at the disposal of their own highly purchasable politicians . Religiously , they seemed to be the willingdupes of their priests , of a superstition to the Protestant mind corrupt and alien  --  There , incidentally , is the Roylan sign , Mr. Woolf , if you 're interested . " The car , slowing still more for the turn , approached a doublefacedyard-square tablet of cast bronze supported by a bronze post . It was headed : ROYLAN . Below , the embossed letters proceeded : ONE MILE EAST OF IIERE ALONG THE FORMER KINGS HIGHWAYSTOOD THE ROYAL ANNA TAVERN ERECTED IN 1710 . . . . " Gone , of course , now , " Judge Lowe said . " Much of the originalstructure was burned in seventeen seventy-eight , in connection with what 's described as the massacre of a party of local militia , surprised there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thirteen Stars Tavern in seventeen eighty-five . Burned again , by accident , in eighteen fifty  --  " Not without amusement , Arthur Winner reflected that Mr. Woolf had himself to thank . His hobby was history , was n't it ? Judge Lowe said : " Some years ago the Brocton Historical Sod-64cty , to whom Arthur 's father and Mr. Tuttle  --  they had acquiredall the properties here around nineteen ten ; and for a song , sir ! Nobody then wanted the old fieldstone houses , or what was left of them  --  had deeded the tavern site , made excavations . A number of interesting implements and kitchen furnishingswere turned up  --  now in the society 's Brocton museum . You can still trace the original foundations where the old crossroadsused to be  --  just beyond Doctor Shaw 's house , where we 'll be stopping . " If Mr. Woolf was disgruntled by what he 'd let himself in for , by such a waste of precious time away from the subject of the late Michael McCarthy , he gave no sign . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judge . I 'm glad to have a chance to see something of it . I 'll be interested to read up about it when I get home . " Judge Lowe said : " Well , you wo n't find much on the particularbusiness here . Incidents of the kind were n't infrequent ; and the details are really not known . Across the road from the tavernfoundations , you 'll see that the Historical Society has enclosedwith an iron railing a plot supposed to contain the common grave of twenty-three militiamen bayoneted without quarter in the tavern ; and put up a stone with their names , or such of them as could be ascertained  --  " The road , through rolling fields and fringes of trees , came now to the dip down , by which , curving , it dropped a couple of hundred feet into the miniature valley , the pleasant hollow where the houses stood . From the little eminence , you had a moment 's view of the slated roofs below enwreathed by the great boughs of a venerable stand of sycamores  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sun off the mantling gilt eagle on the weather vane above the garage ; the front , cool in shade , the right-angle wing hot in sunlight , of Julius Penrose 's house across the road ; the old gristmill 's thick roofless walls , hung with masses of honeysuckle and buried in trees , by the tenderly preserved short covered bridge over the brook ; and across the brook , past the Dealeys ' place , past a meadow in which the doctor pastured three Guernseys , Doctor65Shaw 's place . Down into the stillness of sun and shadow the car swept swiftly while nearer treetops closed the prospect . Judge Lowe said : " It was , therefore , a matter of some awkwardnesswhen old documents , coming to light soon after , seemed to prove that what was actually buried in a pit there was about that number of pigs . They had died of , or were killed to prevent the spread of , a sort of swine fever . " With a hearty laugh , Mr. Woolf said : " Not so good ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question 's been left unresolved , " Judge Lowe said . " Perhaps , wisely ! Proposals to dig and examine the bones were rejected on the grounds that disturbing them would be a desecrationif they were in fact those of the honored dead . Not that there is n't also a question about how much they ought to be honored . Most of the so-called militia seem to have been no less bad a lot than the so-called loyalists . In forays of their own , they 'd undoubtedly done enough in the way of horse-stealing , house-burning , murder , and rape for the others to have a score to settle . " Mr. Woolf said : " Is n't that the truth , Judge ! If only we knew ! That 's a thing that interests me about history . Most of what you read 's ex parte  --  we 're used to studying evidence , so we see that right away . What are n't they telling you ? A lot of men they put up statues to might not look so good if we knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or some of the other things they did that they managed to keep dark or have hushed up . " " Yes ; men , perhaps unfortunately , are men , " Judge Lowe said . Mr. Wool ! ' s knowing t iun ) ph over the dead might have disturbed his sense of justice ; for he went on : " If all hearts were open , all desires known ; and if no secrets were hid  --  each of us , I think , might do well to consider just where that would leave him personally , whether he 'd still be quite so well regarded as he may be now . " Judge Lowe paused , as though he invited Mr. Woolf to ponderfor a minute that situation  --  the regrettable good guess to be made . Behind what man 's honorable-appearing face , his airs of sound principle , his manner of rectitude , lay no self-knowledgeof at least a few mean secrets ? More or less successfully not thought on , more or less safely out of public sight , some old matters of shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor  --  always ( the virtual certainty was ) lay hid in each man 's heart . Judge Lowe said : " Who 's that , Arthur  --  Rodney ? " " It is , " Arthur Winner said . " He seems to want to speak to us . " By a rural delivery box at the road 's edge was parked a convertiblecoupe , not new , but with a new paint job of brilliant scarlet enamel . Beside the car stood Rodney Revere , rapidly waving a large envelope at them . Slowing down , Arthur Winner swung over to the close-mowed grass of the wide roadside . Mr. Woolf had looked sharply at the A. s . WINNER on the neat big mailbox . Then he looked past the gate , set back with formal curved wings and white posts with urn-topped finials , to the drive and up the long lawn under the sycamores to the ample house whose solid walls in harmonious shades of aged , uncoursedfieldstone rose luminous and warm in the dappling of sun across them . He said : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The exclamation 's surprise of respect was unmistakable . While Mr. Woolf would hardly , in what he saw , be finding evidence of actual wealth , of great amassings of money of the kind he must have come to know something about ( even if he was only the little man hired to protect them ) , Mr. Woolf , in the space of a glance , had plainly made a rapid computation and revised upward certain estimates . The admiring comment with which he relinquished it , declared the opinion that Mr. Woolf , with efficient tact , had been concealing all day  --  that these semihickswere n't of any account . Small-town and smalltime , how much were they likely to make a year ? When , as the moment always did , the moment came for money to talk , what would their insignificant affairs enable them to say ? Mr. Woolf nodded , confirming his new findings . In his sad eye a light of satisfaction briefly gleamed . This Brocton might remain an inconsequential town ; but he could guess , gratified , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to of er  --  nennle with nice nrnnertiec  --  and cn it followed nen-66 67ple who were successful , people of weight , people looked up to ; and , so , it followed further , in a flash of conviction that lifted his heart , the real society of the town , the best  --  not , as he might have feared his getting an invitation meant , the second best . With an ease of familiarity , black face brightly shining , Rod- ney Revere , who wore a sport shirt of many colors and a pair of tan sharply creased slacks , approached the halted car . " Glad I got you , Mr. Winner ! " he said . " First thing : I have this for Judge Lowe . Doctor Shaw got a call ; so there 's nobody home at his house . So he drove by here ; and said this was something Judge Lowe wanted , would I give this to him . " Rodney came to a thoughtful halt . He said : " The truth is , I could n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or whether it was in case you happened to . So I did n't know just what to do  --  if you had to have it , or not . So when I happened to see Judge Dealey 's car come down the hill , I knew he was go- ing out to the lake , too ; so I thought I 'd give it to him to give to you . " Rodney smiled again . " Man , he was driving so fast , he was by before he could see me ! Here you are , sir . " Judge Lowe said : " Much obliged to you , Rodney . " " You 're quite welcome , Judge , " Rodney said . I-Ialf turned in the front seat , Arthur Winner could observe on Mr. Woolf 's face the shadow of new amazement or incom- prehension . The shadow would seem to show that , though hold- ing with religion the concept of all men as equal , Mr. Woolf , humanly enough , meant to say that he should be any man 's equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kindly given liberty , this young colored fellow with his fancy shirt and natty pants would seem to be helping himself to license . Ought not somebody to speak up : Remember who you are , and whom ad- dressing ? Rodney being there , Arthur Winner could not very well help Mr. Woolf with more local history , explain to him that the ex- tra service the judge acknowledged  --  Rodney 's waiting for them with Doctor Shaw 's envelope  --  like Rodney 's very presence at Arthur Winner 's gate , was , in fact , a piece of obligingness on Rodney 's part . For a couple of years now , Rodney had been away from Brocton most of the time , attending a college of den- tistry ; but , during vacations , there were Brocton people he would " help "  --  you might say , less for money than for old times ' sake . Not that Mr. Woolf made any mistake about who Rodney was . Rodney 's great-grandfather had been a runaway slave . As a youth in the 185o 's , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he called himself Paul Revere . Abolitionists in Brocton found him work . By his diligence and intelligence , Paul Revere prospered . A highly respectable man , he rose to become , when he was older , sexton of Christ Church , and steward of the Union League  --  positions , it might interest Mr. Woolf to know , descendants of his had ever since held . Paul Revere was also a prolific man . In him originated a complicatedconnection of aunts and uncles , of nephews , nieces , and cousins of various degrees , on whom parishioners of the church and members of the club could rely for high-type doers of domesticwork . Supervised first by old Paul , and then by his grandsonAlfred  --  Paul outlived all his sons  --  no Revere , over a good many years , was permitted to take such situations with any other people  --  a family discipline that Arthur Winner did n't doubt still operated ; his mother 's Luella , though surnamed White , was a daughter of a daughter of Alfred ; and the day she was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for her ! Rodney was to be , was now within months , another year , of being , a professional man , a duly licensed dentist ; but if Rodney was home and available , Rodney 's Aunt Em , who worked for the Winners , had only to speak to Alfred . Rodney would be directed to go and give her any help she thought she needed . Rodney had been all week doing , with energy and no apparent feeling that he was demeaned , those parts of a house cleaning that Em ( she was strong as a horse ) held to be too hard for her now that she was getting on . After a conscientious eight hours of intelligent toil , Rodney hung his work clothes in the garage lavatory , washed up , donned garments suited to a social evening , and drove off cheerfully in his secondhand but newly painted and brightly shined car . Mr. Woolf 's not-unnatural mistakewould lie in his supposing that Rodney , because he gave service , was somebody 's servant . Rodney said : " Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hold of you . He was ringing here ; but I did n't get to the telephone in time . When she left this morning , Aunt Em said Mrs. Winner wanted all the brass polished ; so I was just finishingup , working on the front door knocker , when I heard the telephone inside . Only , I 'd been coming around , so the door was n't open ; and I had to go to the back to get in . They 'd stopped ringing then ; and they did n't know who was calling . The way I found out ; it was n't more than a few minutes before Mrs. Penrose came over . When Mr. Tuttle did n't get any answer here , he called there . Said for you to call him right away . " Frowning , Arthur Winner said : " Mrs. Penrose did n't say why  --  what he wanted ? " " I do n't believe he told her , Mr. Winner . She only said he told her he knew you were going to be driving through here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calling from the office , he said . That was about fifteen minutes ago . I did n't know would you want to call him from here ; so the front door 's not locked  --  " " No , on the whole , " Arthur Winner said . " I 'll wait till we get to the lake . I can call him from there . I do n't want to hold the judge and Mr. Woolf up  --  " Judge Lowe said : " Oh , call him , Arthur , call him ! Only , do n't let him talk all night . " Rodney said : " The other doors are all right ; I locked them . So I guess I 'll go along . Good night , Mr. Winner . Good night , Judge . " With the obvious benevolent idea of not leaving the stranger out , Rodney gave Mr. Woolf a separate nod , and said affably : " Good-by ! " In the telephone he held , Arthur Winner could hear the throb of ringing , mechanically reiterated , and vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat of the afternoon beyond the open front door . From the car , drawn close to the steps , came Judge Lowe 's voice , not loud but distinct , accustomed to making itself reach every corner of a courtroom . " . . . could fairly be called a wealthy man . He 'd built up one of the largest and most successful contracting businesses in this part of the state ; and that , ironically , was how he came to lose almost all his money . " 70Five miles away , the Brocton operator said : " One-one-two does not answer , sir . " " Please try one-one-one again , " Arthur Winner said . He controlled as well as he could his irritation  --  in part , to be laid , he supposed , to the heat of the long hard day ; in part , to his certainty , a virtual foreknowledge , that Noah did n't " have to " speak to him at all . There was hardly the remotest chance that anything important in a business way could have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be of such a nature that it could n't wait until tomorrow . What , then , did Noah want ? With weariness of spirit , Arthur Winner knew . Returned from the hearing ( and his encounter with Arthur Winner 's Aunt Maud ! ) , shut up in his room , Noah had doggedly been going over a mass of figures , locating at last what he was looking for . About some disputed , inconsequential item in the account , he now had the proof that he was right , quite right . He just wanted Arthur Winner to know . On the contrary , on the other hand , shut up in his room , Noah might have been doing nothing , slumped there in a stupor of brooding , afflicted to think how he had behaved . Like a child , Noah , at the end of the day forlornly conscious of his naughtiness , sought to make amend . He wanted to tell Arthur Winner that he knew , he knew ; he had n't meant to ! It was all his fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As we go on up the valley , you 'll be able to see still remains of the right of way  --  gradings ; bridge piers ; even an old tunnel . I suppose , since many electric interurban lines were showing big profits in the early nineteen hundreds , the project seemed sound . But , I suppose , too , the handwriting was on the wall , if they 'd only looked . I suppose they ought to have counted the number of automobiles owned in Brocton even then . " Too true ! The right of way , now abandoned , was planned to compete with those buckboards his mother recalled to Arthur Winner , with horse-drawn drays proceeding at a couple of miles an hour to Eatontown . Once the new line was operating , how greatly shortened were trips from Brocton to the lake ; and how much more interesting ! Any boy must be impressed by the transit company 's great maroon cars . They were three times as71long as the little streetcars in Brocton , and they had formidable iron cowcatchers , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable grades down to Brocton , they could , and often did , attain speeds of sixty miles an hour . Peoplegoing to the lake would be carried up the line as far as Shelby 's , a farm near the foot of the hill . There , you left your things for Mr. Shelby to bring along later in his wagon , and walked the trail as before . After a few years , the trail was improvedenough to let early model T Fords be driven  --  a jolting , adventurous ride  --  to the lake . Arthur Winner 's father bought one and kept it in Mr. Shelby 's wagon shed . That , too , was not long in changing . The old Eatontown turnpike was straightened , widened , and paved ; and there ( yes , the handwriting had been on the wall ! ) was the real end of the Brocton Rapid Transit Company . Arthur Winner 's father 's Pierce-Arrow , before , driven only around town , or on the " improved " road to Riverside or Mechanicsville , could henceforth get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveniently . Soon , it could even go on to the lake . The throb of ringing in Arthur Winner 's ear ceased suddenly . Out of breath , a voice cried : " Tuttle , Winner and Penrose ! Miss Mills . " Arthur Winner said : " Gladys , I 'm at Roylan , on the way up to the lake . There was a message here that Mr. Tuttle had been trying to get me . " Gladys Mills said : " Oh , I 'm so sorry , Mr. Winner ! Yes ; he did want you . I ias n't he answered ? I was out a minute . Perhaps he did n't hear the bell . I le 's in his room . I 'll go and tell him . " " Looking back , " Judge Lowe said , " the astonishing thing is how everybody could be so slow to realize the hopeless situation . The Brocton Rapid Transit Company could not be said ever to have made any money ; for a while , the operating expenses were earned , with enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end , people who should have known better believeddividends on the stock would be paid soon . Moreover , most of them never seemed to realize that if the line could n't be made to do a paying business , the bonds were secured by nothing at all . True , what secured them had cost a lot . Everything  --  roadbed ; 72power plant ; substations ; carbarn ; rolling stock  --  had been to the highest specifications of the day . But , as they stood , all they were good for was a trolley line . In the late nineteen twenties , that was to say ; they were good for nothing  --  " " Mr. Winner ! " Arthur Winner said : " Yes , Gladys . " With perplexity , Gladys Mills said : " Mr. Tuttle is n't here , sir . I do n't know where he could have gone . He was waiting for you to call him . " " You do n't know what he wanted to talk to me about ? Mr. Penrose had n't called from Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ; Mr. Tuttle did n't tell me what it was , Mr. Winner . And as far as I know , there was n't any other call from Mr. Penrose  --  not after the one when you were here this morning . " She was silent a moment . She said : " There 's only one thing , Mr. Winner . He sounded sort of funny when he was asking me for an outside line . I hope he was n't not feeling well  --  " " But you 've been into his room ? " Arthur Winner said . " Oh , yes ; I went in , sir . And he 's not in the little room , either . I thought he might be taking a nap . And he 's not in the washroom  --  Imade sure . " " Of course , Helen 's not there ? " " No , sir . She left fairly early . I think she said she was going over to the courthouse to see Mrs. Keating about something . Before that , I know she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuttle ; and I think she said she might be coming back this evening to help him with some of the McCarthy figures . " " Nobody came in to see him , I suppose ? " Gladys said : " Why , no , sir . Well , Mr. Breck came in ; but  --  " " Bernie ? " Arthur Winner said . Bernie Breck was chief of the five Brocton Borough policemen . " Yes , " Gladys said . " I was filing ; and he just went through the office and I heard him knock on Mr. Tuttle 's door . I think Mr. Tuttle may have forgotten and left his car in a no-parking place again . Oh , I had n't thought of that ! Of course , Mr. Tuttle usually gives Mr. Breck the key ; and he moves it . I did n't see73Mr . Breck leave ; but I know he did n't come back with the key . So perhaps Mr. Tuttle went out to move it himself . He might have met somebody ; and  --  " And , Gladys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgentneed to reach Arthur , his supposedly important communication , would then slip the old man 's mind altogether . Incidentally , Arthur Winner must reflect , Noah really ought to stop driving a car ; but who would venture to say so ? Who would call his attention to his malady without a cure  --  the yellow leaves , or none , or few ; the twilight of the day ; in the ashes , the doubtful glow of the expiring fire ? This was the time of year on which Noah was congratulated ; these were the mental powers whose persistence was often and admiringly mentioned . Remarkable ? Yes ; so remarkable that admiration posed the query of astonishment : Can such things be ? To that question , a question must be returned . The answer depended on what you meant . In his own field , on those probateand fiduciary matters to which Noah had given a lifetime , half a century , Noah could sound as acute and sagacious as ever . There , nothing unknown or new could now confront him ; the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them by heart , came of themselves . If unimpaired mental powerswas construed to mean competence to do today that job of ten years ago on the I ) ccedents Estates Law that Willard Lowe had praised , Arthur Winner would be inclined to agree that Noah , unequaled in technical knowledge , unexcelled in practicalestate and trust management , with so much of the special sort of legal experience needed in this special sort of work , probablystill kept that competence . If , by unimpaired mental powers , you meant an unaffected judgment , a continuing sound sense of proportion , a reliable balance , a firmness of command in coming to decisions and a promptitude in acting on them  --  what was to be said about that ? As though to counterpoint the subduing thought , an offer in evidence , a proof of loss , judge Lowe could be heard . " . . . this , you see , was soon after the failure of the transit company . Mr. Tuttle represented the bondholders , he was the trustee in bankruptcyconfirmed by the Federal district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masterly job , Mr. Woolf . The business , of course , remained bad enough ; but Noah so handled it that liquidation was n't utterly disastrous . Due entirely to him , the total loss most of us thought impossible to avert was averted . Thanks to Noah , and no one else , Mike and a lot of other Broctonpeople did n't find themselves penniless . Mike knew that . It was their relationship in that business that led to Noah 's consentingto be Mike 's executor . " Breaking the silence in which Gladys , perhaps a little subdued herself to see the wrecks of time ( though such things were so unimaginably distant from her ) , waited on him , Arthur Winner said : " Yes ; I think we may assume he 's all right . That 's probably what happened . " Gladys said : " Would you like me to stay here until he comes back , or I hear from him , Mr. Winner ? I could ring the Union League . He might have moved the car to over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think not , thanks , " Arthur Winner said . " Put a note on his desk , in case he and Helen come back this evening . Say I called ; that I 'll be at the lake from about twenty minutes from now untilten or so , and he can get me there if he needs to . Close up then , and go home . You ought to have been off before this . " " Oh , I do n't mind , Mr. Winner ! With Mr. Penrose away , and you and Mr. Tuttle over at the courthouse all day , Mary and I hardly had a thing to do . You 'll be in tomorrow , wo n't you ? " " In the morning , " Arthur Winner said . " Tell Mary we 'll shut at noon . " His hand still on the telephone , Arthur Winner stood motionlessa moment while he thought of calling the Union League himself  --  not to ask what Noah wanted ; for Noah had presumablyforgotten that he wanted anything ; but simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Greenwood Avenue , Noah had lived at the club ; and he was comfortable enough  --  more comfortable , and certainly better taken care of , than he could have been anywhere else . That undoubted fact did not much affect the picture of Noah , by himself , laboriously mount-75ing the wide main flight of stairs ; fumbling with his key ; totteringa little as he entered a deserted room  --  though commodious , though containing everything an austere old man could possibly want , surely without cheer . Good , and , so , still sound , shabby only , not shoddy , everywhere in the Union League the furnish ings were those of the 187o 's  --  they , too , were very old ; they , too , were left from another day . But , of course , Noah , if he had entered the club absently ( instead of going back to the office across the courthouse square , as he intended ) , would pad at once to the antiquated barroom ; to the mahogany glow , perfumed by the slopped spirits of decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the boys , or Alfred Revere himself , would receive the old man with salutes of deference , set him in his corner , pamper him respectfully with their service . As Noah , aches of age warming away , glooms of age dissolving , took heart from his couple of ounces of whisky , he would be heard , all attention , if he chose to assure himself by denouncing in detail today'snews , by complaining in general against the time and the customs . Unless Arthur Winner could show good reason for call ing , Noah would resent the interruption. 76FOURRuTH SHAW said : " They 're all , or almost all , down at the boathouse , swimming , Arthur . Out there , do they have everything they want , now ? I suppose if they have n't , the judge can bellow . " Arthur Winner said : " They have Scotch , they have rye , they have bourbon ; they have charged water ; they have ice . What would they be expecting ? Dancing girls ? " " Willard Lowe would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you believe he would ! " In her wide , tanned , and competently composedface , Ruth Shaw 's eyes turned , ironic and cheerful . " Men ! " she said .

" She looked around the lodge 's vast old kitchen with the long-disused wood-burning range that stretched several yards across the chimneywall . " You know , what people would put up with when we were children is simply extraordinary ! Do n't talk to me about the good old days . Em ! Are we going to have enough plates ? " From the oversized pantry beyond , a voice called back : " How many is there now , Mrs. Shaw ? " " Let 's see , " Ruth Shaw said . Her solid and matronly figure posed itself as though for thought . She began to count on her fingers . She said : " The little ones . Mine ; and Ann ; and Priscilla Penrose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . Doctor Trowbridge , and his mother , and Miss Cummins .

" If he goes back to Brocton to the office  --  a stop 's got to be put to this . He has too damned many patients . Three men could n't do what he tries to do . " Her brown eyes glinted again , coming around to Arthur Winner . Dropping her voice slightly , she said : " That 's what 's driving him to drink , in case you wondered .

After that , I do n't know ; but he swore he 'd get some sleep this afternoon , and come out here to supper . Em ! I make it eighteen . Can we manage ? " " Yes , ma'am . We got twenty . I just counted . " To Arthur Winner , Ruth Shaw said : " I do n't know how you men are going to like it , but all you 're having 's a sort of buffet . We 'll put things on the big terrace table and people can help themselves . There 's plenty , Lord knows ; but nothing 's hot but En- 's beans , which I hope are all right . Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and off  --  " " They all right , Mrs. Shaw . I just tried them . " " ' Then , everything 's all right . Just tell Clarissa , Em and I have the feast under control . There 's nothing for her to do ; so she need n't come up  --  she 's not to come up . That Mrs. Trowbridge has been harrying her all clay  --  " Putting a hand on Arthur Winner'sarm , pushing him , Ruth Shaw moved with him and went out on the back porch with him . " Forget that about Reg , " she said . " He 's had a hard summer . I 'll get him fixed . Reg thinks because he 's only a little tight most of the time nobody notices . I felt like having you know that I know that everybody notices . When this damned horrible infant dies , Ruth 's going to lower the boom . Was he tight this afternoon ? " Arthur Winner said : " I did n't see him , Ruth . He 'd left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I forgot . " The brown eyes , ironic and amiable almost ogled him . " Arthur can not tell a lie ! It 's nice when you 're able to count on something about somebody . " She clasped her hands over her full arms and breathed the warm air deeply . " I love that smell , " she said . Sunlight had left most of the lake . The lengthening shadow of the tree slopes across the water to the west reached far out ; but a late blaze of sun still rested on this shore . The heat was that of summer , heavy with brooding thunderous quality ; yet the light , though so full and splendid , by a different angle , by the creeping trend of withdrawal to the south , was no longer summer light . The near-evening sunshine held a gauzelike haze in which every outline softened . If there had been a breeze , the breeze had fallen . The lake was motionless ; yet from the woods around , slow currents of air moved . Wafted with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree trunks , of shady leaves , of ferns , and not-quite-dry moss , which Arthur Winner , too , breathed gratefully . Ruth Shaw said : " Somewhere , there are thunderstorms . I suppose we 'll get them just when we start to eat . Do you ever wish this were forty years ago , Arthur ? We used to have such wonderful summers . Or do n't you remember ? Or do n't you think so ? Or did n't you ? " She had turned her head with an almost sensuoussmile , as though of dreaming . The broadened , hearty face , rapt in reminiscence , seemed to be replaced , an instant 's trickingof the eye , by another face  --  all the while hidden there ; long overlaid ; yet abruptly , perfectly , recalled by Arthur Winner . The face was the face , not seen for years , of a girl named Ruth Fentriss  --  pert ; cool ; pretty only in being young , but what older prettiness could compare with youth 's prettiness ? The light lighting up that earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth Shaw looked as though she could have wept . She said : " Be off , you oaf ! You do n't know what I mean . " Particulars of what Ruth Shaw , gazing back down her life until she came on Ruth Fentriss , then selected to remember could not be known ; yet , being such stuff as dreams are made on , the gen-79eral nature of their baseless fabric was not hard to know . That drifting bosky smell , a fragrance too subtle to be called sweet , signaled the mind ; and , from an immense repertory , the mind pulled out associated thoughts . Here at the lake , hours were sunny , and every day a happy day . Every night was deep and starry , a peace into which one sank ; and , led beside still waters , slept . As seen by a child , coming to the lake had been to go on a journey ; and , in fact , a journey it then was . Being fifteen miles from Brocton , the best part of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour , was originally required . Longer than miles from Brocton was a distance that lay , in those days , between the one life there and the other life here . Brocton was winter  --  a world of sidewalks , dead lawns , storm windows , and temporary wooden vestibules ; a schedule of school without end ; a passage of slow time with everything done indoors . The lake was summer . Clothes were fewer and more agreeable to wear . Meals were different  --  more like constant parties . Families at the lake lived in their separate bungalows ; but they walked up to the so-called lodge and ate together . Rooms for living and sleeping were different . In the taste of the nineties , the bungalows were very rustic . Exteriors of half-round bark slab , of rough juniper veranda posts and rails , of roofs whose shingles were hand-hewn , enclosed consciously simple and bare interiors , puncheonbeamed  --  therooms had no ceilings ; floored with broad knobby planks , walled with unfinished knotty pine . Cobblestones had been used to build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a child  --  there was no inside plumbing . Modest , retired among plantings of hemlock , stood trim , commodiousouthouses . In those days , the clays of Arthur Winner 's earliest memories , the trip to the lake , as his mother had reminded him , was made in horse-drawn buckboards . Along the valley road from Brocton the buckboards carried everybody ; but for the last mile and a half , all uphill , following what was more a trail than a road , everybody , to spare the horses , got out and walked . Short cuts could be taken on foot ; and , going ahead , the children were al-8oways up first . With them , leading them , was generally Mr. Ietweiler  --  George Detweiler 's Uncle Ned . A conscientious outdoorsman , Ned Detweiler was versed in woodcraft . He toted packs and portaged canoes for the fun of it . He cooked skillfully at open fires . Taking several of the boys , he would hike into the woods ; and though they could easily have got back to the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground under shelters that Mr. Detweiler showed them how to put together with no other tool than a sheath ax . Up ahead of the rest , gaining the top of the hill , the children found themselves deep in a preserved strip of first-growth forest . Spanning the road or trail , a rustic gate arch confronted them . Close by was an immense glacial boulder to which bronze letters had been attached . They spelled : PONEMAH . With no effort , Arthur Winner could hear Ned Detweiler 's voice , years ago silenced . Mr. Detweiler liked to recite for them : Thus departedHiawatha ( emphatically " poetic , " insistently solemn , the mechanical trochaic tetrameters trotted along ) to the islands of the blessed , to the kingdom of Ponemah , to the land of the hereafter . . . . To go to the boathouse , Arthur Winner was coming down the path that passed below the lodge terrace . Sunlight , getting through a grove of pines planted half a century ago along the gentle lower slope , struck dazzling into Arthur Winner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Like Noah Tuttlein the Union League bar , Willard Lowe was ingesting some old man 's milk , and now , gratefully , was beginning to get the good of it . An earlier edge of tired concern , of active or vigorous disapproval , had gone . What residue of regret his voice held was passive , pensive . Sad , but not dissatisfied , he was saying : .. dead , today , every man Jack of them ! Well , Mr. Woolf , it is not growing like a tree , in bulk cloth make . . . Smiling , Arthur Winner could be sure that the judge , his mind comforted , a physical pleasure in being alive recovered , enjoyed a mild access of the senses of sentiment and of eloquence . Arthur8iWinner suspected him of gesturing at the great oak on the terrace , calling it , magniloquent , to Mr. Woolf 's surely startled attention . This tree was , indeed , worth attention . Out over the edge of the terrace parapet , out over Arthur Winner on the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended . The oak stood well removed from the old lodge 's rustic front ; yet Judge Lowe and Mr. Woolf , not far from the door , could be said to sit under it . The trunk , a ponderous short pillar of whitish gray bark , furrowed with massive perpendicular ridges as though to show its strength , was seven feet through . The highest twigs of the broad rounded crown were ninety feet in the air . Those low first boughs , nearly horizontal , reached sideways almost as far . Some of them were thicker than a man . Mounting in intricate symmetry , lesser boughs spread out branches too many to count , lifted in hills of leaves , leaves innumerable . Even now in September , they were kept green and lustrous by what must be a gigantic root system , boring down to the water table , searching half an acre for food . When they came to fall , those leaves would , not a few , measure eight or more inches . Arthur Winner 's idea as a boy had been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and though he presently learned differently , learned that this tree was nothing compared to trees of the Pacific coast , here was at least a king of its kind  --  you would go a long way before you found as big an oak . On a visit  --  and this was years ago  --  a friend of Arthur Winner 's father , a college professor who was an eminent  --  the new word still stayed in Arthur Winner 's head  --  dendrologist , had painstakinglymeasured the oak . IIe gave his expert 's opinion that no Quercus alba of such dimensions could be less than three hundred years old ; and in all probability was very much older . Past the Ponemah oak when the country had seemed permanentlytheirs , Indians a good deal more real than Hiawatha might have filed . What you knew at fifty  --  that a hundred years , far from being forever and ever , was not long ; that all wonders , in time , will prove supposititious  --  left untouched the amazing thoughts you were at liberty to have at ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely imagined . Unchanging itself , the oak was living proof of afternoons when children ( among them , a child , Arthur Winner Junior ) , by means of a ladder of cords that Arthur Winner 's father dexterously tied together and hung for them , had played in the tree . With monkey agility ( somewhat limited , since their feet were not hands , too ) they made their excited way upward from point to point , exploring as far as they dared the dizzy aerial world . Those children had been real ; as , in their time , the Indians , possibly passing by , had been . The innocence of that stage of life was real ; for innocence 's essence was a rapturous unknowing , a bliss of doubt-free ignorance . The folly of being wise , those children had never yet committed . They knew nothing of life 's unkept promises and impossible tasks . Soon to disappear , soon to be no more  --  the men and women they were fathers to , the grownups now found to bear their names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of there and as of then . In random flashes of memory , they peopled , all spirits , though clearly seen , that pageant . High in the green afternoon shade of the great tree , they hung and swung . Running to gain the Ponemah rock , the long-lost children could be heard shouting to each other through the woods above the bright lake . In clear echo , Arthur Winner , now close to the boathouse , where it lay with the last shafts of sunlight still on it , could hear today 's children , the young voices , the sportive shouts from the water. + " Darling , " she said , " did you have a dreadful day ? " With quick ease , stepping neatly , light on her feet , Clarissa mounted the stairs from the landing to the veranda , running the width of the boathouse , that overlooked the lake . Strapped underher chin , a white rubber bathing cap framed in tight smooth lines her reposed clear features . Her firmly formed body moved , tall and athletic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " It was so hot ! I hoped you 'd be able to get out earlier . " Arthur Winner looked at her with pleasure . " So did I , " he said . " So did we . I adjourned our meeting before three ; but Wil-83lard was tied up in chambers . So we waited . And how were things here ? " " All right  --  I trust ! " she said . " The children seem to be havinga lovely time . The water 's wonderful . I just got out myself  --  I 'm wet . " Coming close to him , she set her fingers against his shoulders , holding him off , while she put her head forward and kissed him . Speaking low , she said : " Our other guests made motions of enjoyment , anyway  --  and I 'll venture that Mrs. T. really did enjoyherself . I 'll tell you about that . But not right now . " She nodded past him , down the veranda . " Miss Cummins ! " she murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went up to dress a few minutes ago . She 's in there . So if you want to go swimming , you 'll have to wait  --  I 'm afraid your bathing trunks are in there , too . She wo n't be long . " " No , I do n't think I 'll go swimming , " Arthur Winner said . " I have another guest for you ; which , I gather , is all right . Ruth , who says to say everything 's under control , seemed confident there 'd be enough to eat . He 's a lawyer from New York . I left him on the terrace having a drink with Willard , so I can sit a moment ; but for various reasons I do n't want him to feel he 's neglected . " " Arthur , at least take your coat off , " Clarissa said . " Yes ; there 's tons to cat . What time is it ? " Removing his linen jacket and laying it on the settee by the veranda rail , Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat down on the settee . ' Faking her hand , he said : " Sit here . " " No , darling ; I'n- soaking wet , " she said . " And really I suppose I ought to get dressed . Was Adelaide helping Ruth ? " " I did n't see her , " Arthur Winner said . " Though I thought I heard Fred talking to her . Ile drove out by himself and got here before we did . " Clarissa said : " Adelaide was n't feeling very well . She went in after lunch to lie down . You must n't say anything ; but she believesshe 's going to have a baby  --  or hopes she is . She has n't told Fred ; and she does n't want to see Reggie Shaw ; because she 's afraid he 'll make her take some tests and she 'll find she isn't. 84Either that , or he 'll say , after last time , she must n't try it again  --  " " I think she would be foolish to , " Arthur Winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about it . " " I 'm merely her sister , darling , " Clarissa said . " Anyway , this must be considered mostly hope  --  to date . I know about that . " I alf turning , she half sat on the veranda rail , her back against the center post . Reaching to take her hand again , Arthur Winner said : " Do you find that entirely comfortable ? " She said : " Yes ; I 'm afraid I do . I 'm only too well padded . " She rnoved her free hand , feeling her long bare rounded thighs and her hips through the tight cloth of the bathing suit . " I try to tell myself I 've always been a big girl ; but I know better . I 'm puttingweight on . I do n't take it off the way I used to when 1 played tennis . " " Nonsense ! " Arthur Winner said . " There 's no fat on you anywhere . Let 's not have dieting . Russ Polhemus was telling me this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nothing but lettuce . " " Whatever happens , you 'll be fed , my darling , " she said . " If it 's after five , I suppose those children ought to come out . They 've been in the water almost all day . " Turning her head , she called : " Ann , dearest ! Priscilla ! Winifred ! Esther ! All of you ! The boys , too ! I think that 's enough , now . " From below , arose a wail in chorus : " Oh , Hendy ! Oh , not yet ! " Arthur Winner could see their faces turned up in protest  --  Stewart Penrose , the Dealey boys , and George Shaw , who had been busy , not far from the plank walk to the float , climbing into and pushing each other out of an old rowboat , now nearly swamped . The girls were together at the float , their hands resting on it . There they lolled in the water , four heads just showing over the float edge in a row . Noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Hello , Father ! Are n't you coming in ? " . " Not just now , " Arthur Winner said . " Are n't you coming out ? " 85 " Oh , ten more minutes ! Only ten more minutes ! " " All right , " Clarissa said . " Exactly ten more minutes . Then everyone must go and get dressed . " Withdrawing abruptly the hand that Arthur Winner held , she stood up , smiling . Miss Cummins had come out of the door of the room at the end of the veranda . Her short boyish face was flat-cheeked , with small lips curved in what seemed a firm , permanent agreeableness . Her dark hair was braided , and she had coiled the braids tightly round and round her head  --  an arrangement , Arthur Winner suspected , that her fellow women would take at sight as conclusive evidence that Miss Cummins had no idea of how to make the best of herself . Miss Cummins , thin-hipped in a dark green frock with sprigs of small white flowers all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answering Clarissa 's smile , her lips parted on her even , small upper teeth . To Arthur Winner , who had arisen , Miss Cummins said , gazingearnestly up at him : " Mr. Winner , I ca n't tell you how we 've felt for you , in town all day ! It 's been just delightful here . Such fun ! " Making plain her awareness that she might have interrupteda conversation , she said : " I saw Mrs. Trowbridge and Whit coming back along the point a minute ago . I believe I 'll walk over that way and meet them . Unless there 's something I could help with about supper , Mrs. Winner . I 'd love to  --  " " ' ! ' here 's not a thing , thanks , " Clarissa said . " All we do now is eat it . We 'll be up soon and have something to drink . My dear , let inc have that bathing suit and towel . I 'll hang them with mine . It 's so warm , I think they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Cummins said : " Oh , Mrs. Winner , no ! Tell me where to hang it , and 1 'll  --  " With smile encountering smile , Clarissa gently took the damp bundle away from her . To Arthur Winner , Miss Cummins said : " I do feel people ought to get more work out of me . " To Clarissa , she said : " Well , thanks so much ! I did so enjoy getting a swim . " She began to move again . " I just go out through here , do n't I ? I see I do . " She offered them a last smile and went into the open passage that led through the boathouseto the back . While Clarissa carried Miss Cummins 's bathing suit and towel86to the end of the veranda and attached them with clips to the line there , Arthur Winner sat down again . Coming back , Clarissasaid : " Yes , Doctor Trowbridge went for a walk with his mother  --  or , she with him . She has lots and lots to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the post , she let Arthur Winner have her hand . " He adapted himself wonderfully , I must say . Good with the children . Oh ; before I forget , there 's something I must ask you . We 've a little problem , he and I. I take it he 's come to call you ' Arthur . ' What 's the etiquette ? I mean , because of his  --  er  --  cloth , or something , do I keep calling him ' Doctor Trowbridge ' until he calls me ' Clarissa ' ? Or , is he waiting for me , a matron a trifle his senior , to call him ' Whit ' before he stops calling me ' Mrs. Winner ' ? Incidentally , every time Miss Cummins calls him ' Whit , ' his mother 's at pains to make an occasion to call him ' Whitmore . ' " " I expect he 'd be pleased if you called him ' Whit '  --  or ' Whitmore , ' " Arthur Winner said . " We got to it gradually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relative sense , quite a while . His correspondence was with me , as clerk of the vestry . When he was here to preach last June , we were , of course , quite formal . It only began to be Arthur after the induction . The spirit of the age , I suppose . " He laughed . " His age . It 's not particularly relevant ; but I ca n't help remembering that having had him as vestryman and warden for nearly twenty-five years , old Doctor Ives always said ' Mr. Winner ' to my father ; and I 'm sure he 'd have been struck speechless if Father had ever addressed him as ' Jonathan . ' Yes ; I thought you 'd find him easy to get on with . I do  --  " Arthur Winner smiled . " Which may be because he takes great care to ask my advice . Then , if I make any suggestions , he at once follows them . In matters of parish business , that is . In matters of faith and morals , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure him I wo n't intrude there . What has his mother to tell him ? " " Everything , " Clarissa said . " Really , that woman ! There 's nothing about me  --  and not much about you  --  she does n't know now . I do n't think her son  --  well , fills her in very fully . At any rate , nobody happened to have informed her that I was n't your first wife . So she had a horrified moment  --  I could see it  --  of87wondering if one of her son 's vestry had been divorced . I could n't do less than assure her you were a widower when I marriedyou . Not that she had n't decided by then that I was n't much of a  --  what she calls  --  Churchwoman . Well , at least I did n't tell her my people were Presbyterians . Let go , darling ; I must take this cap off . Some water got in . " Unsnapping the chin strap , Clarissa pushed her fingers under the cap 's edges , stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor , she began to feel over her pinned-up dark hair . " Mrs. T. got at it by asking me how old Ann was . I said : Fifteen . ' She said  --  I could see she thought it might be useful to butter me up  --  ' My dear , you must have been married very young ! ' So I had to say I was n't Ann 's mother . Oh , ' she said , quite obviously put out , ' I suppose that 's why she calls you  --  " Hendy , " is it ? ' So  --  you see how it goes  --  I said my maiden name was Henderson ; and that Ann had known me before you married me  --  in fact , that I 'd run a little summer camp up here at the lake for Brocton girls ; that the girls all called me Hendy ; and that Ann , for a couple of seasons , had been one of the girls . Yes ; my hair 's good and wet  --  " Deftly , she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So , Mrs. T. said : ' Oh ; that 's how you happened to meet Mr. Winner . 1las lie other children ? ' " Clarissa laughed . " Do you see what an expert she is ? I told her obediently that yes , there was Lawrence , who was married and a lawyer in Washington ; and that another son , Warren , a year or so older , had been killed in the war . But of course she 'd fixed it so I had to go on by myself then . Explain just who I was  --  that I had n't come cruisingin from God knew where and picked you up ; that our familieshad always known each other ; that my father had been a great friend of your father 's ; and so on , and so on . I admit I could n't help saying  --  I suppose it was quite nasty of me  --  that far from marrying very young , I 'd been almost Doctor Trowbridge'sage . Well , if it 's any compensation , I found out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to stay in Brocton , does she ? " " I expect she could be persuaded , " Clarissa said . " But I do n't believe she 's going to be . I really feel for Doctor Trowbridge , 88poor fellow . He must know better than anyone else what a trial she is ! Of course , she 's far from happy about the marriage . 1 do n't know that she has anything against Miss Cummins personally  --  shesaid she was a dear girl , and came of very good people . But having Whitmore live with her must have suited her down to the ground . And , no matter how he put it , the net effect  --  accepting a new job ; getting married  --  was to shake her off . Just how old is he ? " " In the statement he sent me to read to the vestry , he said he was thirty-three that month  --  last May . " Dropping her handful of hairpins on the settee , Clarissa took her hair , hanging to her shoulders , with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Miss Cummins is twenty-six . I had some semiconfidences from her , too . They 've been engaged several years . She said she was n't getting any younger ; and she 'd begun to wonder if she were going to go on being engaged for the rest of her life . Women have a way of understanding women , so I expect she pretty well knew that was Mrs. T. 's whole idea . Mrs. T. meant it to last out her time . She was all for the engagement  --  akind of insurance , I suppose . I suppose she saw that Miss Cummins was the sort of girl a man can be sensible about ; and as long as she was officially Whitmore 's intended , he could n't very well start taking an interest in girls a man could n't be sensibleabout . I admit I wonder just what Miss Cummins did to beat the game . " Smiling , Arthur Winner said : " I 'm not sure Miss Cummins ( lid anything . I think we did it at the vestry meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the picture . Christ Church is well enough endowed for his stipend to be considerably more than the average parish could pay . He was an assistant , really a curate , while he did postgraduate work for his doctor 's degree . Naturally , he was n't making a great deal . I believehis mother has money ; and , living with him , she must have helped with the expenses . While that was his situation , he might not have seen his way to marrying . Miss Cummins simply had to wait until he did see his way . I 'm glad if we 've been of service to her . " " Yes ; good ! " Clarissa said . " And that also clears up something89Mrs . T. said . It seemed to be about money  --  rather veiled . I supposes he never realized I had n't the faintest idea what a minister  --  aterm she much dislikes  --  gets ; what would be more , or what would be less . But I could understand that , for some reason , she wanted me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm afraid she does n't find us very fashionable  --  orstylish . In short , Whitmore , as a matter of religious duty , because Brocton needed him , had stepped down from the more distinguished social circles he was used to ; and , by his own Christian choice , had come to live among the lowest of the low  --  I 'm glad I did n't really know what she was talking about . I 'd have had trouble keeping my big mouth shut . Now , those childrenmust come out . " Turning , she called : " All right , every-body  --  " Yells at once arose . From the float , Ann cried : " Oh , Hendy ! Judge Dealey 's just come ! He 's showing us  --  " On the float , Arthur Winner could see Fred Dealey in swimmingtrunks . He had moved out on the springboard , which bent a good deal with his added weight , to where Priscilla Penrose stood at the end . He was rearranging her pose . Fred 's dark muscularhairy arms brought Priscilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different angle . Putting his hand to Priscilla 's blonde hair , plastered dank with water behind her ears , he set her head straight . Ile tapped her back to make her straighten that . " Now , Fled ! " Clarissa called . " Honestly , they 've been in all day  --  " " One dive apiece ! " he called back . He steadied Priscilla a moment in her new position . Ile stepped away from her then , leavingthe springboard . Clarissa said : " Poor child ! She was just born clumsy . Priscilla 's pretty in many ways . That lovely hair  --  at least when it is n't wet . I suppose you could say , feature by feature , she 's prettier than Ann ; but  --  you notice every time you see them together  --  the really attractive one 's Ann , not Priscilla . " Shading her eyes against the sun , now fairly on the rim of the rise across the lake 's half-mile of unmoved water , she continued to watch the children clustered about Judge Dealey on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is , Priscilla looks more and90more like Marjorie every year . Have you noticed ? They move the same way  --  all over themselves . You even begin to see that expression of Marjorie 's  --  you know ; that really odd slant-eyed look , with her mouth open just a little when she listens to you , so you see the edges of her teeth . It 's a pity the children did n't take after Julius more . When he was young , I think he was the handsomest man I ever saw . I remember starting to play tennis at the club  --  Julius used to spend a lot of time coaching the kids . When he 'd stand over me , making me change my grip on a racquet , I 'd nearly swoon  --  " At the float 's end , the springboard dipped slightly to the thrust of Priscilla Penrose 's slim knees . It snapped up with her ; and she left it , jackknifing uncertainly . She hit the water with a shattering splash . " You see ? " Clarissa said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that way . Speaking of that , she 's definitely getting queerer and queerer . " " Priscilla ? " " No , my love  --  Marjorie . You should have seen her this morning ! The rector and his mother and Miss Cummins got out to Roylan quite early  --  you probably passed them on your way in . As a matter of fact , I did n't expect them so soon . I was still having coffee ; so I had to ask them to have some . Stewart and Priscilla turned up presently ; and then , for no special reason , Marjorie herself appeared . She was wearing a red pullover sweater , very tight , with nothing on under it ; and a pair of quite dirty white linen slacks with , all too evidently , nothing on under them ; and no shoes . Of course , you might say it 's only a step across the road from the Penroses ' ; but the effect was certainly strange . The rector and Miss Cummins had gone down to see your rose garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Penrose was the wife of one of my husband 's law partners ; and our near neighbor  --  passing it off as well as I could . I suppose not looking at Marjorie 's feet was hard for Mrs. T. ; so Marjorie suddenly said to her : Do n't you love walking barefoot in wet grass ? It 's the most wonderful feeling . ' If only for a moment , Mrs. T. was really stopped  --  Oh , that was Ann ! That was a good one ! You 'll have to say you saw it . " 91From the float , Fred Dealey 's voice came up heartily : " ' Ata girl , Ann ! You show ' em ! All right , Stewart . No , no ; wait ! " Clarissa said : " Of course , Mrs. T. had to get this straight at once . I suppose the woman has real strength of personality , or something . I mean , as I was to find out later , you never think of not answering . You only realize afterward that half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of her business . So she went right into Marjorie  --  where she was born ; how long she 'd lived around Brocton ; how many children she had . Then she asked where Mr. Penrose was . Marjorie , rather dazed , said he was away for a week in Washington on business ; he 'd be home tomorrow  --  " " That reminds me , " Arthur Winner said . " He wo n't . He called me this morning . Somebody offered to drive him up ; and it 's so much easier for him , he said he 'd stay over . He wo n't be here until early next week . I meant to call Marjorie ; but things were much upset in the office this morning ; and I never thought of it again . I suppose I ought to call her . " " We can tell Priscilla to tell her , " Clarissa said . " She does n't have to know right now . Well , the point was : Mrs. T. just nodded several times . Meaning : That went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her , would let his wife go around with no shoes ? " Up the stairs from the landing came a multiple sound of light running steps . Esther and Winifred Shaw ; Ann ; and then Priscilla appeared , their brief soaked bathing suits and flashing active limbs spattering water . Esther and Winifred said together : " hello , Mr. Winner ! " Priscilla turned a shy smile at him . To Priscilla 's still little-developed rump , Ann swung a smart slap ; and , giggling , jostling each other , they slipped in the door of the first room . After them , running too , came George Shaw and the Dealey boys , their cropped light hair almost white above their deeply browned faces . Tom Dealey said : " ' Lo , Uncle Arthur . " To Clarissa , Jack Dealey said : " Where 's mother ? " " She had a headache , dear , " Clarissa said . " She 's lying down for a while . " After them , without haste , as though separating himself from little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penrose . He carried his skinny twelve-year-old frame with an air of gravity and haughtiness . He said : " See me dive , Mr. Winner ? " " Very good , too , " Arthur Winner said . Stewart Penrose stared at him closely for a moment . Injured and contemptuous , he said : " I took a belly-flopper . " He moved off , following the others to the room down the passage where their clothes had been left . Smiling , Arthur Winner said : " At any rate , there 's a lot of Julius in him , you must admit . No nonsense wanted ! " Clarissa said : " That child 's too thin . I wish they 'd do something  --  findout why . Darling , I 've got to finish my story . At that point , the rector and Miss Cummins came back from the garden ; and they looked rather startled . So I did the introducing ; and , to occupy the moment , asked Marjorie if I could n't give her some coffee . She said : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Mrs. T. more or less gulped ; and said : ' You mean , for religious reasons , Mrs. Penrose ? ' Marjorie said : ' Yes . You see , I 've a great deal to atone for . I led , many years , a life of entire materialism . I did many wicked things . Now , I 'm trying to do better . ' I could see the rector looking at her with a certain , I suppose , professional , concern . Maybe Marjorie noticed , and did n't want him to think she was appealing to him . She said : ' I hope to become a Catholic , when I 'm able . ' That was the first I 'd heard about that . D' you imagine she really means it ? Does Julius know ? " Somewhat uncomfortably , Arthur Winner said : " It has been discussed . That friend of hers who visits her  --  that Mrs. Pratt , I believe  --  is a Catholic . She and Marjorie were at college together ; and then I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've met her , " Clarissa said . " She 's quite mad . " " Yes ; I met her myself , I remember , " Arthur Winner said . " I had a curious exchange with Marjorie about her last week . She  --  Mrs. Pratt  --  planned to drive down for a day . Marjorie called me at the office . Would I let her and Mrs. Pratt  --  Polly  --  talk to me ; it was vitally important to her . Put that way , I could n't very well say no  --  " Clarissa said : " And you did talk to them ? " 93 " No , I did n't , " Arthur Winner said . " As far as I know , Mrs. Pratt never came . At any rate , they did n't come to see me . PerhapsMarjorie changed her mind . I 've no idea what there could be to talk about . " " That 's easy , " Clarissa said . " You 're to speak to Julius . Marjorieprobably has trouble getting him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Julius . Arthur , you 're always doing things for people ; and it 's wonderful of you ; but  --  " She hesitated in embarrassment . " But this once , here , I think you 'd be very unwiseto let her involve you . As I say , I do n't know what Marjorie 's up to  --  until this morning , I really had n't seen her for at least two weeks . I took it for granted that she was in one of her moods . When she is , she more or less shuts herself up . " She hesitatedagain . " I do n't think I ever told you ; when we were first married , when I was first living out at Roylan , Marjorie used to come over all the time for talks ' with me . That was when she was doing a lot of drinking ; but it was n't just that . She works herself up . Then she tries to get everyone around her worked up , too . If you do n't go along , take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present thing is , it has to be between her and Julius . Arthur , I really beg you not to mix into it . " Arthur Winner said : " Well , the plan was probably to have the talk with me while Julius was away . I know he does n't like this Polly ; and I imagine Marjorie sees they meet as little as possible . Since it did n't come off this week , and Julius will probably be back Monday , I expect I 'll hear no more . " " I do hope you do n't , " Clarissa said . " And if you do , you really ought to tell her that you do n't feel able to advise her , that there 's nothing you could say to Julius . She has no judg-merit  --  " " Yes , I know that , " Arthur Winner said . " You need to think of her as a child . Mother was speaking about her this afternoon . Marjorie 'd come there ; and Mother had n't been able to see her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , hurt . For all I know , Marjorie was going to talk to her about this . I suppose Marjorie had one of her impulses . Still , I think it 's fair to her to say that her impulses are generally kindhearted  --  a sort of child 's hopingto-please . She does n't refuse anyone anything ; she ca n't under-94stand how anyone can refuse her anything . You 're right ; it 's a fault in judgment ; but  --  " Taking his hand , Clarissa said : " Well , it is n't always quite as pretty as that . You 've been so close to Julius for so long , he 's able to make you see her as I suppose he sees her . When her feelingsare hurt , and you never know what 's going to hurt them , Marjorie 's anything but kindhearted . There 's no telling what she 'll do , let alone what she 'll say . It takes a woman to understandanother woman  --  like Miss Cummins and her prospective mother-in-law . Women do n't fool themselves about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , " Arthur Winner said . Clarissa said : " You mean you just wo n't bother to argue . All right , darling ; do n't bother . But do steer as clear as you can . " She tossed her hanging hair , with her free hand catching a handful . " I 'm starting to get gray , " she said . " Have you noticed ? Would you like me to touch it up ? " " Nonsense ! " " There 's a gray hair  --  right there . Well , if you do n't mind , I do n't  --  much ! " Arthur Winner said : " If you do n't mind my having close to no hair at all , and the fact that I look , and am , nearly old enough to be your father  --  " Tightening her strong fingers on his , Clarissa said : " Not too nearly old enough , I think . " She smothered a laugh . " Not unless you were awfully precocious  --  " She broke off . From the room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; little by little , as their chatter absorbedthem , getting louder . Now Ann 's voice said clearly : " For somebody that old , I think she 's kind of cute . D' you know what her name really is ? " Priscilla Penrose said : " Miss Cummins 's name ? " Winifred Shaw said : " He calls her ' Midge . ' I heard him . " " Yes , " Ann said . " I think that 's kind of cute , too . It 's probablywhat she asks her friends to call her . " Esther Shaw said : " D' you suppose when they 're alone he  --  well , you know ; kisses her , and everything ? " " Of course , silly ! " Ann said . " They 're just like anyone else . But I saw her real name in the paper . Mrs. Gifford Trowbridge , 95and Miss Hermione Cummins , at the Federal House . Herrnione ! But , actually ! " Enunciating those words , Ann , Arthur Winner knew , would be giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side in a mannerism she had come to practice during the last year , Ann 's delicate-featured , sun-browned face would be expressing a fatigued resignation . With a dramatic drop of her long-lashed eyelids , Ann would be veiling her light blue eyes as though she prayed for the strength to bear it . Priscilla murmured something ; and Ann said : " Oh , it 's from Shakespeare . Queen to Leontes . The Winter 's Tale . It 's there in that collected works we had to buy . Of course , Mrs. Pollard did n't assign that ! It 's the craziest play ! Everyone 's nuts . But , definitely ! This Leontes suddenly gets the idea , because , when he asks her to , his wife  --  that 's Hermione  --  asks this best friend of his to stay longer , that his best friend  --  " She lowered her voice . " Oh , Ann ! " Esther Shaw giggled . " You 're awful . " Ann , plainly complimented , said : " I 'm only saying what it says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sir Smile  --  ' " Raising her voice , Clarissa called : " Ann ! " " Yes , Ilendy ? " " You girls finish dressing , dear . And , Ann ; unless you talk very quietly , anything you say in there people may be able to hear on the porch , you know . " There was an explosive faint sound of general dismay , and some choked giggles . Ann then said , composed enough : " We 're dressed . Winnie 's just putting her sandals on . Hendy , we 're terriblythirsty . May we have some tomato juice , or something ? " " Yes . Take the boys , too . Em will give you all something . And tell her I 'll he along pretty soon . " To Arthur Winner , she said : " I suppose I should dress . Yes , I should . There 's Doctor Trowbridgeand his women  --  just past the pines , there . They 'll go on up , I hope ; but I 'm sure Mrs. T. will think it very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising from the porch rail , she bent , caught up her bathing cap and collected the little pile of hairpinson the settee . " Come in while I get my clothes on . You did n't tell me about your hearing , or whatever it was . " 96Following her into the room at the end , Arthur Winner said : " I was sitting as auditor . All of it was long ; much of it , complicated , and of merely legal interest , if that . None of it was of any consequence  --  unless you 're able to feel it of consequence for the McCarthy sons , an unattractive pair , to succeed in their fairly ugly attempt to keep a cousin of the old man , who took care of him during his last years , from charging the estate what she says he cost her . The boys say , adducing no proof , that she was paid in cash from a horde he kept in his mattress . Or , for the widow , a distressing creature , to succeed in Lloyd Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the will . By her own agreement , and for due consideration , she was years ago excluded . Her election will certainly be vacated . You could n't possibly want to hear the details . " Clarissa closed the door . Turning in the warm shadow , she said : " I am not , and will never be , one of those wives who 's bored by her husband 's business . Oh ! Another point of etiquette . I 'm right in thinking it 's proper to offer the rector a drink ? " Smiling , Arthur Winner said : " He 's not a Presbyterian . It is proper . " Looking out the screened window over the cot set against the unfinished pine plank wall , he said : " Yes ; they 're going on up  --  not coming here ; if that 's what worried you . I do n't think you finished telling me about your talk with Mrs. Trowbridge . " Clarissa said : " Arthur , how patient you are ! " Coming back to him , she lifted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ? I believe it 's because I have n't any intellect . Good at games  --  that 's all I ever was . Why did you marry me ? Are n't you sorry you did ? " " As most people would see it , " Arthur Winner said , " I think the pertinent question might be : Are you sorry I did ? " " You do n't know how lucky I am , Arthur , " she said . " You 'd have to be me to understand that . " Coloring , she looked steadilyat him a moment . She looked away then ; and said : " Do I need a shower ? I always feel as if the lake might be full of dead fish . No ; I do n't . Mrs. T. would probably take it less amiss if I appeared sooner , without soap and water , than if I appeared97later , with soap and water . I 'll just throw some clothes on . " Sliding a thumb under the narrow worsted strap of the bathingsuit , she freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I was young , I never , never , wanted to be married . When I saw boys looking at me as if  --  well , I suppose , as if I were a girl  --  I just hated it . I tried every way I could to make them stop . I remember when Adelaide got engaged  --  as late as that  --  she seemed to me completely insane . Fred might be all right ; but why on earth did Del want to have to put up with a man for the rest of her life ? I could n't see it . " Pausing , she got the strap off her right shoulder , and said : " I 'll tell you something I never told you before . I really kept right on not being able to see it until one evening when you 'd come up , when Ann was at camp here . You had supper with us ; and you stayed until taps . And I walked out to your car with you ; and suddenly I realized that what you 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason you 'd just decided not to . I ca n't tell you what a shock I got then . I mean , a minute before , I 'd have been perfectly positive I 'd never consider marrying anyone . The next minute , it was all settled  --  settled as far as I went ! I was going to marry you if it was the last thing I ever did  --  you just had to ask me ! So then I began to be in a kind of panic . There I was , thirty-one years old ; and I 'd never learned what any girl of sixteen knows  --  how to get a man to ask you . " Arthur Winner sat down on the chair at the foot of the cot . He said : " And how does she ? I 've often wondered . " " Not in any of the ways I thought of trying , " Clarissa said . " I thought of trying to make you see there would n't be anythingtoo funny about it  --  it was n't as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be too tall either . Then , I thought of using Ann  --  I mean , of making you see that the child was quite attached to me , that you did n't have to worry about whether she and I would get on , that it would be so much better for her if she had someone like me to take care of her , make a home for her , while she was growing up . And , of course , that you needed a home , that living with Ann at your mother 's , the way you were , with your own house shut up , was no way to live . I98knew you went out and took care of the gardens at Roylan , so it was pretty plain you wished you lived there . If you 'll think back , you 'll realize I took several months to work it ; and it was pure Providence that I did n't bitch it for fair . " " This is not uninstructive , " Arthur Winner said . " By your account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I 'll now tell you something I never told you before . What concerned me was a feeling that I had no business to ask you , that it would be an extraordinary piece of presumption and imperceptiveness , that you would be annoyed and offended . If men your own age had n't seemed attractive enough for you to want to marry any of them , why on earth would you want to marry a middle-aged friend of your father 's ? That 's the only reason it took you severalmonths . Yes ; let 's ascribe it to Providence . I 'm much obliged to Providence . " " Are you ? " Clarissa said . " Arthur , I love you . " She worked the bathing suit down to her waist , turning away a little , with a swing of her freed breasts and a swing of the loosened dark hair that hid her face as she bent her head . She said : " It really never was that I did n't like men . I thought they were marvelous ; and anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always a nuisance . That 's what I meant about Julius Penrose  --  the way he looked to me when I was a child . I never did the kind of mooning about him normal little girls might do  --  about how when they grew up he 'd marry them . That would spoil everything ; because what married him would have to be a detestable girl . All I meant was that I wanted to be a man like that so much I could hardly stand it  --  the shape of his hands was so beautiful ; hands you could do something with , not ridiculous girls ' hands . I knew it was no good ; I 'd have to go on being a girl . And I just loathed it . I do n't know what was wrong with me ; but that went on all the time I was growing up  --  very neurotic , I can see now . Quite horrid , really . It 's nice to think you could n't possibly have noticed me then . " In simple penetration of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected that Clarissa was wrong . He99had noticed her ; he remembered her as a child . The notice he took might not have been consciously taken  --  conscious notice would do no more than mark her , identify the child as the elder Ilenclerson girl  --  yet something in her expression , her carriage , her manner , could have left an impression . His mind had probablybeen prepared for the definite notice of her that he could remember taking later . Hardly more than a child , Clarissa Henderson , by her remarkabletennis playing , had begun to make herself a name . To the Brocton club , she brought all the state cups available to girls of her age ; and she was soon winning matches in invitation tournaments even farther afield . There had been hopeful local talk  --  too hopeful , as it proved  --  that Brocton was producing here a girl who might get the National Junior title away from the young California champions who kept succeeding each other . That was asking the impossible . A real amateur , who played tennis only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never by any mere natural aptitude make herself a threat to what amounted to professional amateurs  --  girls who played tennis all year round , whose aptitude might equal hers , and whose training and coaching were highly professional . Coming up against some of these players , Clarissa , if not beaten easily , was beaten soundly . They outclassed her . A girl of good sense and good temper , she acknowledged it . She would have to be content to win from those with no greater advantages than she had . This was the point at which Arthur Winner 's recollections could become specific . Ile had observed Clarissa Henderson as an individual . Ile could clearly picture her , dressed for the evening , among young people at the club dances  --  say , twenty years ago . On many of the girls , dressing up of that kind worked an arresting , sometimes amusing , often touching , transformationinto likenesses of grown women . The party dresses heightenedfemininity ; they showed off insinuatingly the pliable lines of their new-found , fully female bodies . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allure did nothing good . They looked all wrong on her . The right costume for Clarissa Henderson was the whiteioobroadcloth shirt and shorts , the laced canvas shoes and green eyeshade that she wore on the courts . A highly developed muscularco-ordination would not let her be physically clumsy about anything ; yet a timing of her motions to music , an according of them to those of a dancing partner who led her , broke the fine rhythms into which that co-ordination , left to itself , would fall . If you wished to see what those rhythms were like , you had to follow Clarissa Henderson , side-stepping sure and swift , as she passaged with zeal along a clay court 's back line . You had to study her as she pressed with mastery , springy on her fast feet , every muscle in harmonious play . She walloped the ball back nearly as hard as a man ; she carried , irresistible , the rally toward the net , toward the final deft lob placed with precision out of her opponent 's reach . While she paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resting her racquet in her hanginghand , the warmth of the short spatter of applause sure to sound from the stands acknowledged , not the incidental won point , but the pleasure that watching her had been . Beside these pictures , that picture of Clarissa ( who even if she had failed in the grand essay remained little the less a youthful local heroine ) brought out to dance , of Clarissa obliged to put on the clothes that made other girls pretty , but did not become her , must cause a twinge of sympathy . Arthur Winner 's sympathy had been , of course , altogether detached , impersonal . In what conceivable way could Tom Henderson 's halfgrowndaughter come to be of the least intimate interest to him  --  let alone , to be his wife ? Arthur Winner already had a wife ; and , indeed , it was Hope who really brought him to notice Clarissa , to see what ( being no concern of his ) he might otherwise have failed to see , or failed to take in . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a generous general concern of Hope 's , the prompt representations that a heart made , indignant and mutinous , when shown again how little common sense and common kindness went into the ordering of the world . Hope Winner , sitting with her husband ( they were able to think of themselves as an old married couple , ages removed from the kids across the room ) to watch the young people indulgently , was moved to the sudden complaint that it was a shame , it was tootolunfair , it was really cruel . She indicated Clarissa Henderson to him . The fact was , though none of the child-women over there could be said to have a figure better joined or more justly pro- portioned , Clarissa Henderson stood an inch taller than the tallest boy present . That this should be so often a fact ; and that to the fact was joined those other facts  --  no boy of her age in Brocton could face her successfully on a tennis court ; every one of them , div- ing off a landing beside her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the water and put a hand on the raft  --  might have , Arthur Winner thought , more to do than Clarissa now remembered with her hating it when a boy ( in passing ; how many such boys had there been ? Hope Winner 's compunc- tious concern , her woman 's pitying appraisal , was not to be shrugged off . Would hurts to his manly pride incline a youth to love ? ) looked at her as if she were a girl . The hate , no doubt , was real ; but what were the reasons for it ? Did Clarissa Henderson , her blood warmed with adolescence , really manage to think never of boys except in terms of athletic games and races to the raft ? Aroused , she was physically ardent ; and , with her vigor of health , as good as certainly she early be- carne so . Forgotten in the years of wishing to forget , there must have been times when Clarissa , well past the stage ( now preferred in memory ) of the child who yearned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny feelings . What was she to do ? She would have the flustering consciousness of her splendid tall athlete 's body . She would have the disconcerting foreknowledge that she must be careful , or she would very likely humiliate him in fields supposed to be his . Those good but timid suggestions that instinct would not fail to offer her , she could not follow  --  they were all for small girls , cuddlesome little creatures . Suppose she ventured inviting an advance ; and then ( anguishing thought ! ) none was made ? Suppose , thinking of her as a big lummox , he saw what she was trying to do , and laughed her to scorn ? practicing themselves on Clarissa , these fears might perfect their wretched power . The game , the thing toward which the funny feeling tried to push her , was not worth the candle . For no gratification that such a feeling could possibly portend , not 102 for anything , was she going to hazard the agony of finding , speechlessin her shame , that she had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She needed only to be first  --  rebuffing advances before they were made ; arranging to have the laughing-to-scorn immediate , and hers ; conveying at once , to any boy who in the least perturbed her , that there was nothing doing , do n't be silly ! So conducted , life was reasonably safe . Clarissa was fairly secure , un-get-at-able in her bright parthenic status of just Hendy , a grand girl , a good sport , a real pal  --  and , no , thank you , nobody 's sweetheart now  --  or ever ! Since practice must here , too , make perfect , there was reason enough to think that Clarissa did not deceive herself about what her attitude of mind as a girl had usually been . Since the secret fearfulness was genuine , she genuinely wanted this state of her affairs ; and , so , having established it , could be genuinely at peace in it . Most days , with all her free time going into games , she would be both too busy , and , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding . Most nights , putting herself to bed in a happy , drowsy tiredness , she went right to sleep . Her nature 's real temper would have trouble finding its hours . How often would she be idle and by herself during the day ; or , at night , gone to bed but wakeful ? How often was the incubus able to creep upon her , to reach and to toy with that cribbed , that pent-up , ardency until , in her distraction , he compelled her to let him have his way , compelledher to go on and help him stay her and comfort her , compelledher to confess , by consent to her unavowable present engagement , what she secretly lay sick of ? Standing in the warm shadow , Clarissa pressed the tight bathingsuit down over her hips to her knees , where , deftly balancing , she stepped with neatness out of it . Coming erect , her gainly white back poised with candid grace between her brown arms and her well-shaped long brown legs , she crossed to a chair by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip . The barefoot movement in the indoor twilight , the **25;10715;TOOLONG display of the breasts in clean curved motion , of the narrowed waist and well-held hips , the straightness of limb , set up in Arthur Winner a stir of the senses  --  to be , of course , ignored ; yet an ache of force persisted in the imagination'smoment of fantasy . If they were alone , if he and she had been up at the lake by themselves this afternoon , if no people waited at the lodge , if no children were running around everywhere , if Fred Dealey were n't still down swimmingAlone here , he could have touched her arm , turned her about . Coming late to the act of love , Clarissa came frank and fervent , unhindered by the juvenile bride 's shy maneuvers of anxiety , or the untried recent schoolgirl 's fits of embarrassment . The start of her surprise would instantly be gone . Getting , by one tender look at him , the answer to her grave smile of query , her color would come up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his unexpected importunity , a warmth of foretastedpleasure , of the body 's concentration , intent and inward , on the joy proposed , the bliss now soon to be in proof . She would , half in his arms , move toward the cot with him , helpinghim lead her , bring her , where he liked  --  flowers were the couch ! Clarissa said : " Who 's this man who came out with you ? Any-body ? " " Ile has a certain air of consequence , " Arthur Winner said . " 11is name 's Woolf . I do n't believe he thinks much of us , or the kind of law we practice . Ile began the proceedings by challengingme as auditor . I had to explain to him that he could n't do that  --  that I could n't hear him . I was n't competent , as an instrument of the court , to entertain objections to the legality or propriety of the court 's appointment . His remedy would be to except to my report . Ile then wanted his protest against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . I did n't think we could do that either . The issue was in every sense dehorsthe record . " With quick efficient movements , Clarissa had drawn on a pair of panties . She said : " He sounds quite unpleasant . " " Purely professional unpleasantness , I think , " Arthur Winnersaid . " He 's accustomed to seeing a surrogate , or something104of that kind , handle all probate matters  --  at any rate , an ordinary member of the bar named by the court was new to him . I 'd say he was right ; he has a duty to his clients to scrutinize the proceeding for irregularities . He seemed to think he saw at least one . He understood , he said , that the executor , Mr. Tuttle , was what he called the principal trust and estate officer  --  you can see the scale of things he 's used to  --  of a firm in which I was a partner . Supposing this to be true , how was it that I had n't disqualified myself ? Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , Noah 's position . Neither of us was there in any capacity that made our business relationship relevant . " Dropping a slip over her head , Clarissa said : " Did he mean  --  " " I suppose he did , " Arthur Winner said . " I suppose he wondered if he was up against some cabal of small-town lawyers who had fixed things to play into each other 's hands . Then , he was n't long in displeasing Noah ; so Noah proceeded to behave as only Noah , on occasion , can . Mr. Woolf 's really owed an apology ; and I expect even Noah thinks so now . He was trying to reach me by telephone about an hour ago ; and I think that was what was on his mind . But one wishes he could remember that  --  that he 's going to be sorry  --  before he says it . " Clarissa , sitting down to the mirror of the small and inconvenientdressing table , took up a comb . Tossing back her hair , she went to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just too old ! He hardly remembers anything . A week or so ago I met him on the street in Brocton ; and he stopped to talk to me ; and I happened to tell him I 'd driven Ann in to the dentist . He said to me : ' Ann ? Ann ? Who 's Ann ? ' " Rubbing his head wearily , Arthur Winner said : " Things like that depend a good deal on how he 's feeling . Some days ; he 's quite all right . Some days ; he gets upset , and then he gets confused . Helen Detweiler can handle him ; but today Helen needed some handling herself . She 'd had a shock of sorts . Brother Ralph is refusing to go to college . He says he wants to get married . " Clarissa said : " Heavens , is he old enough ? " " That 's how time passes , " Arthur Winner said . " Ralph 's eight-105een . Anyway , Helen seemed to see it as the end of the world . " Gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight at the back of her head . " Well , I do feel sorry for 1-lelen , " she said . " That boy always was thoroughly selfish . " Holding her hair , she picked up a narrow black ribbon , caught the held hair in a loop , and tied the ribbon firmly . She said : " Who does he want to marry ? " " Well , I think there 's also that , " Arthur Winner said . " Or , would be , if Helen took the marrying part seriously . The girl 's father 's a chain-store butcher . I do n't doubt she 's perfectly all right ; but since Helen 's idea is that nothing 's too good for Ralph , this would n't be the match of her choice . But , as I say , she thinks Ralph 's only using that to get out of having to go to college . She was a good deal more realistic about him than I expected . It does n't seem to make her dote on him any less ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't going to saddle himself with somebody to support  --  " " I should hope not ! " Clarissa said . " Eighteen years old ! And I know who 'd do the supporting , too . " She stood up . She went to the wall where a frock of white linen on a cleaner 's hanger was suspended from a hook . Slipping the hanger off the hook , she turned the frock around , looking critically at it . " I wo n't give those Acme people any more of our cleaning , " she said . " Their work 's getting worse and worse . Helen has a peculiar mind , you know . " The frock on , she came over to Arthur Winnerand faced about . " Zip me up , darling , " she said . " Back when that happened about her father and mother , for a long time  --  several years  --  Helen was very strange with me and Adelaide . It was so ! narked , you could n't miss it . Later , I found out why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ; because she felt we must think Father 's dying was her parents ' fault . I mean , things that would never cross the average person 's mind , I 'm sure cross Helen 's mind all the time . Could Ralph get married if she did n't want him to ? " " In theory , no , " Arthur Winner said . " Helen 's now Ralph 's legal guardian . In this state , he ca n't marry without her consent until he 's twenty-one . " Io6Opening the door to the veranda , Clarissa said : " Then , she does n't have to worry about that . I suppose that 's why she does n't take it seriously . She knows he could n't do it . " " Not in this state , " Arthur Winner said . " But if he took the girl into another jurisdiction ; and if , there , neither of them was under statutory age , nobody could interfere with his marrying her . If he 's legally married there , the full faith and credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all he 'd have to do if , tomorrow , he felt like contracting a mar-riage  --  " Coming up the stairs from the landing below , Fred Dealey said loudly : " Who feels like contracting a marriage ? Bring ' em before me ! I 'll marry ' em ! Now , who 's sticking his head in a noose ? " " I do n't know that anyone is , " Arthur Winner said . " Ralph Detweiler just told Helen he might be thinking of it . " " Best thing that could happen to him , " Fred Dealey said . " I 've wondered if that boy was ever going to do anything for himself . After all , he 's George Detweiler 's son . There ought to be something in him  --  if he 's ever given a chance to show it . " Clarissa said : " Oh , Fred ! That 's utterly absurd , and you know it is ! When Helen 's done everything for him , made it possible for him to go to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dealey said . Balancing his hairy and limber , almost youthful , body tautly on the balls of his feet , Fred Dealey also balanced his sharp-chinned , severely narrow face , pulling back a little to stare at her with a penetrating shine of eye , cool and critical . He said : " I was afraid he was going to college . Four more years of living on his sister , and he wo n't be good for anything . What he needs is to have to work , not have Helen helping him find ways not to . Was n't he supposed to be working this summer ? " " He was working , " Arthur Winner said . " I do n't know how hard  --  " " Of course ! Does he have to work hard ? No ! What was he do-ing ? " " Selling brushes , " Arthur Winner said . Io7 " Did he make any money ? " " Perhaps not , " Arthur Winner said . " Helen had to buy him a car  --  " " Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is Brocton so big you have to have a car to get around it ? Helen had to buy him a car ! There it is ! No , sir ! If Ralph can find the guts to get out from under and marry someone , more power to him ! " Clarissa said : " Now , Fred ; really ! A boy of eighteen . Would n't you want Jack and Tom to go to college ? " " Not if they do n't do any better in school than I hear Ralph did , " Fred Dealey said . " If they 'd like to go to college , they 'll have to show me they could get something out of it . What 's Ralph going to get out of it ? Nothing ! " Clarissa said : " You do n't know that , Fred . " Pulling his chin down farther , Fred Dealey rose springily on his toes , making himself nearly as tall as she was . He gave her a look , friendly but derisive . He said : " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be working ; and when he is n't working , I happen to know something about what he does . Selling brushes did n't take all Ralph 's time this summer . We 've just had a report from the juvenile office on that Old Timbers " Tavern place , down the Mechanicsville road , and who hangs out there . We want to see if we ca n't catch up with that Ropel fellow and his wife ; and I only hope I 'll be the one who has the pleasure of throwing the book at them . They encourage these kids to come in . Rope ! knows none of them 's twenty-one ; but he sells them all they want to drink . We have Ralph 's name . He 's not one of the regulars  --  yet ! But he 's practicing for it . They 're a no-good lot  --  two or three reformatory graduates who do n't seem to remember they 're on probation . Several girls who appear to be well-established teen-age tarts . The sooner Ralph has to support a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms akimbo , her strong hands on her linencoveredhips , Clarissa said : " Now , you 're just talking , Fred ! A boy Ralph 's age has n't any business to marry anyone . He 's not old enough to buy a drink ; but you 're trying to tell me he 's old enough to have a wife and family . Arthur says there is n't anyio8law to keep him from getting married . I say , if you do n't have one , you ought to make one . Heavens , I must get up there ! Are you coming ? " " Well , get up there , Toots ! " Fred Dealey said . " I 've something to speak to Arthur about . " " That 's a good sign , " Clarissa said . " Maybe he can talk some sense into you . Darling , did you say your man 's name was Woolf ? " " I did . No doubt Judge Lowe will see that he 's introduced to you . They 're on the terrace . " 109FIVE S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or small , these Henderson girls are great ones for knowing their minds . When they say it , it 's so ! Why 'd you bring Woolf out , anyway ? " " Well , we had to continue  --  " " Why did you have to ? I did n't think you 'd need more than one day . " " I did n't either , " Arthur Winner said . " In a sense , Mr. Woolf can thank himself , if he does n't like staying . He insisted on going into detail on the inventory . Noah was prepared for exceptions to the account , and for the widow 's election ; but that he was n't prepared for ; so sums of money  --  an item of bonds , in particular  --  were unaccounted . Any other morning , Helen would have seen he had all the figures , just on the off- chance he might need them ; but today there was this Ralph business . Helen got hold of herself . She was able to report the meeting , all right . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of hand . Woolf , of course , bore the brunt . " " Well , he does n't look exactly helpless . " " Far from it , " Arthur Winner said . " And if trouble 's what you want , he 'll oblige you . Ile 's got a good head ; and he hangs onto his points . So , of course , he infuriated Noah . Noah 's not used to having statements of his questioned . Moreover , Mr. Woolf must have had our probate law looked up for him . He 'd noticed that the amended statute lets us cite an executor to ac- count after six months ; and since nobody had told him we just do n't do things like that here , he was hinting pretty strongly that that might be his next step . That really tied it ; because Noah did n't like Mr. Woolf anyway . As you saw , Mr. Woolf 's obviously Jewish . Noah made several references to you people '  --  very pointed ; and getting madder all the time . Finally he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know why you ask . Never imagine , Mr. What's-your-name , that I ca n't tell typical Jew lawyertricks when I see them . ' " " A highly improper observation , " Fred Dealey said . " And is that what they were ? " " Woolf was perfectly in order , " Arthur Winner said . " He had a job to do ; and he was doing it . He 's a very capable examiner ; and the effect may have been a little rude once or twice . But it was n't on him to know local customs of our courts ; or that Noah 's to be treated with tact and deference  --  the dean of the bar , and so on . " " How did you handle it ? " " Mr. Woolf did n't give it to me to handle ; and I was very grateful to him , " Arthur Winner said . " He certainly had a right to appeal to me . He simply said : ' If my religious faith interests you , Mr. Tuttle ; I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer , that 's answer enough . ' I had only to say to Helen : Strike Mr. Tuttle 's concluding remark . ' And we could proceed . That 's the real reason I asked Woolf out . I did n't want him thinking we all shared Noah 's prejudice . " " Well , Noah 's outlived his times , " Fred Dealey said . " This matter of so-called prejudice always interests me . Take a man like your father . Anyone who knew him would agree that if there ever was a fair and just man , a man absolutely unbigoted and unprejudiced , he was it . Back when the Ponemah Associationwas formed , and they were building the bungalows here , do you think your father would even have considered admitting a Jew , letting him come and build a bungalow with the others ? He would , like hell ! Why not ? A perfectly reasonable reason . What  --  probably , little  --  he 'd seen of Jews , persuaded him he did n't want them for neighbors . Today , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My personal observation is that Jews behave as well as other people ; and you can trust them just as far  --  which is n't saying much ! Take our brother of the bariiiDave Weintraub . Like our good district attorney , J. Jerome Brophy , he has , I know , some low-life customers in Mechanics- ville ; but , personally , I find him better company than half the alleged Christians . If he wants to live next door to me , he 's wel- come to . The same goes for J. Jerome  --  or would go , if he could manage to be a little less of a slick article ; and I 'm the first to say he could be that without having come from Water Street or being a Catholic . Speaking of Catholics , what 's this about Mar- jorie Penrose ? Is she serious ? " " I know very little , " Arthur Winner said . " I think she may be . " " How 's Julius going to like it ? " " I have n't asked him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no need to , " Fred Dealey said . " If he 's been able to put up with her all these years , he must be able to put up with anything . Sometimes I think the crazier she is , the more he somehow feels responsible for her  --  have to be something of the kind . " He looked closely at Arthur Winner . " Do n't imagine I mean that to reflect on Julius , " he said . " I mean just the opposite . How long would I be able to do unto a sort of idiot girl as I would that people should do unto me ? And he 's never been any professional saint , acting noble about it , either . " He paused moodily . He said : " Well , what the hell ! Let everybody do what he wants . Or she wants . They do n't have to ask me . " Arthur Winner said : " I-Ias someone been asking you ? " He picked up the jacket he had laid on the settee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one ! I suppose you want to get up there , Arthur . Come on . This is n't going to take long . " They moved together through the open passage . " I do n't know what to do , really , " Fred Dealey said . " What would you do ? Del , the damn fool , thinks she can have another baby . I say she ca n't  --  not alter what happened three years ago . She says she can and will ; she 's going to . So there we rest . " The sunlight , moving up the slope , no longer lay on the path behind the boathouse . Shadow had mounted past the glimpsed terrace and the rambling front , partly seen , of the old lodge ; 112 but the whole upper range of the great oak was sunny still . The bright enormous tree stood against a sky that looked heavier and darker  --  perhaps , only the shades of night to the east ; perhaps , thunderstorms developing out of the close air . Arthur Winner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be pregnant . I gathered that Adelaide was pleased . " " So the story goes , " Fred Dealey said . " I do n't know what got into her  --  Strike that ! " He gave a rough , bitter laugh . " I would n't have to look too far to find what got into her , I guess . The bees and flowers were n't involved . It 's not as if we had n't two children already , for God 's sake ! Her idea seems to be that she wants a girl . Why ? What 's good about them ? And , anyway , does she think she can order what she wants ? " Arthur Winner said : " If having a baby 's really dangerous  --  " " Well , you ought to know ! " Fred Dealey said . I ie shut his mouth sharply , turning his strained severe face on Arthur Winner . " That was the goddamnedest thing to say ! I 'm sorry I said it , Arthur . I suppose I meant , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd understand better than most people . When something like that goes wrong , I guess you do some thinking  --  if it were n't for you , it would n't have happened ; you did it to her . Not much fun ! That was still a hell of a thing to say . " Arthur Winner said : " You 've a point . There 's that to think of . I ought to know ; and I do . I do n't mind your saying it , Fred . " In a way that Fred Dealey , intent on his immediate anxiety of looking forward , imagining what could come , not able to see things as a looking-back would see them , might be unable to understand , Arthur Winner spoke the truth . The truth was one that took getting used to . Discovering it , the heart relucted , had recourse to customary defenses , tried to add one more to the index of prohibited thoughts . This truth , the fact that the heart 's dear feelings , conceived as spiritual , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ephemeral , outlasted them with113ease , at first sight simply would not do . For a second sight ; for an adjustment to the knowledge that this , being so , would simply have to do , a little more time was needed . Contrite , Fred Dealey swore when he thought of the pain he must have caused any man of decent feeling . Forgiven , he was crediting Arthur Winner with magnanimity , not with a plain statement of the case . What , in actual fact , was left today of that live nausea of guilt and grief  --  Fred Dealey 's " not much fun " ? The retentive mind could reproduce at once , sharp and exact , what was needed  --  evidences of the senses ; things then seen and heard  --  to show Arthur Winner the corridors of the Broctonhospital 's Grace Giddings Orcutt Memorial Pavilion on a January morning nearly eight years ago . He was walking through them . On the third floor , at the corridor 's end , was a small sunroom , today without sun . Beyond the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantity of plants in sickly condition  --  pots of things sent to patients and left by them when , in one way or another , they departed . Along the corridor , stepping with a swing that seemed to say he was at home there , now came Reggie Shaw . He wore a white operating-room gown . He was carrying his cap , and the square of fabric that had masked his mouth and nose . When he reached the sunroom , the sweat finely beading his broad bony forehead could be seen . He tossed the cap and mask on the table . " Buck up , Arthur ! " he said . With hands that showed a tremor of strain or tiredness , he produced and lit a cigarette . Poised in his lips , the cigarette had a tremor , too . He spoke around it . " I think we 've licked the thing . We 're all right . I do n't mind telling you we 've had a time . We could n't get it tied off  --  " Near his elbow , unobservable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-sized bright stain of fresh blood . In memorable shakiness of relaxing nerves , Arthur Winner looked at him . Reggie Shaw said : " She 'll be all right . Now it 's just a matter of starting transfusions and keeping them up a while . They 're bringing the stuff down now . " He flexed his hands , his breathing audible , as , relaxing , too , he drew deeply on his cigarette and slowly breathed smoke out . The next moment , from behind them , from a suddenly114opened door down the corridor , a nurse was calling , her voice alive with urgence : " Doctor Shaw ! Doctor Shaw . . . Arthur Winner said : " What I started to say , Fred , was that if it 's really dangerous , too dangerous , you can depend on Reggie Shaw . He 'll stop her . " " Him , and how many policemen ? " Fred Dealey said angrily . " If Del 's made her mind up to have a try  --  I do n't even know that I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraption ! She had this gadget and some stuff Reggie gave her she was supposed to use . Then , says she , she got this idea . So she began , without telling me , not to use it . I do n't know whether she did or not ! I can generally tell what she 's doing or not doing . I think this was a slip-up ; but , God knows why , she does n't want to admit that . So she 's trying to say she planned it this way . I do n't know what 's going on . " By Fred Dealey 's impatient scowl , Arthur Winner could guess that Fred was reviewing some of the many devices known to him of that cockeyed contraption , the human  --  or , here , specifically feminine  --  mind . He might see , though he was not going to say , that Adelaide , caught this way , could need him to share her trouble , not to get off free . She could feel impelled , a need not incompatible with human loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenged herself a little on him for what , even if only by accident , was ( as he said ) his doing . At the same time ( a need frankly loving ) she might want those proofs of his attachment to be found in his anger and alarm at the risk she was proposing to take . The two needs once sufficiently satisfied , she could have every intention of giving in , of , in good time , agreeing to run no risks . Fred Dealey said : " So , at the moment , I 'm supposed , says she laughing merrily , to leave it to her . The other , says she , could have happened to anyone . This will be different  --  wait and see ! I suppose , if you 're a woman , you may have a natural instinct to go on with it  --  unless , maybe , you forgot to get married . And even then ! Look at our Caroline Dummer case  --  she seems to have wanted to have the baby ; she only lost what little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused . As though involuntarily , he said : " I suppose Hope wanted to have it , too . " " No , " Arthur Winner said . " It was n't that . She did n't know . It was one of those cases  --  Reggie said they were n't uncommon , particularly when they were going to terminate that way  --  in which there was n't any reason to think she was pregnant until she had what turned out to be a miscarriage . If we 'd known , there could n't have been two opinions . She 'd never been very strong ; and she 'd had a bad time when Ann was born ; and she was in her forties . " Moodily , Fred Dealey said : " Well , that 's a lot different  --  just bad luck . You ca n't blame yourself for not doing anything about what you do n't know about . What creates liability ? " His tone , sardonic , took on energy . Mimicking an attorney in argument , he said : " I offer Restatement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other . It is negligence to use an instrumentality , whether a human being or a thing , which the actor knows or should know to be so incompetent , inappropriate , or defective that its use involves an unreasonable risk of harm to others . Right on the nail ! At my time of life , I 'm not having any of this let's-take-a-chance stuff . That 's no way to run a railroad ! " In the positive , irritable assertion appeared , for Arthur Winnerto see , what Fred Dealey might not see himself . Angry and anxious , Fred was retorting to a faint disturbance of doubt , to a first enigmatic intimation that all might not be well with the unconscious assumption that underlay his settled view of things . At forty , Fred saw himself with living enough back of him to know what was to he known of life . He was able , sometimes sadder , always wiser , to survey the successive stages of himself . With the knowledgeableness of today , he could consider his own transitions  --  theonetime college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the zealous and optimistic law student ( he had been number two in his class ) ; the new attorney , not insensible of his own merit , and , so , hardly surprised ( though pleased ) to have the Winners , father and son ; Noah Tuttle ; and Julius Penrose soon agree together to offer him a job with what most people conceded to be the " best " law firm in Brocton . He had duly taken a wife ; and , so , taken instruction in women . He had begot children ; 116 117and , so , made himself acquainted with the not-otherwise-to-be- understood pains and pleasures that the existence of offspring must afford a father . He had even come finally to know some law , actually to be little if any less learned in law than he had fondly ( if privately ) seen himself as being when he left law school . Then , with everyone 's approval , and much earlier than might be expected , he became a judge on the bench . Fred , of course , knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the moment , probably for a number of years now , the course of his life lulled him with a reassuring steadiness  --  every- thing under control ; nothing coming up that his gained ex- perience could n't unhesitatingly deal with . Having learned to understand both , he could handle himself , and he could handle other people . He might reasonably ask where any major form- ative changes , like those of the past , could now come from . At Fred 's age , fourteen years ago , Arthur Winner , no more aware then than Fred was aware now of what he rested on , rested , too , on some such assumption . Intimations ( like what- ever this one was that he could see Fred now half feeling ) had surely offered themselves  --  hints that the lute could rift ; premonitory catchings and hitchings in the smooth run of the scheme of things ; silences in which there seemed to be sounds . Were they from behind ? Were they of hunting , of pursuers ? Were they from ambushes ahead ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would presently do . He dismissed them as fancies . Arthur Winner said : " I do n't know that much blame attaches to not doing anything about what you ca n't do anything about either . All I 'd be able to suggest , Fred , is that you make Adelaide see Reggie . You can do that . And you could try to get her to promise that she 'd have Reggie , not you , or her , decide . " " Well , yes , " Fred Dealey said . " Smart move ! The thing to do is really have an argument about that . I 'll start right after sup- per . " He gave a grimace as though of self-contempt . " What else ? I did n't really want advice ; I just wanted to shoot my face off . Thanks for listening . " He paused where the path to the side door went off . " Maybe I can even get some licks in right now . Del was feeling lousy ; so she 'd gone to lie down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had my swimming trunks in there , and called me in . If she 's still there , and feeling really bad , this might be a good time to beat her up . " " If you decide to , keep it quiet if you can , " Arthur Winner said . " The Trowbridges , and Woolf , do n't know us very well . If they heard anything , they might not understand . " Fred Dealey said : " Whatever happened , Del would n't yell . You 've got to give her that . " He took two steps away and stopped . Scratching his hairy leg thoughtfully , he said : " Well , I know what you mean about how much blame attaches , Arthur . I 've a little thing I 'm working on . I have n't got it done yet ; and , anyway , I could n't use it in my business . There , you just note how things came out , and say : The sentence of the court is  --  . You 're dealing with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , how about what 's going to happen ? By any chance , could that be all over now , too ? " Frowning almost diffidently , he looked at Arthur Winner . He said : " This may sound like a lot of words . I just notice how often , afterward , you think : If only I 'd done this , if only I 'd known that ! But , observe : You did n't do this , and you did n't know that . Make you think of anything ? Quaere : Could you ever have changed what 's going to happen ? You know this much : Whatever happens , happens because a lot of other things have happened already . When it gets to where you come in  --  well , it 's bound to be pretty late in the day . Things have been fixing for whatever this is for a long time ; and that includes you  --  whether you know it or not , what you 're going to do or not do has been fixing for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the knowledge of necessity . " Standing still on the path , hearing mingled cheerful voices from the terrace above them , Arthur Winner looked at Fred Dealey . The nature of the intimation could be seen  --  a query directed at human struggle and human failure , and at the kinds of victory attainable in life . Might all of them be forms of de- feat : givings-up ; compromises ; assents to the second best ; aban- donments of hope in the face of the ascertained fact that what was to be , was to be ? " And , maybe , just as well ! " Fred Dealey said . This intimation 118 was dismissible , too ; and Fred was now dismissing it . He gave a scornful laugh . " Can you tell what 's good ? This looks wonderful ; this is for you ! Yeah ? Wait a year ; and check that . This worriesyou to death ; this is terrible ! And what does this turn out to be ? Only  --  the best break you ever got ! Sure ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! " Down from the terrace came a burst of laughter . With everyonegathered around , Willard Lowe had perhaps condescended to tell a story ; and often he told good ones . After the laughter , Clarissa 's voice said : " Del , this is Mr. Woolf , a friend of Arthur 's  --  my sister , Mrs. Dealey . " At the same time , Ruth Shaw said : " I actually believe that was Reg 's car coming in . Poor lamb , I did n't really think he 'd make it  --  " A voice , not familiar to Arthur Winner , but surely Mrs. Trowbridge 's , said : " I would n't , I 'm afraid , care to be a physician 's wife . It must be so hard to plan things  --  " Still standing where Fred Dealey left him , Arthur Winnercould feel  --  he was taken unprepared ; he had been feeling cheerful enough  --  a deep sudden depression of mind , a reluctance to walk on , to face the weary , flat , stale , and unprofitable uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Woolf ; of Doctor Trowbridge ; of Doctor Trowbridge 's mother . Sun had gone from the summit of the great oak , and from the wooded slopes beyond the lodge . Now the day was over . Though not anywhere near a dusk , though broad and lucid , the light was now the light of evening , the close warm air was evening air . Below Arthur Winner , the lake , with everyone gone from it , spread silent , flat as glass . Standing still , Arthur Winner seemed to see himself , the motionless big-limbed , taller-thanaveragefigure , with his balding head tilted up , paused ( past the middle of his journey ) at loss . Laughter and idle voices above him made sounds how vain , how futile , before the coming night and the possibly coming storm. ' ' 9An activity of mind , marginal , not pressed on Arthur Winner'simmediate attention , would seem to have proceeded from that reference to Hope that he had not minded Fred 's making . The marginal activity might first have been no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today Hope was remembered , of discomfort at the heartlessness ( Sleep on , my love , in thy cold bed ! ) of that necessary , and , so , inevitable , adjustment ; of sadness to see how quickly and willingly the dead were not only allowed , but helped , to bury the dead . The change from the vague and formal to the definite , from remote regret to the pressing and depressing present grief of heart , came , of course , when Fred , after his half-embarrassed essay in minute philosophy  --  whether a man is a necessary or a free agent ; and the possible teleologies of what happens to you  --  dropped his sardonicphrase : the best break you ever got ! You might reserve judgment on whether or not an unalterable , already finished design determined your future ; but could you deny the iron chain of effect following essential cause by which the past had so plainly determined your present ? From the tranquillity of today 's slowly ending afternoon ; from Clarissa , her hand in his , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grace about the shadowedroom in a candor of nakedness ; the chain , link after link , stretched hack , a nexus unbroken to the winter morning with a cold and gloom of snowfall outside when , even as Doctor Shaw declared his triumph , his words were mocked . That was essential ! This present , quite simply , went back to , originated in , was made possible by , the giving-way of a little tied ligature . A pack of gauze sopped at once with blood . Over linen covering the impervious undersheet , appeared a widening moist spread of blood  --  too copious to be controlled by anything at hand ; too rapid for anything to be fetched . Presently , Hope 's half-emptied heart fell silent . There , too , of course , a chain was ending . Step by step , the present of that woeful morning in the hospital could be retraced from caused effect after caused effect to effective cause after effectivecause . Each of them firm , the links of circumstance stretched back to another morning , a day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding day of a lanky tall young man of twenty-five , a figure long lost in the past , called Arthur Winner Junior . Apparent aspects of that occasion  --  one of local social consequence  --  were all fair . To the parents of Arthur Winner Junior and the parents of Hope Tuttle no more agreeable arrangement could be imagined . Every material prospectwas fortunate . For the happy couple , a home of their own was ready and waiting . Arthur Winner Senior 's splendid weddingpresent had been a deeding-over to them of the first of those old Roylan houses that he had caused to be restored with taste and fitted with every modern convenience . The chancing house to live in was not all . The lucky pair was easy about their livelihood . The well-starred bridegroom had , in the law offices of his father and his father-in-law , not merely a job , but a position . He started where any other young lawyer , the newest member of the county bar , might expect to spend years getting . Not material , not connected with money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was another , again surely favorable , aspect of this marrying . Bride and bridegroom had known each other a long time . Though the easily determined date must make him not quite three years old , Arthur Winner could recall ( with a distinctness and insistency that suggested an actual remembering ; an early first lifting of the oblivion that lies on infancy ) himself being held up so that he could see into a crib which contained a small bundle of lace with a face . To sounds of an enthusiasm he did not share , he was informed that what he saw was the darling new little baby that God had given Mrs. Tuttle . But even if this episode was quite imaginary , a mistakein fact and a mistake in date , the bridegroom had , from a few years later , and thereafter continuing clearly , indubitable recollections of his bride-to-be . There was an often-seen slight girl child in rompers . Above her dainty pale face , still babyishly round , her hair formed a dense soft cap of curls of a remarkable dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black stockings , bloomers , and a middy blouse wore that hair , unaltered in its arresting shade , braided to pigtails . At such stages , Arthur Winner Junior  --  in age so far ahead of her ; and she just a girl  --  would view little Hope Tuttle with a120 121mild disdain of indifference ; yet the more or less sissy world in which she lived overlapped his . During summers at the lake , during the winter in houses whose lawns merged together on Greenwood Avenue , she was there , insignificant , but well known to him . When ( about the time she was seventeen ) Hope astonishinglybegan to overtake him ; when , a year or so later , he found Hope at home in his circle , his full contemporary , both of them were able to see themselves as having grown up together . It was true , at any rate , that they had a common background . They recalled together the same people , places , and incidents . Consciouslyor unconsciously , for years he had been observing her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if she liked him , that liking was informed and tested . Neither need anticipatethose appalling surprises that people who marry on short acquaintance , who had not perhaps even met a year before , may spring on each other . Remaining , of course , were considerations that came , in young love 's estimate , not last , but first  --  the powerful part of love ; the pretty part of romance . What had this bridal to show of rapturous feelings , of elevated thoughts , of fine sentiments ? To be true , to be real , love ( everyone knows ) must be innocent of calculation . Did this match , as far removed from imprudence as any match could be , fail that test ? Surely not ! He and Hope , in view of their feelings , would unhesitatingly have declared themselves to be in love . Why not state that they were ? With eagerness , such a young couple might seek to love ; with longing , such a young couple might wish to love ; but , could they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult living . They were hardly aware of that main principle of life that all things pass and all things change . The knowledge they would need in their relationship could not be got in advance , so they were ignorant . They were imperceptive , because perception is an acquirement of experience . When they spoke of love , were they really given to know what they were talking about ? That person of so long ago , the Arthur Winner Junior who protested122his passion to Hope Tuttle , now dead , could not be here to answer ; but , to help with an answer , the lost and gone young man had laid by some recoverable recollections  --  acts done ; sensationsexperienced ; thoughts entertained . They might bear on the question , shed light . In recollection 's light , first to be noted was the plain fact that , by standards of what was later learned , the feelings affording a young man his state of love , of being in love , were largely factitious . This was not by any means to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not , as the young man himself was likely to imagine , arisen spontaneously . In theory , the feelingsresulted when love magically and mysteriously seized on him ; in theory , that was what love did . In practice , love did nothing of the kind . He , the truth usually was , seized on love . A young man heard and read of a thing called love . Love was praised everywhere as pure , noble , and beautiful . Love did have to do with the commerce between the sexes ; but love as describedclearly could not have to do with sex  --  the physical urges of nature that he knew about . Those had been ib nounced to him as evil and impure , the associates of what he joined in calling ( even if he fairly frequently indulged in them ) dirty jokes , dirty thoughts , dirty practices . What those were , must be everythingtrue love was n't . Love knew them not . Love , manifestly , was out of this world . Love 's high feelings , at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had , apparently , by anyone . A young man would not be long in resolving to have some . By the time Arthur Winner Junior 's eye came to cast itself on Hope Tuttle , the resolve to love had made strides . An ordinary number of awkward preliminary ventures lay behind . At first timid and inept , the resolve had tried forcing romances into being , practicing for the right feelings . The labored quality of such ventures would soon dissatisfy the resolve ; this was no good . The venture had to be written off . He let the always-tentativeaffair fade . He then tried again elsewhere . Thus , the eye that cast itself on Hope had learned to look more critically . The resolve to love had a better idea of what was needed . To prosper , the resolve now knew that the loved one would have to be123this , and she would have to be that . Until such requirements were , by trial and error , established , Arthur Winner Junior naturallyhad no way of knowing Hope Tuttle would do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dreams . That love was something one fell into , might , this far , be true . The frustrate resolve to love was searching , a formed idea now well in mind , for a one and only . The day came when , startled , Arthur Winner Junior looked at Hope ; and Hope , a friend , laughed or smiled ; and there she was ! The bill filled by Hope , never having been consciously formulated , could not be exactly stated . For one thing , Hope as an object of sight greatly pleased ; and this was , of course , importantsince her proposed lover had gained at least an inkling of the great truth that people , if you have the eyes to see , are what they look like . Anyone would say that Hope was pretty ; which was good ; and a growing discernment could say the prettinesswas not that of too-formal beauties  --  always warning you to watch out : their possessor 's main business in life may be to admire herself in her glass . Was never face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so , immediately the resolve to love improvedthem . They were interfused with light and radiance  --  the enchanting mysteries of the female ; her delicatenesses of difference ; her charms of strangeness . Arthur Winner Junior with a new eye , a re-created mind , took , marveling , these wonders in , entranced by them . For another thing , Ilope , as well as so wonderful to look at , was observed , with some of the same suddenness , to be fun to be with , to he nice to be with . Things she said and did were constantlydelighting her now-acknowledged swain . Hope had , for example , a habit of silent laughter . Breaking in on what she was saying , or making her leave for a moment what she was doing , ebullitions of happiness appeared to take her by surprise . They buoyed up abruptly , too strong for a smile to contain them . Quietly exultant , Hope laughed to herself . Toward the end of the period of their engagement , feelings , clearly intense , of tenderness appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pacing his resolve to love , parallel to it , equal in its success , a resolve of Hope 's , a young woman 's love of love determinedlyapplied , had been proceeding . With a look of amaze-ment , she would say suddenly : " Think how I love you ! " Coming at last to stand in the flower-bowered chancel of Christ Church , with a dressed-up crowd behind him , and outdoors , a beautiful day  --  the sun was to shine on this bride  --  the bridegroom had undoubtedly ( these sensations were recoverable ) brought there a budget of excited emotions . At some moments , he had not failed to feel the joked-about male trepidation , the awful wish to run , the panic of goneness to realize that this , as they used to say , was " for keeps . " At others , he might fairly be said to have felt all the exaltations that he practiced to feel ; the high-minded , even holy , joy that he knew he ought to feel . Stumbling on a word or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he said , genuinely dizzy , that he , Arthur , took her , Hope , to his wedded wile , to have and to hold . Still dizzy , he heard her , Hope , their loosened hands again formally joined , take him , Arthur , to her wedded husband . ProfferedHope 's other hand , whose immaculate glove had been slit for the purpose , he pushed , after an instant 's unforgettable fumbling , the ring over her narrow finger tip and down Hope 's bare finger . Taught by Doctor Ives , he dizzily endowed her , since she was agreeable to being had and held , with all those worldly goods , so luckily his , or in prospect to be his . That was the place ; that was the day ; that was the moment . Revisiting the pretty solemnization 's scene , one saw now ( and might not one have seen then ? ) the presages . Did a prophetic whisper sound at Hope 's appearance on her father 's arm ? Beneaththe cascading veil , Hope 's notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which all extra flesh was beautifully chiseled away , and with that skin 's delicate sheerness , the pallor near-transparent . A liquefaction of lace and satin folds of a wedding dress that had been her mother 's ( takingin the dress enough to fit Hope had been a problem ) suggestedHope 's slender shape , the slim conformation of the body to the light bones . That slenderness could charm the male eye ; that slimness could cost older women , who wiped a tear , pangs124 11 125of envy ; yet , though Hope did not look in ill-health , any physician , putting together the fined-down face , the sheer skin , the too-slight figure , was likely to be of the decided opinion that she needed to put some weight on . Professionally , he might ponderthe prognosis . What about the practical side of this business ? Pretty ; yes ; but was that a body to breed and bear ? For the flesh 's earthy function , was this mold all too ethereal ? An answer of yes could be made . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bring about Hope 's untimely cutting-off . On the other hand , to show you that doctors did n't know everything , that frame that looked so fragile must have been not unsturdy : her spouse , by that frail venter , was to have three children . Here , the ethereal mold , the outward and physicalHope , might mislead . Where appearances , as usual , did not mislead was in what they said of the inward Hope , of the body 's tenant ; and of that tenant 's tastes and temperament . Not the one , nor the other , you might rightly guess , would be likely by itself to have prepared Hope to regard that practical side , the earthy function , with physical enthusiasm . Neither could the uses of courtship , which often effect a preparation , effect one in Hope . They could heighten her feelings of fondness or affection ; they could not alter her temperament . The fact of apparent paradox was that , in those uses , Hope had been by no means backward . To her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as he pleased . Hugs and kisses were an accepted , understood expression of pure affection . Hope liked them , in the sense that she enjoyed , innocently relishedas compliments , their proof that she was attractive . Her nature unaroused , and in her experience , unarousable , Hope , with calm desireless happiness , was ready to ( as it was then called ) pet at every opportunity . Not really affected , she had no reason to proceed with caution . How far was far enough need never trouble her . The result , not without irony , was that Hope could and would consent to " pet " longer and oftener than girls whose temperaments were warm , than girls , conscious of natures not , they knew , to trust , who must call a halt fairly early in the game , must stop then , if they were going to stop at all . To this ingenuous practice of Hope 's , her fiance adapted himself as well as he could . One important element in his resolve to love had , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gross . The resolve decreed that Hope 's purity ( of which there could be no possible doubt ) and , indeed , the beauty and nobility of this relationship in general , should never be affronted by the taking of any liberties that were also indecencies . Embracing Hope , her lover comported himself with conscious high-minded restraint . As far as possible , he meant to take care that the object of his affections occasioned in him no thoughts that were low , no feelings that were dirty . Given Hope 's innocences of consent , this was not always easy . To the rules of high-mindedness , the flesh is imperfectly amenable . Kisses however chaste , caresses however decent , if the exchange of them is kept up , must have the flesh soon shaping to its natural end , projecting its actual objective . A discipline of mind was required . The witching hour was to be saved intact by a division of consciousness ; one part excluding rigidly all that engaged the other part . Held separate , thoughts on the plane of moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , at least , they could so proceed to a point . Due to that blamelessneglect of Hope 's to call the halt she ( the fair , the chaste , the inexpressive she ! ) had no need to call ; and to her partner in petting 's reluctance to leave , since he was free to remain , there had been awkward occasions when the animal ( disregarded by the hour and teased too far ) reacted of a sudden , put to the shillyshallyso long imposed its own unpreventable end . Arthur WinnerJunior  --  confusion in the moonlight ; dismay among the roses !  --  was obliged to conceal as well as he could a crisis about which his single shamed consolation was that Hope , anything but knowing , would never know what had happened . Recollected with detachment , these self-contrived quandaries , these piffling dilemmas that young love could invent for itself were comic  --  too much ado about nothing much ! Arthur WinnerJunior was entangled laughably in his still-juvenile illogicalitiesand inconsistencies . Absurdly set on working contradictoriesand incompatibles , he showed how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By his unripe , **25;10742;TOOLONG , he was bound to be self-confounded . By the ridiculous impracticalness of his aspirations , he was inescapablythat figure of fun whose lofty professions go with quite other performances . The high endeavor 's very moments of true predominance guaranteed the little joke-on-them to follow . In unedited , unglossed fact , an endeavor of high-mindedness really had kept that dizzy morning in Christ Church free of all gross thoughts . Purity prevailed . To Arthur Winner junior 's unsteadiness , not the smallest part was contributed by thoughts that soon he could enjoy Hope physically . Entrance of smutty ideas  --  say , imaginings of Hope as she would look undressing , as she would look undressed  --  would be an outrage , unthinkable ; even a glance at them would amount to piacular pollution . But , come night ; what then ? Well , not that night . For that night , untied Hope still her virgin knot will keep ! After all , Hope was worn out by the happy day 's festivities ; and , moreover , when they retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . Hope 's new husband 's consideration for her , not unjoined by the subduingeffects of a nervousness great enough to threaten incapacity , with a kiss put off what-then . But , come tomorrow night ? At the resort where they had arrived safely , in the very expensivehotel suite reserved for them , high-mindedness could continue to set some comic difficulties in passion 's way ; but , never fear , they would not prove insuperable ! A somewhat uneasy dinner over , I lope soon went upstairs ; and while Hope was beingallowed , to spare her modesty , to do her undressing by herself , those rejected imaginings of yesterday morning now enteredunopposed . That concept of piacular pollution , much diminished as the idea of the undressing Hope was entertained , received , with the autoptic fact of the undressed Hope , its coup de grace . Not ungently , not heedlessly nor unfeelingly , yet quite determinedly ( that nervousness , though considerable , did not prove incapacitating ) , Hope , before the night was much older , was deflowered . With some unskillfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certain pause-giving sense of letdown ; a certain is-that-all ? ) , Hope was duly enjoyed . And the enjoyed Hope ? What , in this coming-together , had been the role of Hope Tuttle , the new Mrs. Winner ? What comedyof cross-purpose did youthful errors of hers produce ? What had the reluctant maiden been professing on the one hand , and actually doing on the other ? In professing herself agreeable to being had and held , Hope 's consent could be judged full and fair  --  her hand , with her heart in it . This was of Hope 's consideredchoice ; this was her deliberate decision  --  the more certain , the more definite , and , yes , the more loving , because no passion colored her judgment . Nor was Hope consenting in any serious ignorance of what she consented to . By a convention then dying , yet not then dead , a mother , otherwise devoted and affectionate , had seen no reason for Hope to know of such mattersbefore marriage discovered them to her ; but Hope had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before girls more knowledgeable saw to her instruction . Since Hope 's temperament made the subject of greater embarrassment than interest to her , much detail remained obscure  --  her fiance had been right in supposing Hope unlearned in male physiology  --  but she was quite clear about the capital point . She knew exactlywhat a girl must let a man start doing to her as soon as they are married . Far from feeling any warmth , any faintest stir of personal desire , when Hope reviewed this knowledge of hers , she undoubtedlyfelt a chill . If stirrings of curiosity sometimes troubled her ; anxious wonderings about what it was really like ; attempts of the mind , revulsively fascinated , to imagine how two people would look , what they could find to do and say , as they prepared to accomplish , and then ( how could they ! ) went ahead and accomplishedtheir joint obscenity , these speculations would be against her conscious wish and will . The more or less hateful compulsion that occupied her with them left her distaste still stronger . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope did not like , Hope was going to do . Undeterred by chill or revulsion , Hope was going to agree , consent , submit . To help her , would be a girl 's settled impression that marrying was what you did when you grew up . If you did n't marry , what would people think but that no man had128 129ever liked you enough to ask you ? To help her , too , was the fact that she was a woman ; and , so , though unknown to her , her alarms , while real , were in the mind , were , at most , only skindeep . The ethereal mold , and the temperament so bespoken , were hers , all right ; but they did n't mean that the female 's saving , tough-spirited , matter-of-factness had been left out of her . Gestures of taught modesty , of conventional timidity , might cover it most of the time ; but it was there ; and it was always ready . Unaware of what it was , Hope could still be conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , enabling her , like any woman , to face unblenching and unsqueamish every anguish and every nastiness that life could inflict on her . With this undefined but perfect assurance , Hope might know that , though she was frightened and repelled , what she had promised to do she would be able to do . Hope 's character , that other aspect of temperament , put duty as a matter of course beforeany conflicting personal wishes . Duty would keep her from entertaining so much as a thought of not doing what she ought to do . Meaning to love , obligated to love , she loved . If being the devoted helpmate of a man she cherished involved permittinghim in his inexplicable pleasure , her pleasure would be to permit him , her pleasure would be to pleasure him . If being the mother of children she would cherish required of her ( as she knew it did ) acts of darkness , acts of darkness would be done . Wanting what came of them , she could even fairly say she wanted them . So many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junior and I lope Tuttle Winner , did the mind hesitate , form a query , feel a doubt about what to call their feelings ? The doubt was really not particular . It did not reflect on him ; certainlyit did not reflect on I lope . The gist of the doubt was general ; the query only this : All sayings aside , is youth in fact love 's season ? + " Father ! " Ann said . " Father ! " She was standing at the top of the stone steps to the terrace. 130Following a fashion or fad ( incomprehensible to Arthur Winner ; since it was not attractive , and did not even look comfortable ; yet it had persisted several years now with the girls of Ann 's generation ) , Ann wore a white boy 's shirt and coarse dark blue workman 's dungarees whose trouser legs were rolled halfwayup her shins . The garments gave her the air of a small male impersonator  --  a Rosalind or a Viola , at the requirement of a complicated and ridiculous dramatic plot , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ann had bunched her notquite-dryhair together and tied it with a big blue little-girl 's bow . She said : " Hendy says : Telephone . " " Thank you , my dear , " Arthur Winner said . " Do you know who 's calling ? " " Unh-unh ! " Ann shook her head . She remained , her sandaled feet planted apart , looking down at him . " I think it may be Grandfather Tuttle  --  or some message from him . " As he approached , mounting toward her , she moved , jumping . From two steps above , she threw her arms around him and kissed hint . " Hello , " she said . Smelling the damp hair , the agreeable fresh odor of young skin , Arthur Winner said : " Goodness ! What am I going to be asked for now ? " Ann giggled . " Oh , nothing much ! " she said . Turning to move with him , she ran her arm through his arm and clasped it securely with both her hands . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind , could Pris and I have a car together ? " Arthur Winner said : " Would that be useful ? Neither of you can get a driving license until she 's sixteen . " " I know , " Ann said . She rubbed her head hard against his arm . " But  --  Pris will be sixteen , right after Christmas . So she could drive then . We 'd be awfully careful . We know a jeep we could get for two hundred and fifty dollars . If I did n't have any other presents for Christmas , could I go halves ? " Arthur Winner said : " That seems a very reasonable price for an automobile . I think I 'd like to look it over , before you settle anything . " " But after you 've looked it over , I can , ca n't I ? We know it 's all right . Rodney Revere 's seen it . It belongs to a dealer he131knows who sold him his car . We were asking him how much he paid for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents about this ? " " No , " Ann said . " She has n't had a chance . You see , we only just decided . And I said I 'd speak to you first . " " And then Priscilla is to tell her father that you 've spoken to me ; and that I feel you and she ought to have a car right away ? " " Oh , Father ! " Doubling her fist , Ann punched his arm several times . " I never said , right away ! It would n't be till next year . But we have to know now ; because we have to save our money to run it . " She looked at him with an expression of virtue . " At the moment , I think I must answer the telephone , " Arthur Winner said . " I 'll take the matter under advisement . " " Please , please , please ! " Ann said . She turned her innocent gaze up at him . " And you 'll tell Mr. Penrose you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Sometimes , when she tries to tell him something , she says he may just laugh at her . Or tell her he does n't want to hear anything more about it before he even knows what she 's going to say ; when if he 'd just listen a minute  --  " Obliged to laugh , Arthur Winner said : " Now you think about it , since his daughter 's involved , I 'd really have to speak to him , would n't I ? " " So , you will ! " Ann said . " That 'll be simply super ! " " I lave we a meeting of minds ? " Arthur Winner said . " I 've engaged to look into the question further ; and to find out how Priscilla 's father feels . Nothing more is implied ; nothing else is to be inferred . " " Natcit ! " Ann said . Reaching the terrace with him , she let go of him . Poising a moment , cocking up an eye to a great limb of the great oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " is what he thinks ! " She scampered away . Along the terrace , the evening light , with so much of the sky shut off by the spread of the tree and the front of the lodge , was vitreous , holding uncolored , transparent preliminary hints of dusk . On the extensive trestle table burned two lighted candles132in big hurricane glasses , their motionless flames a little brighter than the air . Along the table , which was spread with a red-andwhitechecked cloth , platters had been distributed , each carefullycovered by a sheet of waxed paper . At the near end was an array of glasses and bottles and a cocktail pitcher . Fred Dealey , who must just have come out , stood there with Doctor Trowbridge . Their backs were to Arthur Winner . Taking a swallow of the cocktail he had poured himself , Fred Dealey said : " Why in God 's name do women like to eat outdoors ? Do they like bugs ? " To one who knew Fred well , it was apparent that , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion might find the phrasing objectionable came to him . To pass it over , he said with annoyance : " They want to ; we have to ! " Doctor Trowbridge 's head turned , showing Arthur Winner his not-unhandsome profile , his straight nose , his pleasant-lookingsomewhat small-lipped mouth . He surveyed Fred Dealey with an expression that was dry but urbane . Casual and clear , with a little of a liturgical overtone 's elegance , he said : " Yes ; I believe it has been written that what Woman wants , God wants , Judge . With no irreverent intent , we should perhaps accept that in principle . " The grave and friendly correction having been offered ( and Arthur Winner must agree , with some deftness ) , Doctor Trowbridge smiled and raised his glass . Down the expanse of flagstones , beyond the other end of the table , Willard Lowe could be seen . He remained sitting in state in his chosen chair ; but talking to him now were Ruth Shaw and Miss Cummins . Mr. Woolf , Arthur Winner observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Woolf stood silent , his sallow face civil and serious . He held a two-thirds empty highball glass in the unmistakable manner of the man who , drinking only for politeness 's sake , avoids , in order not to have to make a point of refusing more , finishing what he has . Since Mrs. Trowbridge held no glass , Arthur Winner judged that she did not drink even for politeness 's sake . A ( lark purple straw hat was pinned to her masses of nearly white hair . Her features , large and formidable , seemed drawn to a focus , commandingly , searchingly , intent on Mr. Woolf 's bland melan-133choly eyes . She was saying : " Your usual legal work , then , is mainly in New York City  --  " Not pausing , Arthur Winner crossed over behind the oak to go to the other door . Here , out under the open sky , the light was brighter ; yet you could see , in a violescent haze , the east 's increasingly somber tone . Around the several cars , scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hot sun off them , the boys , tireless , were playing tag . Their yells and cries were sharp on the heavy air . By the side door , another car , with Reggie Shaw 's physician 's number plate , stood . Arthur Winner went in . The telephone , an old instrument , really an antique , with a handle by which you rang , was affixed to the wall near the pantry . Clarissa , who had in her hands a big bowl of potato salad , stood there with Adelaide Dealey , who was carrying a pitcher of iced tea . Confronting them was Reggie Shaw . He was saying with a roughness that sounded more jeering than bantering : " What 's your trouble , baby ? Or can I guess ? Just let me have a good look at you . " He put out a hand to touch Adelaide 's chin up . With her free hand , Adelaide struck away Doctor Shaw 's hand . Her small face , trim-looking , with something of the shape , something of the delicacy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weak electric light of the hall . Though she kept her voice low , she said with fury : " Just you mind your damn busi-ness ! " Clarissa said : " Oh , Reg ; let her alone ! " Reggie Shaw said : " Be my damn business before you know it ! Tell Pappy how many periods you 've missed . " Adelaide said : " If you do n't stop , if you do n't shut up  --  " Her hand was shaking enough for iced tea to slop from the lip of the pitcher . " Now , baby ! " Reggie Shaw said . In his voice was that faintly maudlin benevolence of a man who might have had a few drinks ; yet he would pass well enough for sober . In Reggie 's broad bony face , his eyes , hollow-appearing , regarded Adelaide reproachfully . He rubbed his cropped patches of wiry matlike hair whose onetime rust red had now grown almost gray . He134said : " Why do n't you do what you 're told ? You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do you 're one of those girls who only has to look at him to get herself knocked up . " He gave his head a distressed shake . " Now , what are we going to do ? " Moving with violence , Adelaide stepped back , brushed past Clarissa , and carried her pitcher indignantly up the hall . Glancingafter her , still shaking his head , Reggie Shaw said to Clarissa : " I knew it as soon as I looked at her . Sure . One night she thinks : Too much trouble to get up ; the hell with it ! You two ought to trade apparatus . Then , everybody 'd be happy . " Clarissa said : " Reg , you 're not being very funny  --  " " That 's right . I do n't feel very funny , " Reggie Shaw said . " Sometimes you get your bellyful of women  --  their goddamn notions ; their goddamn talk-talk-talk ; their goddamn sacks of tripes ! Hello , Arthur . Are you here ? Where did you come from ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " " Well , do n't apologize ! " Reggie Shaw said . " You are n't interruptinga consultation . The patient was n't co-operative . But she will be ; when the be-jesus is scared out of her , she will be ! " He made an irritable waving gesture of dismissal and went down the hall toward the terrace door . Clarissa said : " Did you hear any of that , Arthur ? I do n't like it . I think somebody ought to speak to him  --  tell him people will only take so much of this kind of thing . " " And if he were to answer that those who did n't like it knew what they could do ? " " Well , he would n't , " Clarissa said . " Not to you . " She nodded at the telephone . " Darling , I do n't know what 's going on . There was a call that seemed to be from your office  --  only it was a man , a voice I did n't recognize  --  just asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was cut off ; and Marjorie Penrose was on the line . Noah had called her at Roylan , she said , again  --  " " Yes , I know , " Arthur Winner said . " That is , I knew he called her before . " " Well , she was disturbed ; because he was more and more excitedor something . So I said I 'd tell you . Oh ; I also took the occasion to tell her what you said about Julius not coining home tomorrow . She said : Ohl ' in a rather funny way . ' He wo n't be135here ? Well , I 've someone I must call then . I 'll hang up . ' So she did . Lord , I thought  --  I remembered what you said  --  now , she 's going to get her Mrs. Pratt down ! I wish I had n't told her . So then , I asked the operator to try to find out who was calling first . So she 's trying , I suppose  --  " " Undoubtedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union League might be putting in the call for him . I think it can be only what I spoke about  --  nothing of any importance . Why do n't you take that bowl out and get rid of it ? And if you 'd care to bring me back a drink , I 'd be most grateful . If it 's Noah , he may want to talk some time  --  " " Well , do n't let him , darling . We 're going to eat very soon . What do you want , Scotch ? " " Yes , " Arthur Winner said . The telephone rang and he took down the receiver from the wall . A man 's voice , known to him , though he could not , for a moment , place the speaker , said : " Hello ! Mr. Winner there ? " " This is Arthur Winner . " " Well , look : Bernie Breck , Mr. Winner . I 'm here at your of-fice  --  " Astonished an instant , then instantly feeling a heart-fall of apprehension  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winner &; Penrose 's line  --  Arthur Winner said : " Has anything happened to Mr. Tuttle ? " Bernie Breck said : " Oh , no , Mr. Winner ! Sorry if I frightened you  --  nothing like that ; no accident or anything . I just came back here with Mr. Tuttle . But we have something  --  a little trouble  --  he was trying to get you about since four o'clock or so . He was trying all over , before we went out . He 's kind of worried ; so when we got back , he thought he 'd rest in his office a while . So I said I 'd keep trying to get you for him  --  " " Yes , " Arthur Winner said . " " Thanks . But what is the trouble ? " Bernie Breck coughed . I le said : " I guess maybe he should tell you . I do n't know any details . What I have is this warrant issuing on an information before Joe Harbison . Joe called us around half past three ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charging him with this offense , see ? So before I served it , looked for Ralph , I thought I 'd go around to Mr. Tuttle , show it to136him . On account of Miss Detweiler working for him , I mean  --  " " Ralph ? " Arthur Winner said . " What 's he charged with ? " Bernie Breck said delicately : " I do n't know if you want me to say a whole lot over the phone , Mr. Winner . There 's an alleged offense against this girl , see ? Well , that he attacked her . I did n't actually look at the complaint , Mr. Winner  --  " " But I presume the name of whoever signed the complaint 's on the warrant . It is n't Moore  --  M-o-o-r-e , is it ? " " Name 's Veronica Kovacs , " Bernie Breck said . " I happen to know who she is . She 's from Mechanicsville ; but she works at the Elite diner on Water Street . " " You have n't served it yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got him here . " He lowered his voice . " That other name you mentioned ; she 's here , too . What we did was : Mr. Tuttle said right away , could we pick up Ralph and bring him here first , so you could talk to him . So he was trying to get you ; and he could n't . So then he went along with me in the police car , while we looked some places ; but Ralph had gone home , see ? Mr. Tuttle wanted to keep Miss Detweiler from knowing , was the thing . So I found this fellow I knew knew Ralph ; and he said he 'd go and get Ralph to come out , come down the street . So we went and parked out GreenwoodAvenue ; only I do n't know what this boy did ; he must have let something out ; because Miss Detweiler came with him , Ralph . So I had to show them the warrant . And she 's in the other room , with this Miss Moore . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here now  --  " Some muffled noises followed ; and Noah Tuttle said : " Arthur , Arthur  --  " " Bernie 's been telling me , " Arthur Winner said . " I 'll take care of it . What 's Ralph say ? " " He did n't do it , Arthur . He swears he did n't do it . She 's just making it up , he says . Now , she 's not a good girl , Arthur . Bernie says that , too ; he 's heard that  --  " Arthur Winner said : " Do you mean Ralph does n't know her ? " " Yes , he knows her , Arthur . Only , he says he never knew her well ; he was only out with her once . " 137 " When was that ? " " Well , last night , he says . " Noah Tuttle 's voice quavered a little . " He says he offered to give her a lift in his car  --  she was waiting for the Mechanicsville bus . Then they went and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what he should n't have done . But not against her will , Arthur ; she wanted him to ; she led him on , he says . He knows he did wrong ; this girl he 's engaged to , he even told her this morning . " " I see , " Arthur Winner said . " Make sure Ralph understands that he must n't , for any reason , say anything more to anyone else , will you ? And will you ask Bernie if Harbison knows the warrant was served ? " Noah Tuttle said : " Yes , he does , Arthur . I told Bernie to tell him ; tell him I had to wait for you . He said all right  --  What did he say ? Here , you tell Arthur about that  --  what Harbison said . " Bernie Breck 's voice cut in : " Mr. Winner ; Joe said all right , I need n't bring Ralph over until you came . Only , he has the Kovacs girl and her mother on his hands  --  the mother did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make it he 'd like to set a hearing at eight  --  " Arthur Winner said : " Yes . Would you let him know that you 've reached me ; and I 'll appear with Ralph . And may I speak to Mr. Tuttle again ? " Noah Tuttle said : " Arthur ? Arthur ? " " I have n't had anything to eat , " Arthur Winner said . " And I do n't suppose you have . You 'd better all get something ; and I 'll get something . I ought to be down by quarter to eight  --  " Clarissa , approaching with a glass in her hand , said : " Oh , darling  --  no ! " Arthur Winner said : " I think we 'd better meet at Harbison 's . I wo n't need to see Ralph first ; because what I 'll be planning to do is ask Harbison to continue . I 'll want the hearing reported ; and we could n't arrange that tonight . But do n't say anything until I get there . Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't want her by any chance to go home . I want to have a look at her . We 'll get a continuance ; and bail set for Ralph ; and then I 'll hear what he has to say . " 138 " All right , Arthur , " Noah Tuttle said . " All right . I know you 'll do everything . " " How is Helen taking it ? " " Fine , Arthur , " Noah Tuttle said . " Just fine . She knows he did n't do it . And we 'll go over to the justice of the peace ; and you 'll be there . " " I 'll be there , " Arthur Winner said . Clarissa said : " Ralph ? Helen ? " She put the glass in his hand . Raising it , Arthur Winner took a swallow . " The brat is in a jam , " he said . " Appropriately enough , about a girl . They 've arrested him . Noah , quite rightly , thinks he ca n't handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't tell you any more ; because I do n't know any more . " " Darling , " Clarissa said , " should I ask  --  I was n't forgetting !  --  Doctor Trowbridge to say grace right away , then ? "
