Exertion made him gasp for breath , but he did not worry about this until he awoke , usually between 1 and 3 a.m. , terrified because he thought he was suffocating . The next year , these cases got worse , and many became uncontrollable , the patients bordering on collapse . Also , the doctors found that the familiar treatment with Adrenalin did little good at first , and soon became useless . They had found a new disease . <P> The G.I.s called it " Yokohama asthma and were almost right .
