For sheer obfuscation. nothing quite matches the sloganeering of public v. <P> private power partisans in the Pacific Northwest . Pro-public advocates cry that the slightest evidence of private enterprise is a " giveaway " of the natural resources bequeathed " the people ' ' by the Almighty . Pro-private advocates shrill that an inch of dam-building aid from any government source amounts to a mile of " creeping socialism " and a rape of the " American Way . " Under such a bombardment of absolutes , the electorate often loses the real problem : how to get cheaper electric power under specific conditions in specific places by means public , or private , or in any combination thereof . <P> Washington 's Stevens County is one Pacific Northwest community where the issue was presented in specific terms . Last week , after nearly 20 years of both public and private power . Stevens County citizens voted overwhelmingly for private power . Reason : public power rates had become far more expensive than private , and no longer fitted their needs . <P> Second Look . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low-cost rural lines , did most of sparsely settled Stevens County ( pop . 19,500 ) get any electricity at all . The privately owned Washington Water Power Co. , which served a few Stevens County towns , had been unable during the Depression to finance the job . To get even cheaper rates , once the tax-paid lines were built . Stevens County formed a Public Utilities District - one of 23 county government electrification systems in the State of Washington 's 39 counties . <P> With authority under state law . the P.U.D. tried to buy up both federal and private systems . After absorbing the federal lines , it took out a capital-raising loan on them which added $51.000 a year in interest alone to the taxpayers ' debt-and helped erase the P.U.D. 's competitive edge . By 1954. when Washington Water Power 's 2.983 predominantly municipal customers were paying only 1.35 per kwh , the P.U.D. 's 2.300 predominantly rural customers were paying a rate of 2.72 . <P> In 1953 the P.U.D. began legal condemnation proceedings against the private company 's facilities , and many Stevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap " ' public power system . Washington Water Power ( whose 4OO-mile Stevens County lines amount to only 2% of its statewide holdings ) saw a rare chance to dramatize its side of the public v. private issue . It offered to buy the P.U.D. Brushed aside , its case was re-bolstered by a citizens ' petition to put the problem to a popular vote-the first such power election in Northwest history . <P> Heavy Vote . The question on the ballot : " Shall P.U.D. No. i sell all its electrical transmission , distribution and associated properties to the Washington Water Power Co. for $2,905.000 ? " Both sides agreed that if the Washington Water Power Co. failed to muster 60% of the voters , it would sell its Stevens County holdings to the P.U.D. for $3,100,000.
