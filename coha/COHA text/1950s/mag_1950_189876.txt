Though U.S. railroads are badly in need of new , modern coaches and freight cars , their dwindling revenues have forced them to cut back their buying orders . As a result , employment in the railroad car-building industry has fallen from 53,100 in February , 1949 , to a current 27,200 . <P> Alarmed , the C.I.O. Steelworkers union went before a congressional committee last week with a new variation of a familiar theme : let the U.S. Government support the industry , in the interests of national defense . Jack Steiber , union research man , proposed that the Government set a production goal of 160,000 freight cars yearly for the next three years , buy up as a " stockpile " any cars which the railroads themselves did n't want . Snapped the Wall Street Journal : ' If the Government were to go into the freight car owning business , a logical next tep would be the freight car manufactur-ng business . And a third likely move would be toward railroad ownership . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
