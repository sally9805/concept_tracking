Congress , in the person of a subcommittee headed by Louisiana 's F. Edward Hebert , has been investigating U.S. aircraft companies on the suspicion that their profits are too high , their executive salaries too big , and their payrolls loaded with retired generals whose chief job as executives is to get military contracts out of the Pentagon . <P> Most major witnesses-doubtless because they are more engineers than publicists-have done little to disabuse Hebert 's subcommittee of this notion . But last week Boeing Airplane Co. ' s President William Allen , a lawyer with a clear grasp of finance as well as manufacturing , flew into Washington . He was not only armed with a 1-lb. 6-oz. printed statement containing charts and figures , he was also armed with the conviction that the air craft industry , not the government , is being shortchanged . <P> No Cushion . Congress , said Allen , should " not only think about whether we are making too much money , but whether we are making enough , in the light of our responsibilities . " He recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its output to the Government , had lost money before World War II in developing warplanes , such as the B-17 Flying Fortress . Hence , it was forced to go through the war with no profit base as a cushion against excess-profits taxes , had to pay the maximum tax of 90% . <P> When the war ended , Boeing again lost money in the struggle to stay healthy for the next war . " It was essential that we preserve as large a nucleus as possible of that know-how that we had built up , " said Allen . " We preserved that nucleus by commencing construction of 50 Strato-cruisers without any orders . . . We lost money on them . But it kept our organization together . " This organization is now building B-47s and B-52s , backbone of the Strategic Air Command . <P> Boeing 's net profit after taxes in the years 1952-54 was 2% of sales , compared to 7% for the auto industry and 10% for the chemical industry . Allen pointed out that the Vinson-Trammel Act of 1934 , which set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit rate of 12% entirely reasonable on Government contracts . " But when we made two point something percent after taxes , the Renegotiation Board says , ' That is too much . ' Such action is not only shocking and appalling ; it is sickening . " Out of the $50 million earned before taxes in 1952 , Boeing is now being asked to give back $10 million . <P> No Free World ? Allen said that Boeing has " retained approximately 70% of our earnings in order to do a better job . Industry generally retains about 45% . If we had greater earnings , we could pour that money into laboratories , into developing new articles , just as we did with the 707 jet tanker-transport , which has saved the Government precious time and money . " When Hebert argued that the profits Boeing used for research and development was " Government money , 99% , " Allen replied : " Mr. Congressman , I do not consider your salary Government money . I consider it yours . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
