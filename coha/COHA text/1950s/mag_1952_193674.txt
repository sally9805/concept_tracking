High Treason ( J. Arthur Rank ; Pacemaker ) wrings a good deal of bang-up drama from a spy plot in which enemy agents conspire to blow up England 's strategic power plants . The picture is a solo effort of Britain 's talented Director Roy Boulting , who , with his twin brother John , made the taut 1950 thriller Seven Days to Noon , about a demented atom scientist 's attempt to destroy London . <P> Though played on a larger stage , High Treason is not quite so dynamic as Seven Days to Noon . The screenplay sometimes bogs down in low melodrama , and the pace lags now &; then for wordy political digressions . But in Boulting 's camera-wise direction the picture mostly crackles with pseudo-documentary excitement . The spectacular climax , as the saboteurs try to take over massive Battersea power station , was filmed at the actual locale among a futuristic welter of catwalks , dynamos and generating equipment . And Director Boulting gives the fanciful plot a realistic look with the odd British types who get tangled up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nichols as an elegant , subversive M.P. , while Liam Redmond plays a counterespionage commander with an Irish brogue and a taste for Etruscan art . Also on hand : Scotland Yard Supt. Folland ( Andre Morell ) , who saved London from atomic devastation in Seven Days to Noon , here blandly helps rescue all of England from being overthrown by foreign agents .
