Through two empires , four republics , three major wars in 70 years and 14 postwar cabinets , the French have sat in suspicious judgment on their governments . Frequently they have shown their approval or disapproval not only by their ballots but by the way they behave when their government asks for money . They have become Europe 's greatest gold hoarders . Since World War II , weak French governments have flooded the Fourth Republic with fancy-looking banknotes which the public no longer trusts , and which steadily lose value . Result : an estimated $4 billion worth of gold has disappeared from circulation , mostly into the stockings of wary French peasants . <P> To coax this gold out of hiding , Premier Antoine Pinay launched a savings-bond drive . He gave the French a choice between buying his gold-backed bonds or paying increased taxes ( TIME , April 21 ) . Last week the bond drive was over , and Pinay pronounced it a " healthy operation . " French hoarders turned in 34 tons of gold , valued at $42 million . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fresh money , " i.e. , cash and gold not previously invested in bonds . <P> The final $666 million came from investors cannily reconverting other bonds to the new Pinay bonds , which are not only gold-backed but in some cases pay higher interest . The drive was a measured success for France 's commonsensible Premier : though France is not yet out of the woods , it seems to be on the right path . <P> Pinay , in his own quiet way , went on proving that France 's confidence is well placed . Last week , when France 's No. 1 political pressure group , the peasant-farmer bloc , demanded an increase in the price of wheat , he bravely said no . If bread prices rise , he argued , the whole delicate mechanism controlling the cost of living will break down . Price hikes mean wage boosts , and France can afford neither . It was the first time since World War II that a French Premier has faced down the farmers-a rare act of political courage .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
