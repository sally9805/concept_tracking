Christianity has a long prison record . Ever since the days of the Apostle Paul , Christians have been familiar with the barred window and the dungeon cell . And ever since the first Good Friday when the cock crew and Peter wept , Christians have died rather than deny their faith and save their skins . This is the strict code of the Christian prisoner , but what of the compromises in between ? Last week one missionary publicly castigated another for keeping his religion but buying his freedom with falsehoods . <P> <P> In Chungking in November 1950 , Methodist Missionary Francis Olin Stockwell , 52 , from Perry , Okla. , was just sitting down to Sunday supper when the <P> Red China police arrived . He kissed his wife goodbye , gathered up his New Testament , and departed for what he thought would be about five days ' imprisonment . It lasted just under two years . <P> For 14 months Missionary Stockwell was in solitary confinement . He paced the floor , prayed , made up poems , and studied the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him , he denied them . Then he got a brainwashing . <P> He was moved to a small cell with seven other prisoners , all Chinese , where they were forced to discuss every detail of their past lives for hours on end , interspersing the discussions with interminable readings from Communist propaganda material . At intervals , a government official grilled Stockwell on his " crimes " and angrily ordered him back for further reflection when he denied them . Stockwell began to see that what the Communists wanted was not just a confession but a conversion-a new way of looking at the world . He decided to give them what they wanted and win his freedom . <P> A Missionary Spy . It was hard work . Methodist Dr. Stockwell learned to parrot a Marxian view of the news , and to give an interpretation of his missionary life as an act of aggression against the Communist government " . " I admitted , " he later wrote , " that my speaking and writing had made the Chinese friendly to the United States and cool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they meant when they said I was a spy , then I would have to admit that I was a spy , a missionary spy ... " <P> To explain a fake code message that had been mailed in his name , Stockwell fabricated an elaborate cops &; robbers story that implicated no one else within Communist reach . He was even compelled to join in the . attempted conversion of other political prisoners . <P> At last , after 9 months of this , two Red guards shoved him across the border at Hongkong , the last Methodist missionary to leave China ( TIME , Dec. 8 ) . <P> In a book , With God in Red China ( Harper ; $3 ) , and two articles in the Christian Century , Methodist Stockwell described what had happened to him and the choice he had made . In last week 's Christian Century , the Rev. Kenneth J. Foreman Jr. , 31 , a Presbyterian missionary who spent 7 months under house arrest in Kunming , attacked what he called the " sin " of Missionary Stockwell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the Communists kept in solitary confinement for many months but who refused to make any confession of guilt .
