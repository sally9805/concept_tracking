We can anticipate that robots will be fiercely resented , at first , in a society that will see them as the latest -- and an **26;1600;TOOLONG threat to the workers whom they will replace . The men who will seek to alter the status quo will be called " robot lovers " and stoned . But what happens next ? benefactor by ... George H. Smith He clutched at the lever with more force than he 'd intended . It was set for further in the future .... " They 're crazy ! They 're insane ! That mob outside is made up of madmen , " Jacob Clark told his young assistant , Bill Towney . " They 'll be battering at the door any minute now , sir , " Towney said nervously . " But why ? Why are they doing it ? My inventions have advanced the world a hundred years . I 've always been a benefactor of man , not a destroyer . " " It 's the robots . People are in a rage because they say the robots cause unemployment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , " Clark said impatiently . " Why ca n't they see that my intelligent , self-controlled robots are the greatest boon the human race has ever received from one man ? " " I do n't know , sir , but they do n't . " Towney paused as the shouting and pounding outside became more intense . " They demanded that you take the robots out of the labor market and order your factories to stop making them . This is the result of your refusal . " " DOWN WITH CLARK ! DOWN WITH THE TIN MEN ! DEATH TO THE ROBOT LOVERS ! " The furious mob was battering at the door now . " Really , sir , " Towney said , " you should leave here . They 'll kill you if you do n't ! " " Leave here ? I should say not . I 'll defy the fools . I 'll tell them what I 've done for them and make them understand . " He glanced nervously at the door . " Besides there 's only one door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the time machine , sir . " " But is n't there some other way ? Perhaps if you went out and talked to them .... " " You know there 's no other way . Those people believe you 've brought disaster to the human race and they mean to kill you . And if you do n't hurry they will , " Towney said urgently . " The time machine is set for twenty years in the future . Please hurry , sir ! " The door was beginning to give . Clark looked around unhappily and then walked to the time machine . " All right , I 'll go . In the future I know the results of my work will be appreciated . I 'll be a hero and benefactor of mankind . " Towney heard the door crash and roughly pushed his employer into the time machine as the mob burst through . " Push the starting button , push the starting button . Quick ! " he screamed as the first of the mob reached him . Clark 's hand leaped to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hand completed its motion with more force than he had intended as he sank unconscious to the floor and the machine was set for a thousand years in the future instead of twenty . * * * * * The year three thousand had been a brilliant one for the robots , in fact , the most brilliant since the last human being had died some five hundred years before . They had reached Venus and Mars and were now planning a trip to Jupiter . And this very day , a huge statue of Jacob Clark , the creator and benefactor , was to be dedicated on the site of what once had been his laboratory . It seemed a shame that most of the records concerning him and his time had been lost in one of the great wars that had helped to extinguish the humans . The statue though was good for surely he looked like a robot . One of the few human books still in existence said that the Creator had created in his own image . It was right at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Clark . They picked up his unconscious , bleeding body and laid it tenderly on a nearby bench . They bent over him with all the gentleness and solicitude that had been installed in his very first models and had been handed down from generation to generation of robots . They wanted to help him but they were very puzzled . " Perhaps it came from a far part of the earth , " one of them said . " Or maybe a mistake was made at one of the birth factories , " said another . " See , it is losing oil at a great rate . " " Perhaps , " mused the elder , " it is a new model . At any rate it is a robot and has been damaged . As our great creator taught us , he must be aided . We will take it to the central repair factory in the city . " " But , " the first robot protested , " it 's awfully bulky to be carried so far . " Being creatures of logic , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a decision that was both effective and reasonable . " Since he is so bulky , we will disassemble him for transportation purposes , " he said as he leaned over and gently twisted off Clark 's right arm . " Rather primitive and messy construction , I 'd say , " said the second robot as he tenderly unscrewed Jacob Clark 's head from his body .
