txt Young Lords Altrincham and ? Londonderry have been graphically articulate about what they dislike in the way the royal role currently is being played in Britain . To one of them the Buckingham Palace staff of courtiers is too " tweedy , " and the Queen should try to get a little personal opinion into her officially ghost-written speeches . To the other the throne is surrounded by " the social squalor of the upper classes " and the royal family has " deplorable taste in clothes . " But if the brash young lords who have provided Fleet Street with a welcome summer substitute for the Loch Ness Monster ( of happy memory among publishers ) know what they dislike , they are vague about what they would put in its place . * One thinks he wants " a truly classless and commonwealth court . " and the other " a true democratic monarchy . " These are vague recipes , involving contradiction in terms .

They ' dream of the old days when there was a king 's party versus a Parliament party , when there were " king 's men " and the monarch was himself a maker of issues , and there was excitement , danger , and also reward in the service of the throne , There may be as many as a thousand atavistic medievalists in all the British Isles who think they would like to see such a restoration of the old monarchy , with its personal authority and the personal exercise of the ancient and long-lost prerogatives of the throne . No normal or sane Britisher would go along for an instant with any such idea of a true monarchic restoration for the practical reason that the modern affairs of state are far too complex for any one person to resolve . But while few sympathize with the Altrincham-Londonderry methods , manners , and possibly dreams , many are troubled over the problem of how best to adapt the monarchy to modern times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has served Britain well and faithfully in great hours of need . At the present moment the very attention given to the " Alt rincham affair " is superficial evidence of a feeling that the institution , as such , is not so broadly useful right now as at times in the past . The real immediate trouble lies in the fact that the monarchy does not have at the moment any opportunity to exercise a positive role . It has plenty of more passive things to do  --  such as providing an example of a good home life : and plenty of ceremonial functions , such as the laying of cornerstones and appearances at charity garden parties . But right now it is not associated positively with the forward movement . of some broad national purpose , for there is no such purpose .

A A A At the accession of Elizabeth II the main positive role of the monarchy was to symbolize Britain 's ties with the Commonwealth countries and with the United States . But the Commonwealth relationship has become less tangible with the passing postwar years , and the ties with the United States took a severe shock over the Suez crisis . At the moment there is no visible , broad , massive advance toward some brave new chapter in Britain 's destiny . This is a period of adjustment , perplexity , and uncertainty .
