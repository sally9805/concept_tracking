txt As the Senate begins voting on substantive provisions of the civil rights bill a historic point in American history is being reached . This is the first time since Reconstruction days that such a measure is actually being debated , considered and voted on in the upper house with some reasonable attention to its merits and real possibility of passage . Heretofore such legislation has been blocked by filibuster , or threat of filibuster , or by the discouragement of its proponents over the general Southern attitude that anything smacking of " civil rights " legislation for the Negro had to be stopped dead in its tracks . Of course the ultimate fate of the bill will not depend entirely on its merits ; a tremendous amount of politics stemming from the increasing power of the Negro at the ballot box is involved . And the pending measure may not even be adopted in any meaningful form or in any form at all ; it may yet be cut to shreds or rejected entirely . But the fact remains that the blind opposition that used to congeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was mentioned has been obliged through force of circumstances to give way to intelligent and intelligible debate  --  during which the bill actually stands a chance for a good deal of improvement . If the improvements that are envisaged imply some concession to the Southern viewpoint , that is not necessarily bad . It all depends on how far the concessions go . In a country so heterogeneous as ours , and especially on an issue so highly packed with emotion as this one , a certain amount ' of compromise on means and methods is often desirable as long as basic principles are not violated . In our opinion this measure is and ought to be primarily a right-to-vote bill . The civil rights referred to in its title ? " An act to provide means of further securing and protecting the civil rights of persons within the jurisdiction of the United States " ? admittedly do go further than voting rights in the terminology and in the official explanations of the bill . But the basic civil right in this context is the right to vote ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings if necessary , is the basic goal . The right to integrated schooling is undeniable ; but to enforce this right at this time in the way envisaged in Part III of this bill seems to us to be taking too many steps too quickly . Furthermore it would almost certainly result in killing a measure that has at least a. chance of becoming law if limited in substance to the voting provisions . These provisions , reinforcing the constitutional right of every citizen to the ballot , must not be diluted by compromise . These provisions must remain strong , as they are in the original bill , so that if and when it becomes law every Negro in the South will know that in a Federal election his access to the polling place is guaranteed him by the United States Government . If this guarantee is to be meaningful , it must - be enforceable ; and to require jury trial in each instance of contempt would make it unenforceable  - -  as well as to introduce something new in American judicial procedure . Even here there may be room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic principle . There are many other phases of the pending bill that could stand amendment without harm  --  and one of them , an ancient force act , was taken care of by unanimous vote yesterday . Another , which deserves fuller discussion than it has had , would impose fine or imprisonment for public disclosure of information obtained in executive session by the proposed Civil Rights Commission . The existence at this late date of these various kinks in the bill  --  and particularly the very large kink . consisting of Part III that will probably be voted on today ? is no tribute either to the House , which has passed the bill , or to the Administration , which owed the public a considerably fuller explanation than it ever received . But the civil rights bill that comes out of all this can be a major achievement in insuring to Southern Negroes the right to vote , which will unquestionably be the forerunner of further civil rights to come .                 @ @ @ @
