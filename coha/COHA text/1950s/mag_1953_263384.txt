A few months after he had seized power last spring , Cuba 's Dictator Fulgencio Batista magnanimously proclaimed that " free and fair elections " for the presidency would be held in November 1953 . Last week the strong man changed his mind . His government announced that no elections will be held till June 1954 , when a new congress will be chosen . The Congressmen will then decide when Cubans may vote on the presidency .
