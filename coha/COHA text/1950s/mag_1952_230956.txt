History 's mantle sat lightly last week on the shoulders of the cheery-cheeked Frenchman as he sat breakfasting in the garden in his dressing gown , eating honey and yoghurt . Six nations this week crowned him a civilian Mr. Europe . They made him first president of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community ( Schuman Plan ) . The Schuman Plan is rightly named for Foreign Minister Schuman , who alone among Frenchmen had the moral authority to propose it successfully to Europe ( TIME , March 1 , 1948 ) . But it was Jean Monnet who conceived the plan and did the behind-the-scenes selling . <P> Eating in the garden , Monnet described the revolution that he hopes to bring to Europe in words that echoed a deep sense of destiny . " The people of Europe want a change , " he said . " This new Community is a revolution in Europe , perhaps the greatest Europe has known . We are embarked on the liberation of Europe from its past . " <P> Liberation there will be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the creation in Europe of an American-style expanding mass market , clean of petty tariffs . By pooling six nations ' annual coal outputs , totaling 220 million tons , and their steel production of 38 million tons , by freeing labor to meet manpower supply &; demand without passports , by crushing the tight cartels that keep production low and prices high , the Coal-Steel Community could liberate Europeans from ration cards , ersatz clothing , queues and slums . It might also blaze the trail towards a politically united Europe , free of ugly nationalisms , and able to support itself . <P> We Must Create Europe . Dapper Jean Monnet , 63 , a rare hardheaded optimist in a pessimistic Europe , intends all this . " We are not dealing merely with the pooling of coal and steel , " he observed last week . " We are creating a new political reality . " No man is better qualified to do the job of creating , for the " Little Howitzer , " as his friends call him , has the driving power of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he never lets go . " If he were put under an anesthetic , " said a friend last week , " he would still keep repeating ' We 've got to create Europe ' as they wheeled him into the operating room . " <P> In his globe-girdling career , Monnet has sold bonds in Wall Street , peddled French brandy to the fur trappers of Hudson 's Bay , liquidated a Swedish match company , and served in wartime Washington as a British diplomat purchasing arms ( his French passport carried a covering letter written by Winston Churchill ) . <P> Born the son of a French brandy maker in the little town of Cognac , he quit school at 16 , in plenty of time to earn a million dollars by the time he was 40 . During World War I he pooled French and British shipping ; in the Depression he lost his first million , and in the ' 30s he became one of the world 's most active and least-known financial backroom boys . Monnet 's influence on events has often been decisive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large aircraft orders in the U.S. just before World War II that led to the quadrupling of U.S. output , and the production of vital airplane engines that helped win the Battle of Britain . It was his idea for a Franco-British Union that Winston Churchill put forward when France was falling in 1940 . <P>
