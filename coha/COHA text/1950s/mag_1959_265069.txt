Nearly ten years after his death , Mexico 's Jos Clemente Orozco is still one of the world 's most debated artists . Last week San Antonio 's McNay Institute was staging a major retrospective of his art , expressly designed to bear out the catalogue 's contention that " Orozco is the major painter of our time , that he , rather than European painting of the same half-century , is the primary heir and vehicle of the great humanistic tradition of the Renaissance . " <P> Since his major works are murals in Mexico , not even the 51 assembled pictures could give the dimensions of Orozco 's power , bitterness and weight , or of the clumsiness , coarseness and obviousness that make him so controversial . One perceptive critic recently returned from looking at the frescoes has joined Orozco 's most fervent disciples . In his new book , Mexican Journal ( Devin-Adair ; $6 ) , Selden Rodman writes that " if there was any doubt in my mind that Orozco was the great artist of our age , it has vanished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen to prove that the winds of fame blow cold as well as warm . Sample opinions : The late Painter Diego Rivera : " Orozco was the only great artist of the counterrevolution ... He felt no compassion , made no affirmation . Because society disapproved of Hitler , he was for him . " Painter David Siqueiros : " If ten people were in a room and argued for something -anything-Orozco would take the opposite side . His tolerance for fascism stemmed from our adherence to Communism , no more . . . Orozco 's only ' constant ' was his bitter hatred of anything having to do with religion . " Biographer Justino Fernandez : " Orozco is hard on God at the Day of Judgment , because he felt that the punishments meted out to sinful men were too severe . " Dealer Ins Amor : " He hated mankind , if ever a man did . ' All Indians , ' he used to say , ' are ugly . ' Why was he bitter ? Because of his life , his failures , his poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " He had compassion and humanity above all other painters . He was a great mathematician , a great engineer , a great architect . " Painter " Dr. Atl " : " Orozco never did understand how to use color . " AArchitect Juan O'Gorman : " Jos Clemente was incapable of talking rationally or thinking rationally about anything . I often asked him before and after the war why he wore a swastika button in his lapel . He wore it , he told me , because Roosevelt , Churchill and especially Stalin were mankind 's greatest scourges , and because the Jews deserved to be exterminated . " Seora Orozco : " My husband was not only a good man who loved his family and thought of them constantly , but he was always relaxed at home , always serene , irresistibly humorous , and in every way normal . " <P> Genius is not normal , and it stands exposed to every wind that blows . On some winds Orozco scattered seeds of hate ; on others he scattered seeds of love and hope . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they swirl about an artist who was mountainous .
