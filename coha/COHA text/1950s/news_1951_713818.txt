Letters to The Times Aiding Iceland 's Defenses History of Wartime Occupation by United States . Troops Reviewed To THE EDITOR OF THE Nnw YORK TIMES : I was deeply impressed on reading your May 9 editorial , " Iceland Saga , " giving a brief historic r6sume of our military relationship to Iceland since July 1 , 1941 , when the Premier of Iceland consented to the presence of American troops to protect Iceland during the war provided they were withdrawn after the war . Five years later the United States withdrew her troops . The Editor of THE NEW YORK TIMES in referring to the way in which the United States lived up to her agreement states : " We cite these facts as a useful reminder that the freedom and ? sovereignty of Iceland are respected as a matter of course by her larger and stronger democratic friends and neighbors of the Atlantic community . " In view of your enlightened editorial I wish to cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the withdrawal of our troops : On March 21 , 1946 , a Scandinavian correspondent came to see me concerning certain remarks I had made at a dinner given to Daisy Harriman , our Minister to Norway , paying tribute question of when American troops were going to get out of Iceland . I was surprised and said I assumed the Scandinavian countries wanted our troops in Iceland as a protection against Russia . He said , " No , " that Iceland felt the presence of our troops in time of peace infringed on her sovereignty . I then said if Iceland felt that way about it we should get out . In so saying I made it clear that I was speaking off the record and as an individual and in no way as a representative of the United States Government . Unfortunately the Scandinavian newspaper man printed this part of my interview , which was purely incidental , conversational , personal and off the record . As a result Joseph Alsop wrote a story for the May 20 , 1946 , Life Magazine in which he blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to her military base in Iceland . Thereupon various segments of the press began to attack me . One of the leading Washington correspondents stated on June 2 , 1946 , that " Truman , Byrnes and Vandenberg were upset by his Wallace 's recent assertion that the United States ought to take its troops out of Iceland . " Today , five years later , the world situation has changed and Iceland wants to contribute to the security of herself and the free nations by asking our troops back to Iceland . Now when we help her at her own request she will respect and trust us . We earned her confidence when we proved our respect for democratic principles and small nations by pulling out five years ago . I congratulate THE TIMES on giving the essential facts so concisely . I was abused five years ago by many people because I stated off the record and in personal conversation that I believed we should respect the sovereignty of Iceland . It is good to know that THE TIMES stands resolutely on the proposition of respecting the sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respect than Iceland . It is our privilege to respond promptly to her cry for help in 1951 . HENRY A. WALLACE . South Salem , N. Y. , May 11 , 1951 . Overnight Garaging Advocated To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of May 9 on " Parking Meters and Police " is quite in line with your usual interest in finding some solution for this grave problem . Anyone who has seen the way parking meters work in other cities in which they are now operating must look forward with some optimism to their successful operation in New York , given the checks you suggest . However , there is still one phase of the problem you failed to touch upon , and that is overnight street-parking . We should all be concerned about the unfairness involved when the law-abiding citizen pays rent to a garage , and his less civic-minded neighbor parks his car all ' night in the city street gratis . Now is the time to urge that these parking meters be so constructed that a car owner , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to park his car overnight for ten hours or so . There can be no reasonable objection to such a plan , and the revenue to the city would be considerable . Many garage owners assure me that , in spite of the general impression that commercial garages are overcrowded , they can still find space for 20 per cent more cars than they now garage . Forcing overnight street-parkers to pay would also do much to clear the streets at night , since owners of new cars , at least , would prefer to pay the difference for indoor protection . JOHN J. DONOHUE . New York , May 9 , 1951 . Taxing Mutual Savings Banks To THE EDITOR OF Tin New YORK TIMES : The May 7 edition of THE TIMES carried an editorial favoring the continuation of the tax-exemption of mutual savings banks . This position is obviously unfair to the ' taxpayers of this nation who believe that all profitmaking institutions should pay their fair share of the burden otgovermnent before taxes are increased on those who do pay . I take particular exception to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy a tax on the income of these institutions would be to tax these depositors on amounts they do not re ceive and without regard to their ability to pay . " The income tax has always been levied on the income of corporations without regard to stockholders " ability to pay . Making the same true of mutual saw ings banks would no more be taxing " depositors on amounts they do not receive " than does taxing regular come rations levy an income tax on the or phans and widows who own stock oil amounts they do not receive . The Treasury has estimated that the taxation of mutual savings banks would raise $215 millions in additional revenue . During these times of high taxation it is imperative that all who have ability to pay taxes do so . We can not continue to extend special privi ' leges to select segments of our society , at the expense of othersi  --  in this case , the taxpayers who have to pay what the mutual savings banks do not pay , and the taxpaying banks who must compete against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Tax Equality Association . Chicago , May 9 , 1951 . Policy of Fear Seen Training of South Koreans and Use a Chiang 's Forces Advocated To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : , In the midst of the jangling judgments within the current national debate one thing at least has become clear . That is that American foreign policy is being definitely based on fears fear of what the Communists  --  Russian , Chinese , European and all  --  may do ; fear of what the members of the United Nations and the Atlantic Pact will do , or decline to do . Such a policy of fear is bound to be a negative policy , a policy of weary reaction against the initiative of some other , a policy of uncertainty and hesitation , of impulse without coherence . It creates no enthusiasm , it builds no morale , at home or in the field , cements no unity and provides no leadership equal to the demands of the hour and the responsible world position of the United States . Of course there are risks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks of bold and positive action , in accordance with the traditional American spirit , are greater or less than the risks of indecision and timidity , is the point of dispute . Only , time can tell , and even time may refuse a clear verdict . But while the dust of this contention still fills the air , are there not open , beyond the economic blockade , two courses of action which need not shock or even alarm the most cautious ? ( 1 ) Multiply , train and equip the forces of Southern Korea . If the chief defense of Western Europe must rest primarily upon those nations themselves , this is equally true of Asia , whether looking to the immediate need for strengthening the total U. N. forces in Korea or anticipating the day when all forces may be withdrawn and Korea must be ready to stand on its own feet . ( 2 ) Release the China Nationalist forces on Formosa , upon which the United States , anti the United States alone , has placed a ban . The U. N. , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a changed Here is one area in which we can and ought to act alone . This is not at all to commit the United States to an " all-out " war against Red China , to undertake any subjugation of its wide territories , to plan any invasion by American troops which would give the slightest excuse for Soviet intervention . It is simply to give Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his armies freedom , encouragement and some help to do what they can in a civil war which is by no means ended and in which the other party is the openly declared enemy of this country and of the United Nations . If wisdom lies in the old slogan , " Be bold , be bold and everywhere be bold ; but not too bold , " then the rash arid the fearful alike may find ' here a pointer to the true path . ( Bishop ) HERBERT WELCH . New York , May 12 , 1951 . Origin of the Pretzel To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK Tams : THE NEW YORK TIMES of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought it might be of interest to know the story of how the pretzel came to be . My grandfather , a master baker from Germany , related the tale that many long years ago the King ordered a loaf of bread that the sun could shine through three times . The pretzel was the result .
