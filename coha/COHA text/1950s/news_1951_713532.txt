txt WASHINGTON , Jan. 10 ? Secretary of State Dean Acheson said today he was willing to discuss foreign policy with Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio or any other Republican member of Congress . But he added that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had been chosen for talks of that nature . In an apparent effort neither to rebuff nor encourage the Republican policy leader , Mr. Acheson made that observation when asked at his news conference what he thought of Senator Taft 's " offer to help write United States foreign policy . " The Administration , replied the Secretary , had been discussing foreign policy with the people chosen by the Senate and the Republican party to do that . Although the Administration is ready to talk about such matters with any member of the minority party , // there was also the question of following the accepted procedures , Mr. Acheson said . The official channel for such consultation , he pointed out , was the Foreign Relations Committee , and that is the channel the Administration has followed . The Secretary did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft or other Republicans in the near future , as in the past . But asked whether he had any plans for calling the Senate/. in " for a talk on foreign policy matters , " Mr. Acheson said he had nothing specific in mind . Statement by Taft The questions and the Secretary 's comments were provoked by Senator Taft 's statement , made in a luncheon speech at the National Press Club yesterday , that he was " quite prepared to sit down with the President of the United States , or anybody else on the majority side , and try to work out a program which would command the unanimous and consistent support of the people of the United States . " After Secretary Acheson 's remarks had been reported to him , Senator Taft said he had not intended to suggest that he personally , or alone , should sit down with President Truman or Mr. Acheson . The discussions , however , he went on , should be carried on by the elected leaders of the Senate Republicans : he , as chairman of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the General Assembly of Senate Republicans ; and Kenneth S. Wherry , Republican Floor Leader . Moreover , said Mr. Taft , if one member of the Foreign Relations Committee were to take part in the discussions , " then all should . " Deals Mildly With Issue Senator Ernest W.- of Arizona , the new floor leader for the Democrats , indicated , after talks with committee chairmen , that the way the Administration should deal with the Republicans , as well as with the Democrats , was through the existing committees . In this instance , he said , the Foreign Relations Committee was the proper body . Apparently seeking a conciliatory role , Senator said that the Democratic leaders agreed that " we should continue our efforts toward a nonpartisan foreign policy . " It was not only on procedure but also on the substance of foreign policy that Secretary Acheson took issue with Mr. Taft today . But it was only a mild issue , and the Secretary dealt with it mildly . Asked about the Senator 's idea that the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be abandoned , Mr. Acheson remarked that that was one way to describe any international forum where issues are discussed . It can be described in a favorable way or in an unfavorable way , he added . Mr. Acheson acknowledged that the prestige and power of the United Nations is damaged whenever it gets a problem it is unable to solve , such as that presented by Communist China 's aggression . At present , Mr. Acheson continued , this Government is consulting with other members of the United Nations to consider what next step should be taken against the Chinese Communists . He said that certain of these other members favored another attempt to convince the Chinese Communists that ' the United Nations seeks a peaceful settlement . This Government is somewhat pessimistic about what the Chinese Communist response to this new approach would be , Mr. Acheson said , but at the same time the United States wants it clear to everyone that it is leaving no stone unturned to find a peaceful settlement , if such can be found . The Secretary also told reporters that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint reply to the Russian proposal for a Big Four conference on Germany . He forecast that the reply would be made in the near future .
