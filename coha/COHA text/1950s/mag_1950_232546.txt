In a penthouse political conference in Kansas City 's Muehlebach Hotel last December , Harry Truman decided , and shortly proclaimed for all to hear , that Emery Allison would make a wonderful U.S. Senator for the state of Missouri . <P> The common reaction among many Missouri Democrats was to ask : Who is Emery Allison ? He turned out to be an Ozark country lawyer , a Baptist , Mason and Legionnaire , and the plodding , cigar-smoking , 56-year-old president pro tem of the Missouri state senate . He was also the great &; good friend of Jim Pendergast , who , like his father before him , is the great &; good friend of Harry Truman . <P> In succeeding months , as Harry Truman popped in &; out of the state clapping Em Allison encouragingly on the back , the Democratic Party bucked and groaned like a plow that had hit a patch of Ozark hardscrabble . Most Democrats thought that Thomas C. Hennings Jr. , a hearty St. Louis attorney who had earned a substantial reputation as a U.S. Congressman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were committed to him . <P> The state C.I.O. pulled itself together and came out for Allison , declaring that it guessed the President " ought to have the chance to vote for the man of his choice . " Hennings countered that the right of free primaries was at stake , and pointed to his liberal record as a Congressman ( A.F.L. President William Green told his unionists : " I can say he was your friend " ) . Governor Forrest Smith and St. Louis ' Mayor Joseph Darst decided to stick with Harry Truman . " I ai n't going to bite the hand that feeds me , " said Joe . <P> Exhorted , harangued and warned that a Hennings victory would be advertised as a repudiation of the President of the U.S. , Missouri Democrats weighed Truman 's man Allison . Last week , in a close race , they defeated him . <P> But Truman 's rebuff was possibly the Democrats ' gain-Hennings looked like a better campaigner than Allison against the Republicans ' Senator Forrest Donnell , an earnest , hair-splitting legalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Big Itch " ) , but a cracker-barrel , Bible-quoting spellbinder along Missouri 's back roads .
