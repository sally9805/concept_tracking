To the white-supremacy neighbors just over the border in South Africa , he was " just another Kaffir returning to his kraal . " To British officialdom , according to solemn agreement , he was a private citizen of Bechuanaland , with all the rights thereof , permitted to return at last to his homeland . But to a hundred thousand Ba-mangwato tribesmen whose kraals spread over 40,000 sq . mi. of Bechuanaland , Seretse Khama , 34 , was still the chief . Last week , as a charter aircraft flew Seretse back from six years ' exile in Britain , the Bamangwato , with their wives and children , crowded the airport at Francistown by the thousands . Many had trekked for days through the parched African bush to be there in time for his arrival . " Our chief is home again ! " they screamed as the aircraft touched down and the returning exile emerged to greet his Uncle Tshekedi , whose complaints about Seretse 's marriage to a white woman ( still in London but soon to join her husband ) had sparked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter his pledge to Britain to behave as a private citizen , Oxford-educated Seretse did nothing to encourage the welcoming demonstration . But he had no need to . Women swarmed to kiss the hood of his car . Men flung themselves in the dusty road before it or clambered on its fenders to cheer their chief . All along the hot , dusty , 140-mile drive to Serowe , the roads were lined with cheering , weeping Bamangwato , and the capital itself was thronged with tribesmen who had waited since dawn without food or water to shout their welcome . Even Seretse 's own attempts to halt the cheering and speak a word of thanks were futile . " Seretse ! Seretse ! Seretse ! " cried his former subjects , and the ex-chief could only smile back helplessly . <P> In dusty Bechuanaland the greatest blessing of all is rain , and for months of drought the tribesmen had prophesied , " Seretse will bring rain . " Suddenly , amid the cries of welcome last week , torrents of sweet rain fell on the parched thirstland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects .
