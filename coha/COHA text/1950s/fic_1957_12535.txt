Sunset . Two roadmenders and a boy put down their shovels and collect around a small bush fire . The men pass a bottle of white rum around . The boy , Annelles , whistles , then begins a dance , as one of the men plays on a bamboo flute , and the other on a goatskin tambour , some native song . ROADMENDER I Lasse danser garcon ! ( Stop dancing boy . ) ROADMENDER II Mais chantez un conte ! ( But sing us a story . ) ROADMENDER I Passez bouteille-la ! ( Please pass the bottle . ) ROADMENDER II Aille prend guitar-ous !

The boy sits near the fire , the men drinking solemnly , the firelight dancing on their faces . The flute takes up the melody as the dawn breaks behind the backs of the men listening , to disclose the green hills of the windy eastern coast , near Dennery . The thatched roofs of the settlement of Aux Lyons showing through wild trees to the left , and on the facing slope , those of Calmitte , both settlements divided by the fertile gully of a noisy rivulet . Between the sudden forking of these ridges , is the haze of distant sea . As light fills the valley , it discloses , right , a thatched hut , set on a rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a wind-twisted thorn tree . To the sound of the flute a woman , en deuille , in widow black , comes down the shortcut from Calmitte , a dried gourd in her hand . And up from the river , a younger woman , in madras and foulard , singing . p. 4 ANNELLES Messieurs , crik , crak .

In the gens Victorin did have the head-chief , Victorin , his two daughter , Helene and Ione , Achille , son of Gabron , husband of Helene , and the old woman , my grandmother , Theresine , who alone in the world could see wind . That woman coming down from Calmitte now for water is Ione , en deuille , mourning her dead husband one year gone , and that one coming from the river where she spend the night doing you know what , is Helene , her sister .

Then I hear sounds , like a woman , who laughing The low noise like a river , tickled under the ferns , I had so much fever , and my heart , it was dry , And my eyes wet with fever , and a strange sentiment . I pick up that cutlass , and walk to the door , And my eyes full of water , the door was half-open , And I can not see nothing , in the blue dusk of the chamber , Until there , on the bed where we first make the child , Was a naked man , and a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing outside the door .

Not saying a word , and I chop him down first , Arm then next arm , like a man chop woodtree , And he crying nothing , fall down in a fountain , Sprinkling my clothes , and cooling my fever . Helene run out screaming , and pick up the child , I jump over the red pool , bawling like a madman , And there in the hot yard , under the pear tree , Was the naked woman , holding the baby . I say in my head , How can I know , if this child is my son . Then , if she had beg , or cry like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was Victorin hatred , I hit at the child , and his blood splashed the leaves , And then when it scream , I get sick , and fall down , And lie down on the ground , and the red small dew Of the death of my son , falling into my hair . . .

BEGGAR She knows what must happen , but she can not stop it . It is not her fault . She is suffering for us all . p. 43 THERESINE I would rather die now , but there is more to come , Here come the people of the tribe of Victorin , O if I could only stop the stupidity of men , But I am an old woman .

The news will come down to our enemies on the sand , To the calm men fishing under the almond leaves , And what they will think ? Not a child has been butchered , But that Diogene , laughing Diogene , who never hurt flies , Is chopped like a pig by the rage of Achille . And the first cry of the idiot will not be peace , But revenge . . . I know , brave Achille , you need your revenge . All my life I have taught you nothing but hatred , Hatred and fighting , but the graves are always ready , And there can not be enough peace anywhere in the world , Will you listen to me , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions to hold you . p. 45 ACHILLE Ha , try and order them , shadow of a king .

ACHILLE I do not know , where your daughter is , Victorin . But if I find her . . . . ( Ione appears with a cutlass ) IONE She is weeping in my house . Over the dead child , The innocent child that did no one nothing . ACHILLE For the dead child , or for stiff Diogene ? IONE For both then , and why not ? He was more of a man , Though he was just past a boy . He was more of a man than you will ever be . VICTORIN She can not stay here . As long as she stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own daughter , Ione , but she must go . ACHILLE You two are the same , the blood of the Victorins Carry its own sickness , too much pride , never wrong .

IONE No man here will touch her . Father , papa , tell him to listen , Command him . VICTORIN I can not command him , In my old age I must turn towards peace , Watch the white foam raging , with idle hands , Since it was my rage that begin this contention , And my hatred that teach Achille this butchery , I tell you it is I who killed my grandson . IONE Do not be a fool in front of your people . ACHILLE There , mi , your own daughter call you a fool . VICTORIN I start this division over this country , I divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now I must pay for the hatred I begin . IONE Well she is where you can not touch her . ACHILLE Get out of my way , you sister of a whore ! THE MEN Give him room , give him room , make room for him . IONE I will chop down the first man that passes this stone . It is easier to kill a big man than a child , Or perhaps this one here , does not think so . I tell you I spit on the courage of you men , You beasts on two feet , boasters , broken by The love of one woman for another of your kind . If he is your friend , drag him away from me. p. 47 ACHILLE Jamette ! VICTORIN Children , my children . . . ACHILLE Jamette Victorin ! Let me pass now . . .

And after that , after the wake of my son , I will think , if I want , of what is enough . Send Ione for her now . VICTORIN You are a hard brother , with a heart like logwood , Tell your sister get ready , my last daughter , Ione , Ask the women to unshelter her , she must leave the land .

For this man I admired , this brother of iron , has a heart that has turned into a baby 's pap . Do you know tenderness , you who talk about it ? Can you understand , you legitimate , the hardness of tenderness ? I have taken a thorn from your foot when you was small , and I cried when you did not . You taught me that compassion .
