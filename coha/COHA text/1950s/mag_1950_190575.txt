A GENERATION ON TRIAL , U.S.A. v. ALGER Hiss ( 342 pp. ) - Alistair Cooke - Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Like most important U.S. trials , the case of the United States v. Alger Hiss was so fully reported that many surfeited newspaper readers still wonder just what went on in the courtroom . The most convenient and agreeable way to find out is to read A Generation on Trial by Alistair Cooke , brilliant U.S. correspondent of England 's Manchester Guardian , himself a U.S. citizen since 1941 . <P> Cooke has made no effort to go behind the trial evidence or to probe into the personal histories of Hiss and Whittaker Chambers . Using only the court records and documents , and the evidence of his own eyes &; ears as a reporter of the trials , Author Cooke has succeeded in the difficult twin task of fairly boiling down the thousands of pages of testimony while vividly restoring the sometimes dramatic , often boring , courtroom scene . Cooke never forgets that he has set out to be a reporter and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader some of the tension that must have gripped the jury . <P> Yet if Cooke is laudably fair as a reporter , the title of his book is a misnomer - one that his introduction labors unsuccessfully to justify . He concedes that " though the count was perjury , the implied charge against Alger Hiss was espionage . " At the same time , he works overtime to imply that Hiss 's whole generation should now be saying to itself , there but for the grace of God go I. <P> Good reporter though he is , Cooke chooses to forget how few Americans were Communists even in the hungry ' 30s . Nor does he ever point up clearly the important difference between U.S. intellectuals who flirted with Marxism , and Communists who were committed to treason . His notion that the anti-Fascist climate of the ' 30s somehow establishes the need for present sympathy with traitors is charity gone wild and mars a fine journalistic performance . <P> On the trials themselves , Generation is a model of balance and lucidity . The tangled evidence is unraveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal verbiage that obscures them . What is almost as remarkable as Cooke 's overall performance is his knack for indicating the worth of each piece of evidence as it came before the jury . Inevitably it becomes clear that the incriminating typewriter and the stolen State Department documents must doom the defendant . In the two trials , 20 of the 24 jurymen believed Chambers . Writes Cooke : " The verdict in the second trial galvanized the country into a bitter realization of the native American types who might well be dedicated to betrayal from within . " <P> Quite apart from the importance of its subject , Generation is remarkably good reading . Every courtroom character from the principals to the least consequential witness comes sharply alive : <P> Judge Kaufman " darted in , flushed and lively-eyed . He was a small neat man with a sort of Disney apprehensiveness . His big black bow tie came over the top of the bench and he squatted like a meditative black rabbit . " <P> Judge Goddard : " ... a magnificent old American bald eagle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curving quizzical eyes , an imperial hook of nose , and a huge clapper of a mouth . "
