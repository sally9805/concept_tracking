IT was 11:30 a.m. on the Eastern Seaboard-the hour of shopping at the supermarket or of getting ready for a business lunch-when word flashed from Rome that a new Pope had been chosen . It was 9:07 a.m. on the West Coast-time to make breakfast or to drive to work-when the flickering radio signal carried the voice of Cardinal Canali announcing , in his soft , Italianate Latin : " Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum-habemus papam . " The press , whose attention for days had been focused on the smoke signals from the Sistine Chapel , promptly provided both great clouds and small wisps of facts about the man who would henceforth be known as John XXIII . TIME 'S task was to organize the mass of facts-which reached the U.S. haphazardly morning and night for a week-into a coherent , intelligible story . TIME 'S cover story on the new Pope strives to 1 ) give a complete account of the man 's life , personality and accomplishments ; 2 ) explain the circumstances of his election ; 3 ) state the problems he faces against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I Choose John . . . " <P> <P> TIME Cover Artist Boris Chaliapin set something of a speed record with his portrait of John XXIII . He began painting the minute he heard the news , worked through the night , finished the next morning , in good time for the picture to be flown from his Connecticut studio to the engraving and printing plant in Chicago . <P> <P> WITH its own kind of mathematics and a menagerie of strange-looking symbols , the young science of genetics was for years no more meaningful to the general public than the cuneiform inscriptions of ancient Babylonia . Hiroshima changed that . The possible genetic effects of radioactive fallout-monstrous malformations of the human form brought about by exposure of human genes to radioactivity-were easily , and chillingly , imaginable . Genetics became a matter of immediate concern to all men . Last summer TIME 'S editors explored this mysterious area at the root of life in a cover story on Geneticist George Wells Beadle of Caltech ( TIME , July 14 ) . Last week the Nobel Prize committee chose Coverman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's award for Medicine ( see SCIENCE ) . The other half of the award went to Dr. Joshua Lederberg , 33 , whom TIME 'S story singled out as " probably the world 's greatest young geneticist . " <P> <P> EARLY descriptions of radioactive fallout 's effect on future generations were subject to exaggeration . Now , an M.I.T. study shows that the human capacity to absorb radium may exceed the previous medical estimates by as much as 25 times .
