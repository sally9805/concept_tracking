In the Milwaukee Journal : <P> YALE TO ADMIT BRIGHT PUPILS* <P> Shake-Up at Collier 's <P> To his office high above Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue , President Paul Smith of Crowell-Collier Publishing Co. last week summoned Roger Dakin , editor for the past three years of the company 's most important , and sickest , magazine , Collier 's . Smith had bad news for Dakin : he was fired . The same afternoon , Dakin was out of the office and his $25,000-a-year job . But the parting was amiable enough . " Roger just did n't seem to get my message , " said President Smith . " If I knew exactly what Paul 's message was , " answered Dakin , " I guess I 'd still be there . " Into Dakin 's place went Kenneth McArdle , 44 , who takes on the new title of executive editor . McArdle was an editorial writer when Smith was editor of the San Francisco Chronicle , has been Smith 's special assistant on Collier 's for the past year . <P> Actually , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such Smith fog as " I want a magazine with scope , not scoop , " he had one simple objective : to try to put the company on its feet . When Smith was named president more than a year ago , he knew he had a hard job ahead of him . ( Collier 's had just taken a drastic step to save itself by changing from a weekly to a biweekly . ) But it was harder than he expected . Less than a month after he took over , he found that Crowell-Collier , once one of the richest U.S. publishers ( Collier 's , Woman 's Home Companion , American , books ) , did not have enough cash to meet its payroll or pay its current bills . Smith borrowed $3,500,000 from banks , named himself editor in chief of all three magazines , streamlined the corporate control , started a reorganization of the staff ( TIME , July 19 ) . <P> The cost-cutting reduced Crowell-Collier 's loss last year to $2,400,000 , v. a $4,000,000 loss in 1953 . Crowell-Collier 's profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Home Companion have skirted in and out of the black , but both made money in the first four months of this year . Collier 's , whose circulation guarantee is at an alltime high ( 3,700,000 ) , is down 10% in ad pages this year , though its overall revenue is up 10% , thanks to a boost in ad rates . Smith 's economies and small improvements in the position of the magazines have staved off disaster , though they have not yet put the magazines-especially Collier's-on a firm footing . <P> Instead of cutting costs more , Smith would like to spend more money to improve the magazines , even if it means sending up the losses . But he thinks the overall effect on advertisers would be unfavorable . Said he : " In 1954 my problem was that I had no cash . In 1955 I have the cash , but I must show the advertisers that out of what we have , we have produced financial stability .
