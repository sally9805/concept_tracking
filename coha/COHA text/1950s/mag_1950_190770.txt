( See Cover ) <P> One day last June , when the North Koreans were pouring down from the 38th parallel , Douglas MacArthur 's hard-pressed Chief of Staff rammed through a phone call from Tokyo to Seoul . <P> Major General Edward Mallory Almond was impatient to hear the latest battlefront news from U.S. military adviser Colonel Sterling Wright . A near-hysterical Korean operator broke into the call . " Oh , save us , save us , General Almond , " she wailed . Tart-tongued in moments of exasperation , the Chief of Staff answered : " What in the hell do you think we 're trying to do ? Whose planes do you think were flying over Seoul today ? " <P> Under MacArthur , few commanders played a more important role than " Ned " Almond in saving Korea from Red aggression . The war was hardly a fortnight old and the U.N . forces were still beating a dismal retreat , when the Chief of Staff was told to start thinking of an end run around the enemy 's line . Inchon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its treacherous tide and seawall . " Who 's going to command the landing force ? " asked the Chief of Staff . " You are , " said MacArthur . <P> Military handbooks allow 160 days for readying a landing of such magnitude . Beginning Aug. 16th , Almond drafted the plans for the Inchon landing by the 28th , had his X Corps ( the U.S. 1st Marine and 7th Infantry Divisions plus South Korean units ) on the sea and moving to the target by Sept. 10 , went ashore on the 15th , secured the Inchon-Seoul-Kimpo area and completed his mission by October 7th-two weeks ahead of schedule and a total of 53 days from start to finish of brilliantly executed Operation Chromite . <P> Battle Ready . Last week U.N . forces in Korea were smashing ahead ( see above ) toward their next objective : a quick finish to the war . <P> In ordinary fatigue uniform and cap , with a .38-caliber revolver at his side and an old leather map case under his arm , trim , greying General Almond spent the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops . He inspected the marines in their staging area , chatted with a hundred leathernecks ( " What 's your name ? Where 's your home ? How long have you been in the service ? " ) , found one who did n't know his rifle number and chided him ( it 's a military notion that a soldier who knows his rifle number will treat the weapon as a friend and never cast it aside ) . <P> He paid homage at a hillside cemetery where lie Americans and Koreans killed in the Inchon campaign . He was host at a dinner for Marine regimental commanders , giving weatherbeaten Colonel Lewis ( " Chesty " ) Puller of the 1st Marine Regiment the place of honor . On the Inchon waterfront Almond saw tanks loaded aboard LSTs . He flew in a Piper Cub 200 miles south to inspect the 7th Infantry Division in another staging area ; he watched the doughfeet , stripped to the waist in the warm South Korean sun , maneuver through combat exercises in paddy fields and up hillsides .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
