 | SCIENCE HAS SPOILED MY SUPPER 1 I AM a fan for Science . My education is scientific and I have , in one field , contributed a monograph to a scientific journal . Science , to my mind , is applied honesty , the one reliable means we have to find out truth . That is why , when error is committed in the name of Science , I feel the way a man would if his favorite uncle had taken to drink . Over the years , I have come to feel that way about what science has done to food . I agree that America can set as good a table as any nation in the world . I agree that our food is nutritious and that the diet of most of us is well-balanced . What America eats is handsomely packaged ; it is usually clean and pure ; it is excellently preserved . The only trouble with it is this : year by year it grows less good to eat . It appeals increasingly to the eye . But who eats with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid . For quite a long time I thought that observation was merely another index of advancing age . But some years ago I married a girl whose mother is an expert cook of the kind called " old-fashioned . " This gifted woman 's daughter ( my wife ) was taught her mother 's venerable skills . The mother lives in the country and still plants an old-fashioned garden . She still buys dairy products from the neighbors and , in so far as possible , she uses the same materials her mother and grandmother did ? to prepare meals that are superior . They are just as good , in this Year of Grace , as I recall them from my courtship . After eating for a while at the table of my mother-in-law , it is sad to go back to eating with my friends ? even the alleged " good cooks " among them . And it is a gruesome experience to have meals at the best big-city restaurants . Take cheese , for instance . Here and there , in big cities , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one can buy at least some of the first-rate cheeses that we used to eat ? such as those we had with pie and in macaroni . The latter were sharp but not too sharp . They were a little crumbly . We called them American cheeses , or even rat cheese ; actually , they were Cheddars . Long ago , this cheese began to be supplanted by a material called " cheese foods . " Some cheese foods and " processed " cheese are fairly edible ; but not one comes within miles of the old kinds ? for flavor . A grocer used to be very fussy about his cheese . Cheddar was made and sold by hundreds of little factories . Representatives of the factories had particular customers , and cheese was prepared by hand to suit the grocers , who knew precisely what their patrons wanted in rat cheese , pie cheese , American and other cheeses . Some liked them sharper ; some liked them yellower ; some liked anise seeds in cheese , or caraway . What happened ? Science ? or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't ship well enough . They crumbled , became moldy , dried out . " Scientific " tests disclosed that a great majority of the people will buy a less-goodtasting cheese if that 's all they can get . " Scientific marketing " then took effect . Its motto is " Give the people the least quality they 'll stand for . " In food , as in many other things , the " scientific marketers " regard quality as secondary so long as they can sell most persons anyhow ; what they are after is " durability " or " shippability . " It is not possible to make the very best cheese in vast quantities at a low average cost . " Scientific sampling " got in its statistically nasty work . It was found that the largest number of people will buy something that is bland and rather tasteless . Those who prefer a product of a pronounced and individualistic flavor have a variety of preferences . Nobody is altogether pleased by bland foodstuff , in other words ; but nobody is very violently put off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found for  | turning out zillions of packages of something that will " do " for nearly all and is n't even imagined to be superlatively good by a single soul ! Economics entered . It is possible to turn out in quantity a bland , impersonal , practically imperishable substance more or less resembling , say , cheese ? at lower cost than cheese . Chain groceries shut out the independent stores and " standardization " became a principal means of cutting costs . Imitations also came into the cheese business . There are American duplications of most of the celebrated European cheeses , mass-produced and cheaper by far than the imports . They would cause European food-lovers to gag or guffaw ? but generally the imitations are all that 's available in the supermarkets . People buy them and eat them . Perhaps you do n't like cheese ? so the fact that decent cheese is hardly ever served in America any more , or used in cooking , does n't matter to you . Well , take bread . There has been ( and still is ) something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few years , a few big bakeries have taken to making a fairly good imitation of real bread . It costs much more than what is nowadays called bread , but it is edible . Most persons , however , now eat as " bread " a substance so full of chemicals and so barren of cereals that it approaches a synthetic . Most bakers are interested mainly in how a loaf of bread looks . They are concerned with how little stuff they can put in it to get how much money . They are deeply interested in using chemicals that will keep bread from molding , make it seem " fresh " for the longest possible time , and so render it marketable and shippable . They have been at this monkey-shine for a generation . Today a loaf of " bread " looks deceptively real ; but it is made from heaven knows what and it resembles , as food , a solidified bubble bath . Some months ago I bought a loaf of the stuff and , experimentally , began pressing it together , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole loaf to a length of about one inch ! Yesterday , at the home of my mother-in-law , I ate with country-churned butter and home-canned wild strawberry jam several slices of actual bread , the same thing we used to have every day at home . People who have eaten actual bread will know what I mean . They will know that the material commonly called bread is not even related to real bread , except in name . 2 For years , I could n't figure out what had happened to vegetables . I knew , of course , that most vegetables , to be enjoyed in their full deliciousness , must be picked fresh and cooked at once . I knew that vegetables can not be overcooked and remain even edible , in the best sense . They can not stand on the stove . That set of facts makes it impossible , of course , for any American restaurant ? or , indeed , any city-dweller separated from supply by more than a few hours ? to have decent fresh vegetables . The Parisians manage by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' carts to market , where no middleman or marketman delays produce on its way to the pot . Our vegetables , however , come to us through a long chain of command . There are merchants of several sorts wholesalers before the retailers , commission men , and so on ? with the result that what were once edible products become , in transit , mere wilted leaves and withered tubers . Homes and restaurants do what they can with this stuff ? which my mother-in-law would discard on the spot . I have long thought that the famed blindfold test for cigarettes should be applied to city vegetables . For I am sure that if you pureed them and ate them blindfolded , you could n't tell the beans from the peas , the turnips from the squash , the Brussels sprouts from the broccoli . It is only lately that I have found how much science has had to do with this reduction of noble victuals to pottage . Here the science of genetics is involved . Agronomists and the like have taken to breeding all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful and often is insane . For the scientists have not as a rule taken any interest whatsoever in the taste of the things they 've tampered with ! What they 've done is to develop " improved " strains of things for every purpose but eating . They work out , say , peas that will ripen all at once . The farmer can then harvest his peas and thresh them and be done with them . It is extremely profitable because it is efficient . What matter if such peas taste like boiled paper wads ? Geneticists have gone crazy over such " opportunities . " They 've developed string beans that are straight instead of curved , and all one length . This makes them easier to pack in cans , even if , when eating them , you ca n't tell them from tender string . Ripening time and identity of size and shape are , nowadays , more important in carrots than the fact that they taste like carrots . Personally , I do n't care if they hybridize onions till they are as big as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in doing so , they are producing onions that only vaguely and feebly remind you of onions . We are getting some varieties , in fact , that have less flavor than the water off last week 's leeks . Yet , if people do n't eat onions because they taste like onions , what in the name of Luther Burbank do they eat them for ? The women 's magazines are about one third dedicated to clothes , one third to mild comment on sex , and the other third to recipes and pictures of handsome salads , desserts , and main courses . " Institutes " exist to experiment and tell housewives how to cook attractive meals and how to turn leftovers  | into works of art . The food thus pictured looks like famous paintings of still life . The only trouble is it 's tasteless . It leaves appetite unquenched and merely serves to stave off famine . 1 wondet if this blandness of our diet does n't explain why so many of us are overweight and even dangerously so . When things had flavor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it satisfied us . A teaspoonful of my mother-in-law 's wild strawberry jam will not just provide a gastronome 's ecstasy : it will entirely satisfy your jam desire . But , of the average tinned or glass-packed strawberry jam , you need half a cupful to get the idea of what you 're eating . A slice of my mother-in-law 's apple pie will satiate you far better than a whole bakery pie . That thought is worthy of investigation ? of genuine scientific investigation . It is merely a hypothesis , so far , and my own . But people t --  and their ancestors ? have been eating according to flavor for upwards of a billion years . The need to satisfy the sense of taste may be innate and important . When food is merely a pretty cascade of viands , with the texture of boiled cardboard and the flavor of library paste , it may be the instinct of genus homo to go on eating in the unconscious hope of finally satisfying the ageless craving of the frustrated taste buds . In the days when good-tasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't such a national curse . Bow can you feel you 've eaten if you have n't tasted , and fully enjoyed tasting ? Why ( since science is ever so ready to answer the beck and call of mankind ) do n't people who want to reduce merely give up eating and get the nourishment they must have in measured doses shot into their arms at hospitals ? One ready answer to that . question suggests that my theory of overeating is sound : people like to taste ! In eating , they try to satisfy that like . The scientific war against deliciousness has been stepped up enormously in the last decade . Some infernal genius found a way to make biscuit batter keep . Housewives began to buy this premixed stuff . It saved work , of course . But any normally intelligent person can learn , in a short period , how to prepare superb baking powder biscuits . I can make better biscuits , myself , than can be made from patent batters . Yet soon after this fiasco became an American staple , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breads , pastries , rolls , and the like could be mass-manufactured , frozen ? and sold for polishing off in the home oven . None of these two-stage creations is as good as even a fair sample of the thing it imitates . A man of taste , who had eaten one of my wife 's cinnamon buns , might use the premixed sort to throw at starlings ? but not to eat ! Cake mixes , too , come ready-prepared ? like cement and not much better-tasting compared with true cake . 11 : is , however , " deep-freezing " that has really 47 rung down the curtain on American cookery . Nothing is improved by the process . I have yet to taste a deep-frozen victual that measures up , in flavor , to the fresh , unfrosted original . And most foods , cooked or uncooked , are destroyed in the deep freeze for all people of sense and sensibility . Vegetables with crisp and crackling texture emerge as mush , slippery and stringy as hair nets simmered in Vaseline . The essential oils that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fusion in freezers . Anyhow , they vanish . Some meats turn to leather . Others to wood pulp . Everything , pretty much , tastes like the mosses of tundra , dug up in midwinter . Even the appearance changes , oftentimes . Handsome comestibles you put down in the summer come out looking very much like the corpses of woolly mammoths recovered from the last Ice Age . Of course , all this scientific " food handling " tends to save money . It certainly preserves food longer . It reduces work at home . But these facts , and especially the last , imply that the first purpose of living is to avoid work ? at home , anyhow . Without thinking , we are making an important confession about ourselves as a nation . We are abandoning quality ? even , to some extent , the quality of people . The " best " is becoming too good for us . We are suckling ourselves on machine-made mediocrity . It is bad for our souls , our minds , and our digestion . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hogs : as much as possible and as fast as possible , with no standard of quality . The Germans say , " Mann ist was er isst Man is what he eats . " If this be true , the people of the U.S.A. are well on their way to becoming a faceless mob of mediocrities , of robots . And if we apply to other attributes the criteria we apply these clays to appetite , that is what would happen ! We would not want bright children any more ; we 'd merely want them to look bright ? and get through school fast . We would n't be interested in beautiful women ? just a good paint job . And we 'd be opposed to the most precious quality of man : his individuality , his differentness from the mob . There are some people ? sociologists and psychologists among them ? who say that is exactly what we Americans are doing , are becoming . Mass man , they say , is on the increase . Conformity , standardization , similarity ? all on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of colorful liberty and dignified individualism . If this is so , the process may well begin , like most human behavior , in the home ? in those homes where a good meal has been replaced by **26;814;TOOLONG . By something not very good to eat , prepared by a mother without very much to do , for a family that does n't feel it amounts to much anyhow . I call , here , for rebellion . @#
