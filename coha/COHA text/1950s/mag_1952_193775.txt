The Democrats were resolved to make this a businesslike , no-nonsense sort of convention , and on the first day they succeeded . The first session started half an hour behind schedule ( despite a promise that sessions would begin only 15 minutes late ) , but things moved ahead snappily . <P> The assembly felt its first political thrill when Governor Adlai Stevenson made his brisk speech . Next speaker was Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois . Instead of generalities , which are customary for a convention 's first day , Douglas chose to speak on a very specific issue , and one that was obviously worrying the Democrats : Korea . <P> To his prepared text , onetime Professor Douglas appended a page of footnotes , and from time to time he referred to a large map of Asia behind him . But it was an all-out political speech , a more or less skillful attempt to whitewash the Administration 's Asia policy . <P> Douglas cited the standard reasons why it would be dangerous to do anything beyond what the U.S. is doing now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children by ... bombing beyond the Yalu , and the Communists would use this fact as a powerful propaganda weapon . " <P> The speech showed signs of the wishful thinking which has characterized the State Department 's policy . Joe Stalin might die soon ( " If it should please the Lord to take him from us , we would be resigned to his loss " ) , and then everything would be better . <P> As for the Administration 's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Korea in 1949 , and Dean Acheson 's 1950 statement that the U.S. could not guarantee Korea against attack , Douglas quoted a Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum suggesting that the U.S. could well use its Korea-based troops elsewhere . " Now who do you suppose was the Chief of Staff of the Army when this military advice was given ? " asked Douglas , theatrically cupping his ears and leaning over the rostrum , as if to listen for an answer . " It was Dwight D. Eisenhower ! " And who did the delegates think made the U.S. proposal before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again the ear business , again the triumphant answer : " John Foster Dulles ! " * <P> The delegates seemed bored by Douglas ' speech , milled through the aisles saying hello to friends , or read newspapers . <P> Make Believe ? It was the same hall , now familiar to millions of TViewers , but the Democratic stage designers had done their best to make it look different . The picture of Lincoln had disappeared ; there was Harry Truman now , in the august company of Jefferson , Jackson , Wilson and F.D.R. Behind the speaker 's stand loomed a new staircase . " When our people make an entrance , " said one official , " they 'll make an entrance-they wo n't sneak up a side stairway . " <P> Again TV 's glassy , curious stare was everywhere . The Democrats were determined to avoid some of the Republicans ' TV mistakes . Two cameras had been set up above the floor 's center aisle , permitting front views of the speaker on the rostrum . " The Democrats , " said one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people in the eye . "
