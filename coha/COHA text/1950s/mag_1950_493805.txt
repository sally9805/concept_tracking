DID HITLER WIN ? DID HITLER win ? I ask this question by seriously , and I am looking , not at devas-Davies A ' Powell tated Europe , but at political Washington . The incapacity , dissension and strident irresponsibility which Hitler said would destroy American leadership in the event of his own defeat are apparent . They have not destroyed us ? not yet ; but how sure can we be about the future ? Hitler , says Rauschning , writing in 1940 , knew himself as " the greatest destroyer in history , " and whenever he felt , as he sometimes did , that he might not be triumphant , he believed that he would drag the world with him to destruction , and thus , in spite of being defeated , would emerge as an avenging Lucifer , scourging the world with its own evils . The character of the political campaign which has just ended is a case in. point . There will be incessant arguments as to who won or lost and why . Bodily dead in the rubble of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his methods were alive in our American campaign . We must ask ourselves seriously if Hitler won . We must inquire , before we lose our souls , how deeply Hitlerism is rooted in our free soil . It is one of the great misfortunes of our time that Hitler 's intellect was underrated . It was not understood that an evil man could be a man of vision , a malignant genius with immense powers of comprehension . Nor was it understood that a man could have these powers and still be mad . Yet Hitler was not the first , and he is not likely to be the last . This is what he had to say about the United States : that if the responsibilities of world leadership are imposed upon us we shall prove too reluctant , too distracted and too disunited to meet them . The United States will find it impossible , he said , to strike a balance between individualism and liberty on the one hand and social discipline and restraint on the other , and thus will be unable to maintain at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make money regardless " will persist under all circumstances , and political ambition will drive leaders into fervent but contentious patriotism , weakening the nation at the very moment when most of all it needs unity and strength . Our American race problem , he continued , we shall prove unable to solve . Faced with the intolerable dilemma of either granting full equality to American Negroes , which we are entirely unwilling to do , or of Not nearly enough of us have recognized as yet the full effect of the McCarthy smear campaign on our friends abroad . To liberal Americans , inured , at least until the recent election , to patience with their own politics , McCarthyism can be written off as Senatorial capers . Not so in England or in France . These countries know that their destinies , even their very survival , may depend upon what happens in American politics . They absolutely do not understand , and nothing can make them understand , the kind of attack the McCarthy coterie is making on our State Department . Fortunately for us , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was redeemed by the promptitude of the President 's action in the crisis in Korea . But what of the future ? Moreover , what of the inference , the inevitable moral implications of such behavior ? There is a sickness , a morbidity , a moral malignity behind these attacks on our leadership . One after another , men of ability , men of character , men with the capacity to lead are being destroyed . Or they choose ? and who can blame them ? ? to leave the Government . If , through sheer fortitude , they decide to remain they must set aside heavy responsibilities and urgent duties to defend themselves against heedless , sinister , insane attacks . When will we understand what drove Emerson to write the following vehement lines ? " Men of aim must lead the aimless , men of invention lead the uninventive . . . . Neither the caucus , nor the newspapers , nor the Congress , nor the mob , nor the guillotine , nor fire , nor all together , can avail to outlaw , cut out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That is Mr. Acheson 's offense . He is a superior person . He is also , it seems , a gentleman . He found it natural to speak compassionately of his former associate , the unfortunate Mr. Alger Hiss . George Washington would have done the same , or Madison or Jefferson . None of them would have spoken harshly of a one-time colleague who had fallen to low estate . Nor would any of them have allowed his personal sympathies to impede him in official duties . They would have been astonished ? as Mr. Acheson was entitled to be ? at having their patriotism questioned . But these standards of decent behavior have become a handicap . Mr. Acheson has also offended the " irresponsibles " by understanding the world situation and evolving a policy to deal with it . It was not a partisan policy , it was an American policy . Responsible Republicans as well as Democrats have on the whole approved it . But the group of " irresponsibles , " having no foreign policy at all , have devoted themselves to attacking Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychopathy ? How long can we go on humiliating the public servants from whom we expect devotion , deriding and abusing them out of fear that they may outperform the common standard ? It was Francis Bacon who wrote as long ago as 1625 that " he that can not mend his own case will do what I e can to impair another 's . " And Montaigne , half a century later , put it even more completely : " Those who can not attain to greatness avenge themselves by railing at it . " We want our leaders to be what we call " regular , " by which we mean , no better than anybody else . But if they are no better than anybody else , why should we want them as leaders ? Is is not only our foremost leaders , however , who are being accorded this treatment . It runs right through the Government . So much is this the case that there is increasing reluctance on the part of men.of ability to come to Washington at all . They know what to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputations damaged , to lose their peace of mind , their confidence , the friendliness of life about them , when they can stay where they are with no fear of such treatment and do a good job in what they are already doing ? Why should they take the risk of baseless accusations , insinuation , slander , and have to spend half their time defending themselves , thus making it possible to go on with their work the other half of the time ? And at the end , of course , be thrown out ? discarded ! Hitler would be pleased at this reluctance . Our Government will come to be managed , he said , by men distinguished by their " lack of talent , of will-power . " Selection will take place " according to absence of . ability and indeed even of character . " With their wild accusations , their stunt " investigations " and their witch-hunts , the " irresponsibles " are giving Hitler more and more of what he wants : They are doing the same thing by their effect upon publi2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , frustrated in their wish for normalcy , are easily manipulated into blaming everything upon somebody else . It is a sad fact of human nature that relief from a painful situation is most easily found by furiously attacking the most accessible victim . I was given a rather instructive account , recently , of how this happens in the case of an ordinary member of the House of Representatives . A Congressman , most of the time ( I was told ) , suffers from frustration . He is " pushed around . " And in Congress he is " pushed around " some more . Very seldom can he get what he wants . He must do the bidding of others . So presently he wants to reverse the roles and do some " pushing around " himself . He finds his only really defenseless victims in the administrative departments ? some of them good-sized targets . Upon these he projects his own frustrations , hunting them down with euphoric zest , and thus achieves considerable relief from his own embittered condition . This is probably too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one who knowns anything about the matter will deny the fanatical zeal with which a Congressman , seated on a suitable committee , will persecute an **25;1528;TOOLONG victim . One can not help noticing , while looking at such a Congressman , how perfectly he would fill the role of commissar . If by some malign fate we were turned overnight into a Communist state , we would expect to see the same persecutors occupying much the same positions , and it is quite a question whether they themselves would feel the difference . The " irresponsibles " have gone too far . They are carrying us along the road of Hitler 's prophecies . Instead of helping us to defeat Communism , they are making it more likely that the Communists will be the victors . We must see ? before it is too late ? what the " irresponsibles " are doing to us . We must discredit them , exposethem , and end their power which tends to weaken us . We need a higher level . Our people must face the facts soberly . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encompassed by the same peril . It is not a condition brought upon us by any one party , any one group , or any assortment of individual men . It is much too big a thing ? this thing that has happened to us ? to be explainable in ways like that . We must see it as something that we must deal with together ? sanely , deliberately , resolutely , unitedly . We need intelligence , patience , fortitude , determinA tion . We need discussion , not vituperation ; precise thinking , not an emotional debauch . We shall win , not by the loudness of our patriotic protestations but by returning to our founding principles . Armed might may help . In any case , it is necessary . But just as indispensable is a higher level in our politics . There is no room for " irresponsibles . " Unless we learn this , we shall not win at all . The winner will be Hitler .                   @ @
