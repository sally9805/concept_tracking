Sir James Matthew Barrie 's Peter Pan , originally produced in London in 1904 with the late Nina Boucicault as the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up , ran for 145 performances . The play has been revived in London every Christmas season since , except in the blitz years of ' 40 and ' 41 . On Broadway , Maude Adams played Peter over 300 times between 1905 and 1916 . Marilyn Miller and Eva Le Gallienne had flings at revivals in the ' 20s and ' 30s . Last week , the current Broadway production , with Jean Arthur and Boris Karloff , played its 238th performance , setting a new Peter Pan record ; and there was no sign that the show would be closing any time soon .
