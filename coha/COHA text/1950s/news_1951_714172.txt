The name Pulaski rd. honored the Polish general , Casimir Pulaski , who fought in the American Revolug 7m . Bitterness that marked the court trial , which began last June 28 , came to a head in a brawl in the Corridor outside Judge O'Malley 's courtroom in the county building after the decision was announced .

Hunt , representing the plaintifs , had expressly agreed to this procedure . Walter H. Buescher , chairman of the Crawford Avenue association , which brought the mandamus suit , praised Judge O'Malley for his patience and fairness , and de-1 plored the city council 's forcing his group to go thru with " such a lengthy and expensive trial .
