Spruce in black coat and striped trousers , Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan was the very model of a Tory Cabinet member and Edwardian gentleman as he anxiously rose in the House of Commons to present his first budget . <P> First , Macmillan rehearsed the melancholy facts beneath Britain 's hectic prosperity-the rising prices at home , the declining exports abroad , the dwindling gold and dollar reserves as imports soared . " The economy is still running at a very high level , ' ' he said , but " there is really no future in importing extra materials that we can not afford , in order to turn them into extra goods that we do not export . ' ' Like workers in a candy factory , <P> Britons were gobbling up too much of their own products , and sooner or later the law of economics would catch up with them . Macmillan conceived his peculiar problem to be " to moderate the boom . " <P> The Gamble . Within its own borders , Britain had a whopping surplus ( $1.2 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tax cut . Instead , he increased taxes on company profits , tacked another few shillings on leaf tobacco to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes to 54 , and lifted the subsidy on bread ( thus increasing the cost of a loaf to 12 ) . Mostly he aimed at forcing the public to keep its money in bank or sock instead of buying what should be exported . <P> His prize surprise proposal brought howls of laughter from both sides of the House . He proposed a new 1 bond , which would pay no interest at all . Instead , the interest would be put in a pool , and every three months the holder would stand a chance of winning up to $2,800 tax-free in a lottery held by the government . Anticipating moral objections , Macmillan insisted : " This is not gambling , for the subscriber can not lose . " <P> In a nation whose favorite weekly pastime is " having a flutter " by risking sixpence in football pools on the chance of winning $280,000 , the proposal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " headlined the Laborite Daily Mirror . " Give him your quid and you might win 1,000 . Gambling ? Oh dear , no ! " <P> The Grumble . As expected , some church leaders grumbled about immorality . Laborite Harold Wilson taunted : " Now Britain 's strength , freedom and solvency apparently depend on the proceeds from a squalid raffle . " The left-wing New Statesman and Nation labeled Macmillan 's proposal " the birth of the windfall state . " But the august London Times defended the new bond , and so did the Financial Times . <P> A more serious criticism of Macmillan 's budget was its failure to attack Britain 's basic problem : lagging productivity . The latest treasury bulletin for industry exposed it baldly : since 1950 , British wages have risen by 45% while output per man increased by only 7% . In the same period , when German wages increased by 40% , output increased by 38% . The Daily Express put Britain 's condition bluntly : " Too little work for too much money .
