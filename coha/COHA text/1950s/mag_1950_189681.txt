Up to the Governor 's mansion at Salt Lake City , Utah rode a cowboy on a pinto pony last month . The cowboy was Denver Post Reporter Robert Fenwick , masquerading in chaps and ten-gallon hat . To amused Governor J. Bracken Lee he presented one silver spur and an invitation to come to Denver to pick up the other one . Twelve times during the month Cowboy Fenwick and his pony ( carted around in a truck ) repeated the stunt at other state capitols in what Post Editor and Publisher Edwin Palmer Hoyt likes to call the " Rocky Mountain Empire . " <P> This week , with assorted governors , senators , mayors , newsmen and Denverites on hand , Emperor Hoyt formally opens his new court-a gleaming $6,000,000 plant in downtown Denver . The 5,000 guests will wash down Rocky Mountain trout with a river of bourbon , admire the electrically heated sidewalks ( guaranteed to melt snow in a jiffy ) , and watch as cosmic rays start the giant new presses rolling off copies of the Post . <P> Performing Chimpanzees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Harry H. Tammen and Frederick G. Bonfils . They ballyhooed the Post to its dominant position in the Rocky Mountains by wild splashes of red ink , trick headlines ( DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD ? ) , a circus makeup , dancing Indians , performing chimpanzees , and stuffed elephants under glass ( they kept one in the business office ) . In his own four years as publisher , Ep Hoyt has shown considerably more restraint , but he has kept the Post growing in circulation ( now 226,866 ) , advertising ( double in four years ) , prestige and influence . He has done it by making the Post responsible as well as robust . <P> A Baptist minister 's son , Palmer Hoyt was a sergeant major in World War I , then a successful writer of westerns ( one Hoyt hero : a buckaroo with a revolving glass eyeball ) . He joined the Portland Oregonian in 1926 , in twelve years rose from copyreader to publisher . In 1946 the Denver Post 's owners hired him away on a fat , longtime contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sloppy makeup , insisted on sharper leads and shorter stories , used the space saved on more news and ads . He doubled the editorial staff , assigned reporters to an empire beat 1,000 miles wide and 1,500 miles long . He gave the Post an editorial page , took editorializing out of the news columns , and broadened the paper 's intensely regional outlook . <P> Although the Post is delivered by bicycle , burro and plane daily in every one of the 13 states in the Rocky Mountain Empire , energetic Ep Hoyt is not relaxing . He munches candy bars , swallows vitamin pills , and takes catnaps to keep going 18 hours a day . He traveled 45,000 miles last year , selling the Post to the empire . The hustle &; bustle pays off . Last year 's gross : $12,000,000 ( net : more than $1,000,000 ) . To Ep Hoyt and the Post that is not good enough . They share the old Bonfils motto , still published daily : " There is no hope for the satisfied man . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
