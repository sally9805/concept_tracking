Possibly the loudest and zaniest radio station in the U.S. is Pittsburgh 's WILY , which tailors its programing and advertising to a Negro audience . This week WILY will die-of an overabundance of success-and in its place will arise station WEEP . There will be some program changes , occasionally some subdued music , and commercials beamed to a general audience . But for the most part , WILY fans will not be disappointed in WEEP . Announcers will still bray crazy commercials ; odd-voiced groups will yell the lyrics to Chicken Baby Chicken , Whole Lotta Shakin ' Goin ' On , and assorted other tunes " to endure traffic jams by . " <P> Explained manager and Part-Owner Ernie Tannen : " After inspecting our electronic navel , we decided we had grown too fast and too big to keep on being just a Negro outfit . " WILY found that its mesmerizing music and offbeat programs were attracting up to three times as many white as Negro fans . So WILY , after filing new call letters with FCC , became what Tannen believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general market . <P> Happy Sounds . One of seven radio stations in a chain headed by wealthy Food Broker John Kluge , WILY quadrupled its advertising billings in the last three years , now carries 150 commercials a day . Yet both Tannen and Kluge felt its identification as a Negro station had sealed off even more potential customers . <P> Of WILY 's three hard-driving Negro disk jockeys , two will be replaced by white men , one will remain : Sir Walter Raleigh , whose haughty , sardonic British accent seems to make hipsters flip . Says Raleigh , as he lays on such " crazy wax " as O Bop She Bop and Rockin ' Pneumonia : " Well , chaps , that 's the way the mop flops . Lads and deicers , we 're feeling rather geometric this afternoon , yes , indeedy , we have happy sounds coming up ; a jolly good show , what ? . . . " <P> Uptown Gossip . Amidst its planned madness , WILY also has exhibited civic spirit-it helped to get children placed in foster homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pigeon perch on top of a fruit market , WILY collected neighborhood news by offering listeners $5 for tips on human-interest stories or uptown gossip . " Radio is n't like it used to be , ' ' says balding , Baltimore-born Manager Tannen , who once worked as a chorus boy in Mae West 's Catherine Was Great . " It has become like wallpaper , a companion . " <P> This week Tannen planned to celebrate WEEP 's christening by playing only one record all day , Perry Como 's Just Born . In picking a new name for his " general market " station , Tannen combed the dictionary before deciding that WEEP held all sorts of possibilities : " A surefire slogan : ' WEEP for joy . ' I can call myself the WEEP veep ; we 'll have a traveling car called the WEEP jeep ; and , my God , think of what we can say when we sign off : ' And now , for the next twelve hours you wo n't hear a peep out of WEEP . ' "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
