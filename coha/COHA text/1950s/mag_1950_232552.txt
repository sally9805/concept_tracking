The Communists kept on rolling . Some times they were stopped , temporarily ; more often they advanced . At midweek , tank-led Red columns drove through Chinju and on toward Masan , only 30 miles from the main U.S. supply port of Pusan . West of Masan the grim and battered G.I.s of the U.S. 24th Division threw themselves into the line once more , and the Red advance ground to a halt . Lieut . General Walton H. Walker hastily moved the 25th Infantry Division to the southern front to shore up the 24th . This week the 24th had moved north , was facing another Red assault on the Naktong River . <P> Across the River . Earlier , a reconnaissance battalion of a regimental combat team made a daring dash 22 miles behind Communist lines , captured valuable documents , maps and Russian-made equipment . The U.S. force came within a hair 's breadth of annihilation by heavy enemy fire when Red artillery shells killed or wounded the crews of its two lead tanks and the rest of the column piled up behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had started the reconnaissance as a bazooka man , took over the controls of the lead tank ( although he had never driven a tank before ) , led the column through heavy enemy fire to U.S. lines . <P> On the western front , the Communists launched flanking movements in an effort to trap the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in the Sobaek Mountains . But the 1st Cavalry , in a crafty withdrawal across to the east bank of the Naktong River , escaped a two-pronged Red drive from the west and north . While the G.I.s of the 1st Cavalry dug in , the Communists made a series of bloody , small-scale thrusts across the river . Their goal : the South Korean provisional capital of Taegu , only seven miles from the Naktong . <P> At week 's end the Reds were still trying . Their estimated casualties in this action alone : 2,400 dead and wounded . Major General Hobart R. Gay , the 1st Cavalry 's commander , reported that the Communists were using hordes of civilians , armed only with sharpened sticks , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mood . The Communists last week produced a picture of what they described as the first U.S. prisoners of the war . The Americans themselves were beginning to take more Korean prisoners . Almost for the first time since the fighting started , small bands of North Korean troops came forward under white flags to surrender . An incident at one U.S. command post highlighted the slightly changing mood of battle . <P> A U.S. sergeant , guarding three captured Reds , waved the barrel of his M-1 rifle at one of the prisoners , a sulky shaven-headed youth obviously not out of his teens . " This kid 's a speed boy , " the sergeant said to a U.S. correspondent . " We flush these three out of a paddy field , and this one tries to cut out . I do n't want to shoot him , because we want to question him . So I just run him down . He was talking English like a professor from Yale College when we caught him , " said the sergeant . " Come on , speed boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at the sergeant , but did not answer . <P> New Threat . As the week wore on , fresh troops of the newly arrived 1st Marine Division and the 2nd Infantry Division moved up to bolster U.S. positions on the southern front .
