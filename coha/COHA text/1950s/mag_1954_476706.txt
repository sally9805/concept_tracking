March was the richest month , breeding Novels out of many lands , mixing Poetry and fantasy , stirring Strong thoughts in spring brains . I read , much of the night , and frequently overslept . GERNIAN veteran of the second war , Theodor Plievier , has written a fine novel about the first few months of Hitler 's invasion of Russia : Moscow ( Doubleday , $3.95 ) . The translation by Stuart Hood reads well ? except that some readers Inay find British military . terms like recce and MT ( = reconnaissance and motor-transport ) a little puzzling at first . The main theme of this book is Power . In peacetime we easily forget what enormous forces arc released and directed in big military operations , what vast and complex organizations armies are , how far above the average man 's comprehension they usually remain , how essentially our own individual lives depend on the steady functioning of society , and how bewildering the future becomes when an army or a state is disorganized . In sheer weight of numbers and range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest ever fought . The initial effort of Hitler 's forces was astounding in its magnitude and drive . Plievier sees it as virtually irresistible : it was scarcely checked until it had rolled to the limit of its momentum . It halted on the outskirts of Moscow , before obstacles which at an earlier stage it could have crushed or penetrated , after four months of almost uninterrupted advance : it had outrun its ammunition and supplies , its reinforcements and its ambulances . By the time winter set in , the German lines of communication were painfully , absurdly , overextended . Their spearheadsfell back on nearly every front , losing masses of men and vehicles and equipment ; losing the initiative ; losing their own offensive optimism . But before that , they had utterly defeated three Russian armies and four Russian armored corps , plus the military formations of the internal army , the NKVDabout 800,000 men , of whom only 100,000 escaped . On the German side , drive , drive , drive , tremendous power directed to a single purpose , and failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'erleaps itself , and falls on the other . " On the Russian side , even greater potential force , but miserably organized , an empire of bosses and slaves filled with unbearable tensions , exploding at the first hard blow , or dissolving under pressure into helpless chaotic fragments without purpose and without hope , objects rather than subjects : convicts who scarcely remembered their homes , peasants who longed for liberation , soldiers who asked : Why fight when our industry , which only produced for defense and gave it such priority that for thirty years it could n't let the people have a cooking spoon or shoes or clothing , leaves us without a weapon when it comes to the point ? A ND then , after the chaos had spread into the very center , after the gold from the Russian State Bank had been sent eastward , after the staff of Moscow University , and the Comintern , and the ministries . and even the NKVD administration had been evacuated in special liMousines , truck convoys , and trains , after preparations for the demolition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken ? then two new powers entered the conflict . It began to rain , in a long unceasing downpour . Gradually the rain turned to snow and the snow to blizzards and the blizzards to frightful , unbelievable cold . And the armies which had garrisoned the far eastern and southern provinces of the Russian empire began to arrive . Although the distant frontiers were stripped , still twenty , forty , eighty divisions detrained outside Moscow for one of the most massive counterstrokes in history . At this point , Plievier 's novel comes to an end . It is complete . The rest is foreseen . T HE second theme of Moscow is Folly . Plievier shows how peasants , town and city people , ordinary soldiers , and officers of both sides felt themselves in the grip of two huge and masterful systems , each of which was directed by a-group of lunatics . Hitler 's invasion of Russia was absurd . The Russian collapse was absurd . The German rulers were f ,  - -  ns to brutalize the Russian , Byelorussian , and Ukrainian peoples instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute their own defeated soldiers for " treason " and to oppress so many millions so obstinately and cruelly that they longed for any relief they could find . The only group on both sides who believed they were moved by reason rather than folly were the slave-drivers : the SS and the NKVD , together with the National Socialist German Workers ' party and the Connnunist party ( Bolshevik ) behind them . All the rest , the vast majority , from generals to farm-laborers , bent their backs , and bled , and died . Plievier symbolizes part of this folly in his elderly Wehrmacht general , von Bomelbuerg . Brave , efficient , and dedicated , the old fellow is a brilliant tactician and disciplinarian , and it is his division that drives to the outskirts of Moscow . But he is practically blind . He can see little , smell and taste nothing , he has no sense of balance : for he was shot through the lower skull and sensory apparatus during the French campaign . In the final retreat from the Moscow defenses , von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the snow , followed by a group of exhausted soldiers who think he knows where he is going . He stumbles on ? into a group of partisans . In a few moments all his men are clubbed or strangled . He himself is tied to a stake and drenched with water , which quickly freezes . He remains there , as a signpost . At last he is pointing in the sensible direction . Moscow is a long , rich , well-constructed novel , full of incidents as macabre and brilliant as that of the purblind general . It is in three parts : the first describes the initial German attack , the second the titanic battles that ended in the destruction of the Russian armies of the west , the third the slowdown , halt , and retreat of the German vanguard . It is told from both German and Russian points of view . We meet all ranks of both armies , together with Russian workers , peasants , and slaves . Stalin himself and his cabinet are seen debating one crucial decision . Hitler is mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better organized than Plievicr 's earlier work , Stalingrad ( published in 1948 by Appleton-Century-Crofts ) , and it is quite as powerful . That ended with a German sergeant , Gnotke , and a German general , Vilshofen , agreeing on the folly of Hitlerism and aggressive nationalism , and trudging off together into the wastes of Russia . In Moscow we meet them both at an earlier stage of the conflict and the disillusionment , so that the two books are tied together . It is to be hoped that Plievier will write a third novel covering the final stages of filter 's war . Very few other writers could adequately describe the tightening of the ring , the advance of the avenging armies , and the climax in Berlin , when the little man with the glassy eyes killed himself among the ruins and flames of his capital . High Life and Flat Talk T HE new play by T. S. Eliot , The Canfiden- tial Clerk ( Harcourt Brace , $3 ) , is an in- genious failure . The chief reason for its failure is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read or hear when they are lyrical . Sometimes they succeed through dramatic rhetoric , another talent which Mr. Eliot possesses , though less richly than his lyricism . This play has neither the power of rhetoric nor the poignancy of lyric verse . It is written in a soft easy meter virtually indistinguishable from prose . Of course there is no objection to prose as a vehicle for drama ; but in a comedy like this we expect wit , or individuality , or both . On the contrary , the conversation is thick with cliches and the speech of the various characters is little diversified . With brilliant acting and elaborate stage emphasis , perhaps they would stand out ; but , when read , they sound very like one another , and few of them interesting . The plot is good . More straightforward than The Cocktail Party , it deals with several familiar comic subjects ? mistaken identity , substituted babies , and misunderstandings between parents and children . It is worked out with the delightful intricacy of a ballet or a chess problem .

Crisis O NE of the most exciting enter- prises in recent fiction is John Masters ' plan to write an epic-romantic series of novels covering the whole history of the British in India . There is nothing like this for the Roman empire , or the OttoMans , or the Spaniards . If he completes the series satisfactorily , it ought to be a fine achievement . He plans to center the story on a British family of officers and administrators , with all its Indian friends , foes , assistants , comrades , and rivals , through a period of three hundred eventful years . He has already published four novels chosen from different periods : the Mutiny , the Thuggee conspiracy , the frontier incidents of the late nineties , and now the year 1947 , the crisis of the transfer of power from the British to the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Viking , $3.75 ) , is a selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club , and deserves to be widely read . It is made up of three interlinked stories about three different problems . One is a love story about a handsome girl who has to experiment with several lovers before she can settle down with a large simple man who is meant to be her husband ( " He was such . a fool , and I understood him so well " ) . The second is a social problem ? about the Eurasians , half-breeds and three-quarter-breeds , who do not consider themselves Indian but who can scarcely be fully British either Although they speak of Britain as " Home , " their accent is a little off , their emotional make-up is different , their color worries them constantly , and they have relatives who to betel nut and spit and tend to revert to Indian manners . It has been difficult enough for them under the British regime , but what is to happen to them when the subcontinent becomes India and Pakistan ? Should they leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel homeless ? T HE third problem is much the most important . This is the problem of the transfer of authority from the British to the two new governments . Looking back- on that important transition , we are apt to believe it was merely a matter of mechanical change smoothed by good will ? the files and buildings handed by one set of officials to another . So we might think ; and yet the transfer was marked by terrible riots approaching civil war , in which Sikhs , Mohammedans , and Hindus savaged each other for weeks with insane , bestial violence . And the Great Soul himself was murdered . Gandhi was shot dead ? by whom ? By a Hindu who thought he had been too kind to other people . Now , Mr. Masters ' thesis is that all this violence was not merely fortuitous : that much of it was fomented by Communist agitators who knew their chances of winning free elections were small , butt who hoped , by producing as much disorder as possible , to create their pre-Utopia , a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could seize power and keep it by the methods used so successfully elsewhere. * The principal thread of his story , therefore , carries us through the joint efforts of an Indian official and a British officer of Gurkhas * He calls his chief Communist triggerman K.

Loud of Promise O NE of the wittiest of American intellectuals , Jacques Barzun , has written a book about the United States which combines solid creative appreciation , destructive satire , and constructive criticism in pretty well equal proportions . Mr. Barzun was born in France in 1907 , moved to this country in 1919 , went through Columbia College and Columbia University , became a citizen in 1933 , and is now ? not a transplanted European . but an American who has the power to view his own country from a long perspective and to judge it by ample and sensitive standards . His commentary , God 's Country and Mine ( Little , Brown , $5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . It will irritate some of us , instruct many of us , amuse most of us , and , for many both here and in Europe , serve as a calm and lucid encouragement to appreciate this country through understanding it better . T HE most original and positive part of Mr. Barzun 's book comes near its beginning . There , in long , clear , persuasive , frequently amusing , and always honest arguments , he makes plain what the United States can claim as a solid social achievement ; can pride itself on when at- ' tacked by European or Asian critics ; can call progress , in comparison with the growth of other lands or with its own inchoate past . First , this country is a democracy ? in manners , in morals , in industrial and social behavior , as well as in politics ; yes , and in its attitude to art . The result , in every one of those spheres , is positive and valuable . Mr. Barzun dramatizes it by reporting the patronizing and denigratory clich ? s about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still assume that art is the province of the few , and who ? though enjoying life in a political democracy ? still feel that the masses are aesthetically contemptible . In Mr. Barzun 's words , it would make a Europ.ean shudder or burst out laughing if you told him that one of our great artistic achievements . - has been to make pretty clothes cheap enough for all young women to buy . Then further , this country is a unity of groups : its motto being E Pluribus-UT111711 , and its aim being to allow many unlike people to live together , rather than to subject them all to a single unifornaizing mold , or to set them all at one another 's throats in a Balkan particularism . Democracy means an . equality that tolerates diversity . Mr. Barzun sensitively describes the value of this pluralism in many fields of American life . At a higher level , it is federalism , that blend of association and independence to which the nations of the whole planet are aspiring , and which we have helped to pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the citizen from perpetual interference by officials . Democracy is self-government carried as far as possible : not government by ubiquitous experts wielding rubber stamps , slide rules , and ( ultimately ) handcuffs . Mr. Bar-inn gives six admirable tests by which every American may judge his own government : ( 1 ) Does carrying on our affairs require endless waiting in line , for rations , for permits . . . ? ( 2 ) Does every move for pleasure or profit entail enormous paper work and public prying into private concerns ? ( 3 ) Are the regulations we are compelled to observe counter to logic and common sense ? ( 4 ) Do our necessary dealings with government officials take inordinate time and depend for their outcome on pull or whim ? ( 5 ) Do we as law-abiding citizens live under police surveillance ? ( 6 ) Do we dare , in law and in fact , to speak up for or against our officials , our laws , and matters of belief generally ? " If the answer is Yes to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other five , we have a tolerable government of the kind our forefathers left the Old World to bring forth upon this continent , " T HIS is a valuable piece of work , because it shows the United States as a country which is consciously trying to produce new and more broadly humane standards of life ? and , in astonishingly large measure , succeeding . Most Amer. jeans believe that to be true , but few of them can explain it so well . However , some of them will observe one weakness in this book . When the European visitor enters the United States and makes his first friends , they nearly always say to him , gently but firmly , " Remember . New York Is Not America . " Many Europeans forget that . Mr. Barzun has remembered it in principle but forgotten it in detail . His book begins with a splendid description of the huge Western lands and the continental energies of climate and migration ; and it closes with a brief but poetic evocation of the vastness and variety of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is centrated on the East , and in titular on New York City . It looks as though he had begun it in the expansive delight of a Western trip , and finished it in the depression of his return to Manhattan , with its filthy streets , its vilely rude bus-drivers , and its mind-benumbing noise . Many of his descriptions of transport problems and shop manners are perfectly true of New York and a few other places , but will not mean so much to San Francisco or Dallas or Cleveland or New Orleans , or to the thousands of medium-sized towns throughout the country . Few people over thirty can live happily in New York unless they escape from it often , to rest , THE NEW ROOKS relax , and expand elsewhere ; and generalizations based on the splendors and miseries of New York should be corrected by the more nor-ma/ and natural standards of other cities .

BOOKS IN BRIEF By Katherine Gauss Jackson FICTION The End of an Old Song , by J. D. Scott . This is Mr. Scott 's second book a bou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Glory he wrote of a tesponsible , conventional , married Englishman who had an affair with a girl in Paris without seriously im-pairing the happiness of wife , mis-tress , or himself . Indeed the three became good friends . In this novel , completely different in atmosphere ml tone , two boys growing up in Scotland together before World War II fall in love with the same mad but rather wonderful girl . Instead of separating them it binds all three of them together through various adventures for many years . This pre-occupation , conscious or not , with squaring the conventional triangle-tragedy into something that also fits human reality gives a Noel-Coward piquancy to what he writes ? even when the central theme is the dis-solution of the old aristocratic order in Scotland . In addition to the Scot-tish atmosphere there are in this novel lovable and rakish characters , a drugged weekend , much suspense , and , a terrific fire ? a fitting end to a story of tempestuous temperaments .

Mrs. Keogh always writes with great vitality and gusto . But this story of an apparently conventional , happy New York marriage disturbed by the woman 's awakening sensuality seems merely great gusto about great unpleasantness . The man who rouses her from her lazy , cat-like lethargy is a deformed and uneducated sculptor and as unsavory a character as I have met in modern fiction .
