THE QUIET CHIMNEYS A Story by William Eastlake Drawings by Don Lynch . T HE C H E V V Y pick-up made its way around the point of the dry mesa . There were two Navaho women in the back of the truck Facing each other . They were not saying anything but this was their custom . That they rode in the back and the men in the front was a custom too . The women were being driven from the post of the white trader , where they had had nothing but talk because they were without credit , back to their hogans which were without food , to put an edge on their knives . The unremitting drought had long since given their hunger a splendid edge . The white trader and the husbands of the two Indians in the rear were going to drop the wives at a hogan to rig a pole to dress out a buck . The people in front were going to kill a buck . They had their guns hidden under a blanket onthe floor board . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a custom at all . But this hunger was becoming a custom and , among many other and more painful words , one Navaho found it a bore . " I tell you , Sansi , " the Navaho in front said to the white trader , " it 's becoming a big bore . " The two Navahos were wearing blue levis , black and yellow boots , and each had a red cotton band around his forehead . The trader wore a leather jacket and a large and very worn Stetson . They wore the same thing in any season . The white trader , whose ! mine was George Bowman , said nothing . " 1 got that from a book , Sansi , " the Navaho said . " Tell me , is that the way they talk at your Yale during the cocktail hour ? That is , you ca n't possibly play football all the time even at your Yale . There must he a cocktail hour . Did you know that Sansi went to Yale ? " The Navaho who spoke was named QuickerThan-You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Shut up , Quicker-Than-You . " They arrived now at one of the hogans of the Navaho . The trader stopped the blue pick-up and the wives who were riding- in the back got off . The hogan was octagonal-shaped and made of vertically-placed cedar posts chinked with adobe . The roof was conical and of mud , laced underneath with pifion . ' There was a hole in the middle for the smoke to come out when they cooked , but there was no smoke from any of the hogans . There was a green and orange wagon parked outside the hogan with an enormous lever that was a hand brake and the big letters INDIANA written on its side . The trader 's name appeared in smaller letters underneath . Between the wagon and the mud-colored hogan two skeletal paint horses refused to get off the trail , just staring at the truck with their feral , stupid , and beautiful eyes . Each of the horses had a jagged patch of white over his left eye , which gave them the appearance of having only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go around the horses , knocking down the thick olive chamise brush , the pick-up thumping heavily . The horses looked at each other as if they had won something . THEY WERE on the trail tracks again now , their fenders brushing against the heavy , head-high chico and chamise bushes . " Tell us that poem again that man wrote about the Indians , Sansi , " Quicken-Than-You said . " I , a stranger and afraid in a world I never made . " They had to cross an arroyo now . There were two crossings , one over a tender-looking bridge made of No. 5 lumber , the other a road that wound down the arroyo and up the other side for the heavier wagons . The white trader tried it across the bridge and made it okay with the Indians not breathing . " That 's not bad , Sansi , but it rhymes , " QuickerThan-You said as they curved through the badlands . " Did n't you tell us it could n't rhyme , Sansi ? " " I said it did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white trader said . " Like not hunting out of season , " QuickerThan-Yon said . " I suppose so , " George Bowman said , and he swore at the Indian under his breath . The earth in the badlands all had wide cracks and was in waves . It was encrusted with alkali . Sometimes there was a big harranca where the scientists hunted and the government soil people looked and which the Navahos found difficult to cross . " And paintings are n't supposed to look like anything . " The driver did n't say anything . " Check , Sansi ? " Quicker-Than-You insisted . " I said they need not look like something familiar . " They have other laws , Sansi , like . . . " " Shut up , Quicker-Than-You , " Rabbit Stockings said . The pick-up was crawling in low gear over a great mound that looked like a dome of salt , and the land was without anything except the distant dry blue mesa as far as they could see . " Okay , Sansi , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be a heap good tourist Indian . Tell me , Sansi , you like my wife 's pictures on the rugs she makes where the men 's bodies are like a pencil ? Are they unfamiliar enough ? " " I like them very much , " the white trader said . " Okay , Sansi , I believe that . You buy them even now when you ca n't sell them . But do you think my wife is beautiful ? " " Yes , " the white trader said . " Okay , we better change the subject , " QuickerThan-You said . " And , speaking of women , you-know we Navahos have n't raided the Pueblo People for a little while now . " " Almost one hundred years , " Rabbit Stockings said . " 1 wonder if their women miss us , " QuickerThan-You said . The trader had to shift again to get over a bad place . " Before the whites the Navaho could take what he wanted , " Quicker-Than-You said slowly . " And that went for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trader was hoping that the very-brightindeed Indian would drop it for a while . But the Navajo was still circling in attack , and he came in now fast and under the cover of something else . " You going to hit me with a writ , Sansi , on my wagon that is n't paid for ? " " No , " George Bowman said . " Because it would n't do any good . " " That comedian from the used-car lot in Gallup hit me with a writ on my former Cadillac , Sansi . I tell you , Sansi , a Cadillac is not much of an automobile for this country . " hit you with a writ , " R ABBIT STOCKINGS was not following anything . He always found QuickerThan-You sharper than anything he had ever felt before . It cut when he understood him , which was not very often , but he could not put down Quicker-Than-You . Quicker-Than-You would not allow himself to be dropped , he insisted himself on the other Indians . He was good-looking , brilliant , clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whites say much either . QuickerThan-You had begun his campaign to go hunting out of season several days ago , when the hunger got bad , Today he had succeeded . Rabbit Stockings was silent , not only because he found Quicker-Than-You too sharp , but be ? cause Rabbit Stockings had nothing to say . Rabbit Stockings had just gone through a period when he had plenty to say ; his wife had to have a kidney stone removed , and the clan had had many sings to pull her through and Rabbit Stockings was very popular . It was the biggest thing that had happened to his clan for two years . Even when the stone turned out to be much smaller than supposed , " and , of course , of no intrinsic value . " One thing you could credit to Quicker-ThanYou was that he was not a professional Indian . They were now passing two professional Indians . From this hill they could see the heart of Cuba . Cuba was worth about two professional - Indians dressing as the Babbitts insisted they should dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today the professional Indians walking toward Cuba were Tons-Dickand-Harry and Silver Threads . The Indians in the pick-up did not wave to them as they went by . One credit you could not give to QuickerThan-You , Rabbit Stockings thought , was that he knew when to keep his mouth shut . " WHEN THE regular hunting season was on , we were scared , ' Quicker-Than-You said . " I tell you , Sansi , I went through the war . It never bothered me very much , but when those shooting people from the city were here I was scared . What was the word they used ? Safari ? What does it mean ? Sansi said safari means they 're trying to prove something . " " I did not , " the white trader said , shifting her into second , slowing her to go over a steel cattle guard . " Well , say it now , " Quicker-Than-You said . " All right , " the trader said . " I will say they arc trying to prove they 've got more money than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , clapping the white trader on the knee . " You know my wife 's reading a book , " QuickerThan-You said . " What do you think , Sansi ? You think that can be dangerous ? " They waited alongside the trail now for a wagon full of Navahos to pass . " Sansi , it 's called The Power of Positive Drinking , or Thinking , I guess it is . Anyway I read parts of it . You know , Sansi , I think they 're trying-to fool us Indians . " " Then we 're all in the same hogan , " the white trader said , starting the car again . " Rut they 're sincere . " And then the trader wished he had said nothing . " Everybody 's sincere , Sansi . The game war-den 's sincere . Everybody 's sincere , Sansi . We 're sincere about killing a buck out of season . But we 're hungry , Sansi . " " Half the world is hungry , " the white trader said . " But the other half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sansi . " " For an illiterate Indian you do all right , " the white trader said . " I stayed out of Yale , " Quicker-Than-You said . " That 's more than a lot of the Indians who liye this close to the mission did . I stayed out of Yale . " " But you ca n't live on that , " Rabbit Stockings said . " You 've got to accomplish something else . Your wife stayed out of Yale . " " True , " Quicker-Than-You said . " But Sansi did n't . " " Okay , " the white trader said . " But ca n't you lay off ? " " Sure , sure , " Quicker-Than-You said . " And I will accomplish something else today . I will kill that big buck . Five hundred yards , right between the eyes . " The trader winced . T HEY HAD passed through Cuba now and were going past the ranches of the white people . There were not many of them in these thousands of square miles of northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navaho and the Apache Nations . The trader called the white ranches a buffer state . What Quicker-Than-You called them was not printable . Rabbit Stockings was completely without heavy weapons to support his opinions , so he was patient . Most of the other Indians were patient WO . They went by Ben Shroyer 's place , and Ben Shroyer , with Cass Goodner and Plemon Johnson , all in identical wide black hats and sharp pointed boots , were trying to pour a corralfill of , white-faced and Brahma cattle through a chute and into a huge semi-trailer truck that would hold thirty-six . They wanted to get started back to the sale ring in Albuquerque , but the cattle were pushing and they were n't doing any good . As the hunters drove by , they heard the sharp-faced , city-dressed driver swearing . They continued down the trail and began to count the gates . They would turn off at the third forest gate . The Indians had spotted the big buck some time ago and knew he ran with two does at a clearing near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trader in on it because he would furnish the shells , now that they were without credit , and the pick-up with a tarp to put the buck under , which would create no suspicion as they went by the ranger station in Cuba . They had nothing to worry about , the nearest game warden was one hundred miles away . The scheme was absolutely foolproof . Quicker-Than-You counted the second gate , and continued as he had been continuing for the last week . " It 's not that I am bitter , Sansi . I am willing to let lost wars be lost wars and lost land remain forever lost . But remember , in this you 're in the same position as the Navaho , Sansi . You were as frightened as any non-institutionalized person would be to venture your head above ground while the city whites were banging away at each other during the hunting season to celebrate the next Du Pont Powder Company 's dividend . You have seen the deer starving in the winter snows because of overpopulation since the wise policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see the starving weak deer get killed every winter by the few remaining cats . I ask you , Sansi , are the mountain lions more privileged than us ? " " How many gates was that ? " the white trader asked . " Two . We turn at the next one , Sansi . " " And if you keep it up , " George Bowman said , " we will go back to the post . " " I 'm not saying anything , Sansi . I apologize for being born . " T H E Y turned into the third forest gate now and Rabbit Stockings got out to open it . There was a small clearing of logged-over country before they entered the forest At the edge of it a Spanish family from La Ventana was cording firewood . The Indians who did not have to get along with these people called them Mexicans . The Anglo ranchers , who did , called them Spanish-Americans . The trader called them people . These people straightened up and waved as the pick-up went by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The pick-up entered the dark forest now and nobody said anything , while they traveled for fifteen minutes . Then the trader stopped the truck and they talked in whispers and signaled to each other with their arms . This hunt had been carefully planned and they all knew what to do . They started off with Rabbit Stockings , who was probably better than anyone in the world at this sort of thing , leading . Then came the trader , followed by QuickerThan-You . They began to travel a big circle in a direction that always kept the moving air coming into their faces , and up wind from the deer , and that would bring them soon to the point in the jut of the mesa where they would no longer walk in file . Then all would make a half turn and sweep the mesa . The buck and the two does  --  if he still had them  --  could not outflank the hunters and double back because there was a sheer cliff on either side ; and soon the deer would have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them toward . This maneuver was a memorable strategy of the Navaho long before it was a classic strategy of the British Navy . T HE HUNTERS had made their simultaneous turn now and were combing the mesa . A big , gentle , wafer-soft snow began to come down as they made their turn but it did nothing to their plans ; if there was enough of it they could even use it for tracking . The great drought , that had had the Navaho People down on one knee for a very long count might be breaking . On the way up the trader had noticed the fat gray cumulus building up to the cirrus and now  --  as the flat gentle flakes came into his face on a long downward curve , so individual , big , and spaced apart that maybe you could count . them  --  he was not surprised at all . He could still see the Navahos in a quiet white haze through the sparse pifion as the line moved forward . The gray buck with a white belly and great puzzled eyes beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go three hundred or more pounds , had his two does working a stretch of grama grass just above the logged clearing when the buck picked up the man smell . The buck felt toward the direction of the smell with his square black nose that was shining wet , until he was certain there were three of them and that 49 there was no hope of getting around their flank and coming in behind them . But he took several tentative but graceful and light , for his heaviness , quick steps toward the hunters to make certain he could not bring his does through them , before he turned them toward the clearing he knew he must avoid . The great buck who now nuzzled the does into movement had , in his wisdom and ten years of experience , got through eight hunting seasons , subtracting those years when he was illegal game . Now be had to get through an extra season . Only last week he had finished weathering a month-long war , which came each year at the same time . Then the man smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , but in some strange rite , themselves . ( The buck had watched from a crag with his two does a hunter stumble as he left his car and shoot himself . As the pool of red spread , these three witnesses had fled into the Largo country , to return only three days ago to this part of the mesa on which they had , until now , been able to successfully maneuver and triumph . ) Rabbit Stockings made an arm signal to the others that he had picked up the almost noiseless sound of the buck pushing his antlers through the dry ground-suckers of the dwarf oak . The Navaho must have picked up other gentle sounds too because he pumped his left arm three times to indicate the number and then , with the same arm , made a great circle in the air to signify that the buck was moving toward the open clearing up ahead . The trader signaled now to increase the pace , knowing they must press the deer and close the range  --  be able to take advantage of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the clearing . The hunters clicked off their safeties . The deer would have to go any second now . The does broke first , pushed out by the buck . They made their run fast and bounding . Then the buck came out , but slowly , as though to drawthe fire on himself . He made an unnecessary turn and looked back straight at the trader , and George Bowman had never had an easier shot in his life . He raised the gun and squeezed off two shots . Rabbit Stockings on his right , who had an even easier shot , pounded off two more . The big buck turned , pivoted slowly again , his white tail flashing before he decided to bound off fast in the direction of the aspens where the does were already safe . They watched him go with no one firing . Quicker-Than-You had not fired at aIl . They all converged on the trader now , but they said nothing until they had each lit up one of the trader 's cigarettes . They all stood with the butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of a bitch . I missed hint twice , " Rabbit Stockings said . " I missed hint twice , " the trader said . " I never got off a shot , " Quicker-Than-You said . " I knew you boys had hint . " " Son of a bitch . I missed him twice , " Rabbit Stockings said . W HEN THEY finished their cigarettes it was beginning to snow very heavily and as they made their way back to the pick-up they crossed the tracks of the buck where he had joined the does . They could tell by the size of the tracks he was as beautiful as they remembered . " Too late to track , " Rabbit Stockings said . " Much too late , " the trader said . When they got back to the blue pick-up it was already cased in white and the trader scraped the snow off the windshield before he started her up . He thought the snow would be heavy now on the poles the Indian women had prepared . There was a heater in the cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did not hide their guns now : the Navahos kept them between their knees . They were short carbine twenty-inch lever-action Winchesters , pointing at the roof . The trader 's big and old Clabro-Martin , which had been the property of his father , was pointing at the floor . He had emptied it . All the guns were empty . When they got to the edge of the dark forest and came out into the light the Navahos waved to the people gathering wood . They looked up surprised but they waved back . One of them took off his red cap . After they got through the forest gate there was a wagonful of Apaches pulled by two starving small Indian ponies , getting ready to camp for the night against the driving snow . The Navahos waved to these people too . The wagonful of Apaches did not seem to know how to take it but they waved back . They were probably going to Zia for a sing . There must be , Rabbit Stockings thought , fourteen of those red Apaches piled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sorry horses . At Ben Shroyer 's the men had emptied the semi-trailer and were trying to load it again , properly this time . The men with wide black hats and pointed boots were waving at the cattle with sticks and the sharp-faced city driver was on top of the red semi cursing and waving a stick too . None of them were waving at the Navahos in the pick-up who were waving at them . The Navahos did not seem to mind . In the heart of Cuba they stopped in front of Bart Montoya 's New York City Bar and allowed the two professional Indians to get in the back of the pick-up . Going out of town they waved to the small , thin , college-boy forest ranger in green uniform and Boy Scout hat sitting in the window of the ranger station reading a book of DeVoto 's on the wild west . He looked a long way from home . He was n't waving to anyone . Soon they were back in their hogan country and there was n't any more waving . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogans and there was no smoke from the holes in the dome-shaped roofs . All the chimneys were quiet . When they got to Rabbit Stockings ' hogan the snow was thick on the poles the women had erected to dress out the buck . The trader did not stop ; he kept right on going . " Wait , " Rabbit Stockings said , " I live here . " " 1 know , " the trader said . " But first we must go to the post . " I N S I D E the dark , great room of the adobe and log trading post the trader pumped up the Colman lanterns and lit them and from underneath the bare shelves he managed to assemble two boxes of groceries . MAGAZINE " But , " Rabbit Stockings said , " what are you going to eat ? " " F got plenty , " George Bowman said . Quicker-Than-You went around in back of the counter where he did not belong and then lie stuck up his head and said , " There 's nothing left but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on a case of beans , " Rabbit Stockings said . " I can live on a case of beans if an Indian can live on nothing , " the trader said , and he lit up a cigarette and offered them each one which they did not accept . " We can work up a credit at Johnson 's , " Quicker-Than-You said . " There 's no need to rob you . " " Johnson 's post is finding it impossible to carry their own Indians through this period . He absolutely could not carry you . " " I know , " Rabbit Stockings said . " Our credit is worthless . " The trader was looking out the window toward the hogans and beyond to the blue mesa . " After today we all maybe draw a little fresh credit , " the trader said finally and he pushed the boxes off on his friends and they left silently . After they had gone the trader took one of the cans of beans and the Colman lantern into a small back room he used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose father and his father in turn had lived with the Indians , had had all the good things when the wool , along with the spirits , was high , when the rains ' 1 , vcre hard and heavy and the government was interpreting the Treaty of 1868 generously ; and when you had inherited all of the downs and ups of three generations , then maybe you could take one more bad year . just one more year , he had been telling himself for many years now , and now he told it to himself again . Just maybe one more year , he said . Just one more year finally adds up to eternity but I do not find eternity with The People too hard to take . Even with Quicker-Than-You . Perhaps it is only the Quicker-Than-Yous that make eternity bearable , he thought . Anyway you take it as it comes . The trader was feeling pretty good . In his way of life you had to be satisfied with being a small winner . " Yes , after today everyone deserves some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he got back to the business of trying to eat the beans . He was sick of beans . But the beans would be far far better than the quiet chimneys .
