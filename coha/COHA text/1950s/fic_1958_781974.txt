 | chapter 7 That night I slept poorly . A lawyer caught in the toils of a murder case is like a man newly fallen in love : his involvement is total . All he can think about , talk about , brood about , dream about , is his case , his lovely lousy goddam case . Whether fishing , shaving , even lying up with a dame , it is always there , the pulsing eternal insistent thump thump of his case . Alas , it is true : the lover in love and the lawyer in murder share equally one of the most exquisite , baffling , delightful , frustrating , exhilarating , fatiguing , intriguing experiences known to man . And it looked like I was rapidly falling in " love . " " Good morning , Mr. Clerk , " I said to Sulo . " Is there a Lieutenant Manion still registered here ? Or has he checked out ? " I had been using the same old gambit on Sulo for ten years and it never failed to convulse him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old school ; old jokes to him were like old cheese : their very mustiness seemed to make him relish them all the more . In fact I had him in stitches ; we two were bad enough to be on TV ; Sulo was the perfect straight man . " Dat 's a good one , Polly , " Sulo gasped , when he had partly recovered . Still convulsed , he reached for his big brass key . " Ho , ho , ho . . . . I  --  I go get your soldier man . he , he . . . . You can use Sheriff 's office you like . He be out road patrol . " It was reassuring to learn that the relentless bloodhound of a sheriff was already abroad stamping out crime . It also gave me a chance to have a quiet chat with Sulo . " Sit down a minute , Sulo , " I said . " We have n't had a little visit for a long time . " I felt like an insurance solicitor coddling a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure , sure , sure , " Sulo said , gratefully sitting down under the portrait of the man coveted by the F.B.I . " Say , Sulo , " I said , before he could launch on the saga of his lumbago , " I do n't suppose you were on duty the night they brought Lieutenant Manion in ? You 're still always on days , are n't you ? " " Sure , you bet , Polly , always on days . Too old now dis night business . " " Um .... Lieutenant Manion wants to hire me for his lawyer , Sulo . But I do n't know , I do n't know . " I pondered the problem with my old friend . " Say , what kind of a woman is his wife ? " Sulo brightened visibly . " Oh , nice lady , nice nice lady . " He shook  | his head appreciatively . " Good looker , too  --  even with dose black eyes . " Sulo winked and brought both arms out and down across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Boy , oh boy , like dat what-you-call , Maryland Monroe .... " " Why , Sulo , you old goat , " I reproved him . " And do n't be carried away . Remember what happened to Barney Quill . " I 'd lost Sulo , he was off again , drunk with laughter , and while I waited for him to collect himself I reflected what a nice thoughtful democratic guy I was to be passing the time of day with my old former fellow officer . And busy as I was , too . The thought gave me a warm glow . It also occurred to me what a shabby trick it was for me to be sitting there trying to pump this affably innocent old jailer . How crafty and double-crossing could a man get ? And all to save the skin of a man who , for simple honor and dignity and the plain virtues , probably was n't fit to shine Sulo 's shoes . But was I doing any of it for Lieutenant Manion ? Was n't it really all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do was to be frank with my old friend . Sulo had recovered and was feeling the small of his back , a sure prelude to a blow-by-blow account of his lumbago . " Look , Sulo , " I said , heading him off , " I 've got to ask you a question , one simple question . If you do n't know the answer I wish you 'd tell me . If you do know and do n't want to tell me , that 's all right , too . Is that fair ! enough ? " " Shoot , Polly , " Sulo said soberly . " Do you know whether Barney Quill raped Laura Manion ? " Sulo surveyed me steadily with his faded blue eyes . He glanced away and back again . " You ask me , Polly ? " he said , shrugging evasively . " How can I know  --  I was home in bed . Vy do n't you ask dat lady ? She was dere . " We sat silently . Sulo now clearly knew I was pumping him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I unwrapped a cigar and chewed the end but did not light it . I had to level still more . " Do n't tell me if you do n't want to , Sulo , " I said . " I would n't want to hurt or involve you for the world . But I 've got to decide whether I 'm taking this ease-I 've got to know today , this morning , in a few minutes . And if I take it I want to win it , it 's damned important to me as well as to the Lieutenant . And if I can really know that Barney raped this woman I think maybe I can win it . " I paused . " That 's the straight dope , Sulo. "  | Sulo glanced furtively around the room . " I tink maybe he did rape her , " he said quietly . The way he said it made the word sound like " rap , " which , upon reflection , still did not make me quibble . " How do you know ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , " Sulo said . " Arc you sure , I mean about the lie-detector results , Sulo ? " I pressed . " I 've got to be sure . " " State police he tell Sheriff ; Sheriff he tell me , " Sulo said simply . " Dat 's true , Polly . I vould not tell you lie about it . " " ' Thanks , Sulo , " I said , briefly taking his hand . " That 's all I want to know . I feel better already , much better . I guess you can fetch down the Lieutenant now . " " Sure , sure , sure , " Sulo said , opening and clanking shut his iron door and locking himself in . He paused on the other side and regarded me thoughtfully through the bars . He smiled faintly . " T'ank you , Polly , " he said dryly . " My lumbago , t'anks , she 's to be much better , much much better . " He turned and shuffled away upstairs , chuckling to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer need n't love his client to adequately represent him , so he does n't necessarily have to believe in his moral or legal innocence . But sometimes it helps , and it was helping now , and I felt greatly relieved to have had my little chat with Sulo . So the liedetector test showed she was telling the truth , had it ? Was the prosecution going to sit on the results ? If they were , how was I going to get them before the jury ? Especially since the results of these tests were in any ' case inadmissible in court ? Well , I 'd have to face that headache later on ... . Sulo had told me more than he realized , much more . This was , in fact , the first big break in the case . For now I not only had confirmation that the lady had been " rapped , " important as that was , but also that her entire story was substantially true . I knew from experience that during the polygraph test the thorough state police would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the events before the rape , the rape itself , and the scene later at the trailer park gate where Barney had allegedly beaten her up . And that last part would absolve my man from any lingering suspicion that he had himself beaten her up in a fit of jealous rage . It further tended to buttress the truth of Lieutenant Manion 's story of his movements after his wife had reached the trailer . Now I not only knew these things were true but I knew that the prosecution also knew them . While all this still did not afford Lieutenant Manion an open-and-  | shut legal defense , I now knew what the People knew and , perhaps equally important , I further knew that they did n't know I knew . It was all a little complicated and I was n't sure yet where it led . Perhaps I could lure the prosecution into trying to hide the results ... . I heard the clank and creak of the iron door . " Good morning , Mister Biegler , " the familiar mocking voice said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You seem buried in thought this morning . " I sniffed the air like a beagle . " Merely incipient coma induced by partial asphyxia . " I arose and held my hand toward the sheriff 's door . " Shall we retire to the lilac room and carry on ? I 'll rally shortly . " " You first , Counselor , you first , " the Lieutenant replied gravely . " Ah , thank you , Lieutenant . " I had done it again to Sulo , and we left him strangling and wounded in his chair under the wanted felon . " He , he , he . . . " I was touched . Good old Sulo ; lumbago and all , he still appreciated his old D.A . " Lieutenant Manion , " I said , facing him , " I 've decided to take your case . " " Good , good . How much is your fee ? " " Three grand . Is that fair enough ? " " Fair enough . I rather thought it might be more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I always want my clients to feel satisfied . " " I 'm real satisfied  --  three thousand is most fair and reasonable . " " Good . When can you pay it ? " " It 'll have to be later . Right now I 'm broke . " " What ! " " I 'm broke . At this moment I could n't pay you three dollars . " " Can you raise it ? " " No . " " I low about your trailer ? " " Both it and my car are mortgaged to the hilt . " " IIow about your relatives ? Everybody has a rich uncle . " " I do n't have any uncles , rich or poor . Both my parents are dead . My only close relative is a married sister in Dubuque . She and her husband owe me money . They have four kids and a mortgage . " " You seem to spring from well-mortgaged stock , " I said . " Look , Manion , why did you call me down here if you knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ran a veterans ' legal aid bureau ? "  | " I needed a lawyer and I wanted the best . " " You mean the second best , do n't you ? Or have you forgotten about that eminent authority on unwritten law , old Crocker ? " The Lieutenant shrugged and regarded me steadily . " Well , " he said slowly , " if you wo n't represent me I suppose I 'll have to try someone else . " I stared at him . Was it possible that this man sensed that by now I would almost have paid him to stay in the case ? " You let me waste a whole goddam day on this case when you knew all along you could n't pay me , " I said , trying hard to work up a pout . " You did n't ask me , " he said . The man had me there . He could n't be expected to know that any half-decent attorney could scarcely discuss his fee before he knew whether he wanted to enter a case . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probed him a little about his general financial condition when I first met him the morning before . And probably should have . Why did n't I face it ? Was n't it the solemn truth that I had suspected all along he did n't have any money , as Maida had warned me , and had deliberately put off asking him until it was too late , until I was hopelessly enmeshed ? As for Maida , how would I ever square all this with her and our depleted check book ? The thought made me smile . " Look , Manion , " I said . " How much can you pay me and when ? " " I can pay you a hundred and fifty dollars on account next week . It 's pay day then . " " You realize , of course , that if I accept that I  --  that I 've enlisted for the duration ? " Coolly : " Yes . That 's why I 'm offering it . " There was a kind of engaging frankness about this cool pirate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . If I 'm acquitted I 'll give you a promissory note and I can pay you so much a month . " " Famous last words , " I said . " And suppose you 're convicted ? " " Then I guess both of us lose . But is n't that just another of those calculated risks  --  like pleading insanity ? " The needling bastard . . . . I had to put in one more try , for Maida 's sake . " Supposing I said I wo n't take your case till you pay me half my fee ? " Shrugging : " I 'd just have to regretfully get someone else , I 'm afraid . " " You 'd risk that ? " I said . " You 'd actually risk it ? "  | Smiling slightly : " I 've got my legal defense now , have n't I ? I was insane , was n't I ? How can I possibly lose ? " I was now getting the Lecture in reverse . I stared admiringly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had me helplessly coming his way and I was morally certain that he now knew I just had to take on this case . The moment of decision was at hand ; I would either go fishing or else go to work . I took a deep breath and held it , pain and all . " Lieutenant Manion , " I said , extending my hand , " you 've got yourself a lawyer . And I seem to have a client . Now let 's get down to work . We 've plenty of it . " lie took my hand . " It 's a pleasure , Counselor . Where do we start ? You 'll have to tell me , you know . Remember , I 've been ill and I 'm just recovering my wits . " " Your wits will do nicely . First let 's go out and see Sulo . I want to discuss with him the possibility of our doing our talking outside in my car . The stink of this place is getting me down . Even for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it much longer . " I held the door open for my client . We found Sulo nodding in his chair and I stood debating whether to awaken him .  | chapter 8 The outer jail door opened and in stalked a character straight out of High Noon . His big mail-order felt hat was pushed back on his perspiring forehead ; his exquisitely tailored and stitched gabardine shirt , with its cascades of pearl buttons at the shaped pockets and cuffs , was negligently open at the tanned throat , from which depended two cords held by a dollar-sized round silver clasp engraved not with Justice , not with Liberty , but with a bucking bronco . The richly tailored trousers were tucked carelessly into the tops of dusty hand-stitched laceless boots and all he lacked , I saw , was a Bull Durham tag dangling over his heart . " Fourscore and seven years ago , " I found myself perversely thinking , " there came forth upon this continent an ancient dust storm ; whereupon an entire province of old Texas was picked up and hurled aloft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , may God help us , it has been dumped upon the far shores of Lake Superior . Yippee yi yi ! " It was a solemn moment and I restrained an impulse to kneel . Sheriff Max Battisfore was back at last from highway patrol . His keen gray eyes restlessly searched the room . They found mine and lit with gladness ; you could see the very glow of gladness in them . " Well , hello , Paul , " the Sheriff said . He grasped my hand in both of his and looked me straight in the eye . " If it is n't my favorite exD.A . In person not a movie . How 's the old boy ? Long time no see . Is old Sulo there treating you and the Lieutenant O.IC. ? " He slapped my shoulder and kept pumping my hand . The Sheriff had come a long way , I saw ; he had developed a boisterous and irresistible gift for camaraderie ; he made one feel  --  I groped for words ? so terribly wanted . We might belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but real friendship was something bigger , finer , than mere party . " How are you , anyway , you old buckaroo ? " he ran on , playfully digging me in the ribs . " I 'm fine , thanks , Max , " I said , smiling and retreating out of range . " Just fine . How are you ? " " Oh , fine , fine . Any phone calls , Sulo ? Oh , on my pad .. .. Yes , Polly , I feel just like a horse 's father . If I felt any better Sulo there 'd have to lock me up in one of my own cells . " He paused as Sulo obediently snorted . Musty cheese , musty jokes . . . . " Tell me , man , how the hell are you , anyway ? "  | " I 'm fine , Max , " I repeated soberly , and , since Max 's concern over my health had been doubly relieved and certified , I added : " If you 've got a minute I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , sure , Polly . Right this way . " He led the way into his office and bent over a memorandum pad on his desk . He called out to Sulo . " Phone the Missus , Sulo , and tell her I got that Community Chest kickoff dinner tonight , after that the Amvets , then bowling . .. . Shut the door , Polly , and sit down . Make yourself at home . Long time no see . Tell me , how the hell  --  ah  --  wo n't you have a ciga-rctte ? " I gestured with the stub of a cigar . " No thanks , Max , I 'm still faithfully on these Italian reefers , still smoking the poor man 's marijuana . The Sheriff wagged his head . " Still the same old joker , too , Polly . Lord , it 's good to see you , man . How do you feel , I mean , how are you really feeling ? " " Look , Max , " I said , taking the plunge , " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I held my lighter poised at my cold cigar . The flame burnt my finger . " Oh , that , " the Sheriff replied , without a pause . " As a foxy old 1 ) . A. like you well knows  --  remember those good old days , Polly ? ? the state police made that test . They made the test , they 've got the results . " He fleetingly laid a confiding hand on my knee . " You remember how jealous they always were of their prerogatives . " He nodded sagely . " Well , Polly , they still are . Jealous as all hell . So would n't it be better all around for you to go ask them ? " He again looked at his desk pad . " Call operator Eleven , Detroit , " he murmured absently . He looked up . " Boy , Polly , it 's been good to see you . Tell Inc , man , how the hell are you ? " " I guess maybe you 're right , Max , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , I 'd better go ask them . " I paused , pondering the problem aloud . " But what 's the use of asking them ? They probably would n't tell me  --  and anyway the results would n't be admissible in court . " I too could confide . " I think maybe I 'll skip it , " I said resolutely . " Yes , I think I may just skip the whole thing . Only complicate matters . To hell with the lie-detector test . " I pumped the Sheriff 's free hand . He had grabbed up the phone with the other . " Thanks , Max , " I said . " Sorry to have troubled you . " " Any time at all , Polly . Long time no see . Boy , it 's been good to see you , you old buckaroo . . . . Hello , Operator , this is Sheriff  | Battisfore . Give me operator Eleven at Detroit . That 's right , honey , just about an hour ago . . . . Yes , dearie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Max stood silhouetted against his wall of framed photographs . For the first time it occurred to me that there were no pictures showing him out pursuing felons or making an arrest , in fact none showing the man in the simple act of being sheriff . . . . I nevertheless found it an impressive scene , as though one had long read about and seen some fabulous personage in the newsreels and on TV and then suddenly been privileged to confront him , relaxed and friendly , in the intimate glow of his own home . One had never realized what a remarkable personality he was . ' There 's just one more thing , Max , " I said . " I was just going to ask Sulo about it , but perhaps I 'd better ask the head man himself . I 'm in Manion 's case now and he and I are going to have a lot to talk about . " I paused diffidently . " There 'll be lots to do , too , and the trial 's just three weeks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheriff said . " And he 's retained one of the best lawyers in the business , Polly . The very best , for my money . " " Thanks , Max , " I said . I was finding trouble coming to the point . " Well , the county still wo n't furnish you a jail conference room and I hate for us to be cluttering up your office and being underfoot all the time . I realize you have your work to do . " " Yes ? " the Sheriff said helpfully . " Well , I was wondering how about the Lieutenant and me occasionally sitting outside in my car , when your office is in use , I mean ? That way we could talk without interruption and in private and at the same time not be in your hair . " That way , too , I thought wistfully , we could occasionally breathe without pain . " Ilm .... " the Sheriff said . He pursed his lips and closed his eyes and nodded his head . " Hm .... " He stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , Polly , " he said thoughtfully . I remained resolutely silent . " Hm , " the Sheriff repeated , squinting again , and it was fun trying to follow his shrewd weighing of the angles , assaying of the factors , yes , counting of the very votes . What was he thinking ? Might it not be something like this ? ? Murder was a nonbailable offense , was n't it , and Manion certainly had no goddam business outside except in custody , had he ? There could be criticism , bad criticism , too , and if the damned fool skipped , made a break , it might be political suicide . But Biegler there was an old hand , an old fox , was n't he ? ? and , hm , a fairly big wheel in his party , too  | and he 'd certainly warn his Lieutenant his goose would be cooked but good if he tried any funny stuff and took a powder . . . . And Polly would n't forget this favor , would he ? And the Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , and poor old Barney Quill was n't , and of course all that had nothing to do with the case , but . .. . " Hrn , " the Sheriff mused , nodding his head . " Maybe I 'd better skip it , Max , " I said . " Maybe people 'd say that because you 're such an active veteran yourself you were playing favorites with war veterans . Maybe even the veterans would get down on you for taking a chance on a fellow veteran , a man who 'd dare lay a finger on a man that had maybe raped and beat up his wife . " I had delivered what I hoped was my clincher ; I paused and awaited the jury 's verdict . " It 's O.K. , Polly , " the Sheriff said quietly , almost casually . " Take him outside any time you want . He 'll be in your custody . " " No cuffs or leg irons ? " I said . " No cuffs or leg irons , " the Sheriff replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him  --  neither of you can afford to . " I t was a shrewd analysis . " Thanks , Max , " I said . There was something big about the man ; the job of being ? and remaining  --  sheriff had n't quite stamped that out . And I felt elated , elated not only to occasionally escape the jail , delightful a prospect as that was , and further elated because the Sheriff 's action tacitly confirmed the results of the lie-detector test , but most of all elated because this most representative citizen , this shrewd walking ( or rather patrolling ) litmus of community sentiment had virtually told me that to his mind at least the prevailing feeling was running toward my man . I was even surer of it now than if Elmo Roper had conducted a county-wide poll . And after all the jury was nothing more than a group of representative citizens , was n't it ? If Max himself felt this way about my man then why should n't they ? Yes , this was the second big break in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't forget this , Max , " I said , opening the door . " It 's nothing at all , Polly , " the Sheriff said . IIe craned his neck . " Hey , there  --  come on in , Sulo , " he shouted out beyond me . " Yes sir , Polly . Any time at all . Lord , it 's good to see you looking so fit . You 're as tanned as a  --  as a hound 's tooth . " " Fishing pallor , " I said . " You 've lost some weight , too , have n't you , Polly ? You 're as lean as a  --  as a ? "  | " Cigar-store Indian , " I said . " Any weight I 've shed , Max , " I continued , ruefully exploring the receding area over my temples , " is solely from losing hair . Time , like crime , marches on . " " You kill me , Polly , " the Sheriff said , chuckling , shifting the receiver to his other ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant sitting out in the warm sun , smelling the rank August smell of Mrs. Battisfore 's flower garden , listening to the distant bumblebee hum of traffic and the drone and clatter of the trusty prisoners ( the Sheriff 's regular clients , the county 's convalescing drunkand-disorderly set ) mowing the big sloping courthouse lawn  --  idly watching the sea gulls dipping and wheeling and soaring so far out over the glittering big lake . We smoked and watched silently and I reflected with lazy unoriginality that the main trouble with the world was the people in it . Someone had said it more floridly if not better : " Where every prospect pleases , and only man is vile . " " We 'll need a psychiatrist , " I and for us , the defense , to create a legal issue on that score we must present expert testimony that you were insane . Once that is done , however , the issue is created and then the burden of disproving your insanity falls squarely on the People . That is our biggest and most pressing problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then I guess we get a psychiatrist . But if it 's a medical question would n't a local doctor do equally as well ? " " No , my friend , a local doctor would n't do at all . Those boys already have their hands full delivering the population and trying to keep up with the latest miracle drugs without moving into the tangled realm of the mind . What 's more , most of them do n't know any more about it than you or I. " " You 're too modest , Counselor . Have you forgotten it was you who injected insanity into this case ? " " No , " I answered carefully . " I merely told you what the possible legal defenses were  --  it was you who told me facts from which one might conclude you may have been insane . " I saw I 'd have to chink that crack in my lecture and keep it chinked . " In any case , even if we were able to find any doctor hereabouts foolhardy enough to testify to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast it would be to throw a real psychiatrist at him and cut him  --  along with your insanity defense  --  to ribbons . You see , psychiatrists are simply a different breed of cats . For example , when plain doctors and lawyers and soldiers and similar riffraff go to a burlesque show they go to watch the girls ' legs and titties . But not a psychiatrist . When one of those birds stoops to attend a burlesque he goes to  | watch the audience . Hell , man , you ca n't pit a mere doctor against a monster like that . " " But how would the People get to know ? " " How would they know what ? " " IIow would they know whether we were going to call a doctor or a psychiatrist  --  or even that we are going to claim insanity at all ? So how could they possibly be prepared to refute it ? " This client of mine was no dummy and I was glad he was n't lobbing shells at me . " Because the law says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial of our intention to plead insanity , and at the same time give the names of our witnesses , expert or otherwise . We ca n't keep it a secret . Surprise pleas of insanity are no fair , ' the law sensibly says . We 've got to tip our hand in advance . " " It 's a pretty unscientific thing , " my man said thoughtfully . " This insanity business is pretty damned unscientific . " " Why do you say that ? " " Well , we ca n't prove insanity without a medical expert , you tell me . Yet you and I have already decided I was insane , we know that we 're going to plead insanity  --  you tell me it 's the only legal defense I 've got . And even I can see that now . In other words you a mere lawyer and I a dumb soldier have between us decided that I was medically and legally insane . Having decided that , we must now go out and shop around for a medical expert to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical doctor wo n't do . " The Lieutenant shook his head . " It all sounds damned unscientific to mc . " It irked Inc unaccountably to hear this Mister Cool so blithely undertake to criticize my profession . It was all right if a member of the family did , but for a perfect stranger . . . " Lieutenant , " I said , " the easiest thing in the world is for a layman to poke fun at the law . Lawyers and the law are sitting ducks for ridicule and always have been . The average layman may in all his lifetime collide with but one small branch of the law , which he understands but imperfectly . IIe usually knows whether he won or lost . He may also remember that Dickens , grumbling through Mr. Bumble , once called the law an ass . So for him all the law is henceforth an ass , and , overnight , he becomes its severest critic . " " But I still do n't get it , " the Lieutenant said . " On this score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Granted , " I said . " But the point I wish to make is that from this  | people may not safely proceed to damn all law . You of all men should be grateful that the massive structure known as the law really exists . It so happens that it represents your only hope . " " How do you mean ? " the Lieutenant said , bristling . " I 'll try to tell you , " I said . " Mr. Bumble was only partly right . He was only part right because , for all its lurching and shambling imbecilities , the law  --  and only the law  --  is what keeps our society from bursting apart at the seams , from becoming a snarling jungle . While the law is not perfect , God knows , no other system has yet been found for governing men except violence . The law is society 's safety valve , its most painless way to achieve social catharsis ; any other way lies anarchy . More precisely , Lieutenant , in your case the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here and seeking out and shooting up every Manion on sight . It is also what would keep the heavily mortgaged Manions of Dubuque from in turn coming a-gunning for the Quills , in other words what keeps the fix you 're now in from fanning out into a sort of Upper Peninsula version of Hatfield-McCoy . " I paused , warming to my unfamiliar role as a defender of law . the law is the busy fireman that puts out society 's brush fires ; that gives people a nonphysical method to discharge hostile feelings and settle violent differences ; that substitutes orderly ritual for the rule of tooth and claw . The very slowness of the law , its massive impersonality , its insistence upon proceeding according to settled and ancient rules  --  all this tends to cool and bank the fires of passion and violence and replace them with order and reason . That is a tremendous accomplishment in itself , however a particular case may turn out . As someone has well said , The difference between an alley-fight and a debate is law . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fine Magna Chartas and constitutions and bills of right and all the rest would be nothing but a lot of archaic and high-flown rhetoric if we could not and did not at all times have the law to buttress them , to interpret them , to breathe meaning and force and life into them . Lofty abstractions about individual liberty and justice do not enforce themselves . These things must be reforged in men 's hearts every day . And they are reforged by the law , for every jury trial in the land is a small daily miracle of democracy in action . " The Lieutenant stared at me with an amused half-smile as I soared away . " Why , just look , man  --  just look at Russia , " I went on . " There the law has been replaced by a stoic joyless gang of lumpy characters  | in round hats and floppy pants and double-breasted overcoats , men who peremptorily crack down on their Lieutenant Manions and everyone , all in the name of the juggernaut state . They are the law . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shook my head . " In fact , Heaven help us , just look almost anywhere these days . The midnight knock on the door , the whisking before a firing squad , the guttural barked command  --  then silence , nothing but anonymous dead silence . . . . No one even dare ask what became of you , much less defend you ; such proletarian curiosity is apt to prove abruptly fatal . " The Lieutenant was smiling now . " I did n't know you cared , " he said . " I only hope you 're half as eloquent during my trial . " I had n't quite known myself how much I cared , and I could n't help smiling . " Having said all that , Lieutenant , it remains to be added that you 're absolutely right on insanity . The present outlook and ritual of the law on legal insanity is almost as primitive and nonsensical as when we manacled and tortured our insane . I agree with you . " The Lieutenant frowned and looked concerned . " I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And supposing our chosen psychiatrist , when we find him , says I 'm not nuts ? " " In that event we keep shopping around , as you say , till we can live-trap one who does . " I shook my head . " So a-shopping we must go . I love that word . I ca n't wait to tell it to Parnell . " The Lieutenant eyed me sharply . " Who is Parnell ? " " Oh , just an old lawyer friend . My legal whetstone , I call him . " " I see . Where do we  --  ah  --  go shopping to find this psychiatrist ? " I thoughtfully lit a cigar . " That may be a real problem , " I said . " Either nobody in the Peninsula is insane or else all of us are nuts . In any case psychiatrists seem to shun the place . The only psychiatrists I know about are connected with public institutions of some kind : the veterans ' hospital at Iron Mountain , the prison over at Marquette , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that sort of place . Most are salaried staff men and I 'm afraid we ca n't expect to get any of them . The People are much more likely to pop up with one of those . " " What do we do , then ? " " We go shopping , my friend . " The Lieutenant shrugged . " Well , I suppose if we must we must . Where do we start ? " " Not where , Lieutenant  --  the burning question is what with ?  | I rather suspect that psychiatrists are no more philanthropic than us lawyers . In fact less so than one foolish lawyer I happen to know . They 'll expect to be well paid  --  and on the line . " " You 're making it rather difficult . How can I pay a psychiatrist ? You know I 'm broke . Hell , man , I ca n't even pay you . " I spoke not unkindly . " You might try helping me , that 's all . And stop feeling so goddam sorry for yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could get a psychiatrist . I was half hoping you might have suggested it . " " Where 's that ? " the Lieutenant said evenly . " From the United States Army , " I replied . " I do n't know whether the Army would . " " I do n't know either , but you might tell me where and who to write . It might also be well to pause here for a little review to impress you with how serious this thing is . One , your only legal defense is insanity . Two , to prove it you must have a psychiatrist . Three , you ca n't afford a psychiatrist . Four , then we 've got to go out and live-trap one some other way . Do you have the picture ? " " I 'll give you the name and address of my C.O. before you leave , " the Lieutenant replied . " Do n't let me forget . " " You better do it now . I 'm phoning or writing him tonight . For this , my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | chapter 10 As my client sat writing out the address , a woman drove up to the side of the courthouse in a black sedan . She got out and a small frisking short-haired terrier followed her , the dog carrying in its mouth a lighted flashlight , of all things . The woman wore dark glasses and as she advanced across the lawn toward us I thought for a moment it was a certain Hollywood tigress : she had the same buoyant step , the same free-swinging stride and same generous blouseful ; she had even the same mass of piled-up russet hair , the high color , the full cherry-red lips . But , no , it was n't my lovely celluloid dream queen . Before she reached my car I knew this was the woman over whom my client had killed Barney Quill . " Hello , Manny , " she said in a low musical voice . " How come you 're out here in the sun ? Did that nice Sheriff finally decide to let you go ? " " IIi , Laura , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 's Rover ? Did you get the trailer moved ? " By this time we were both out of the car . " This is Paul Biegler , Laura . He 's taking my case . He 's arranged for us to talk out here . " " How do you do , Mr. Biegler , " Laura Manion said , extending her hand . She smiled ruefully . " I do hope you can help Manny out of this terrible mess I 've got him in . " " I 'll try , Mrs. Manion . If all of us do our part I think there 's a fair chance . " I sounded , I thought , a little like a professionally pessimistic football coach on the eve of the big game . There was a small thud of silence . Lieutenant Manion knelt and petted the little dog . The animal was in an ecstasy of yipping joy over seeing him . " Rover has n't seen Manny since  --  since that awful night , " Laura Manion explained . " And you ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why , Sunday afternoon . Why do you ask ? " " I just wondered , that 's all . Just making talk . " I paused . " By the way , when can you and I talk ? " " Why , any time you wish , " she said , tilting her head . " I came here today to sec you . Now , if you like . " " The sooner the better , " I said . " Do you think all of us should talk together ? " There was a perceptible pause . She pursed her moist red lips . " Why , just as you and Manny think best , " she said .  | The Lieutenant was still kneeling , petting the dog . " What do you think , Lieutenant ? " I said . Lieutenant Manion looked up at me sideways . " Suppose you call the shot , Mr. Biegler ? Whatever you think is best . " I glanced at his wife and it seemed to me that she shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for now , Lieutenant , " I said . " Do you think you can stand going back to the loving care of Sulo ? I 'd prefer to talk out here in the car . " There was another little jolt of silence , almost like that of relief . " There 's one other thing , " I said . " It seems quite likely that all of us are going to see quite a lot of each other from now on . I 'm no particular slave to the modern cult of informality , but may I suggest that we call each other by our first names ? " " O.K. , Paul , " the Lieutenant said , rising and saluting . " I 'll leave you and Laura to talk . " Iie turned to his wife . " I 'll see you later , Hon. " He started for the jail . " Come on , Rover , " he called and the little dog ran joyfully after him . Frederic and Laura Manion , I observed , had not touched each other during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Manion . She got in and I closed it and then walked around and sat in the driver 's side . " Will you please remove your glasses , Mrs. Manion ? " I said . " The name is Laura , " she said . " Remember ? If you can stand what you 're going to see , I guess I can . " She removed her glasses . " Good Lord ! " I said . In my ten years as D.A . I had never seen a pair of more grievously blackened eyes , and professionally I had been exposed to plenty . " Did Barney Quill really do that ? " I caught my breath . Her eyes were large and a sort of luminous aquarium green . Looking into them was like peering into the depths of the sea . I had never seen anything quite like them before and I was beginning , however dimly , to understand a little what it was that might have driven Barney Quill off his rocker . The woman was breathtakingly attractive , disturbingly so , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatant to the point of flamboyance ; there was something steamily tropical about her ; she was , there was no other word for it , shockingly desirable . All this was something of a trick , too , for a woman with two of the loveliest shiners I ever saw . I remembered something Parnell McCarthy had once said . " Some women radiate sex , " he had said . " All the others merely trade in it . " She raised her long eyelashes and regarded me solemnly , nodding her head . " Yes , " she whispered . " Barney Quill did this to me. "  | " You 'd better put on those dark glasses , " I said wryly , feeling a little giddy . I fumbled for a cigar . " Do you mind if I smoke ? " " Not at all , " she answered in her low voice . " That 's if you 'll give me a light . " ' We smoked in silence for a while . " I guess the first thing I 'd better find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to stay for the trial  --  to stay , that is , and help ? " rI'hc dark glasses abruptly swept around and bored into my eyes ; I could almost see the round staring of those greenish depths . " Why how can you ask such a thing , Mr. Siegler ? " she said evenly . " Whatever made you think I would n't stay ? " " Look , Mrs. Manion , " I said , " I ask it because as your husband 's lawyer I have to know . You 're a key witness in this case , and if you do n't plan to stay  --  stay and help out  --  I would say your husband 's chances for beating this rap are pretty slim . I figure they 're only about fifty-fifty as it is . And you still have n't answered my question . " I was sorry that I had asked her to cover her eyes . I felt that about now they might be revealing to watch . " The question is , are you with him or against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my ash tray . Her hand shook as she found a fresh one and turned toward me for a light . She inhaled the smoke deeply and held it and when she exhaled it seemed to escape her like a sob . " Steady , " I said quietly . " One can never tell how a case like this will turn out . " I paused , cautiously feeling my way , following my nebulous but growing hunch that all was not well between this woman and her husband . " One can never bank on the result of a jury trial . A key witness might go away , and a man still get off . Or a key witness might stay , and the man still go to prison . One never knows about these things . " She had listened tensely . " What did Manny tell you ? " she said . " I do n't mean about the case , but about us , about our lives together , about any plans we may have had for the future ? " Ah , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a thing , Mrs. Manion ; not a hint , not a clue , " I said truthfully . " That I swear . " " How could you know then  --  how can you sense ? " She broke off and again rubbed out her cigarette and turned and faced me . " Tell me , " she said , speaking swiftly , " how could you doubt but what I 'd stay and help ? Did it seem so  --  so obvious to you that there was any question that I might n't ? Tell me , please tell me . " " Why , Mrs. Manion , " I said blandly , " I 've never doubted for a  | moment but that you 'd stay . It 's just routine for us lawyers to try to make sure of our witnesses . I guess perhaps I was a little clumsy and blunt about it . I 've been away from this business for a little while . " " Was it because there was no sign of affection when we met just now  --  was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistened with tears . " Are you staying , Laura ? " I said . " Yes , " she said slowly , closing her wet eyes . " Yes , I 'm staying . That 's the least I can do for poor Manny . " " ' Then I noticed it , yes . You knew I did and I wanted you to know I did . And if you 're staying I do n't think it will be good if too many other people notice it . This is a small watchful community , doubly alerted by this murder , and , as in all such places , nasty harmful little rumors , often baseless , have a habit of traveling with the speed of light . " I opened the car door on my side . " Excuse me , Mrs. Manion , I 've got to go speak to the jailer . I 'll be back in a moment . We 've still lots and lots to talk about . " She leaned swiftly toward me with one hand on the seat . " Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a word . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , Laura , " I said , smiling . " But whatever it is , nary a word . "  | chapter 11 As I was leaving the jail I ran smack into the prosecutor , Mitch Lodwick , just leaving the sheriff 's office . We greeted each other and shook hands . The young prosecutor was a manly picture in tan : light tan summer suit , a pleated tan shirt and silk polka-dot tie , rich two-toned tan sport oxfords , a smart-looking waffle-colored soft straw hat with a folded tan ribbon . Then there was his tanned smiling face which made his flashing white teeth seem almost indecently incongruous . Ile looked as though he belonged more on the front porch of a country club than prowling Max Battisfore 's jail . " Well , Polly , " Mitch said , " Max just tells me you 're in the Manion case . So I guess we 're going ' round and ' round again . This one looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technicolor , Mitch , " I said . " Murder , rape and even a little dog . Hollywood could n't have done better . " Mitch smiled . " Alleged rape , do n't you mean , Polly ? " " I would n't know for sure , Mitch . I just got into the case and have barely met the lady . " Mitch grinned evilly . " Barely , Polly ? I hear tell in some quarters that the last man who barely met up with her died from lead poisoning . " He lowered his voice . " I was hoping I 'd run into you . " " Well , here I am , Mitch . What 's up ? " Was this , I thought , to be the word on the lie-detector test ? " It 's about a continuance , " Mitch said . " What do you say to our agreeing to continue the case from the September term over until the December term ? We 've both got this damned Congressional election coining up  --  remember ? ? and I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mere murder case . And Judge Maitland is still at Mayo Brothers ' and quite likely will not be able to sit in September . I assume you 'd prefer , as I do , to have him try the case rather than gamble on some unknown grab-bag judge assigned from downstate . What do you say ? " I stood there thinking . I found the offer attractive on all counts , especially the desirability of having my wise old judge with whom I had worked so long , Judge Maitland . The judge in this case , I saw , was going to have to be a real lawyer , not some amiable political mountebank with a black gown and a law degree . And there were still other good reasons , too , that Mitch had n't mentioned because he was n't aware of them . If the case was continued over to the December term , would n't I also have a much better chance to insist  | upon , and get , a substantial payment on my fee ? The Lord knew that that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining up a competent psychiatrist and getting my man through his paces , and my growing doubt whether all this could be done ? if indeed it could be done at all  --  in time for the September term of court . There was really only one big objection to a continuance : my client himself . " What do you say , Polly ? " Mitch said . " Do we continue the case ? I did n't think there 'd be any question . " I shook my head . " No , Mitch , I 'm afraid we ca n't agree to any continuance . I 'd like to , I really would , for all the reasons you say and several more . But murder , as you know , is an unbailable offense , and I ca n't very well ask my man to sit in Max 's jail here for an additional three months simply to suit our convenience . And there 's no assurance that Judge Maitland will be able to sit even in December . In fact I for one am getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , Mitch . I hope you see my point . " " I do see your point , " Mitch said , nodding thoughtfully . " Then how about copping your lieutenant out next month on second degree and getting the whole damned thing washed up and over with ? " I shook my head . " No , Mitch , he could still get up to life for that . Too rough , too risky . He would n't stand for that and I would n't let him . But I have a suggestion . How about your lowering the charge to manslaughter so that I can get my man out on bail ? That way you and I will get our cherished continuance , you can go out charming the voters , and I go out alarming the trout  --  and everybody lives happily ever after . Then before the December term we could seriously explore the possibility of his copping out to manslaughter , providing , of course , that you and Judge Maitland are sufficiently imbued with the spirit of Yuletide charity . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . You know that . Would you lower to manslaughter if you were still D.A. ? " Mitch snapped his fingers . " From life down to a fifteen-year max , just like that ? Ilow could I ever square that ? " " A nicely returned ball , Mitch , " I said , smiling . " But if I were D.A . and satisfied that Barney Quill had raped the Manion woman I really think I 'd seriously consider making a lower charge . " I paused . " Especially if I had a nice big fat lie-detector test , say , to luck me up  --  that 's if it did back me up . " I paused thoughtfully . " But I guess maybe I would n't lower the charge if I still thought the cape were alleged , ' as you just called it . "  | My reference to the lie-detector test had not been according to plan . But Mitch , who certainly knew the results , had just seen the Sheriff , and Max had doubtless related our recent conversation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked thoughtfully and cleared his throat . Then he moved deftly around me , like a shifty halfback , and opened the outside jail door . " Well , Polly , I guess it looks like we go to work soon . You do n't go for the continuance and I ca n't go for lowering to manslaughter . " Smiling . " But what are you going to use for a defense ? Old box tops ? Half the town of Thunder Bay saw your lieutenant plug Barney . " " Do n't fret , Mitch , I 'll come up with something . And as a last resort there 's always that reliable home remedy : Old Doctor Crocker 's Special Cure-all for Accused Felons . " " What 's that ? " I furrowed my brow into a Patrick Henry frown , clapped one hand across my breast and pointed scornfully at an imaginary jury . " Ladees an ' gen'emen ! " I thundered . " You cai n't guess this man into state 's prison ! Why , folks , I would n't send a yaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence ! " " Perfect , " Mitch said , laughing . " All you lack is Old Crocker 's red wig . Well , so long , Polly . " " So long , Mitch . " The jail door breathed shut on its pneumatic hinge and that , I saw , was that . Laura Manion was pacing up and down beside my car when I emerged from the jail . When she saw me she stamped out her cigarette and got quickly into the car . I had no sooner joined her than she began to talk , rapidly , breathlessly . " You 've seen Manny . . . . You 've told him , I know you have .. . and you told me you would n't . . . . Oh , why did you do it when you promised you would n't ? " She was perilously close to breaking down . " I should never  --  I ? I ? " " Mrs. Manion ! " I spoke sharply . " Please get hold of yourself . I have n't laid eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . " I twirled my lighter and held it , waiting until she had taken several deep drags before I spoke . " Am I forgiven ? " I said . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " But you left so abruptly  --  and stayed so long . Whatever kept you so long ? " " Did you see that handsome man in tan just leave the jail ? "  | She nodded . " Yes . Who is he ? " " He 's the old devil D.A. , Mitchell Lodwick . I 've just been talking to him . " I briefly recounted my conversation with Mitch . " So that 's what old Squealer Biegler 's been up to , " I concluded . " Am I reinstated in your confidence ? " " I 'm sorry , Paul , " she repeated , laying her hand impulsively on my arm . " I 'm so terribly upset and  --  and ? " " Afraid ? " I suggested . " Is that the word ? Are you afraid of your husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I paused and went on . " I think I have a right to know what gives between you two . I ca n't very well do my best if I 'm working in the dark . " Again she took off her glasses and looked at me , long and searchingly . I felt as though I were gliding to the bottom of the sea in William Beebe 's bathysphere . I fumbled to find a cigar and tore my eyes from hers to light it . " Yes , " she said , in a low voice . " I 'll trust you , Paul . And I 've simply got to talk to someone or I 'll explode . I  --  I ? " She paused and smiled . " I do n't know where to begin . " I flicked my cigar at the ash tray . " Suppose you begin with my question , " I suggested . " Are you afraid of your husband ? " When she spoke it was as though to herself . " Afraid ? Afraid ? " She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fear , precisely , it  --  it 's something at once more subtle and more degrading than that . Have you ever been jealous ? " " You mean over a woman I cared for ? " She quickly nodded her head . " Yes , that 's what I mean . Of someone you really loved ? " " Mercifully no , " I replied thoughtfully . " Not ever seriously , that is , beyond occasional pangs . And that was long ago . . . . I consider jealousy the most corrosive and destructive of all emotions and I long ago made up my mind that I refused to be jealous of anyone or anything . Life is simply too goddam short . But my views on jealousy wo n't help your husband beat this murder rap and yours might . " I paused and went on . " Is jealousy at the bottom of the tension between Manny and you ? " This was an important and possibly serious development and I had to know . She sat thoughtfully silent . " Yes , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any single word . " She closed her eyes for a moment and then continued . " I 'll try to tell you , " she said . " Manny has always been jealous of me , even before we were married . I should have known how it would be . But then I found it only flattering  | and protective . " She paused . " Afterwards , after we were married , I discovered how  --  how terrible it could be . " " We 're playing truth , now , Laura , so I wo n't beat around the bush . Did he ever have any possible reason to be jealous ? " Iler answer seemed too swift , too certain , for dissembling . " No , no ! Ncvcr once . And God knows it was not for lack of opportunity . " She smiled , and her smile had about it a certain little-girl quality of wistfulness and pathos . " This thing ? " she gestured vaguely ? " whatever it is f have  --  has always been . . . difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to have you think I do n't like gaiety and fun and flattery , " she went on . " And men , too , but not in the way that Manny apparently thinks I do . He 's jealous of any man I meet in t he most casual way . In fact he 's probably jealous of you at this very moment . " I gave an involuntary start and for a prickly instant I could visualize a lager trained on my back . Then it occurred to me that there was always the possibility that she was gilding the lily , that , being emotionally upset and understandably distraught by her recent experience she was somehow trying to expiate her sense of guilt . I remembered suddenly that my client had the day before spotted my fishing gear in my car . My car was parked in the same place . There was one way to find out a few things , a fast and simple way . " Excuse me , " I said abruptly , and I quickly got out of my car and elaborately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing casually up at the jail windows . Despite the dust and soot there was no mistake : I had caught a retreating-glimpse of a familiar dark be-mustached face , the merest flash of disappearing Army khaki . Now any poor man had a right , I conceded , to stand and stare out of his cell window ; in fact I knew that some of them simply had to , like animals in a cage . But here the quick retreat had done it , had told the story ; the jealous Lieutenant stood convicted ; I now saw ilnat this woman was probably telling me the truth . " Arc you all right ? " she inquired anxiously as I regained my place beside her . " Leg cramps , " I said wryly . " Please go on with your story . " " Well , there is n't much more to tell . I thought when Manny got assigned up here that things would be better . This was n't his regular outfit , you know . " " Were they ? " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , they were worse , if possible . It just  | meant a whole new strange crew of men for him to be jealous over . " She paused . " Manny 's really a grand person , but he 's strangling my feeling for him . How can you continue to love a man who constantly makes you feel like a  --  a common street-walker ? " " Go on , " I said . I did not propose to digress any further on jealousy or the male 's reactions to it . " Just two weeks ago we attended an Army cocktail party at the hotel . Some silly half-drunk young second lieutenant I 'd never seen before kept following me around and calling me Cleopatra . He was just a boy , I suppose I could have been his mother . Finally he playfully grabbed and kissed my hand , like an overzealous puppy . It was just one of those things all Army people experience and understand . But Manny knocked him down . That 's the last time I was out  --  socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was even half jealous of Barney Quill . " I pricked up my ears . " IIow do you mean ? " " We 'd gone to Barney 's bar several times . It was about the only decent place to drink in town . Barney was one of those loquacious blarney-tongued operators who 'd flatter a witch on a broomstick provided only she was wearing a skirt . He paused at our table once or twice  --  he did the same at most of the others , too  --  and ran out his poor little stock of complimentary banter , the same dreary sort of thing I 've heard in a hundred bars and Army posts , with or without Manny . But this time Manny went into one of his more elaborate sulks . So we quit going to Barney 's bar . " " Was there any incident  --  any scene ? " I asked , holding my breath . " No , thank goodness . Manny made me hurry my drink and we left . " She shook her head . " It was so utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tragic . And I feel so guilty . " I spoke casually . " Have you mentioned any of these things we 've just been discussing to the state police ? ? or to anyone ? " " Heavens no . I told them all about the  --  the incidents of that night , of course . I had nothing to hide . " " You are sure of this . Think back now . " " I am positive . " " Did you tell them about the sexual attack by Barney ? And all the rest , both before and after the attack ? " " In great detail . " " Did you tell all this during your lie-detector test ? " " Why , yes , of course , " she said impatiently .  | " Who first suggested that you take this test ? " " I did . I 'd read about them somewhere . " She incuriously studied her nails . " Do you know the results of the test ? " " No , I have n't given it a thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one result . I told them the simple truth . Heaven knows that was bad enough . " I had not meant to tell either the Lieutenant or Mrs. Manion , at least for the time , that I knew the results of the lie test ; this , not only to protect Sulo but for certain reasons of my own . I now saw I would have to change my plans . " Well , you passed the test , " I said . " It showed you were telling the truth . " " Oh , " she said , with mild interest . " Did that handsome young prosecutor just tell you ? " " You see well with your dark glasses , madam , " I said . " No , the handsome prosecutor did n't tell me . I ca n't tell you how I know , but I know . There are certain trade symptoms I have learned to recognize . " One of them occurred to me as I spoke . Mitch surely knew the results of the test , and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me so to aid his cause when he was making his pitch for a guilty plea to second degree murder . He had no reason then to hide the results of a bad test  --  bad for our side  --  and several good selling reasons not to . Why had n't I thought of it be-fore ? " Does Manny know ? " she said . " Not yet , but I 've decided to tell him . " For it was now plain to me that I 'd have to reassure this troubled man , and fast , or we perhaps might not need to employ a psychiatrist or anyone to tell us he was insane ; he actually would be . " There 's one more thing , " I said . " Do n't tell a soul you know the result of this lie-detector thing . If people ask you  --  anyone  --  simply tell them you do n't know . This may be vital . Do you promise ? " " Just as you say , Paul . And you wo n't tell Manny these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thought . " Heavens no , my good woman . And do n't you . " " No , of course not , " she said , smiling wanly . " Now we have secrets . And I do hope I have made you see certain things more clearly . " " I 'm beginning to see a number of things , " I said .  | She again quickly placed her hand on my arm . " Please do n't think I have said any of this to criticize Manny . Or to be disloyal . He was  --  he is  --  so tender and good in so many ways . He 'd go through hell and high water for me . " " He might even kill for you ? " I said . She buried her face in her hands and I regretted having spoken . I was afraid she was going to cry . " Steady , Laura , " I said . " The man probably ca n't help himself . I sometimes think that jealousy is a disease  --  a sort of disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . . . . You want to help him . As his lawyer I want to help him . " I paused . " Now I must go . I want to talk to you in the morning . Tonight I must work on this case . I suggest you go put on a little scene of loving reunion with Manny for the benefit of Sulo and the Sheriff . But mostly , I guess , for Manny . I 'm getting a little worried about that man . " " Thank you , Paul , " she said . She extended her hand and I took it . " You 've been very understanding . I feel much better already . " She kept her hand in mine . " We have secrets , now , Laura , so I 'll tell you another one . I would n't have mentioned it except for what you 've told me this afternoon . " I looked down at her hand . " Your husband 's jail window overlooks my car . " She colored and withdrew her hand quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open her door . I forced myself not to look up at the jail window . " Good night , Paul , " Laura Manion said , smiling . " Good night , Laura . Keep the chin up  --  like a good Army wife . "  | chapter 12 That night I worked late in my office . I looked some law and wrote out a letter for Maida to sign for me and send the Lieutenant 's commanding officer , reviewing the case and its problems and putting in an urgent request for an Army psychiatrist . Then I left a note for Maida to tell Parnell McCarthy I wanted to see him at my office late the next night . " After fishing , " I added defiantly . Then I fell into my unmade bed . " Hi , Sulo , " I said . " Greetings from the early bird . I want to see the Lieutenant for a minute . How about my skipping up to his cell and saving a lot of commotion ? " " Sure , sure , skip away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big brass key and admitting me to the inner sanctum , the jail proper . " Three flights up , den turn right , den walk to end  --  his cell door 's unlocked  --  an ' dat 's where you Lieutenant live his new address . " Sulo chuckled over his little joke . I managed a wan little smile as I started up the steep iron-shod stairs . " If Mrs. Manion shows up tell her to wait in my car . " As I trudged up the clanking echoing stairs winding through a maze of pipes of all kinds , water pipes , sewer pipes , steam pipes and miscellaneous brackets and girders , all done in battleship gray , I reflected that men could apparently get used to almost anything . Thousands of men , all over the world , lived in places like this and worse . I thought of the hundreds of uncomplaining iron miners only a few miles away who daily plunged down into the chill and damp of ill-lit holes in the ground where for hours on end they groped their way about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , of the time I had once inadvertently wandered into the sawyers ' room of a flooring mill , while campaigning , and had suddenly been so clutched and frozen by the demented screaming and awful banshee wailing of the dozens and scores of whirling saws  --  each presided over by a calmly oblivious workman  --  that it was only with physical effort I had turned and fled the place in terror . Even my usually dogged zeal for votes for Biegler had failed to hold me . From a distant cell I heard an unseen player strumming softly and expertly on a guitar , accompanying a quavering falsetto voice , a voice plaintively beseeching his sweetheart to meet him on that opposite shore . I stopped and held my breath , suddenly caught and  | wrenched , helplessly plucked at the heartstrings , unaccountably moved by this wry mingling of sadness and comedy . I resisted an impulse to go seek out this anonymous artist , to take his hand , to behold at last a person who did n't treat this haunting evocative instrument as a species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must not get sidetracked . I shrugged and moved on , reflecting that I must have been a guitar-playing gardener at some Spanish hacienda during a previous incarnation . Pablo O'Biegler , no doubt . " Oh , tell me you 'll leave me no more , " the quavering voice pursued me . " When we meet on that opposite shore .... " " Hello , Polly ! " someone called from one of the nearer cells , and I recognized the wreckage of one of Chippewa 's more persistently dedicated drunkards . This gaunt alcoholic specter was gaily waving at me , as though it was I who was caught in jail and he instead a mere passing visitor . I waved back , not very gaily , and as I toiled my way up the last flight of stairs I heard him explaining in an extravagantly loud voice to his cell neighbor just who I was and what a hell of a hard-boiled prosecutor I had been . " But good , though . Boy ! Why , that Polly there even once sent me to prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nice , I thought , to have such a grateful and satisfied customer . " Good morning , Lieutenant , " I said . My client was sitting on his unmade cot reading a newspaper , clad in old fatigue trousers and a white T-shirt , his dark hair rumpled and uncombed and his face unshaven . Except for the smudge of mustache he reminded me of a photograph I 'd once seen of Lawrence of Arabia . " Oh , good morning , good morning , " he said , quickly rising and pointing to the lone stool next to the gaping seatless toilet . " Please sit down . I  --  I did n't expect you quite so early or I 'd have been ready . " He gestured at his cell . " Forgive the appearance of this ? t his ? " " Sty , " I said helpfully , sitting down . I had forgotten how oppressively squalid the cells really were . Nor had I realized that the man had carefully groomed and dressed himself for his daily sessions with me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , " this may help take your mind off your surroundings . " It was Thomas Wolfe 's Look Homeward , Angel . " I hope you have n't already read it . " " Oh , thanks . Thank you very much . " He examined the thick book gingerly . " No  --  no I have n't read it , " he said . He leaned over his cot and carefully shoved the book under his pillow , patting the  | pillow to hide it . " Have n't ever heard of it , in fact . " He laughed briefly . " I 'm just a typical army type , I guess , interested only in three things : in wine , women , and war , or as I once heard a soldier say in Pusan , in beer , broads , and battle . Is it any good ? " " Good ? " I said . " Good ? " I repeated . " It was written by a ravaged whale of a man  --  written with his own threshing flukes dipped in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't climb way up here to talk of Wolfe . " I lowered my voice . " I came to tell you that your wife passed her lie-detector test . She was telling the truth . " The Lieutenant sat staring at me in tense coiled silence . He stared searchingly , almost uncomprehendingly . The dark eyes fluttered . Then : " How do you know this ? " he said , his voice suddenly gone husky with emotion . His eyes , too , had grown narrow and slitted with craft . My hunch , I felt , had not been wrong : he had suspected her all along . " I ca n't tell you , Lieutenant , " I replied steadily . " But I know it is true . " I paused . " There is now not the slightest doubt in my mind that your wife 's story is true in every important particular  --  including the rape . " The lieutenant had closed his eyes and sat , tight-lipped , shaking his head quickly from side to side . " The poor bastard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The canker of doubt had still been gnawing at him whether it had really been rape , whether she might n't have encouraged or even solicited Barney Quill . " There 's one more thing , " I said , rising to leave . " We must not let anyone know that we know what we know . That makes a nice cryptic sentence , does n't it ? I mean the result of this test . " I turned to go . " I understand , " the Lieutenant said . " You 're leaving so soon ? Oh , l suppose you prefer to wait for me below . " He smiled and glanced about his cell . " I would n't much blame you . I wo n't be long . " He arose and walked to the cell door . " I wo n't be seeing you until some time this afternoon , Lieutenant , " I said . " Oh , by the way , I wrote the Army last night about furnishing us a psychiatrist . I held out the tin cup and piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your wife . I expect we 'll have a rather heavy session this morning . " I paused . " I would prefer that you were n't there . " The Lieutenant stood frozen in his tracks . " But you talked with her yesterday , " he suddenly blurted . " You talked for  --  for over two hours . Why  --  I ? " He had paused , fallen silent , and stood nervously chewing his lower lip .  | " Yes , Lieutenant ? " I said , turning and facing him . " Have you said all you wanted to say ? Are you done ? " The man 's face was a brick-like crimson . " I  --  I was just thinking , " he said . I stood watching the man , wavering between scorn and pity . " Lieutenant , " I said softly , " I do n't think I 'd like to know what you 're thinking . I do n't think I 'd really like it . You 've already revealed quite enough . " I paused . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are in enough trouble already without dreaming up any more . Now come off of it , Lieutenant . Please . We 've got to fight a real danger  --  this damned murder case . " I held out my hand . He still stood there frozen , still flushed and frowning , his eyes unblinking , his lower lip caught in his teeth . There was a perceptible pause and then he took my hand . " Yes , sir ! " he said , and the phrase escaped him like a pent jet of steam . I turned and quickly left . As I clattered down the ringing jail stairs I whipped out my handkerchief and patted my forehead . The guitar had fallen silent . It seemed that I still had a client . I discovered that I was running and I slowed to a walk . Reaching the bottom I rattled the big main door like a man fleeing from nightmare . " For Christ 's sake let me out of here , Sulo ! " I shouted . " I need air . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bowels in a uproar , " Sulo said , hurrying to release me from  --  from precisely what I did not know ... . I stood outside the jail door , breathing deeply . God , it was good to be alive and  --  and free from witnessing an open cancer of jealousy . When I reached the car Laura Manion and her little dog were awaiting me . " Did you tell Manny ? " she asked eagerly before I fairly got seated . " How did he take it ? " " Did I tell him what ? " I said sharply , knowing what she meant and feeling an unaccountable prick of irritation . What kind of a pair of emotional juveniles was I getting mixed up with ? " Why , the results of the lie-detector test , of course . I could scarcely wait to ask you . " " Oh , that , " I said almost gaily , fighting back the dark mood I seemed to be in . " Yes , I told him , " I said airily . " Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep mum . " I paused , feeling not unlike a sort of badgered and teetering diplomatic referee , like someone trying to promote sweetness and light , say , between the SoViets  | and the U.S.A. " Everything 's under control , " I went on . " He 's getting himself and his bachelor quarters tidied up and I plan to see him after lunch . In the meantime I 'd like to hear your story . I want it from A to Z. Would you care to light up ? " " Do you want me to tell it just as I told it to the state police ? " " I want it just as you told it to the state police , plus , " I said . " Plus what ? " I smiled . " Plus , my dear , what you did n't tell the state police . Come now , I.anra , you 're a smart woman and you 're doubtless several light years ahead of me . I want all the story  --  plus all of the angles , good or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell your lawyer what he may have to face and fight ? " " Where shall I begin ? " she said , smiling . " Suppose , " I said , " suppose you begin at A. "  | chapter 13 " I had ironed most of the afternoon , " Laura Manion said , beginning on a nice domestic note . " Manny had got home from the firing point a little later than usual , about six o'clock  --  I mean the night of the shooting . " She was wearing slacks and a tight sweater  --  I saw I 'd have to speak to her about that  --  and had drawn her legs up under her , sitting cross-legged , Indian fashion . " I think he 'd stopped off at Barney 's bar with some other officers and had a round or two of drinks  --  he was sleepy and hungry . " " Was he drunk ? " I said . " Oh , no , just so-so  --  just relaxed , merely a pleasant glow . " " I see , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? I mean about his sleepiness , about the pleasant glow ? " " I did n't tell them and they did n't ask me . " " Very well , " I said . " Go on . I 'll try not to interrupt unless I have to . " Laura Manion went on with her story . Manny had taken a brief nap before dinner ; then he had eaten ; then he had taken another nap . Later he had awakened and asked for a highball , but there was no whisky in the trailer ; then he had wanted some beer , but there was no beer . Laura Manion had suggested that they go visit Barney 's bar but Manny had grunted and turned his face to the wall . " And what were you doing all this time ? " I said . " Being frightfully bored , " she replied . " I had n't been out of that damned trailer in over a week , except to shop . It was beginning to feel like a cell . " " Cleopatra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironing board of a mortgaged trailer . " There was something faintly incongruous in the picture . " Go on , " I said . Manny had again fallen asleep . A full moon had swum up out of Lake Superior , sifting through the pines surrounding the trailer . It was a gorgeous summer night and for a time she had sat watching the shimmering lake . Laura had finally awakened Manny and told him she planned going to the bar at the hotel to get some beer . Would he like to go along ? Manny had yawned and thought no , but said he might join her later . Then he had fallen asleep again . This time he had begun to snore . He had sounded , she thought , " like a missing outboard motor . " Laura had listened to his snoring as long as she could and then she had called her little dog Rover and taken her flashlight and walked  | up to Barney 's hotel bar , taking the path through the woods . That was her regular route to town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been shortly before nine o'clock , she could n't exactly remember , anyway it was getting dusk . She must have got there in about ten minutes . Barney 's hotel bar was almost deserted , there were only a few customers , and those mostly locals . No , there were no Army people . There might have been a tourist or two . Oh , yes , the tourist park where the Manions stayed was quite full ; it was that time of the year . " Tourists to the right of us ; tourists to the left of us . ... " The only others in the bar were the bartender , whose name was Paquette , she thought , and a blonde waitress called Fern something or other , she was n't quite sure of her last name , perhaps Malmquist or Youngquist , something like that . We certainly had some rather odd names up in this neck of the woods , did n't we ? " Yes , " I admitted . " Up here Smith is an odder name , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you arrived ? " " No , he did n't appear until later . I ordered a highball  --  my regular drink , a bourbon and tall water  --  and then I went over and played the pinball machine . " " Pinball ! " I said , recoiling in horror . Somehow or other I could n't quite visualize this beautiful creature and pinball . " You played pinball ? " I asked her incredulously . She smiled , defiant in her waywardness . " I love to play pinball , " she said . " I guess I 'm funny that way . " " You share your neurosis with millions , " I said , shaking my head sadly . " Why there are even some people who love to square-dance ? square-dance to hill-billy music sung through the left nostril . I have beheld it with these tired old eyes . " " An Army wife has to find some way to pass her time  --  and still stay an Army wife , " she said . " Anyway , I love it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone on playing pinball ; there was no escape from it ; more lights had lit , more bells had rung , still more colors and numbers had flashed and cascaded , the machine was wracked with more tremors and seizures  --  and she had gone on playing pinball . Then Barney Quill had appeared quietly at her side and challenged her to a game for a drink . She had accepted his challenge and they had played and she had won the first game . Yes , Fern had served them their drinks over at the machine . " This Barney  --  what shape was he in ? " I said . " How did he act ?  | Did he seem to be drunk ? Did he  --  did he make any kind of a play for you ? " " He appeared sober to me . And I must say he acted like a gentleman . In the place , that is . There was no suggestion of any play " ? she paused and smiled ? " and from long experience I think I 've grown fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . Did the police ask you about this , too ? " " Yes . And I gave them the same answer , because it was true . He was friendly and courteous , no less and no more . " " Go on , " I said . " When did you finally wrench yourself away from the hypnosis of pinball ? " She and Barney had played several more games . They had had some J of their drinks at the bar . During the evening she had had three or four highballs ; she was quite sure it was not more than four . No , she was not intoxicated , just feeling relaxed and enjoying herself , perhaps about like Manny had felt when he had come home for supper . Then she had noticed it was nearing eleven so she ordered her six-pack of beer and made ready to leave . It was then that Barney suggested that he drive her back to the trailer . Yes , he was still courteous but she had thanked him and declined , saying that with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking . Barney had then warned her that there were a lot of strange characters floating about the town at that time of the year and that he felt it was his duty to see the Lieutenant 's wife safely home . And then he had mentioned the bears . " Bears ! " I said . First there was pinball , now there were bears . Little Laura and the three bears . " What bears ? " I said . " It seems that nearly every evening the black bears move in to scavenge the village and trailer-park garbage dumps . I remembered that Manny had mentioned seeing a bear one night while driving along the main road . Then I recalled that one of our soldiers had wounded one only the week before . " " What did you do ? " " Well , by that time I was of half a mind to ride with him but I knew that Manny did n't like Barney  --  or any man that was nice to me , for that matter  --  so I again declined and thanked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest room , back beyond the pinball machine , to tidy up so that when I was ready to leave I could slip out the side door of the bar without further notice . " " I understand , " I said . Laura Manion had lighted her flashlight when she emerged from  | the rest room and given it to Rover  --  he carried it in his mouth like a bone , it was his little trick  --  and she and Rover had slipped out of the side door as she had planned . " What happened then ? " I said . Someone standing in the shadows had said " Psst ! " and come forward . It was Barney . He had the motor of his car running and he again asked her to let him drive her home ; once more he expressed his concern over the anonymous characters and the bears . " What ( lid you do ? " I said . " Well , it seemed frightfully dark outside after the brightly lit barroom . And , foolishly as it turned out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any strange men . It also struck me as ungracious and rather insulting for me to continue to refuse him . It seemed much easier to let him drive me home  --  it was so close . So I consented and Rover and I got in his car , Rover sitting between us with his flashlight . " " Go on , " I said . " Well , Barney drove down the main road to the regular car entrance to the trailer park . It 's only a short way beyond the footpath I had taken earlier while coming to the hotel . When he turned in toward the tourist park I remember feeling a little silly for having refused a ride so long  --  for there he was , driving me straight home , just as he had promised . " " Proceed , " I said . " There is a little stretch of heavily wooded road just before you get to the boundary of the tourist park , the main entrance . When we got there I saw a gate closed squarely across the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened then ? " " As I started to open the car door and thank him for driving me home he laid his hand on my hand or arm  --  not forcibly , just lightly ? and told me that he had forgotten that the caretaker locked the gate at night ; that he knew of another little road into the park that had no gate and would not be closed ; and there was no use in my getting all dusty going through the fence and walking the sandy road , he 'd gladly take me the other way . With that he backed the car swiftly out to the main road and shot it into forward gear and drove away down the road  --  in a direction still farther away from the hotel bar . " " Up to that time had you felt any particular sense of alarm ? " " No , none whatever . "  | " All right . Then what happened ? " " He drove rapidly down the road and then turned abruptly off the main road onto a strange narrow two-rut road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the first time I had any feeling that things were not right . I said , ' Barney , where are you going ? ' Instead of answering me he grabbed my arm , tightly this time , and kept driving furiously . I do n't know how far we drove . Suddenly he stopped the bouncing car and turned out the lights . By that time I was thoroughly alarmed and I opened the door and tried to get out , but he dragged me back in . He was terribly strong . Then Rover the dog started to whine and Barney opened his door and threw him out . All the while he had n't spoken a word . I could n't see a thing , but I could hear Rover whimpering outside . " " Go on , " I said . " Then Barney got close up against me , very close , and said in a hoarse wild voice I could scarcely recognize that he was going to rape me . " " He used that word ? " " That 's the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across  --  that was also his expression  --  or I 'd never get out of the car alive . All the while he was pawing away at me , trying to get at me , and I was trying to fight him off . " " Up to this time had you screamed ? " " No . I guess I sensed it was no use ; it seemed like we were miles from anywhere ; it was like being marooned in the middle of a jungle . And I was growing terribly afraid now that he might kill nee , as he had threatened . " " Go on . " " All the while he kept clawing at me and beating me on the knees with his fists , a regular tattoo . I had my knees clamped together . I felt myself growing weaker . Finally I said : ' If you do this to me my husband will kill you . ' " " You told him that ? " I said , wincing my eyes shut . p " Yes , I was getting desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and bring him to his senses . And furthermore I meant it . " This opened up certain glum vistas ; vistas , I saw , that should mightily please an alert prosecutor . But now was no time to get into that . " What happened then ? " I said . " My saying that only seemed to make him worse , if anything . He laughed , if you could call it that  --  it was a horrible cackling sound  | and said Manny would n't have the guts to kill him ; that he , Barney , was one of the best pistol shots in Michigan , in the Midwest , anywhere ; that he was a whiz at Judo and I do n't remember what all , and that he could take on a dozen Army guys like Manny with one arm tied behind his back . He ranted on like a madman . It seemed he was just about the best there was at anything . " " IIm , " I said . " Interesting , very , very interesting . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to me Manny would kill him  --  we were struggling all the time , remember  --  and with that he suddenly crouched away from me and hit me with his fist . Hard . He swore at me. ' fake that , you goddam Army slut ! ' is one of the things I remember he said . I almost lost consciousness . I felt something ripping as he tore off my panties . About all I can remember after that is that he kept clawing and beating away at my knees like a maniac . I was practically out . I could hear the dog whimpering and crying outside , scratching at the door . " I was watching her closely during this recital . She did not sigh or weep or hesitate ; rather she told her story as though she were trying faithfully to recount some bad dream . " And then what ? " I said . " Well , finally I knew he was  --  well , he had succeeded , he was getting his way . " " You 're sure of that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . I still ache from the man ; I did not want him ; I was . . . . Surely you understand all this .... " " Go on , " I said , nodding . " IIe was like a raging beast . I did not fight any more . In the first place I could n't any longer ; anyway it seemed better to have this awful nightmare over with . I lost all track of time . All I recall is that suddenly he was n't at me , that Rover was back beside me , that the car was moving once again . I must have partly fainted . All I wanted then was to get away from this madman . It seemed as though he wanted to rend something ; to tear it apart . " " Did either of you speak ? More than you have recounted , I mean ? " " No , no other words were spoken . Barney was breathing deeply , almost like a dying man , a hideous guttural noise between a sob and a moan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a way  --  this may sound terribly odd to you  --  one of the worst parts  | of my experience . It was as though he was about to cry , to break down . . . . " She shook her head . " I still hear it at night . " " Go on , " I said . " Finally we were out on the main road . Then I saw we were again nearing the locked gate . I grabbed for the door and got it partly open at the same time that Barney grabbed for me . I could n't get out . he wanted to take off my sweater . . . . Then he wanted me to totally undress . We 'd try it that way , he said . He was like a madman , all the time plucking away trying to rip off my sweater . By this time the car had to stop or it would have hit the gate . I somehow again opened the car door and Rover leapt out . His flashlight was still burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill me , ' I thought . I suddenly gathered myself and somehow wrenched away from him and ran . I could see Rover with his light running furiously back and forth between an opening in the fence . I ran towards him , towards the light . " " Did you get through the fence ? " " I do n't really know . Barney was suddenly upon me . He tripped me and kicked me and then fell on me . Then he started hitting me with his fists , hard , all over my face and body , repeatedly . I swear he was trying to kill me . I felt myself fainting , I was nearly out . That was when I screamed . I screamed two or three times with all my might . Suddenly I discovered that I was alone , running , following Rover and his light , running towards our trailer . I tripped and fell and got up again  --  I do n't know how many times  --  but always I kept running toward the light . " " You saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook her head . " No . I never laid eyes on him again  --  alive or dead . " " Go on , " I said . " As I got to the door of our trailer Manny was just coming out . He seemed only half awake . He told me later he 'd dreamed I was screaming and woke up . I fell into his arms . " I looked at my watch . " Do you want a rest ? " I said . " Maybe to smoke or walk the dog ? " If she did n't , I did . " No , no , " she said , and then she smiled . " But perhaps you do . " " I think I 'll take a five , " I said . " In the meantime you can collect your thoughts . "  | chapter 14 " If you do this to me Manny will kill you , " Laura Manion had said . And she had been right ; she had known her Manny and Barney had n't . Barney had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right ; lie had marched out and killed Barney . The reaction had been as starkly primitive and elemental  --  yes , and as inevitable  --  as holding one 's hand over an open fire : perforce the hand would be burned . If Manny had been insane that night then Barney himself must have been stark raving mad . In fact the certainty that something bad would happen to him if he raped Laura Manion cast the biggest doubt on her story . What in hell did Barney Quill think would happen to him if he did but half of what she claimed ? Had the man been trying deliberately to destroy himself ? Who was this guy Barney Quill ? What was his trouble ? I saw I still had lots and lots of work to do ; that there were still many baffling questions in this weird case . " Manny will kill you , " she had said . The fateful phrase buzzed like a gnat in my ears . And as the defense lawyer I did n't pretend to like it . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ; the fatal words had been uttered . I shook my head . Lawyers were something like actors , I reflected : their range was limited by the play ; they had to take the script as they found it ; they dared not change the words or tinker with the dialogue . When they did they became either ham actors , on the one hand , or else shysters . What Laura Manion had said was natural enough , Heaven knows , but I was sure that if I had been writing the script I would not have let her say what she had said . For one thing , in one breath did n't it take a lot of wind out of the sails of our insanity plea ? Did n't this revealing warning she had given Barney tend rather to stamp the act as a deliberate killing done in a fit of murderous retribution and revenge , just as she had predicted ? And had she told the police what she had told Barney ? Perhaps even more important , had she told Manny what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband that he go out and dispatch the doomed and waiting Barney ? Well , I would find out very soon . " Laura , " I said , beside her in the car once again , " did you tell the police about warning Barney that Manny would kill him if  --  if he molested ' you , as our family newspapers love to call rape ? " " Yes , yes , of course . I told the police everything that happened ,  | everything I could recall that was said and done . Was n't that all right ? " " Yes , of course . " I proceeded calmly . There was no use in my uselessly scaring her . " And did you also tell Manny what you 'd told Barney ? " I held my breath as I awaited her answer . " Yes , he was the first one I told , " she replied . My heart sank . This could be a serious development in the case , not only marring the effectiveness before a jury of our claim of insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputable psychiatrist would now ever find insanity at all , in view of it . Well , I had better get all the bad news at once . " And did you also tell the police that you had already told Manny ? " I asked . " Yes , " she replied , and my spirits sank even lower . " I told Manny about it on the way driving in to the jail . The officers undoubtedly heard me and anyway I told them again later . " My spirits soared and I could almost  --  but not quite  --  have hugged her . " You mean , " I said , " that the first time you told Manny was after the shooting ? ? not before ? " My mounting concern and sudden relief had been totally lost on Laura . " Why , yes . I never thought of telling him before , " she replied easily . " I guess I was afraid , too , that Manny would do just what he did do . I knew the man . . . . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wearing that night ? " I said , veering abruptly away from this troublesome subject . " Were you dressed as you are now ? " Looking again , I was somehow hopeful she was n't . But then , had n't she already mentioned wearing a sweater ? " Well , " she said thoughtfully , " I had on a sweater , one very much like this " ? I winced inwardly ? " and a skirt and a slip and panties . " " Any girdle ? " I inquired hopefully . " Heaven 's no , " she said . " I never wear the things . " " These . . . panties that Barney tore off  --  who has them now ? The police ? " " I 've never seen them since . We gave the ripped skirt to the police . The next day the police drove me and Rover in to the spot  --  they apparently determined it by some fresh tire burns nearby on the grass where Barney had evidently turned around , and also by the way poor Rover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached over and affectionately patted the dog as she spoke ) , " but they never found my panties though they scoured the woods all around  | the place . All they found were my glasses  --  still intact , thank goodness . " " Glasses ? " I said . " You mean to tell me you were wearing glasses through all this ? " " No , not wearing but carrying them in their case . I 'd been holding them in my hand and in the struggle with Barney when I first tried to get out of the car I must have dropped them . " " Why are n't you wearing them now ? " I said . " Well , right now I 'm afraid I still need my dark glasses . " She laughed her rich chuckling laugh . " Anyway I only use them for reading or anything close up . I had used them to play pinball that night . " She again laughed . " I 'm surely glad they found them  --  I ca n't even read a headline without my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another small score for our side . It was going to be hard at best , I saw , to tone down this concupiscent-looking creature , but I would have to make the try . However she might despise wearing a girdle she was damned well going to have to wear one at the trial . I 'd have to remember to tell her . " I seem to recall that you or your husband mentioned something about moving your trailer , " I said . " What was all that about ? " " I 've moved our trailer from the tourist park in Thunder Bay down to a small private trailer lot in Iron Bay , " she said . " First of all , I wanted to get away from that  --  that place " ? she paused ? " and also get away from the tourists and curiosity seekers . Ever since that night they have surrounded the place , almost day and night , it seemed , as though I were some kind of two-headed monster . I was in a state of siege . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , owlishly staring at me or boldly asking that Rover and I pose for their cameras . Some were even bold enough to want to discuss the details of the case with me . I 've never seen such an exhibition of morbid prying curiosity . " She shook her head . " The price of fame , madam , " I said. , " But you have n't seen anything yet . Just wait till the trial . You will discover that morbid curiosity is not confined solely to tourists . It 's the nature of the human beast , I 'm afraid . " " You  --  you think the trial will be crowded ? " she inquired anxiously . " Solidly , " I said . " The case has everything . Rape , murder . Even a little dog . " But I saw the look of " courtroom fright " overtaking her again so I swiftly changed the subject . " Did you tell the police substantially the same story you have told me , up to now ? "  | She nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " I had to . That 's the way it was . " " Well , " I said . " You have told it very well , well and effectively . It has the ring of truth . I only hope you can do as well in court . " " Thank you , Paul , " she said . " I 'll certainly try . " " There 's one more thing  --  an important thing . " " What 's that ? " she said . " You understand of course that when we 're in court during the trial the prosecutor will get to question you when I am done ? " " Yes , I supposed that he would . They always do in the movies , do n't they ? Wagging their fingers and all ? " " Well , he may try to shake your story , or confuse you , or try to bring out things that we might not ourselves particularly like to bring out . I can not now predict what they might be . But do you follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impress upon you , " I continued , " is to at all times tell the truth . I think that so far you have been , but Mitch ? I mean the prosecutor  --  may try to draw things from you , possibly new things , that in your natural confusion or desire to help you may feel are better to hide or soft-pedal  --  or even to lie about . " I paused . " Do n't do it . When in doubt tell the truth . It 's the best little confounder of clever cross-examination in the business . I know whereof I speak . Now I 'll try to keep Mitch from roaming too far afield , but the latitude allowed in cross-examination can be deadly and Mitch may nevertheless try to give you a bad time . " Laura shook her head . " Why should he try to do that to me ? And he looks so open and frank  --  so nice and kindly , too . " " He may try it to shake or cast doubt on your story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big problem in this case and he will know it . Do n't you see , Laura , if he can keep pecking away at you and lower your guard and get you to tell some silly little untruth on some minor point , and then later in rebuttal or in some other way demonstrate that little lie of yours to the jury  --  if he can do that , then maybe he can cast a doubt on our big truth  --  the bitter and otherwise unescapable truth of the rape . Do n't you see ? It 's one of the oldest tricks in the law . " " Yes , I see , Paul . But why should he try to shake my story on the rape ? He already knows that I told the truth  --  he has his own liedetector test to tell him that . " I laughed , a little cynically , I 'm afraid . " Dear woman , " I said , " a  | lawyer in court trying to win a big case is like a newspaper man sitting on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never . At such times a lawyer would betray his own grandmother . So help me , I 've clone it myself . In fact I used to be quite a little bearcat at the business . " She shook her head . " How utterly sordid , " she said . " I  --  I thought the law was above that . . . . Flow can a lawyer possibly try to twist and pervert what he already knows to be the truth ? " " We lawyers quickly develop a protective scar tissue to take care of that , " I said . " It 's all rather simple . It is our lofty conviction , hugged so dearly to our hearts , that our cause is basically just and right and that those on the other side are just a pack of lying and guilty knaves . " I shook my head . " It 's merely the same old dilemma of man in a new guise : that supposed noble ends can ever justify shabby means . Mitch will tell himself  --  and with considerable force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Manny no legal justification to kill him . So the man must be guilty . From there it 's only a small jump , a mere breeze , to convincing himself that the ultimate truth or falsity of the rape does n't really matter . Do n't you see ? " " I 'm afraid I do , " Laura Manion said , nevertheless shaking her head dubiously . I was growing afraid that I had told her too much too early and had maybe built up in her what lawyers call " court fright , " the legal version of mike fright or camera jitters in the amiable world of radio and television . But it had to be done ; it would be no easier if I sprung it on her just before the trial ; and this way she could perhaps at least have time to ponder and learn to live with her burden . " Do n't let the prospect get you down , Laura , " I said . " All you have to do is open those big eyes of yours wide and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anyway , and here we must make sure that nobody tells any small untruths so that we can protect our big truth . I hope I can cuff the prosecution all over the lot with that . So let 's not weaken our rape story to gain any small temporary triumphs . " It was refreshing , I reflected , that legal strategy and the truth could occasionally walk gaily hand in hand . " ' Thank you , Paul , " she said , touching my arm briefly . " I 'll open my eyes real wide and just let the truth flow out . " She paused and smiled . " You really want to win this case , do n't you ? " " Did n't you know , madam , " I said , laughing , " that I too am convinced  | of the justice and right of our cause ? The prosecution is nothing but a pack of lying scoundrels . You see , it 's an occupational disease of us lawyers . " I glanced at my watch . It was nearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restlessly up and down his cell , peering anxiously out of his sooty window , drilling my back with his smoldering dark eyes . " Speaking of your big wide eyes , " I continued , " I want you to go find a photographer today and have your black eyes photographed in all their glory . And all your bruises , too . They 've faded out some even since yesterday . To make sure have him take at least two shots of each pose . When this thing 's all over , I 'll give you a set to place among your souvenirs . Better go to Tom Bennett ; I 'll phone him first . I do n't want him playing up your bruises  --  they scarcely need that  --  but I also do n't want him to go artistic on us and play them down . As a class these picture men have a weakness that way ; they seem to want to make everyone come out looking like week-old albino rabbits . I 'm a Mathew Brady man myself . And do n't you go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . " Then come back over here when you 're done . I want to hear the rest of your story . " " It shall be done , Paul , " Laura Manion said , laughing . " And I promise to look like a perfect witch . " " That , madam , " I said gallantly , " will take a bit of doing . "  | chapter 15 If clients and witnesses sometimes suffer from courtroom jitters , lawyers themselves occasionally come down with what might more clumsily be called " preparation-of-the-case " jitters . That noon while I ate lunch at the Iron Bay Club I thought I detected some preliminary twinges in myself . The symptoms are subtle and rather hard to pin clown ; I seemed suddenly gripped by a feeling of unreality about the case and its possible outcome , a wry sensation of inadequacy and doubt , a notion that I was somehow missing the boat ; an anxious feeling that I had got so close to this damned case that I could n't see the forest for the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwich poised in mid-air . I abruptly took a big bite into it and one or two of my fellow diners glanced quickly in my direction , as one does when a creep is abroad . " Wrong order , " I muttered in a sandwich-muffled voice . " Place goin ' plumb to hell . " Tentative trial strategies which seemed inspired from on high were now crowding in and colliding head on with still other but inconsistent strategies which had seemed no less brilliant at birth . It was high time , I reflected , that I get to hell away from the turbulent Manions and their tangled emotional problems and turn my searchlight on the raw case itself . From there on it was only a breeze for me to decide to go fishing . I sighed and pushed my unfinished sandwich away and went upstairs and phoned the county jail . " Is this you , Sulo ? " I asked , as though there was anyone else in the whole wide world who could say " Iron ' Liffs Gounty Yail speaking " with half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biegler , " I went on . " Look , Sulo , please tell the Manions that I 've been unavoidably detained and wo n't be able to see them this afternoon . " " You been wat ? " Sulo shouted , and it came back to me that he had always shouted over the phone ; he ' was one of those resolute diehards who would never quite believe that such gadgets were here to stay . " Look , Sulo , tell my Army man I wo n't be there today . Yes .. . I mean no . . . I wo n't be there . " I too was shouting . " Have you got it ? I wo n't be there ! I 'm sick , I 'm going fishing , I 'm drunk ! I wo n't be there ! " " Sewer , sewer , sewer , Polly , " Sulo said mildly . " Vy do n't you tell me dat in da first ' lace ? You vo n't be over here today . "  | " Good-by , Sulo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Vat you say ? " Sulo shouted . " I wo n't be there ! " I shouted back , closing my eyes and resting the receiver gently on its cradle . Yes , it was about time to go fishing . But it was still too early and far too bright for good fishing so I ordered a bottle of beer and picked up an outdoor magazine and idly thumbed the pages . The mosquito-infested crisp-bacon world of outdoor sportsmen , I saw , was this season fast going to hell in an outboard motor . Tucked away between the jungle of ads I found an article on a new way of plug casting for bass . I read it , as one sometimes macaberly reads the obituaries of complete strangers . The incongruity of my reading about bass or bass fishing , which I loathed , reminded me of the time my friend Raymond and I had once , on a fishing tip , visited the shack of old Dan McGinnis , the king of Oxbow Lake . Danny lived by himself ? " batched " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remotest areas of the county . One had to walk the last several miles to get there ; not even the best jeep could quite negotiate that bush country . We had found old Danny sitting by his window , patched elbows propped on his checkered oilcloth-covered kitchen table , poring over a tattered old pulp magazine . His lips were moving silently as though he were reciting a litany . So absorbed was he in his reading that he barely looked up when we stomped in and dumped our packsacks and fishing gear on his floor . " What are you reading , Danny ? " Raymond had politely asked . " Oh , who me ? " Danny replied , annoyedly looking up . " Why , I 'm readin ' a story about a kind of a hermit fella what lives ' way up in the north woods  --  all by hisself . He 's slowly goin ' crazy , it says here . Livin ' all alone all year ' round . Can you imagine the likes of a pore crazy bastard doin ' that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yep . Damned int'restin ' , though ! " And there I now sat , in the heart of some of the finest trout fishing in the country , reading an article designed to teach poor trapped city guys and Indiana farmers how they might catch more wormy bass , a fish that I personally regarded as scarcely a cut above a chain-store lobster . I slammed shut the magazine and stalked out of the place and down the street to Doc Trembath 's office . The Doctor 's office was crowded as usual , and as usual mostly with glowering and stoically pregnant women , who were his specialty ; but Doe 's receptionist was an understanding woman who  | seemed to sense that my own pregnancy was more advanced , and in a few minutes I was seated beside the doctor himself , an enormous big bulking field marshal of a man with the gentle long-suffering mien of an overworked angel . " I 'm defending the Manion murder case , " I said , shaking his big paw , " and believe it or not I need some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fallen . Please try to give it to me straight ? not in the pig Latin you doctors ordinarily use . " " Fire away , " Doctor Trembath said , sighing wearily and lighting a cigarette . " You 've doubtless read about the case in the papers , including the fact that Manion 's wife claims that Barney Quill had raped her , " I said . " Yes , " the Doctor said . He was a quiet sort of man , and he rarely wasted words . The women adored him ; a sheer case of the attraction of opposites . " Well , the lady in the case , Laura Manion , is a fireball of a woman . She 's now living with her second husband . Could a doctor tell by examining her whether she had been raped ? " The Doctor slowly shook his head no . " Or that she had recently had intercourse ? " " Only if a smear showed spermatozoa . " " The Manions tell me that old Doc Dompierre tilted her up over at the jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smear with a swab stick . He has since reported it was negative for male sperm . " " Did he first dilate the  --  vaginal opening ? " Doc asked , mindful of my warning against medical Latin . " The Manions say no . But is the way he did it kosher ? " " That is not the way I would have done it , " the Doctor said . " But is it one medically accepted way ? " I persisted . " No , " he said . " I would say it is definitely not . " " If it appeared that the lady was excessively tender and sore ? might not that be some evidence that she had been forcibly had ? " The Doctor looked up at the ceiling and blinked thoughtfully . " I would rather put it this way , " he said , speaking carefully . " The symptoms you speak of are purely subjective , so a physician could not himself testify as to her pain and soreness . There would thus be no direct physical evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could testify to . But if the woman 's claim as to such soreness were true and also her claim that it was the result of an unwelcome act of intercourse  --  if her story was believed , in other  | words  --  a careful physician could testify that this was some evidence that the intercourse had been against her will . " He paused and smiled faintly . " I suppose I do n't have to tell you that a normal woman has to be receptive to the act  --  she has to be ready . I further understand that among you lawyers the woman 's unwillingness is an important element of legal rape . " " Right , Doctor , " I said . " But would you so testify if you were asked in court  --  that her sensitivity could have been the result of intercourse against her will ? " He thought for a moment . " I would want to examine her first , " he said . The good Doctor had led with his chin . " Good , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunted and gestured wearily at the roomful of waiting females . " Another one more or less wo n't make much difference , I guess . " He sighed . " Sometimes I wish I had taken up steamfitting ? some trade where I could just throw clown my wrench and walk away when the whistle blew . " " Perhaps , Doctor , " I said , " perhaps your world view is growing a trifle too confined . " He smiled wanly . " When do you want to send her in ? " " How about this afternoon ? " " I suppose . Yes , send her along . " " Will you also check her for any possible bruises and lacerations , there or elsewhere , and please make notes of your findings ? " " Yes , yes . Send her along . " " Thank you , Doctor . Now just one more question : Is there any way that an autopsy on Barney Quill could have shown that he had had intercourse shortly before his death and reached a climax ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By possible stains on his body or clothing , and better yet by examination of the seminal vesicles , which would naturally be depleted  --  that is , if he had recently reached a sexual climax . Here , I 'll show you . " He reached over and selected a thick medical book and flipped the pages and showed me and explained a picture of the complicated things that happen to the human male as he embarks on love 's last embrace . " Ah , nature , it 's wonderful , " I said , when he was done . " But I think that henceforth I 'll stick exclusively to fishing . "  | " May I ask if an autopsy was performed on the deceased ? " the Doctor said . " I assume so , " I said . " That 's the only sure way the People can prove the cause of death  --  which is part of what we lawyers call the corpus delicti , you know , if you 'll excuse my foreign accent . " " Was an examination made of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That 's exactly what I do n't know , Doc . That 's one of the reasons I came to see you . " I had come to the hard part , and I paused . " Would you have any objection , Doctor , to testifying for the defense on these things  --  if it should become necessary ? " I said . " In fairness I should add that it probably will become necessary . " The Doctor sat pondering and puffing his cigarette . Here was a grievously busy man , one of the busiest and best in the county . Yet could I much blame him if he shied away from getting mixed up in such a malodorous and flamboyant murder case ? " Doctor Orion Trembath , prominent Iron Bay physician and surgeon , today testified for the defense ! " the newspapers would proclaim . And he would naturally anticipate all that . " Doc , " I said softly , rising , " this Lieutenant of mine ? ' way up here among strangers  --  he 's a pretty goddam lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll try to find someone else if  --  if you 'd rather not help . " The Doctor crushed out his cigarette and arose and extended his hand . Tall as I am he towered over me . " If the going gets too rough , " he said , " you can count on me . " " Thank you , Doctor , " I said . " I hope no one 's popped out there while we 've been talking . " The stoically pregnant women seemed to glower harder than ever as I , the interloping male , one of the hateful carefree breed responsible for their plight , stole through their swollen ranks and clattered down the stairs . Ah , but they did n't realize all the fine mechanical secrets I now knew about their husbands and lovers . And anyway I had got my doctor , the one I had wanted , one whose opinions were not for sale to the highest bidder . Outside I found that the sun had clouded over . I glanced up at the weather tower . A gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the wind is from the west , that 's when fishing is the best . " My nostrils began to dilate . I walked back up to the club and called the jail again and asked Sulo to please get the Lieutenant on the phone . The Lieutenant , it appeared , was still sitting there waiting for me . Sulo would put him on . " You lawyer man vants you ! " he shouted .  | " I wo n't be over this afternoon , Lieutenant , " I said . " Yes , Sulo just told me a while ago . I 'm waiting for Laura . Is everything all right ? " " Just getting a little punchy , is all , and I 'm going fishing . I want to be alone to roll some spitballs for Mr. Lodwick . " The Lieutenant laughed , and I briefly told him of the arrangements I had made for an examination of his wife later that afternoon by Doctor Trembath . " Please see that she gets there , " I added . " But she already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggrieved voice I was getting to know so well . " Yes , I know , " I said . " Then is n't he enough ? Do we need two ? " I mentally counted to ten . " I do n't want to seem picky , Lieutenant , but I happen to consider your particular doctor professionally on a par with Amos Crocker . In fact he must have recommended him . " I paused . " Listen , Lieutenant , I 'm getting a little weary of having to threaten to pull out of this goddam case every time I want your consent to any recommendation I make . But I should warn you  --  if you insist upon having that doctor I think you 'd better also plan to stick around and wait for old Crocker 's leg to mend . They 'd make such a charming pair ; they both improvise so well . 1 ) o I make myself clear ? " " You do . " " Now are you sending your wife over to the new doctor ? " There was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sipping of the tiny mustache , the biting of the lower lip . " I 've been counting ten , Lieutenant , and I 'm almost there . " " Yes , damn it ! I 'll send her . " " Ah , that 's better . Now I can away to my fishing with a carefree heart . " " I hope you fall in . " " What 's that ! " " I said , damn it , I hope you have good luck . " " That 's the old fight , Lieutenant . I heard you the first time . Now you 're talking my language . " " Will you be down tomorrow ? " I had n't thought of it before , at least consciously , and my answer came out of a clear sky . " No , Lieutenant , I wo n't be down tomorrow . I 've just decided it 's time for me to visit the scene of this business . Tomorrow I 'm going to Thunder Bay . " " When will I see you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't pin me down . I 'll see you when I sec you . Right now I 'm going fishing . " So I went fishing and my heart was carefree and gay . At dusk I snapped my leader on two trout of voting age and finally , just at dark , latched on to grandpa and the fight was on . " Come , come , sweet lover darlin ' , " I coaxed and wheedled . " Come to daddy , come to daddy . " Twenty minutes later I went into the familiar daisy hoop and slipped the net under him . " Ah . . . . " It was my biggest brook trout of the season . It looked like a dappled and dripping slice of sunset in the wavering light of my flashlight . But best of all , for twenty whole minutes I had managed to forget all about the Manion case .  | chapter 16 ' When I got home from fishing I found old Parnell McCarthy dozing on the bench that the chiropractor across the hall had thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parnell sat with his chubby hands locked across the front of his colorful Tattersall vest . I had picked the vest up for him , much to Maida 's dismay , on one of my Canadian fishing trips ; it was among his proudest possessions , perhaps something like a barber and his Cadillac ; and it occurred to me that I 'd never once seen him button his coat across this flaming garment since I 'd presented it to him the year before . I secretly longed to wear such a vest myself , but , craven soul , somehow lacked the nerve . Parnell rocked gently as he slumbered . " Whistler 's delinquent little brother , " I thought wryly . The old man 's series of chins rested gently on his chest and when he exhaled his puttering lips sounded faintly like a far-off motorboat . Well , not so far off , I thought judiciously ; rather more like the blubbery trumpeting sounds that my father Oliver 's horses used to make with their lips after I had watered them down for the night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound in years . Parnell sighed and trumpeted away . I stood looking down at my old friend . I leaned forward and smelled his breath . " Ali , apparently sober , " I concluded with relief . I sniffed again to make sure . Just then Parnell opened one eye and caught me at it . " Ought to be ashamed of yourself , boy , " he rumbled , " sniffin ' an ' spyin ' on an old gentleman just after taking his evenin ' catnap ? not catnip ! " He lurched heavily to his feet . " Where in hell was you at ? I nearly gave you up . Ah , fishin ' , I see by your outlandish and evil-smelling costume . What fetid malarial bog did you wallow through today ? And must you get yourself up to look and smell like a beachcomber to catch a mere fish ? You see , I can sniff , too , my fine laddie buck . . . . C'm on , let 's get going , boy . There 's work to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from B to bunghole . I 'm fairly dyin ' to hear it . " I unlocked my office and brought in my fresh laundry which was resting against the door . I waved Parnell to a comfortable chair , put my fish on ice , got into my pajamas and an old bathrobe , lit a fire which thoughtful Maida had laid in the Franklin stove and turned out the lights . Then I sat and told Parnell the whole story , the good and the bad , my plans and hopes , all my fears and anxieties .  | He sat quietly through the whole recital , for the most part silent and unblinking , at times looking variously , in the flickering firelight , like a statue of Judgment , an aging satyr , a seedy race-track tout , the Buddha himself , the late W. C. Fields , a bust of Socrates  --  and even that lovely old ad for Lash 's Bitters . But mostly , thank goodness , he looked like good old shrewd old kindly old Parnell McCarthy . Parnell interrupted me rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that his alert mind was racing , racing faster than the numbers and lights on a runaway pinball machine . It felt good just to have him there , and already some of the confusion and uncertainty that had oppressed me earlier in the day seemed magically to disappear in the simple act of telling . Down across the deserted square the cracked bell of the clock in the city hall tower sounded one . I loved its wavering clangor . The bell had been cracked since November 11 , 1918 , and any city father that suggested replacing it courted swift political oblivion . The sound was more of a jarring thud than a knell ; a prolonged metallic shudder , as though some giant armed with a sledge had struck a broken rail . At length the dissonant echo faded and died away . " Well , Parnell , " I said , " what does the prosecuting attorney say ? Does the defense have a Chinaman 's chance ? Do n't spare my feelings . Give me both barrels , my friend . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and tugging at the grizzled slack of his throat . This was our little game . During most of my time as prosecutor Parnell had acted as a sort of volunteer attorney for the defense . We had " tried " all my big tough cases in advance , sitting by the Franklin stove or across the top of Grandma Biegler 's old dining-room table . Thus had Parnell hammered and tested  --  and frequently revised ? the theory and strategy of my cases on the stout anvil of his mind . He was , as I had told Mister Cool , my legal whetstone . This sagacious old man was in fact probably the biggest single reason I had run up , as D.A. , the record of convictions of which he seemed so much prouder than I. I often wondered why he bothered and I sometimes sensed vaguely , as I sensed now , that to him I was a sort of what-might-have-been . " Do I have a chance ? " I repeated . " Of course you 've got a chance , " he began gruffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , boy . Do n't sell yourself short . It 's poor psychology and , worse yet , in your case false modesty , too . It does n't become you , boy . Let us please dispense with the chat of the bull .  | You 're good and you damn well know it . " He shook his head . " Quite a case , boy , quite a case indeed , " he said musingly . " I  --  I only wish I were in it . " He sighed . " It 's been many a year since I 've wished that about any case . " This was the opening I had been waiting for . " You 're going to be in it , Parnell , " I said quietly . " Right up to the hilt . All you got to do is say yes . What do you say ? " It grew silent . Parnell sat very still and I thought for a moment he had dozed off again . I leaned closer and saw that his eyes were open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they glistened suspiciously , but I may have been mistaken . " You mean that , boy ? " he said , barely above a whisper . " You really want me in your big murder case ? " " You heard me , Pam . I want you , I need you , and I mean it . I 'm not being magnanimous , either . I simply and selfishly need your goddam help . You know what winning this case means to me , I do n't have to tell you . " " I  --  I 'll do it , Paul , " he said , " but on one condition . " " What 's that , Parn ? " " That Parnell McCarthy stays behind the scenes , strictly in the background . You understand ? Not even your client must know . Nobody but us  --  and Miss Maida , of course . There must be no leak . " " Why , Pam ? " I said . " Tell me why ? " This was an interesting development . Parnell snorted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man settin ' at a counsel table would be enough to queer any case , " he went on . " Lord knows you got hurdles enough to get over without addin ' me . And if anything went wrong  --  the ever unpredictable jury you know , boy  --  I would n't want that on my conscience or on yours . I  --  it 's better that I do my sittin ' beside you in spirit . I 'll be close by in any case . " He paused . " And there 's one other reason , boy . " " Tell me , Parn ? " " When you win this case I want it to be solely your victory . You 're already on the right track , boy , you know that , and you do n't really need me . You won lots of your big cases before we ever became friends . I 'll try to help in my own fumblin ' way , of course , but it 's enough for an old party like me to see you make the grade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused and , almost angrily , cleared his throat . " I  --  I ? Oh , hell , give me one of those awful Eyetalian cigars . I 'll smoke it out of self-defense  --  that abominable stinker of  | yours is makin ' me eyes smart . Lord help me , it smells like a Bermuda onion . Is it really an onion now , boy ? " " I understand , Parn , " I said , passing him a cigar . " I 'll accept your terms on one condition . " " Ah , what 's that , now ? You 'd think we was after discussin ' the terms of a goddam ninety-nine-year chain-store lease . Whatever is your fine condition now ? " " That we share whatever fee I get straight across the board , " I said . " I told you what it was and  --  and the chance I 'm probably taking in ever getting it . " Parnell blinked his eyes . " What you aimin ' to do , Paul ? Make an old man bawl ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I mean it , Parn , just like I meant asking you into the case , " I said gruffly . " We share the fee or no partnership in the case . That 's only fair . " " Bless you , boy , I 'll do it . I 'll do it to help you and humor your generous whim . Having said that it may be ungracious and commercial-soundin ' of me to add that if you do n't get paid before the trial you probably never will after , win or lose . " He laughed briefly . " I have to say that now so you wo n't think it 's money I 'm after , which God knows I ai n't and never been . But you are n't either , Paul , you 're a lawyer , too , not a misdirected shopkeeper who 'd mistakenly gone to law school . I 'm pleased and mighty proud that you would undertake to defend this lonely man with  --  without ? " " Look , Parn , " I broke in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got little or nothing to do with my taking this case . Do n't give me that blarney . Please , Pam , please  --  do n't try to build me up into a bleeding liberal . Now please lay off . " " The role fits you more than you think , boy , more than you think , " Parnell went on . " Now you listen to me . You did n't consent to continue your man 's case when that young Mitch fellow gave you the golden chance , did you ? No you did n't . Now you could have sold that continuance to your client and you know damn well you could , still keepin ' your hand in the case for all your other reasons , and still givin ' yourself more time to pry some money out of him . And more time for your fishin ' . All this you could have clone . I say I 'm proud of you , damn it . You would n't let the poor bastard lay in jail for another three or four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Poke up that fire and fetch me a bottle of beer . " He grimaced . " I 'd just as lief drink mare 's water but there 's work to be done  --  and let 's get down to business . "  | I drew myself up proudly . " I 'll have you understand , Mr. McCarthy , that I pay over five bucks a case for my beer . Every bottle is tested by virgins in rubber gloves . No finger touch . I 've even seen Heinle the brewmaster on TV . Charming articulate fellow who talks through a permanent mist of sauerkraut , like my great-uncle Otto . Mine goot friendts , dis malt , dese hops  --  da pest vat money can puy , ya ! ' Authentic , see , very Old World , and all done purely for love , like mother 's bread . Perhaps you 'd prefer some nice tepid tap water instead . " " Get on wid you , " Parnell said , grinning and holding a match to his cigar , then archly cocking his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there virgins ? "  | chapter 17 Parnell took a sip of his beer . He swallowed , looked thoughtful , and then made a wry face , like a small boy distastefully eating his spinach . " The original diagnosis was correct , " he said . " Better you sue your goot friendt Heinie , ya ! " " Very well , Mr. Prosecutor , " I said . " Quit slandering my hospitality . Let 's have your reasons why my man should be convicted . It 's getting late . " He stared at me vacantly for a moment and then leaned forward , speaking earnestly . " If I were prosecutor , boy , " he began , " I would hammer relentlessly at this one big question : If the defendant Manion did not take a gun and go to Barney Quill 's bar solely to kill him , why in hell else did he go there ? Members of the jury , ' I would say , here is a man who deliberately takes a loaded pistol , secretes it on his person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife  --  and pumps him full of lead . Why , why , why  --  if it was not solely to kill the man , which is promptly what he did ? ' " Parnell paused , his gray eyes glowing and alight . " Does defense counsel concede any merit in this argument ? How , my resourceful friend , do you propose to get around that ? " " Go on , Parn , " I said . " There 's more , much more . Hit me with all of it and then I 'll try to fight back . " " Yes , there 's more to it , " Parnell continued thoughtfully . " In connection with this same line of argument , and also to dispute your claim of insanity , I would keep harping on the fact that , immediately after the shooting , the defendant apparently threatened to shoot the bartender , who followed him from the place , and then returned to his trailer and gave himself up to the deputized caretaker of the trailer camp with these significant words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Take me in , Mister Policeman , my mission is accomplished ; I went there to get Barney and by God I got him . ' Are these the actions of a crazy man , of a man who did n't know what he was doing ? Why , even his wife , who knew his jealous nature , predicted he would kill Barney  --  and I 'm damned if that 's what he did n't . " " Objection , Parn , " I said . " No fair on that jealousy business . That 's inside information I hope the prosecution does n't and wo n't have . But otherwise you 've been hitting me where it really hurts . " " Objection overruled , " Parnell continued coolly . " This young Lodwick fellow is inexperienced and all , and perhaps no great heavyweight  | as a prosecutor , at least yet , but he 'll simply smell jealousy from her statement that your man would kill Barney if .. .. And if lie does n't smell it the jury probably will anyway . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parn , " I said . " You know it 's got me worried . But I would argue back that here was a woman in a desperate plight  --  about to be raped  --  who seized at a straw , a last desperate deterrent stratagem , the threat of physical retaliation and punishment if Barney should rape her . What else could the poor woman do or say ? And after all , how in hell could she know what her husband might do ? just how many other men can the People show he had killed for raping her ? And think of how much worse it would be if before the shooting she 'd told Manion what she 'd told Barney . " " Good boy , Polly , " Parnell said , nodding . " Yes , a fairly good answer , young man . Did you just think of it ? " " I guess I 've been brooding about it all the time I was fishing today . " I shook my head gloomily . " But there 's still a lot of work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , I 've an enormous lot of law to look . I simply have n't had time to get at it . Anyway , I 'd like to get all the facts first . All we want are the facts , ma'am . " " We 've got a lot of work to do , " Parnell said reprovingly . " We 've got a lot of law to look . Remember , I 'm in this case now , too , young man . " " I sit corrected , " I said , smiling . " But right now you 're the prosecutor . Proceed with your indictment , Mr. D.A . " After that Parnell and I kicked the case around , planned strategies , rejected them , substituted others , pondered how we might get in evidence of the rape , how the prosecution might block it , how we might try to bring out at least the fact of Laura 's lie-detector test ... Parncll finally hauled out his silver watch . " Lord help us , I have n't been up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tonight , lad . Now get along with you to bed . We 've both got to keep our wits about us in this here case ; it just reeks with lovely points of law . By the way , judge Maitland will be sitting , I do hope . " I shook my head . " No , Parn , I 'm afraid not . He 's still over at Mayo 's and his condition is n't good . " " Who then ? " " I have n't the foggiest notion . And if Mitch knows he is n't saying . I hope it is n't one of those dreary downstate political hacks  --  we 're going  | to need a real lawyer on this one . By the way , I 'm driving up to Thunder Bay tomorrow to have a look around . Want to come along ? " " Bless you , of course I do . I been standin ' here waitin ' for you to ask me . And Maida , too ? " " Maida ? " I said . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types letters and rcads Mickey Spillane . " " Maida , " Parn replied firmly . " There 's detective work to be done . If there 's some nice ripe skulduggery up there in Thunder Bay , a smart woman will nose it out . 1 . , Iaida is smart and she goes along . That 's an order from senior counsel , young man . " " Yes , sir , Mr. McCarthy , " I said meekly . " Please , sir , when do we cave ? " " Sharp at eight from your office . " " But Maida does n't get here till nine . And I have n't the heart to phone her at this ungodly hour . My God , it 's after two . " As Parnell walked to the door there seemed to be a sprightliness in his bearing I had n't seen in years . " Set your clock and call her at seven , boy . Old Thomas Edison thrived for years on four hours rest . Does a young man like you want to rot in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work to be done and we must up and away . We 're leavin ' here at eight . " " Yes , sir , " I said . " Anything more , sir ? And many thanks , Parn . You  --  you 've already given me lots of food for ulcers . " Parnell hooked his thumb through the armhole of his tattersall vest and grinned his irresistible melting Irish grin . " Good night , Polly , and God bless you . Tonight you 've made me feel more like a real lawyer than I have in years and years . " lie paused . " Now I  --  I must hurry away before I really break down and bawl . Good night , goddam it . " " Good night , Parn , " I called softly after his plodding retreating figure . I went to the phonograph and put on a recording of Debussy 's haunting " The Blessed Damozel . " Then I sat in the darkness staring into the fire . Little unseen bellows seemed occasionally to fitfully fan the dying embers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated the eternal fascination and mystery of fire . . .. I sighed ; I was tired , tired bodily and mentally . " So now , Bicglcr , " I mused , " you 're about to become a private eye . " It was a new role for me and I wondered if I would do half as well as Parnell had in his new role as prosecutor . The phonograph took over , the women 's voices now murmurously  | joining the orchestra , swelling , fading , soaring into ecstasies of moving and melancholy sound . I sat there covered with gooseflesh until the last strains had died away . The fire was out . I shivered and tottered my way to my bedroom , set the alarm clock , yawned prodigiously and flung my pajama bottoms in a corner  --  and fell on the bed , asleep instantly . I dreamt a dream , an interminable dream about a monster brook trout that seemed bent upon pulling me into the water . For a while it was touch and go . All that finally saved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm . I squinted one eye open ; it was broad daylight ; Detective Biegler must be up and at the keyhole.  | chapter 18 So sinless and devoted to the pastoral virtues is the Upper Peninsula that trained private investigators are virtually nonexistent . As everywhere , of course , there are the usual proportion of yearning adolescents and occasional eccentrics who have won a tin star and a fingerprint outfit from one of the mail-order diploma mills , the kind that turn out detectives in twelve easy lessons . But these groping souls would do us no good ; they generally wound up with a black eye or in reporting on dead beats for credit bureaus at two dollars a head . More often they wound up with the black eye anyway , after which they tended to enroll in courses on advanced refrigeration . Peninsula lawyers or clients or anyone requiring the services of a real private detective had perforce either to import one or do it themselves . Since my client could n't even pay me or his psychiatrist , let alone a detective , hiring one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play detective ourselves . Thunder Bay was a former logging and commercial fishing village on Lake Superior that had quietly swooned and expired when the white pine was cut and the fish were caught . After sleeping through a generation or more of genteel Rip Van Winkle poverty it had been rediscovered and miraculously resuscitated by the advent of those curious seasonal wanderers , that modern American gypsy known as the Summer Tourist . As the care and feeding of tourists had more and more absorbed the attentions of the townsfolk , more and more had I avoided the place ; as a class tourists had a tendency unduly to grieve me ; and it came as something of a shock to recall that I had not been near the picturesque old town in a dozen-odd years . Barney Quill , a comparative newcomer , was nothing more to me than a name ; I seemed to have read about him once or twice in the newspapers ; he had shot a bear or caught a big fish or some such thing ... . As Maida and Parnell and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front seat of my coupe , I saw that I had forgotten how beautiful the drive to Thunder Bay was ; the towering sighing groves of fragrant Norway pines , the broad expanses of clean white sand , the sea gulls , always the endlessly wheeling sea gulls ; an occasional bald eagle seeming bent on soaring straight up to Heaven ; the intermittent craggy and pine-clad granite or sandstone hills , sometimes rising gauntly to the dignity of small mountains , then again sudden stretches of sand or more majestic Norway pines  --  and always ,  | of course , the vast glittering heaving lake , the world 's largest inland sea , as treacherous and deceitful as a spurned woman , either caressing or raging at the shore , more often turbulent than not , but today on its best company manners , presenting the falsely placid aspect of a mill pond . " I 've been thinkin ' , " Parnell McCarthy began . " Please , Parn , " I begged . " Please , not about the damned case , not now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . Sometimes I think I fish too much . " " I 've been thinkin ' , " Parnell solemnly went on , " that it 's been well over a quarter-century since I 've troubled to come along this way . That last time my Nora and I were in a buckboard drawn by a team of bay mares .... I 've been thinking of what fools indeed we mortals be , letting all this beauty languish unseen while we , like suicidal lemmings , hurry on our way to our obscure graves , chasing dollars , chasing women , chasing trout , chasing the dubious pleasures of the bottle . " He sighed and took a deep breath . " The waste , the hideous waste of living ? it 's enough to make one weep . Boy , I must indeed mend me ways . " " Stop , Parn , stop , " Maida said , giggling like a schoolgirl . " You sound more and more like Cyrano . If you keep on like this I swear I 'll fall in love . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Rostand ? " I inquired silkily . " If I may say so , I think we 'd better flee this lovely lake shore before all of us start cracking up . " The car toiled up a steep granite bluff , the roadway hacked out between towering walls of solid rock , and then began the long descent . There , spread out before us , was the village of Thunder Bay , as neat and ordered as though viewed from an airplane , clustered tightly among the tall pines along the edge of the glittering and now peaceful bay that had given the town its name . " And now to the wars , " I said , clamping a fresh cigar in my teeth and stepping on the gas . I speculated a little on what it was that drew the tourists to this remote place . It lacked the reek of ancient lore possessed by St. Ignace , with its great new bridge and " authentic " Indian chieftains in fill regalia solemnly selling the lamblike tourists equally authentic litindred-year-old tomahawks made the winter before in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sault Ste. Marie , which could boast , and endlessly did , that its locks annually handled more tonnage than any in the world ; its shoreline was not  | adorned with the tinted and dramatic Pictured Rocks of Munising ; it lacked Marquette 's imposing iron ore loading docks , each dwarfing in height and length even the Queen Mary . No , the town did not possess any of these alluring tourist properties ; it had no golf courses or crumbling fortresses ; it had no tall roaring waterfalls from the top of which a monotonous procession of legendary Indian maidens had leapt for love and love alone ; it lacked any medicinal springs to throw orange peels and coke bottles into or any copper or iron mines or towering ski jumps or Indian burial mounds or places to dig for agates or ancient arrowheads ; nor had it any displays of two-headed calves or trained bears or wolves or even any mangy coyotes . Nor , final ignominy , had any of its hamburger stands or lunch counters , so far as I knew , been blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possessed the simple but incomparable attributes of rural quiet , fresh sea-washed air which blew the mosquitoes away  --  and great natural beauty , a beauty as yet unmarred by man . And , as I presently saw , it certainly had the tourists ; the place was teeming with them ; and I slowed down abruptly to avoid collecting a representative specimen on my fender , a prospective trophy more revolting for me to contemplate than the head of a bull moose . " Look where you 're driving , Mac ! " my near specimen shouted . " Excuse me , " I apologized contritely , " I should have taken the sidewalk . " We drove slowly up the main street of the town , past the tourist park on our right , nestled in among a tall grove of pines on the lake shore , past the usual cluster of gas stations , a grocery store , the post office , then two churches and , as though to achieve proportion and balance , an abrupt rash of neon-lit taverns , the inevitable souvenir shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the long street , on our right and overlooking the lake , stood a large white and attractive three-story frame structure . A screened-in veranda ran along the entire front and half the side nearest the lake . This was the Thunder Bay Inn , in the barroom of which the proprietor Barney Quill had mct his death such a short time before . The last time I had seen the Inn it had been boarded up and now , freshly painted , it was a mecca for school marms and summer tourists . A short distance past the Inn I stopped the car and turned off the key . " Well , Parn , " I said , " what 's the strategy ? " " Polly , " Parnell said , " I suggest you drop me off at one of the smaller taverns  --  no fear , I 'm not going to drink  --  and then drop  | Maida at the beauty shop for a manicure or something . Both strike me as being likely spots to begin our search . Then you his yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon enough that you 're in town and they 'll be expecting you . So you might as well go there first and be done with it . Then I suggest we all meet back at the hotel around noon and have lunch and possibly compare notes . What do you think ? " I nodded . " Sounds fine to me , Parn . " " But I do n't need a manicure , " Maida pouted . " Anyway , I do my own nails . " Parnell bowed gallantly . " I will grant that any attention from these sordid entrepreneurs of beauty to your comely person , dear lady , would be carrying coals to Newcastle , " he said , " but I 'm equally sure that your great wit , matched only by your ravishing beauty , will suggest to you a plausible reason for visiting their malodorous precincts . " " I 've warned you , Parnell , " Maida laughed . " If you keep running on this way you 're going to have an infatuated female on your hands . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome that eventuality , " Parnell replied , again gravely bowing with his air of impishncss and antique courtliness . he held up a pudgy hand , his gray eyes dancing . " But please , Madam , please , I beg of you  --  do not ever suggest matrimony , " he continued gravely . " Men have contrived Fewer devices more deadly to romance than marriage itself . " lie fluttered his fingers lightly through the air . " Gay wings , " he murnnired , blowing Maida a kiss . " Ali lass , let us stoutly resolve ever to remain gay and unfettered . " II , " Ali , Parnell , Parnell . ... " Maida murmured , wistfully shaking her head . " Ali , Cyrano , Cyrano , " I muttered , stirring restlessly . Parnell must have been quite a boy in his day , I reflected , quite a boy ... . " Rubbish ! " I said petulantly , wheeling the car around in an abrupt U - turn . Enough of this romantic buffoonery.  | chapter 19 With some trepidation I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Maida at the beauty parlor , wishing them good luck . Then I drove back to the hotel , parked my car near the street entrance to the taproom  --  the same door Lieutenant Manion had conic and left by when he had shot Barney  --  and lit up a cigar , took a deep breath , and pushed against the door . It did not yield . I rattled and wrenched at the knob ; the door was locked . A small typewritten sign on the glass informed me that the place would not be open for business until noon . I peered through the window ; the place was dim and there was no sign of activity . I shrugged and walked around front to the main entrance of the hotel ; perhaps I could at least get a peck at the bar . Since the hotel stood on a steep sandy hill , the front accordingly rose considerably higher above the street level than in the rear , where the building in fact ran a few feet into the hill . I mounted the steps to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hines had been there before me , as his discreetly beckoning little tin sign now reassured me . Thunder Bay had at last made the grade ; one could now dine in the certified knowledge that Duncan approved . I could visualize this ubiquitous little man  --  his bib full of gravy stains , his pockets full of pills , his soul full of hope  --  gnawing his way across a continent , leaving diplomas of approval in his wake like a sort of gastronomic Kilroy . I sighed and moved into the hotel . " Peptic ulcers can now be gaily faced , " I thought . " Duncan has et here . " The lobby was deserted except for a knot of numbed and somnambulistic-looking tourists gathered about a flaming large stone fireplace . It was only 72 degrees outside .... I glanced quickly around and found a sign on a door saying " Cocktail Lounge . " I tried the door and found it unlocked and went quickly down the stairs . " Siegler , " I thought , " your career as a detective has officially begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barroom smote my nostrils . I paused at the bottom to become accustomed to the dim light . I seemed to be alone . The room was large and filled with tables and stacked chairs except for a small roped-off dance space in the center . I spotted Laura Manion 's pinball machine in the corner , to my left , standing between an upright piano and a garishly colored jukebox . Adjoining this and nearer me were the wash rooms . I advanced  | slowly into the room . To my right about thirty feet from the street door I had just tried to enter , was the bar itself . I gave a start . Standing motionless behind the bar , holding a towel and glass in his hands and intently regarding me , was a small dark man , a wiry , foxy-looking little man in a white apron . " Hello , " I said , advancing . " I 'm Paul Biegler from Chippewa , Lieutenant Manion 's lawyer . " " Yes , I know , " he replied , averting his eyes , busily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Biegler ? I 'm Paquette the bartender . " " Well , " I said , smiling , " after you 've served me a bottle of pop ? your choice  --  you might tell me if you were present during the shooting . " The soft drink and a glass were placed before me with deft dispatch ; the money rung up ; and then he was back polishing another glass . " I was present , " he said evenly . " Just like it said in the newspapers . " " Maybe we could talk a little about what happened , " I said . " Maybe , " he said , inspecting his glass in the light . " And then again , maybe we could not . " This sort of sparring could go on for days , I saw , an enterprise for which I lacked both the time and taste ; I preferred seeing my little foxes in the woods . I swiftly decided to level with my cozy friend . F , ither he would talk or he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even his failure to talk might prove something or other . " Look , Mr. Paquette , " I said , " whether you choose to clam up or talk is a matter of considerable indifference to me . I 'll have my crack at you in court  --  where you 'll bloody well have to talk and plenty . But maybe all of us would save a lot of time and turmoil if you 'd help me to find out what I came here to find out and which I promise you I will find out . " The polishing had stopped . " Like what ? " he said . I shrugged . " Oh , for a starter , like where Barney and Manny  --  I mean Lieutenant Manion  --  were standing when the shots were fired . " " I did n't see any shots fired . " This had not been clear from the newspaper reports . " Where were you ? " I said . " I was standing out on the floor talking with some customers at a table . We 'd had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could have a rest . He was always thoughtful that way . The crowd was thinning out . "  | " The ever-thoughtful Mister Quill , " I thought , and then a little bell tinkled in my mind . The tired bartender had said he was standing out on the floor . IIere was a poor fatigued bartender , who had been relieved by his thoughtful boss so that he could rest , standing out on the floor talking to his customers . I went baying along the scent . " Who were these customers ? " I asked casually . " l cllow called Pedersen and his wife and a friend from Iron Bay . " I'lia 'd been out for a drive . " I made a mental note to remember the name . " Where was the Pedersen table located ? " I went on . " Out on the floor . " " Naturally , " I said . " But where on the floor ? Over by the pinball machine ? The stairs ? The piano ? " I paused , pointing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or was their table over by the outside door there ? " " Yes , " he murmured . Anyone standing by the window near the door , I guessed , could have commanded an unobstructed view of any patron approaching the door from the outside . Even a patron , say , like Lieutenant Manion . But better I lay off that now , I decided ; no use clamming up this sly character at the outset . Well , maybe I should explore it just a bit , to worry him , to let him guess a little what I really suspected . " How come , Mr. Paquette ? " I continued easily . " How come you did n't sit down when you chatted with the Pedersens ? Are n't there usually four chairs at a table ? " He shot me a quick look , but he answered readily enough . " They had a package on the other chair , " he said . From the quick little gleam of triumph in his eyes I guessed he was telling the truth . But his triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook so easily . " Could n't this poor tired bartender have sat and held their package in his lap ? Do n't tell me it was an anvil . Or could n't he have drawn tip another chair ? " I held up a warning hand . " Now do n't tell me there were n't any spare chairs  --  the crowd was thinning out , re-member ? " This time I had really tagged him . He scowled and compressed his lips and glanced apprehensively in the direction of the stairway . " Or perhaps , " I went on , " you 're like the postman who climbs mountains on his vacation  --  you simply love to stand on your own two feet . " Like most people , Mr. Paquette could stand almost anything but  | ridicule . " What you driving at ? " he demanded angrily . " Sitting or standing  --  what goddam difference does it make ? " " Little Standing Bull , " I thought . But I was n't ready to spell out my thoughts , at least not quite yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I knew . Perhaps it would give him a little more respect for the truth . " Do n't race your motor , " I said . " In any case Barney Quill was alone behind the bar when Lieutenant Manion came in ? " " I 've already told you he was . " " Sitting or standing ? " " Standing . He always stood when he was at the bar . " I pondered my next question . " How long had he been relieving you , standing there alone behind the bar ? " " Oh , for upwards of an hour I 'd say . " Little Standing Bull had kept the weary vigil by the door for nearly a whole hour ! " And when had he relieved you ? " " Around midnight , I should say . " " And what time was the shooting ? " " At twelve forty-six exactly . " " How would you know that ? " " At the first shot I wheeled around and looked at the clock . " Had he been surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clock was on the wall behind the bar . " ' Then you must have seen some of the other shots fired , did n't you , Mr. Paquette ? " Ile lit a cigarette and I thought his hand trembled ever so little . " I saw Lieutenant Manion standing up on the bar rail , leaning over and pointing at something down behind the bar . " I had long ago learned that this nice air of meticulous fairness in a witness was often a sure sign that he was hostile or lying . " Come now , that something was of course Barney Quill , was n't it ? " " Well , yes . It turned out to be . " " And where at the bar was the Lieutenant standing ? " He pointed . " Near the middle , there , right between those two service rails . It was the only place open ; the bar itself was crowded , all with men . Barney had just bought another round of drinks . He was generous that way . The Lieutenant turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ran out the door after him  --  the door you just tried to enter . " " Oh , so you saw me out there . What happened then ? " " When I got outside he wheeled around and faced me and said : ' Do you want some , too , Buster ? " '  | I winced over that one , but continued bravely . " What did you do ? " " I said , No , sir ' and hurried back inside . " This was even worse for our side than the newspaper had reported it ; this grim fighting talk from my Lieutenant was more than a little inconsistent with our proposed picture of a man whose wits had departed him from shock and excessive grief . But the show must go on . . " And Buster is n't your name , of course ? " I went on . " No , Alphonse is my first name . People generally call me Al or Phonse . " Yes , people continue to be as original as all hell , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 'd apparently died instantly . Five out of the six shots got to him . The man did n't have a chance . " " You mean a chance to fire a shot himself ? " Quickly : " I mean a chance to live . " " To your knowledge did either man speak ? " " I personally heard nothing but later I heard that Barney had said Good evening , Lieutenant . " ' " What about Manion  --  had anyone heard him speak ? " " No . Apparently he did not utter a word although several persons later claimed they had spoken to him , including one of our waitresses . " " What 's her name ? " " ern Rundquist . " This was fairly good news ; see , my poor addled client could n't see or hear anything . The defense was up , down , then in a neutral corner .... " Did you go look at Barney ? " I said . " Yes . " " Did you examine his body ? " " Yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked the place . " " What time was that ? " " About one o'clock . Nobody had to be urged to leave ; most of them fled the joint right after the shooting . " " So that finally you were left all alone with the dead body ? " " Well , yes . Somebody had to wait for the police . " " Who called them ? " " I did . " " When ? " He hesitated for an instant . " It will all be a matter of record , you know , " I said . " They 'll tell me if you don't. "  | " I was just thinking , " he said . " About one-fifteen , I should say . " " My , my . How come you waited so long to notify the police , Mr. Paquette ? " " Oh , the excitement and all  --  I ? I guess I just forgot . " " I-Im , your boss is shot to death at twelve forty-six  --  in all the excitement you do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later that maybe the police should be notified . It simply had n't occurred to you before , is that it ? " " Right , " he snapped . I sipped my drink and lit a fresh cigar . Alphonse Paquette had resumed polishing a glass . I noted that it was the same one he had already polished at length . This man , I concluded , probably knew much more than he had told anyone , or perhaps ever intended to tell anyone , but certain probabilities had already emerged despite his reluctance . I was now convinced that Barney Quill had been waiting for the Lieutenant ; that he had deliberately relieved his bartender not only to get him out of the way of the anticipated show clown but also to in turn warn Barney and further so that he , Barney could get behind the bar himself . It had been his fortress . Then by buying drinks he had further surrounded himself with an unwitting protective human cordon  --  all but at the waitresses ' service station , which customers were everywhere supposed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Barney 's Achilles ' heel was a nice ironic touch . I was now equally sure that he must have been armed ? else why should he have waited around at all ? I decided to play my hunch . " When did the police arrive ? " " It was shortly after two  --  the distance and winding roads , you know . " " Yes , I know . " I paused . " So you were alone with the body for over au hour ? " " Why , yes , that 's correct . Somebody had to take the rap and wait . " He was still preoccupied with the same glass , polishing it inlently , and I was growing afraid he would wear it out . " You just told me that , " I said and again I paused . " Would you mind greatly putting down that glass , Mr. Paquette ? You 've been working on it for the last half-hour . Anyway , I like to look at the people I 'm talking with , it 's an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and stood facing me with an air of defiant and unfeigned hostility . " I 'm looking , Mister , " he said . " Fire away . "  | " Good , " I said . " Now was it during this lonely hour-long vigil that you removed the firearms from behind the bar and got rid of them ? " Ills eyes bored steadily into mine . But the look of angry hostility now seemed mingled with a sudden gleam of fear . " What pistols ? " he said evenly , trying to control himself . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . Who said anything about pistols ? If you 've come up Iicrc to set smart lawyer traps for me , you 'd better be on your way , Mister . I 've got work to do . " " You seem already to have fallen into one of those lawyer traps , ' my friend . I said firearms ' not pistols . ' What did you do with the pis-tols ? " He had grown suddenly tense and pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a rifle , " he countered . " I would n't know , " I said . " But you called them pistols  --  I did n't . You 'd better remember that for the trial . Do n't fall into that trap again . " Is that all ? " he said coldly . " Is that all you wanted to ask me ? " " Scarcely , " I said . " But perhaps we 'd better move on to  --  to something less sensitive . Had Barney left the place during the eve-ning ? " Sullenly : " Yes . " " When ? , " Around eleven , shortly before Mrs. Manion left . " " When did you next see him ? " " Around midnight , shortly before he relieved me . " " Which way did he enter  --  from the street or the hotel stairs ? " I paused . " Remember , others will know . " Uneasily : " He came down from the hotel . " So far so good ; that would give Barney the time and opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  get rid of Laura Manion 's missing underpants . " Had he changed his clothes ? " I asked . There was no answer and I repeated the question . He still remained silent . " Must I continue to remind you with every question that I can find out from others if you wo n't talk ? " " Why do n't you go and ask the others , then ? " he demanded hotly . " Why do you keep firing away at me ? " " One talks to but one witness at a time , " I said . " Right now your number is up . " I shrugged . " But if you want it that way . ... " I turned as though to leave . " Perhaps you 'd prefer to have me bring  | out in court that you would n't answer that simple little question ? " He almost spat his reply . " He 'd changed from a white shirt to a sweat shirt . He  --  he often did . It was a hot night . What other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the man 's bartender , not his valet . " " Perhaps the sweat shirt gave him more freedom to lift a glass , say ? or even a gun ? " I said gently . " Were n't you surprised when you wheeled around and saw the Lieutenant still standing and not Barney ? And when you wheeled could it have been that you were checking the time so you could testify later  --  for Barney ? " He smiled frostily and I swiftly concluded I would rather take him scowling . " Suppose , " he said slowly , " suppose you try checking that one with the others . " His dart was well aimed , I saw , and I saw further that as far as he was concerned I would get little or nothing out of him that could not be confirmed by others . " At any rate , " I said , " Barney comes down in his sweat shirt and immediately relieves you from behind the bar . " " That 's correct . Everybody saw that . " He seemed almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for admitting anything that might help the defense . It was an interesting development ; both interesting and challenging . And it could be serious . Why was this little man so evasive and hostile ? " Was it Barney 's regular practice to relieve you behind the bar ? " I said . His eyes flickered . " Occasionally . " " How often had he relieved you , say , during the last two weeks before the shooting ? All this can be checked , too , remember . Now I 'll promise cross my heart to quit saying that if you 'll just promise to remember it . " " Well , he just did n't happen to relieve me during that time . Lots of other times , though . " " During the entire last month then ? " I said . " I do n't remember . " " I do n't think a jury would like that answer . They might even suspect you of being evasive or something , and for such a frank and open person that would indeed be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't relieve me . " Despite some glaring gaps , some of the pieces were now falling into place . " Ali , now we 're getting somewhere , " I said . " Barney just happened to relieve you the very night he also just happened to have  | raped and heat up Laura Manion . " It was time to level . " Look , chum , did n't lie really tell you to get to hell away from the bar so you would n't get hurt ? And on his orders were n't you standing by that window for nearly an hour so you could spot the Lieutenant coming and warn Barney ? " " Who said Barney raped her ? " he demanded . " You doubt it ? " I said . " 1 was n't there . " " 1 know you were n't there , comrade . But I just asked you if you doubted that he 'd raped her . " He had a cute little habit of turning my question to other channels . Defiantly : " Yes , I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also doubt , it was with her willing consent . Anybody can see she 's a floozie . " ' I'licre was going to be great fun with this winning character in court , I saw . " I see , " I said . " You could n't tell me just now whether lie raped her , because you were n't there , but now , still not having been there , you have all the answers as to what happened . Is that it ? " I paused , pondering whether to risk drying up this man by further antagonizing him or to push on , doggedly getting as much as I could by a softer approach . I decided to take the risk and speak a few homely truths . " Mr. Paquette , " I said , " you do n't like my asking you all these embarrassing questions , I suppose , and I really ca n't blame you . Nobody likes the hot seat . In fact you obviously bitterly resent my asking them . But that 's the penalty for having a ringside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's freedom and whole future rides on this case . And you happen to have some of the answers . Now I intend to get those answers , my friend , but you are not coming clean with me , not even halfway clean . And if I can see that you are n't , I promise you I 'll make a jury see it . What you 've had from me so far , unpleasant as you may find it , will be nothing to the going over I 'll give you in court unless you come off this cozy routine . I 'll make a damn fool or liar out of you or moth . I  --  I 'll burn your ass to a crisp . " Ile flushed with hot anger and took a quick step back . " Is that a threat ? " For a moment I thought he might try to hit me . The moment passed . " No , not a threat , " I said , " but a promise . I 'd rather call it a little preview of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try telling the truth . And fast . The truth is so easy , Mr. Paquette ; nothing to make up , no evasions , no traps , no entanglements , no inconsistent statements  | to try to explain away . Just the simple truth . I recommend you try it sometime . Why not now ? " " You think everything I 've told you is a pack of lies ? " he demanded . " Of course not . But you 're holding back , you 're not telling the whole truth . Do you think I 'm a goddam dummy , man ? I 've been bulldozed by experts . While you 're good and will doubtless improve , you still do n't quite pitch in that league . " " What do you mean ? " he said . " You 're leveling with me only on the things you know I already know or that others will testify to anyway , or things you know I can check you up on . And you 're evasive , evasive as hell . A little while ago I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieving you Barney sent you away from the bar so you 'd be out of range when the fireworks started and also to warn him . You did n't attempt to answer me . Did you think I 'd forget that question or that it 'd just go away ? " Alphonse Paquette blinked his eyes thoughtfully . I had apparently given him food for thought ; he seemed to be weighing something , considering the pros and cons of some situation I knew not of . I wondered what his angle was . I was convinced now that he was holding back , but why was he ? Why this loyalty , this desire to shield something or someone ? Had the thoughtful and relieving Mister Barney meant so much to him ? And , if so , what was there in it for him ? Who 'd put the " silencer " on him and why ? " You still have n't answered me , " I said . He sighed and shook his head . " He did n't send me away , " he said almost doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I was n't watching for Lieutenant Manion or anyone . " I sensed that I 'd almost had him . " Very well , my friend . You want it that way ; you 've chosen your course . But do n't forget I warned you . And I do n't mind telling you you 're lying by the clock . Even a child can see that . " " It 's the truth , I tell you , " he said sullenly , almost resignedly . The anger and defiance were gone now  --  gone or hidden ? ; all he wanted was for me to go away . I decided to gratify his desire up to a point ; I would leave temporarily to go visit the wash room . " Excuse me , " I said . " I 'm going to the can and I 'll expect to see you here when I come back . "  | chapter 20 I was mildly surprised to find him there upon my return and I wasted no time in boring in . " How long did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . See , that 's another question you can afford to answer truthfully . I can check it and it surely ca n't hurt anything anyway . Tonelessly : " Eighteen months . " " Ilad you known him before that ? " " No. 1 just blew in . He needed a bartender and I got the job . " " Who are you working for now ? " After a pause , " I 'm not sure . " " Come , come , man . Surely somebody is in charge of this joint . Who is he ? Or are you the new boss man ? " " It 's a woman . " I felt a small inward jolt of recognition . Of course , a woman  --  there simply had to be a dame . Why had n't I thought of that before ? Well , a man could n't think of everything  --  and during trout season women were the farthest thing from my mind . Well , almost the farthest .... " This woman , " I said , " who is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs . She 's running things up there . She  --  she was Barney 's hostess . " He had hesitated ever so little over the word " hostess . " It opened up new vistas . " Is she  --  is she going to own the place now ? " " I would n't know , " he said . " I 'm just a dumb bartender , you know . I just work here . Why do n't you try asking her ? " " Not so dumb , " I said . " But we 'll pass that ; I can find that out easily enough elsewhere . " " You can ? " he said , looking surprised . " How ? " " By checking the files in probate court or the records in the register of deeds office down in Iron Bay . Or else by wiring the Liquor Control Commission in Lansing regarding any pending application for the transfer of your liquor license . And there are other ways . We live in an age of papers and records , you know ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other clamping his official seal ou the corpse . But it seems a shame , does n't it , to put me to all that needless bother ? " I paused . " Come , Alphonse , does she own the joint ? Do n't mar our budding new friendship by making me suspect you 're holding out on me . " " Barney left a will , " he said resignedly . " I guess he left the works  | to Mary  --  Miss Filant . In fact I know he did . It 's still got to go through probate court and all , but I guess she 'll eventually get everything . " He spread out his thin supple hands as though to embrace the place . " Everything . " " Was this Mary person present during the shooting ? " " No . " " Hm .... Where was she ? " He dropped his eyes . " I really would n't know , " he replied , and I made a mental note to check on that one . I had a sudden hunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " were you one of the witnesses to it ? " He looked startled . " How do you know that ? " I laughed . " I have lived , Alphonse , I have lived . And when did Barney make out this will that you witnessed , Alphonse ? Or would you prefer me to check up on that myself ? " " About three weeks before  --  before he was killed . " " Was Barney married ? " " Married and divorced . Long ago . Down in Wisconsin . " " Any parents ? " " Both dead . " " Any children ? " He smiled fleetingly , and I put the smile away in cold storage . So Barney had been that way . .. . " I think there was a daughter , " he said . " Did he leave any other relatives and did any of them show up for the funeral ? " " He was buried down in Wisconsin . " " Very well , but my question had two horns , " I said . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the stairway . " Besides the divorced wife and daughter there may have been a married sister . I do n't know nothing about that . " He stirred uneasily ; oddly enough , this new subject seemed to bother him more than the shooting itself . I paused and lit another Italian cigar , pondering this swift change in the picture . The plot , like homemade French pea soup , was getting thicker and thicker . If Barney had not left any will his daughter would get everything ; that was plainly the law ; she would be his sole heir . If he left no wife , and willed everything to a stranger , then the stranger would get everything and the daughter nothing ; that was equally the law . But if a relative or guardian or someone contested  | and could somehow successfully block the will  --  because of coercion , undue influence , fraud , drunkenness , mental incapacity and the like ? then the will would fall and the daughter take all . And the stakes were certainly high enough  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist beat . In any will contest , too , the witnesses to the will would hold important  --  and valuable trumps . A light was beginning to dawn . " Who was the other witness to the will ? " I said . " The night clerk upstairs . " It was almost too neat ; this left Mary Pilant and her loyal employccs solely in the driver 's seat . I decided to test my growing hunch of the cause  --  or one of the causes  --  of all this reticence . Could it be from fear of someone upsetting the will ? " IIow about Barney 's drinking ? " I said . IIe threw out his hands . " He drank some . Most people in this business almost have to . " " Yes , I suppose . Like the well-known fact that proprietors of candystores hang around all day eating candy , " I said . " But on the day of the shooting  --  how about his drinking then ? " " He drank about the same as usual . In fact he drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friend , one could truthfully say that about a quart-a-dayman , or even a hopeless drunk . The question is : how much was he drinking ? " " If you mean he was drunk , he was n't . He 'd had his regular quota . " Patiently : " And how much was that ? " " Oh , a few shots more or less . " " Hell , man , do n't give me that stuff  --  he drank more than that with Laura Manion alone . What in hell was he doing behind the bar for an hour buying house drinks and all  --  swiggling soda pop ? But we 'll pass that for now and take up this interesting Mary person ? what was she to Barney ? " IIe smiled a tight knowing little smile . " Why do n't you go ask her ? She 's very friendly . I 've already told you she was his hostess . " He glanced quickly at the clock over the bar . " Excuse me , I 've got to go unlock the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the tourist gang to show up . " It was 11:3o and the sign on the door had said iz:oo . Did my nervous friend want to let the tourist herd in simply so that he might be interrupted ? I decided to let it pass .  | Instead of unlocking the outside door Alphonse Paquette had quickly scampered up the stairs to the hotel , doubtless to warn the heiress apparent , Mary Pilant , that the villainous and nosy Biegler was abroad . I was left alone in the big empty barroom , whereupon : all the malty frustrated yearnings and boozy instincts implanted in me by generations of sturdy distillers and brewers and saloonkeepers : by the name of Biegler swept suddenly over me ; I found myself gliding behind the bar as though drawn by a magnet . " Hm .... " I said , and paused . On the floor in the middle of the bar was a large dark blotch . That would be the spot where Barney had fallen . I carefully studied the bar at this point . Then I knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " About six inches below the surface of the bar itself , near the bar service station and out of sight of anyone standing in front , I found a narrow wooden shelf about four feet long . I whistled softly and leaned closer . It was made of wood inferior to , that of the bar itself and had been added later , crudely added , I saw , , as though the job had been done by an amateur . And to what purpose ? Right now it held a forlorn collection of assorted salt and pepper shakers and mustard jars . But it could also , I plainly saw , have held a small arsenal of firearms , yes , even a sawed-off shotgun or short rifle in a pinch . It could even have held a brace of pistols . I turned my back on the bar , facing the bar mirror and bottle shelf . The mirror seemed intact . I craned over the rows of bottles , on my tiptoes . There was a neat small splintered hole near the base of the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart . If this had been caused by one of my man 's shots , then at least one of the bottles . should have been broken . As I walked out from behind the bar I felt like Sherlock Holmes and longed for a curved bulldog pipe and exile of those fore-and-aft-peaked deer-stalker 's caps . Yes , damn it , and a checkered tattersall vest . Someone was rattling at the locked street door . I could hear him swearing softly and I visualized him standing , out there , sagging with thirst , eyes glazed and tongue parched and dangling . I longed to slip a pair of frilled elastic garters over my shirt sleeves and let him in and then scamper back behind the bar , palm &; clown and elbows out . " What 's yores , pardner ? " I would say as he advanced . I shook my head . " Down , Grandpa , down , " I thought ; this was no time to be playing at saloonkeeper . It struck me that the bartender and his new boss must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pressing for them to , leave me alone with all this wealth of booze . I felt touched and hon-  | ored by this subtle testimonial to my honesty and sobriety . The thirsting door-rattler had given up and gone away , but I took solace in the knowledge that he had but a short way to go to find another oasis . I walked over towards the door and stood by the table and window where the bartender had said he stood " resting . " An awning outside somewhat obstructed my view and I stooped to what I judged to be the height of the shorter Paquette . Ali , the view was now fine ? I could sec outside and , turning slightly , also see the bar , a perfect place for a warning lookout . I glanced around . On the wall adjoining the door on the other side , closer to the bar , was a large bulletin board which appeared to be covered with various anouncements , scores , newspaper clippings , snapshots and the like . I quickly moved over that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of Max Battisfore , the Sheriff . For this bulletin board , I discovered , was a shrine apparently dedicated by Barney Quill to Barney Quill about Barney Quill ; it was devoted almost solely to celebrating his exploits as a fisherman , hunter , expert marksman and , to a lesser extent , as a bowler , downhill skier , and racer of outboard motor-boats . And there had been many exploits ; there were dozens and scores of snapshots and photos and newspaper clippings , old and new , all attesting his prowess in all of these things and more : Barney Quill had won the turkey shoot the previous fall , he 'd won a skeet shoot , he 'd placed first in another pistol shoot ; he 'd skied the Iron Bay course in 1:53 . Over here Barney had shot the biggest buck at over two hundred yards ; Barney had caught the largest brook trout last season , and on a mere 5-X leader , too ( I read this particular item with an envious pang ) ; Barney and his outboard had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " a voice behind me said . Startled , I wheeled around . Alphonse Paquette , the bartender , had returned . " What nice soft shoes you wear , Grandma , " I said . He smiled faintly . " Have to wear ' em for my bunions . Standing all hours at that goddam bar , you know . " " And standing and enjoying the view from this goddam window when you 're not , " I said . " Did you have a nice little chat about me with Mary Pilant ? " I said , smiling . " Most satisfactory and to the point . She told me to keep my trap shut . No more questions and no more answers . Those were the lady 's orders  --  and she 's the boss . "  | Well , Mary Pilant might have been just a trifle late , I thought . I wondered what kind of witch she would be . Probably a pearl-laden dame with gold teeth and a baritone voice who shaved twice a week ; the kind who , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " honey " and who wore long loopy earrings from which small boys could depend while performing gymnastics . The picture was not good ; maybe I could shove her off on Parnell . " Well , " I said , " since you ca n't or wo n't talk I guess I might as well up and leave . It 's time for lunch , anyway . When a journeyman lawyer ca n't talk he 's in a bad way ; he ca n't very well open his mouth without asking questions . " " So I 've noticed . " Something on the bulletin board had caught my eye . Caught and perplexed me . " But I have just one more question , an easy harmless little one , " I said . " And it demands no more cerebration than those certified questions on TV where people constantly win life annuities and round trips to Jamaica for guessing President Lincoln 's first name . Just one little question . " " Will you promise to lay off and go , then ? I 've got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Eagle Scout , " I said . " But I wo n't promise I wo n't be back . " He shook his head and sighed . " Shoot your damned question . You lawyers are boring in all the time . " " That 's the prettiest compliment I 've had since I retired from public life , " I said . " Thank you , Al . " I pointed at a large glossy unframed photograph on the bulletin board . It showed a couple standing on a sandy beach . The man , who had wavy hair which was graying at the temples  --  and who was clearly Barney , I judged from the other pictures  --  was smiling down at the woman , a stunning-looking brunette who was gravely regarding the camera . They were a striking , handsome-looking couple and I would have guessed they were married or in love except for one thing the considerable disparity in their years ; I guessed that the man , in a pinch , was old enough to be her father . Could it be possible that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Is that Barney and Mary ? " I said . " That 's Barney and Mary , " he said . " I 've a good-looking boss , do n't you think ? " " Very , " I said , trying to hide my confusion over this sudden new development . The pea soup was getting thicker . " Now I go , " I said ,  | " like I promised , " and like a good Eagle Scout I marched resolutely to the stairway . I paused on the first step and looked around . " One friendly tip , " I said , " not a question . " " What 's that ? " lie said , with an elaborate show of patience . " Do n't remove the gun shelf from behind the bar . It 's too late ? I 've already seen it and it 'll only look worse if you take it out now . You should 've clone that before the police came  --  at the same time you got rid of the pistols . " " Next murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You would n't want to play the part of the dead body , would you ? It would be a real pleasure to have you . " " Only over your dead body , Buster , " I said , turning and trudging slowly up the stairs . Here was really quite an amiable character . Certainly not dumb either ; perhaps only a little nervous . I wondered how much his cut would be if everything turned out all right . Well I certainly did not wish either him or the charming Mary Pilant any harm . Live and let live was my motto . No , no harm at all  --  just so long as they did not foul up the defense of my murder case . But when they moved into that area there would really be war , charm or no charm . And it was beginning to look like war . I had told Mitch that this case had everything but Technicolor . It had been the prize understatement of the year . For Technicolor had now been added and its name was Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | chapter 21 Hotels that aspire to look cozy and homelike generally succeed about as dismally as chain-bakeries fool anyone by calling their lumps of pumped-up dough Grandma Higgins ' homemade bread ; but insofar as any hotel can perhaps be made to look homelike , someone had almost succeeded with the Thunder Bay Inn . The place was actually attractive . Even with all the milling tourists there was an atmosphere of uncontrivcd hominess and cheer about it , especially about the lobby , that defied analysis . Perhaps it was the handsome stone fireplace or the superb heads of three white-tailed deer over it ( Barney would undoubtedly have shot those ) , or the colorful and yet restful drapes at the large picture windows overlooking the blue expanse of lake , or the attractively paneled walls of unfinished red cedar that glowed and shone like burnished copper , or the carefully selected prints and photographs  --  and even a few interesting water colors  --  all of which depicted scenes indigenous to the Peninsula rather than the usual tourist art showing fairy dream castles in Wales . Whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Pilant have had a hand in all this , I wondered . The lobby was crowded with people , including Maida , who was sitting by the fireplace oblivious to the clatter and turmoil around her , her nose buried in one of her inevitable mystery thrillers . Mystery thriller indeed , I thought . Here she was , working on a case that had more real mystery about it than a dozen contrived thrillers , a case as bristling with mystery as a porcupine with quills  --  and she sat reading a damned mystery thriller . I thought of my old hermit Danny McGinnis incredulously glued to his story about his fellow hermit . True , in our case there was little mystery about what had actually taken place  --  that was becoming all too brutally apparent . But these facts , however melodramatic , skimmed but the surface , were in themselves merely the tip of the iceberg at sea ; it was the " inner facts , " the heart of the case itself , that teemed with the stuff of real mystery , the deepening tangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . I glanced about . There was a milling group of vacantly staring people wandering aimlessly up and down , most of whom appeared to be carrying boxes of cleansing tissue . But where was all the Army  | brass ? What had happened to the Army ? I went over to the lobby desk . The bespectacled clerk appeared to be playing a losing game of solitaire with a pack of registration cards . His rapt concentration plainly brooked no interruption . " Ah , cheating ! " I thought , as he finally dealt a card from the bottom . After an indecent interval he sighed and reshuffled the deck and looked up . " Yes ? " he inquired , with that fine mixture of condescension , boredom and inner pain that seems to be the trademark of hotel clerks the world over . " What happened to the Army ? " I said . " I do n't see any glittering brass . IIas there been a new war ? " .. the Army has retreated , " he answered solemnly . " They cleared out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rolled his eyes up , obviously a sorely put-upon man . " Nobody knows the troubles I 've had , " he seemed to be saying . " Was the retreat according to plan or because of the shooting of ? of Dangerous Dan McGrew ? " I said . " I thought the Army was supposed to stay here on maneuvers or something through September . " " The Army has not officially informed me of its reasons for departure , " he replied with enviable sarcasm . " All I know is that they have mercifully departed . " " By the way , " I asked casually , " were you on duty the night Barney was shot ? " He glanced sharply at me . " What 's that to you ? " he said coolly . " I 'm Lieutenant Manion 's lawyer , " I said . " Paul Biegler from Chippewa . " " Oh , " he said , shrugging . " I thought you might be another of those prying tourists . " " Smile when you say that , pardner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on duty ? " " Yes , I was on nights ' last week . " " Ali , a break at last , " I thought as I pressed rapidly on . " Do you remember when Barney came in ? How he was dressed ? His general appearance ? " He nodded his head . " I certainly do , " he said emphatically . " Barney came running in the front entrance at just about ? " At this juncture a large soft blimp of a woman bustled herself squarely between us and pelted the clerk with a flurry of questions . " Yes , madam , we will serve lunch until one-thirty , " he explained patiently . " No , madam , we do not pack lunches for the road . No , madam , the check-out hour is four not five . Yes , madam , downstairs is  | the place where the poor defenseless man ' was shot . " The clerk turned wearily back to me . " You see how it is ? " he murmured . " They 're driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .. " I began . At that moment a waitress hurried up to the desk , all but running , and spoke earnestly to the clerk . " Miss Pilant wants to see you in the dining room  --  immediately ! " she said . " Yes , yes , of course , " he said , innocently trotting away to have his gag applied . So Mary Pilant wanted to play it that way , did she ? I turned ruefully , bitterly , upon the still-waiting lady tourist . " Excuse me for intruding , " I said coldly , thinking of how satisfying it would be to hoist her a nice slow kick in the blubber . I stalked away . So the Army had taken a powder , had it ? ? gone away , retreated before the superior fire power of Lieutenant Manion ? We were certainly getting all the breaks . I had arrived a clay late and now could n't find out what if anything the Army knew . And now even Mary Piant was getting in my hair . And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our chances for getting one of their damned psychiatrists ? As I stood there morosely Parnell came charging into the lobby , wheezing and puffing like an old wood-burning locomotive , his broad face perspiring and red as a beet . I felt alarmed for him until I saw the look of wild triumph in his eye ; the old boy must have come up with something , all right ; he looked as proud and pleased as an old clog with a new bone . He brushed blindly past me and joined Maida at the fireplace , flopping down in a chair like a winded whale , but not quite so overcome , I noted , that he forgot to display the tattersall vest for the bedazzled tourists . As I threaded my way glumly through the milling crowd to join Parnell and Maida I found my way blocked by the same lady tourist who had just interrupted the clerk and me . She was intently studying a large road map affixed to the wall , leaning over and thou glitfully scratching her fanny . The target was magnificent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop kick . . . She was hoydenislily clad in Bermuda shorts large enough to sail the hon-Tiki . She wore a bandana top and a girlish head scarf and on the incredibly tiny feet of her lumpy piano legs she wore some sort of gay open-toed sandals . She was , I saw , of the common or sun-worshiper variety of tourist , looking as though she had been but recently dipped , and held , in a boiling lobster pot . As Mencken once said ,  | she was the sort of female that made a man want to burn every bed in the world . " Merciful God , " I thought , studying this prize specimen of homo tourosis . " How do you like my new hair-do , Boss ? " Maida chirped amiably as I joined them . " Fine , " I conceded , " if looking like a curly blonde Zulu is an effective disguise for the undercover work you 're doing . But the jackpot question is : are the results worth all the sacrifice ? Who are you trying to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed to Parnell . " See , Parn , see , " she pouted . " Now you can see why I 'm so starved for a kind word . " I stole a look at the still-scratching lady tourist . " On second thought , Maida , " I said , " you look positively ravishing . Pardon my outburst  --  I 've just been through a harrowing experience . Let 's go eat and I 'll tell you . " As we entered the dining room a young woman came forward to meet us . I caught my breath . It was Mary Pilant . She was much lovelier in person than her photograph , small and poised , with wide intelligent dark eyes . " Three ? " she inquired politely . " Please , " I said . " And please , too  --  far away from the tourists . " " Perhaps you would prefer to dine on the veranda , " she suggested . " We keep a few overflow tables set up out there . And there you will not only escape the tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alone to talk . " " Thank you , " I said , smiling back . " That 's very thoughtful of you . By all means take us to the veranda . " As she led the way through the multitude of noisily feeding tourists I watched her with the kind of avid and rueful admiration that balding middle-aged males bestow upon hopelessly unattainable young loveliness . I noted the poise and slender grace of her walk , the trim modeling of her legs and ankles , the small ears and small well-shaped head with the tendrils of dark hair curling up from the nape of her neck , the sort of pent and brooding intelligence of her face . Yes , poise and grace and intelligence was the verdict for Mary Pilant . And how , I wondered , how had a character like Barney Quill ever ... ? Why , he was even older than I. I sighed and recalled justice Holmes 's classic comment to justice Brandeis . The two had been out for a Washington stroll . A pert little stenographer had overtaken and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partridge breasts all contributing their part . " Ali , Louis , Louis , " the great Holmes had sighed , shaking his leonine head regretfully . " Ali , to be seventy again .... " Right now I would have gladly settled for forty . " Here we are , " Mary Pilant said , pausing at a tastefully laid table which commanded a breathless view of the lake . " Thank you , young lady , " I said . " What a lovely outlook . I see I must come here more often . " " By all means , Mr. Biegler , " she said , smiling . " We have many points of interest in our little town . " " So I 've observed , " I said . " I 've already been investigating some of them , as you may have heard . But I 'm sure there are many more ? that is if my view should not be too much obstructed . " She held my eyes for an instant as I watched her faintly mocking smile . It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waitress in a minute , " she said , turning away . " Who 's that ? " Maida said as soon as she had left . " Who is that adorable creature ? And what kind of verbal sparring were you two up to ? It sounded like Esperanto to me . " " That 's Mary Pilant , " I said . " She used to be Barney Quill 's hostess . I 'll get to the sparring part later . " Parnell had grown rather quiet . " Lovely , lovely , " he muttered , turning and gazing pensively out over the lake . Maida 's eyes had widened with wonder and envy . " So that 's the woman in the case , " she murmured . " I  --  I guess I had half expected a two-headed female monster , some sort of scheming witch . " " I know what you mean , " I said . " Tell me , " I went on , " tell me what you learned about her ? There 's something here that does n't add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait over half an hour for her turn at the beauty parlor . The place was crowded with beautystarved females , both tourists and locals , besides the half-dozen-odd employees . " The place was like a steambath . " And all of them were buzzing about the shooting of Barney Quill ; it was just about all they had talked about . " What was the burden of their chatter , Maida ? " I said . " We can cover the details later . " " Well , " Maida began , " according to some stories this Mary person was supposed to have been Barney 's mistress  --  although there seems to be considerable doubt on that score . "  | Parnell spoke up . " When any group of females clacking in a beauty parlor in any degree ever spares one of their sisters , " he observed dryly , " they have created , I should say , a tremendous doubt on that score . " I glanced quickly at Parnell . Had he fallen for Mary ? If so , that would make two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where is she from ? " I went on . " It seems that she came to Thunder Bay several summers ago with a group of vacationing schoolteachers , " Maida continued . " She must be a livin ' doll , because Barney fell for her like a ton of bricks  --  so the word goes  --  and made her boss lady of the place and of all the college-girl waitresses  --  at twice her schoolteacher pay . When her own gang of schoolteachers went back to their brats she remained behind as Barney 's hostess , just like that . " " Well , I ca n't much blame him , " Parnell said thoughtfully . He sighed heavily and again his gaze wandered out over the glittering lake . " She  --  she reminds me of someone I once knew , " he said slowly , " ? over a million years ago .. . " I again glanced quickly at Parnell . Was he referring to his own lost Nora ? If so perhaps I could now understand and view his checkered career in a new light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilant , " I said , " how come he did this terrible thing to Laura Manion ? What 's the story on that ? " " Well , " Maida said , " there 're half a dozen stories on that : one , that Barney was half-crazed with drink , again that Laura Manion had led him on that night and even before , then again that this rape routine was just an old trick of Barney 's with summer tourists . Then there 's the school of scandal in reverse that claims he did n't even rape or touch Laura Manion at all  --  although all agree that he was a ravening wolf . " Maida paused . " On this wolf business I even suspect that the girl who worked on me knew personally whereof she spoke . I seemed to detect a note of wistfulness . " " Will the Voice of Experience please proceed ? " I said . " The most persistent story I heard was that Barney had simply blown his stack over the thought of losing Mary Pilant  --  that she somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maida paused and lowered her voice . " Here comes the waitress ! " she hissed , as artfully as Mata Hari herself . I waited impatiently for the waitress to take our order and depart .  | " What do you mean  --  about Barney losing her , about her triggering any explosion ? " " The story is that Mary Pilant had recently taken up with some young Army officer with Lieutenant Manion 's outfit  --  a second-lonie called Loftus , Sonny Loftus they called him  --  and that Barney had tried to break it off . One version is that Barney had offered to marry her , another to also give her this hotel  --  but that she had refused to stop seeing the young officer and was even about to leave or bad threatened to do so . It 's all gossip , of course , but I guess in these real small towns you ca n't even yawn in decent privacy . And here I thought Chippewa was bad enough . " She paused and smiled slyly . " And I do manage to yawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Leave us not pause now to hear the diverting story of your secret love life . Remember , the trial is next month . " " You make a point , Boss , " Maida amiably agreed . " All the stories seem to agree that Barney had lately started to drink heavily  --  it seems the man could always carry a tremendous load  --  right up until the night Laura Manion had wandered into the bar to play pinball . " " But why  --  why did he do this ? " I said , more to myself than to Maida . " How does he keep  --  or win back  --  tbe lovely Mary by doing such a spectacularly evil thing ? " " That 's the burning mystery , " Maida said . " That 's what 's got everybody baffled . " She shook her head . " It beats me , Boss . " " Perhaps Barney was really the one that needed a psychiatrist , " I said , half to myself . Parnell spoke slowly , " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manions wandered onto the stage of a Greek drama in which they had no part , indeed a drama upon which the curtain had already nearly fallen . " Shrewd old Parnell , I thought . " Well said , Parn , " I agreed , as he beamed with pleasure . " It looks more and more like the Manions may have been mere innocently casual pawns in some bigger , more mysterious game . It 's up to us to try to find out about the game . It may hold the solution . " Yet I wondered what all this had to do with the defense to this murder charge . Assuming we learned all , so what ? And why was Mary Pilant so apparently bent on shielding Barney ? Or was it to shield Barney ? Was it rather to make sure that the will was not upset , that she would ultimately get all the swag for herself ? I shook my head dubiously . Such avid and calculated avarice somehow did n't seem  | to fit this lovely feminine creature , it simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case that did n't signify . Why had she even been working for such a man ? " Watch out , Biegler , " I thought . " Do n't go seeing shimmering brunette mirages , do n't go getting soft over a passing vision of dark velvet loveliness . Remember , comrade , A rag , a bone ... ' And whatever the lady 's motives may be , your sole motive now is to get at the truth ! " " Jiggers ! " Maida warned . Tlic waitress appeared and took our dessert orders while Maida chattered disarmingly on about the lovely pines , the gorgeous weather , the priceless view , her eyes glowing and dancing with the excitement of her new role . " Magni fique ! " I said , when the waitress had departed . " By all means we must send you to Moscow to spy on the Moujiks . " " To think , " Maida said , " just to think that I have been pounding a typewriter all these years when  --  when there 's work like this to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typewriter , you mean , " I said , " at least since I got in this damned case . And as for this being fun , I 'll still take the hay . And remember , lawyers do n't often get bizarre cases like this to work on . Most criminal cases are duller than contract bridge . In fact , during my hundred and ten years as prosecutor there were few I can offhand remember that could even hold a candle to it . " Parnell turned to me . " Suppose you bring us up to date , Polly . " " Yes , " Maida breathed , " I ca n't wait . This is like working on a Chinese puzzle . Even Mickey Spillane has nothing on this  --  and we 've only got one murder . " She shook her head in wonder . " It does n't seem possible  --  only one murder ! " The dessert had been served and we were on our third cup of coffee before I described how I had discovered the gun shelf under the bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them my theory about the bartender serving as lookout , ' about the bulletin board , about the lovable bartender finally clamming up , about the abrupt summons of the desk clerk to the dining room to have his gag adjusted . It was well after two o'clock when I was done . " You mean , " Maida said wonderingly , spreading her hands , " you mean Mary Pilant gets all this loot anyway  --  even when she was stepping out with another man ? Would n't you know . And I ca n't get one lone male to take me out to dinner  --  even when I pay . " " At least you 've got two tottering old badgers taking you out to  | lunch , " I comforted her . " You got to play it cool , Maida , play it cool . " I turned to the silent Parnell . " Well , Parn , I guess it 's your turn . You not only look like a cat that has just swallowed a mouse , but even like a mouse that has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | chapter 22 Parnell had had a busy morning ; in fact , as he unfolded the story of his activities that forenoon I marveled that such an arthritic and ailing old man could have accomplished even half so much in so short a time . Few professional detectives could have covered so much ground , I felt , and none , I was certain , could have done so to better purpose . The old boy was a born detective : shrewd , resourceful , and always keeping his eye on the main chance , and as he talked on I stared at him with increasing admiration . He had got off to a slow start ; the only people in the first tavern had been a " stupendously drunken " Indian and the proprietor ? " a great purple-nosed bladder-faced individual with the eyes of a cod , to which he was obviously related , and who , with equal obviousness , had joyously dedicated his life to the consumption of his own wares . " 1'hc moment Parnell had brought up the subject of the fatal shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back room . " It was plain that this numbed and sodden intellectual pygmy was not being evasive or cute , " Parnell explained . " I swear rather that in his addled alcoholic mind lie had worked out the notion that , since his tavern was the closest to Barney 's , he was next on the list to be shot and I had come to shoot him . " Parnell shook his head . " ' Killer ' McCarthy , " he said . " The Lord save us , an ' me not knowin ' which end of a gun to shoot . " Parnell had covered every tavern in town  --  there were seven  --  and had doggedly consumed at least one bottle of pop in each . " I never drank so much of the vile stuff since I left law school , " he explained . Fortunately in all the other taverns  --  which were patronized largely by locals or by truck drivers or pulp cutters from the surrounding logging camps  --  they were all either already talking about the shooting or were more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot about the life and times of the late Barney Quill , hunter and fisherman and expert shot who had failed only once ... . " I shall not pause now and recount just where and from whom I learned what I learned , " Parnell went on , " but by the time I got to the last tavern several things had clearly emerged regarding the character and reputation of the deceased . " " Let 's have ' em , Parn , " I said . " First and foremost he was perhaps the most thoroughly disliked person in town , " Parnell said . " The general air of rejoicing over his  | demise was as shocking as it was obvious . To borrow one of your inelegant but colorful phrases , Paul , most people simply hated his guts , ' his insufferable affectation of superior virtue , his apparently illy disguised cock-of-the-walk attitude that he was a sort of superman who could outshoot , outfight , outlove , out-anything any three men in town . " " There is some evidence , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , " I said . " I had not proceeded far before I discovered that this vast dislike was also mingled with fear , " Parnell went on , " and a fear that appeared pretty well grounded . " He paused . " It seems that the reports were pretty much all the truth : he could outhunt , outshoot , outfight and out all the rest just about any one man , if not three , in all of Thunder Bay . Not to mention the sylvan environs , which I shall presently get to . Apparently the man not only thought he was good , he was good . He wanted to be Mr. Big of Thunder Bay and Mastodon Township and by God he was . And in his pursuit of this dubious distinction he seems to have known no personal fear . A truly amazin ' character , that he was . " " Can you give us an example ? " I said . " It might be important , you know . " " Well , " Parnell went on , tolerantly overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husky young truck driver who came to beat him up . " Parnell paused thoughtfully and pursed his lips . " Yes , that 's a moderately good illustration . Thcre are many others . " " Oh , lovely , lovely , " Maida said , leaning forward . " It seems that before this Mary Pilant young lady came to work for Barney ? " Parnell 's eyes seemed to soften at her name ? " Barney 's hotel and bar , particularly the bar , had been pretty much a rendezvous for roistering lumberjacks and truck drivers and the various seedy and besotted local gentry , slaves all to strong drink . But when Miss Mary came on the scene all that abruptly changed ; she evidently sold Barney on the notion that he was wastin ' his time and talents ; that the real money was to be made from the tourists . But the local characters would first have to be sent on their way . Anyway , and whatever happened , the welcome mat was suddenly removed ? the local characters were one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " You mean there was n't any fight after all ? " Maida said , seeming on the verge of tears . " They went like sheep ? "  | " Patience , my dove , " Parnell said . " There were fights indeed , fisticuffs and eye-gougings and broken heads beyond the wildest dreams of even your literary hero . The local gentry resented bitterly losing their happy drinking home to the tourists ; they had been there first ; and so they still insisted on coming back to Barney 's . " Parnell paused . " Alas , the results were inevitable . " " How do you mean ? " Maida breathlessly put in . " As fast as they came in the door Barney threw them out , with a sort of monotonous abstracted regularity , like a bored Keystone cop flailing his constituents with his night stick . It got so the tourists would gather , particularly on Saturday nights , to watch the mighty evacuation . For a time it became a sort of tourist feature of Thunder Bay , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again house-cicanin ' his bar . " " Lovely , " Maida murmured , blinking her eyes . " If the interlopers wanted to box , Barney boxed ' em ; if they wanted to wrassle , he wrasslcd ' em ; and if they wanted to play dirty , he cheerfully obliged ' em . It seems that among his many other attainments he excelled in the dark arts of judo or jujitsu or whatever it 's called . Really an amazin ' fellow he was , a sort of Ben Franklin of the world of physical attainment and violence . Why , one night three ' jacks rushed Barney  --  all of them younger than he  --  and when the smoke cleared away one was knocked cold on the floor and had to be assisted away , the other had fled into the night , and the third was moaning and holding a broken wrist . Nobody is yet quite sure how it happened . In any event it was a clear case of an irresistible force colliding with three highly removable objects . " " Lieutenant Manion should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " I said . " And here they want to send the poor man to prison . " " Do n't forget the husky young truck driver , " Maida reminded Parnell , her appetite whetted . " Remember , you promised . " " Presently , my dear , presently , " Parnell said , smiling benevolently . " After that last fracas things understandably calmed down , and for an interval the tourists inherited the Thunder Bay Inn undisturbed ? that is , until this husky young truck driver came to town , or rather to one of the nearby lumber camps . " " Who was he , where was he from ? " Maida begged . " No matter , but it appears that he was not only nearly twice the size of Barney , who was evidently not an unusually large man , but  | also less than half his age . Moreover he had been an amateur pugilist of no mean attainments and had , it seemed , reached the semi-finals in those  --  those Diamond Glove contests sponsored by that shyly self-admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Golden Gloves you mean , Parn , " I said , hoping to keep him off that subject . " It 's the annual Golden Gloves Tournaments . " " Ali yes , golden , " Parn said . " But no matter , no matter , golden or tin  --  the fight 's the thing . " " Aye , the fight , the fight  --  let 's have the fight ! " the avid Maida chimed in . " When the men at this young boxer 's camp learned of his prowess in fisticuffs , the very next Saturday night they came to town and marched in a body into Barney 's , with this stout young gladiator at their head , and demanded drinks for the house from Barney . " " What happened ? " I said . " Do n't interrupt ! " Maida said , plucking my sleeve . " Well , Barney and the young man fought , of course . They fought their fight with their fists . They fought by the bar , they fought behind the bar , they fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they once fought out in the street . They fought for an hour and seven minutes by the clock  --  the men who told me were there and saw it  --  until  --  until this Barney , himself like his adversary all tattered and bloody and nearly done in , suddenly executed a quick feint with his left " ? in his excitement Parnell had arisen and now flailed out with his pudgy arms ? " and brought over a sizzling right  --  wham ! ? and the youthful pride of the lumberjacks toppled and crashed like a tall Norway pine . " " Timber ! " Maida yelped with delight . " You  --  you mean Barney knocked him cold ? " " Rather extensively , " Parnell replied dryly . " Barney stowed him away in a deep freeze . The fight was over . His comrades shouldered their fallen hero and silently took him away . One of the men who told me the story said it was so bad that he had to drive the young boxer 's truck back to camp . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time and . quit the camp . " Parnell paused and sighed , as though reluctant to be done with his yarn . " And that was the last visitation of the local lumberjacks and unwanted barflies upon the hallowed premises of the Thunder Bay Inn . " " Good God , Parn , " I said , horrified at the thought . " All this must .  | have happened while I was still prosecutor . Where were the police ? the Sheriff ? I never heard a whisper about any of this . It seems incredible . " " Perhaps the gendarmes thought Barney was himself a sufficient if unwitting force for law and order . Or perhaps it was a case of discretion being the better part of valor . The only deputy sheriff in town was the kindly little old man who is the caretaker of the trailer park  --  the same man that our Lieutenant gave himself up to the night he shot Barney . " " Better raise the ante to two Congressional Medals , Boss , " Maida put in . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a man , what a man ... . " A waitress appeared and hovered expectantly over our still littered table . I glanced at my watch . " It 's getting late , " I said . " Let 's get out of here and finish our talk in the car . " " I ca n't wait , " Maida said , busily putting her face together .  | chapter 23 As I settled for our bill in the main dining room Mary Pilant was nowhere to be seen . " Thank you , Young lady , " I said to the waitress . " We enjoyed our luncheon immensely  --  the service , the view , the delicious lake trout  --  all were superb . I 'm sorry we kept you waiting so long and please tell Miss Pilant that we 'll surely be back . Do n't forget now . " " Thank you , " the waitress murmured , gliding away to retrieve her tip . " Hark ! the candidate for Congress bestows his first snow job , " Maida jibed sarcastically . " Charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm voting straight Federalist . " " Ali , the truth emerges , " I fought back . " I 've suspected you of ballot-box treachery all along . " " Are n't you going to try to see her ? " Parnell said as we moved out to the lobby . " Mary Pilant , I mean ? " I shook my head . " No use , Parn . Certainly not now at least , while she 's playing us this glacial chill . If and when I ever do see her lj I want to have all the story , or as much of it as we 're ever likely to get . I have n't even heard all your story yet , but from the Cheshire cat grin on your face I know you 've still got something up your sleeve . " I paused and lowered my voice . " Stand by and watch , now , while I go try to speak to the clerk . You 'll see how much use it is to talk with her . " I moved over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we were interrupted this noon ... " I began . The clerk looked up and regarded me stonily . " Is there any use ? " I said . " Is the gag really on that tight ? " To his credit the little man looked embarrassed as he shook his head . " No use , " he said . " I 'm sorry . ... I need the job . " " But you 'll have to tell me eventually , " I pressed him quietly . " I 'll get it out of you in court anyway . " He stared at me blankly for a moment and then glanced toward the dining room . " Will you ? " he said , and turned away . I wheeled around and , yes , Mary Pilant was standing motionless in the doorway . She smiled and nodded agreeably at me and moved out of sight into the dining room . " Sad , sad , " Parnell murmured as we left , shaking his head dolefully . " It  --  it 's hard to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signaled him , all right , I saw her shake her head , I  | saw her . Ah me , ah me , what a dreary complicated old world .... " " This really looks like war , Parn , " I said , setting my jaw and doubtless adding three new wrinkles to my already knotted forehead . One thing was plain : whatever her motives , Mary Pilant in her quiet way was every bit the relentless fighter that her late boss had been , the fabulous and unbelievable Barney Quill . " You see , Parn , " I said , " this little lady happens to be suppressing the truth ? and truth that we happen to need badly . " Parnell sighed and shook his head . It grieved him mightily that his sweet Nora-Mary should carry on this way . Before leaving town we drove into the tourist park to get the lay of the land , pausing at the now open gate and the smaller adjoining opening in the fence through which Laura Manion 's little dog had lighted her way the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seventh heaven of pleasure just to be present at the scene of so much delicious violence . " And it looks so placid and innocent now , " she breathed . " Brr . ... " The road wound through the park and around under the Norway pines toward the lake and then circled northerly and inland again back to the caretaker 's cottage , near which the Manion trailer had been parked , as we guessed from the area of yellowed grass . Parnell asked me to note that the trailer had stood considerably north of the gate , that is , closer to the town and Barney 's than the entrance gate itself . I put my hand on the door to get out . " Where you goin ' ? " Parnell politely inquired . " I thought I 'd go see the caretaker , " I said . " Want to come along ? " " Spare yourself , " Parnell said loftily . " I 've seen him already . I did n't waste my mornin ' like some I know , standin ' around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it worth it ? " " I 'll tell you when we get rollin ' ? the sight of all these tourists an ' trailers is giving me hay fever . Let us away . A-kerchoo . . . . " On the way out of town I paused by a rather obscure two-rut dirt road turning off the main road and running into the woods westerly , away from the tourist park . I pointed . " That would be the road that Barney drove Laura in on when he raped her , " I said . In his morning wanderings Parnell had heard that one of Lieutenant Manion 's shots had not only broken the bar mirror but also a bottle of bonded whisky ; that Barney had been an expert shot with  | all manner of small arms , including rifles , shotguns and pistols , particularly pistols ; that he possessed a considerable collection of all types of firearms , again particularly including pistols ; that he was reputed to have kept firearms stashed somewhere behind the bar ; that he had also kept on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awe of the tourists , the many medals and ribbons he had won for his shooting prowess . " I did n't see any medals , Parn , " I said , " and I looked around pretty carefully . " " Maybe they were buried with the man , " Maida helpfully suggested . " I read somewhere last winter where they 'd buried ski wax and goggles and all with a skier who 'd broken his neck . " " The ski wax was probably used to fill the empty brain cavity , " I said . " The medals were there as late as the night of the shooting , " Parnell said . " One of my local informants had seen them earlier in the evening . " " I thought Barney did n't allow any of the local peasantry in his place , " Maida said . " Only a select and fumigated few who regularly behaved  --  and bathed  --  up to the new high standards , " Parnell replied . " And presumably only those who were properly awed by the great Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " Did you learn anything new ? " " Ah , yes , the caretaker , " Parnell said with relish . " Fine little old man by the name of Lemon . He happened to be in one of the last taverns I hit , merely buying a package of Peerless , he is n't a drinking man he told me . One of the patrons pointed him out and I simply went up and introduced myself and asked me questions . IIe had no hesitation in answering . Fine , frank little old man  --  and nimble for his years , too . " " What 'd you find out ? " I said . " Beyond the fact that he was nim-ble ? " " Well , first of all I inquired and learned from him there was no other automobile road leading into or from the park ; in other words that Barney lied by the clock when he told Laura Manion he could drive her home another way . " " Good , Parn , good ; we must remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manions , particularly the wife , and that , to again borrow your coarse idiom , he hated Bar-  | ney 's guts . IIe called him a bully and a braggart and said that while officially he frowned upon violence and murder that the town was well rid of him . " " Uric , fine , Parn . Go on . " " He also likes Mary Pilant and thinks she 's a perfect lady and ca n't understand why she would ever have worked for such a rogue as Barney much less have been his mistress , which he thoroughly doubted . " Parnell paused . " Yes , a fine observant truthful little old nnan , " lie said , obviously pleased to have dredged up a strong proMary fan in his travels . " What else , Parn ? All this is good , but what else ? I can tell you 're holding out . Let 's have it . " I was not wrong ; with his instinctive Irish sense of drama , Parnell had indeed saved the best for the last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally spoke . " Now I 'm coming to the good part , " he said . " You see , Polly , at the trial we must be prepared to meet a claim or at least an inference by the prosecution that Barney did not rape our lady in the woods , but rather that the affair was a mutual party , an easy lay , as you might say , and further that it was not Barney who beat her up at the gate but rather her angry and jealous husband up at the trailer , after she came home . Do you follow me ? " " That I do , Parn , " I said soberly . " And the possibility has bothered me a lot , as you know . " " Well , I now think we may have medicine to block any such claim . " Parnell paused , nursing his scoop like a mother her first-born . " Real medicine , " he added mysteriously . " Speak , man , speak ! " Maida broke in . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile doll , " Parnell gently reproved her . " Well , two tourists who had been staying here for nearly a month ? an old couple from Akron  --  checked out with their trailer early this morning , this here now very identical morning . They had just said good-by to Mr. Lemon and were turning away to depart when the woman remarked , just casual like , passin ' the time of day , that she hoped now her nightmares would go away and she could at last get a good night 's sleep . " " What happened ? " Maida panted . " Well , " Parnell went placidly on , " Mr. Lennon naturally asked her what she meant about her nightmares . And she up and told him she still woke up at night hearing the screams of that poor woman at the gate ? "  | " Are you sure she said at , the gate , Parn ? " I broke in . " Are you sure ? This is vital , you know . " " At the gate , " Parnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked at her clock . I asked the caretaker several times whether she said at the gate and he said lie was sure . Then he pointed out to me that this Ohio couple 's trailer had been , of all the trailers in the park , the closest one to the gate , and that anyway the shouts had to be at or near the gate and not up at the trailer because this Ohio woman was a little deaf and both she and her husband had been awakened by the screams , while he , Mr. Lemon , a light sleeper with good hearing whose cottage is right near the Manions ' trailer , heard nary a sound . " " Lord , Pam , " I said , " this is a wonderful break , wonderful . Did you get their names ? " Parnell patted his breast pocket . " I 've got their names and addresses written down in my notebook here . They already told their stories to the state police . And that should surely blast any attempt by the prosecution to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else did you find out ? " I demanded . " I can see you still got something up your sleeve . " Parnell frowned and grew serious . " You 're right , Paul , " he said . " ' There 's more . " Parnell sighed . " What I 'm about to tell you may hold the key to the whole perplexing why of this case . I refer to Mary Pilant . " " Then why so glum , Parn ? " Maida said . " Out with it , man . " " When I rushed into the hotel this noon I was just bursting to tell about it . " Parnell paused and sighed heavily . " After I saw Mary Pilant my little triumph turned to ashes  --  and then I did n't want to tell , and I still do n't . " " Nora , again , " I thought . " Whatever you think best , Parn , " I began " But I 've got to tell it , it 's too important to the case . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , but like much else we have learned today that we probably ca n't use , this is important to an even bigger thing  --  it should help us to see and understand our case . " Parnell sighed . " When a lawyer once really understands his case , half the battle is won . " " All right , Parn , " I said quietly . " I had reached the seventh and last tavern , " Parnell began , when I ran into a nice-looking young soldier boy who had come in and was having a bottle of pop . I had already heard that the  | Army had pulled out so , nosey me , I barged over and asked him if perchance he was with Lieutenant Manion 's outfit . He was , and on a quick hunch I introduced myself and said I was there helping Lieutenant Manion 's lawyer investigate the fatal shooting and did he know of anything that might help us . It was a shot in the dark . " " Go on , Parn , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilant . " Well , with that he looked around and pulled me into a back booth and told me that he did have something on his mind that might help us , he was n't sure , but anyway he 'd better tell me as he was just leaving town . " " What did he say , Parn ? " " He said that the night before the shooting his bunkmate had been out on late pass and , the night being moonlit and warm and himself a little full of beer , the bunkmate had decided to walk down the beach a way and take a swim in the raw . Well , he was walking along the beach , quietly minding his own business and all , when suddenly he stumbled . He flashed on his flashlight and saw one of his junior officers lying on the sand and , standing some paces away behind a pile of driftwood , a woman whom he recognized only as the good-looking hostess at the Thunder Bay Inn , not even knowing her name . He still do n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my , " I said . " And then what happened ? " " He ran like a deer , " Parnell said and then fell silent , glumly examining his cold cigar . During the telling he had become more and more morose and I thought it was time to cheer him up . But I still could n't see how all this was important to our case . " Well , there 's no law against a young couple being on the beach , Pam , " I said . " Not yet , at least . Maida told us over lunch , remember , that she 'd heard this Mary gal was going with some young officer . What 's all this big build-up about ? " " It was n't their being on the beach , " Parnell doggedly went on . " It was their attire , their vestments  --  or ' rather the lack . " He rolled his eyes at us . " They did n't appear to have on too many clothes . " Maida and I glanced quickly at each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . I felt almost sorry he had found out about the incident . For what possible use could such a thing , however spicy , be to the defense of our case ? Surely honorable old Parnell was not suggesting , even obliquely , that we somehow blackmail Mary Pilant into co-operating with the defense ? Or was he ? " Maybe this was just Army gossip , Parn , " I said . " After all you got  | the story in a public tavern from a man who was n't even there . " Parnell shook his head . " No , Polly . I checked on that . I asked this young soldier who he 'd heard the story from and he said he had got it directly from this bunkmate who had seen it . Then I asked him when and where he had heard it from this bunkmate , and he said his buddy had told him the story over a beer in Barney 's bar the next night , that is , the very night of the shooting  --  early that evening , shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I asked him if anyone else knew about this story  --  now get this , Paul  --  and he said that no one else knew it , that his buddy had purposely clammed up so that he would n't get in a jam with this young officer . I pressed him on this , asking him who was at the bar , and he said no one but the bartender . I asked him if the bartender could possibly have overheard it , and he finally agreed it was possible , because , as he now remembered , the bartender had suddenly left the bar and disappeared upstairs , leaving them alone . " " Technicolor , popcorn buttered generously with old crankcase oil , and a screen a block long , " I said , shaking my head . " I swear this case has a h'ant on it . " " You mean , " excited Maida said , " you mean , Parn , that the bartender ran and told Barney and then  --  and then the feathers hit the fan ? " " I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleakly . " I 'm telling you what I heard . Then I asked this young soldier where his buddy was and he said he was back at camp loading the last truck preparatory to taking off . I said , Take me to him , ' and in half an hour ? after my first harrowing ride in a jeep  --  I had the story straight from the young man himself . It checked in every particular . " I longed to have a picture of Pamell and his tattersall riding in a jeep . Even the very waves must have risen in salute . " Where are the young soldiers now , Pam ? " I said . " They 're on their way to a camp down in Georgia . They left before noon , already several hours late . I have their names and addresses in my notebook . " He shrugged morosely . " And that 's my big scoop . " " But if Barney did learn from his bartender of Mary 's  --  ah  --  indiscretion with this young officer , " Maida said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young officer ? ? or even Mary ? Why should he pick on the poor innocent Manions ? " Parnell threw out his hands . " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " The more I learn about this case the less I know . I do n't even know for  | sure that Barney did know about Mary  --  ah  --  being on the beach the night before with the young officer . But it seems common knowledge that lie did know she was dating this young fellow and also that he was trying desperately to break it up . " Parnell paused . " I guess it would take a whole panel of psychiatrists to unwind the mind of that one .... Perhaps he was mad at the whole Army ? because of it he was no longer the big frog in Thunder Bay , and finally , to heap insult on injury , it was stealing his girl . Then when Army wife Laura Manion wandered into his web he concentrated all of his accumulated venom and frustration on her . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only an old whisky-drinkin ' lawyer myself  --  and also , I 'm afraid , a sentimental old fool . " After that we drove along in silence , each lost in his own thoughts , perhaps lost , as I was , in the spell of the magnificent lake , heaving gently with such deceptive tranquillity below us , washed in the glow of the dying sun , each wheeling sea gull seeming nailed in the sky . On the way home we braved the tourists and stopped off at the Halfway House for our supper , preceded by some well-earned drinks ? " just two , " we solemnly resolved  --  and there found a new small Negro combo , with a pixilated piano man who so seared our hearts , or at least mine , that all our resolutions were forgotten . We were so far carried away , in fact , that along about closing time Maida even asked Parnell to dance with her , a calamitous enterprise which I believe the old goat would have undertaken except that he was mercifully stricken with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead all of us wove our way homeward and , fortunately , did not run across any patrolling sheriffs.  | chapter 24 Pamell appeared at my office the next morning , even before Maida , and joined me in my second " eye-opener " cup of coffee . " I 've been thinking , boy , " he said . " I did n't sleep very well last night . " " I 've been thinking , too , Pam , " I said , indicating an open letter on my desk . " Found that little present at my mail slot last night . Letter from the Army officer I wrote at Thunder Bay giving us the brush-off on an Army psychiatrist . Writes that since Lieutenant Manion did n't belong to his outfit  --  was just there on loan  --  we 'd better write the Lieutenant 's own outfit . Sent me the address . " I shook my head . " So we 're back to scratch  --  no psychiatrist and the trial date appproaching on wings . " " That 's one of the things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , of course , that under the statute we must serve timely notice on the prosecution of our intention to claim the defense of insanity and at least four days before the trial . When do you propose to serve that notice , boy ? Time 's a-flyin ' . " " That problem 's been bothering me most all night , Parn  --  ever since I read that damned letter . Up to now I 've been putting off serving the notice for several reasons : till I saw we could actually get a psychiatrist ; then with the vague idea of not tipping our hand to the other side any sooner than we had to ; and also to possibly prevent or delay the People from sicking their own rebuttal psychiatrists on our man . " I paused . " I 'm glad you raised the subject because I 've just about made up my mind that we should serve the notice nowtoday  --  and let the chips fall where they may . What do you think ? " " But wo n't that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said thoughtfully . " Tip off our defense and give the other side a longer psychiatric crack at him , as it were ? Mind , now , I 'm not objectin ' , boy ; I 'm merely tryin ' to test your thinkin ' ? our little game , you know . I 'm listenin ' . " So Parnell and I were away again , endlessly debating the pros and cons of our strategy for the fast approaching trial . I pointed out that if we delayed the serving of our notice this might in itself give the People their grounds for a continuance since Mitch could then argue that he needed additional time in which to obtain a decent rebuttal psychiatric examination . Parnell agreed and then raised the question of whether the People could ever get to examine our man . " It 's a little brainstorm I had during the night , " he added . " What do you mean ? " I said . " Surely you 're familiar with the  | procedure that permits a prosecutor in felony cases to file a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatric examination and sanity hearing ? The moment we file our notice of insanity Mitch can petition the court  --  on the sole ground that we 've thereby furnished him  --  that the defendant may have been insane ( he need n't admit it ) , and hence get to paw over our man . " Parnell grinned evilly . " I 'm aware of that procedure , boy , " he said . " I have it fully in mind . If and when such a petition is filed we 'll simply tell our man to clam up and tell the People 's psychiatrist to go fly a kite . He simply wo n't play . " I fidgeted uneasily . " You mean , Pam , we 'd tell Lieutenant Manion not to let the People 's psychiatrist have at him ? " " Not only tell him not to let them examine him  --  but not even talk with them , " he said . " I mean our man will tell ' em all to go plumb to hell . " " But how can you expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on the law books , man , and has been for years . Wo n't I risk being jailed for contempt or something ? " " We 'll chance it , " Parnell replied . " There are a lot of rusty old things in the law and on the law books , boy , that could n't stand up for five minutes if their constitutionality were seriously challenged . Nearly every new supreme court report that comes out has at least one shining example . The Legislature 's forever getting some unconstitutional bug in its britches , and I think this old law is one of them . I 've had my droopy eye on this statute for years and in my opinion it is n't worth the paper it 's written on . Constitutionally , I mean . " " I 'm beginning to see , " I murmured . " I 'm beginning to see . ... ? " Do n't you see , " Parnell went on , warming to his subject , " one of the basic provisions of both the State and Federal constitutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in any criminal case . That 's of course the Fifth Amendment  --  the very one that 's getting to be such a dirty word these days in certain sturdy flag-waving quarters . ... " " Let 's not get on that now , Parn , " I said , rolling up my eyes . Parnell had awakened during the night with the whole argument laid out cold . " I must have put a nickel in me subconscious . " If any statute or procedure purported to force a person charged with crime to submit to a hostile psychiatric examination , was n't it thereby unconstitutional and bad ?  | " Hm , " I mused , over the bold soundness of the old man 's vision . " But supposing the good judge overrules all our fine constitutional arguments ? Either we appeal  --  which is tantamount to a People 's continuance  --  or the other side still gets its examination . " Parnell grinned and shook his head . " No , boy . No such thing . If the judge rules against us our man still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if he tells them that what 're they going to do ? The Judge , Mitch , the Doctor , anyone ? If our man simply wo n't talk who 's going to make him talk ? They ca n't threaten to jail him for contempt , the poor bastard 's already there . And you 're in the dear , Polly . You co-operated . And what kind of a psychiatric examination would they have if he would n't play ball ? The whole procedure of psychoanalysis , to be effective , presumes ardent co-operation from the subject ; hence the overstuffed couch . " A key rattled in the outside door and Maida burst in with her usual boisterous calm and only twenty minutes late . " What you two doing ? " she demanded . " Telling dirty stories ? " " I wish to God we were , " I said . " We 've been exploring the dismal legal swamps of insanity . " " Well , " Maida sniffed , " I must say each of you has excellent laboratory material to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Enough of this insubordination . Please respect our years if not our brains . You ca n't play detective every day . See , Parn , one day out and she 's more sassy and spoiled than ever . " Maida went to her room and presently reappeared with her book and bristling battery of pencils . " Back to the salt mines , " she sighed , twisting and squaring herself around for her dictation , as all stenographers seem bound to do , like the circling of a dog bedding down for the night . " Ready ? " I said , when the squirmings and maneuvers had ceased . " Ready . " " I 've got a combined notice and proof of service and three letters . Make the notice an original and three  --  no , four , we need a set for Parn  --  with one blue cover for filing . Got it ? " " Got it . " I turned to the form of notice of insanity in Judge Gillespie 's work on Michigan criminal law and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a letter of transmittal to Mitch of his copy and one to the county clerk for the original . " Add a postscript to the county clerk 's letter : I trust that by pure chance , as usual , you will contrive to get at least one good-looking babe on the jury to case our pain . " Maida sniffed and glanced at Parnell . " Murder or no murder , the boss must always make his little joke . " " Now fix up a letter to a Colonel Mugfur at the address on this letter , " I said , handing her the rejection letter from the Army officer at Thunder Bay . " Send him the same letter I wrote the Thunder Bay brass asking for an Army psychiatrist , fixing it where needed to make sense . Send it airmail special delivery . Times a-fleetin ' . Have you got it ? " " Got it . " " Good girl . Now type all that up as fast as you can . House Detectives McCarthy and Biegler must clamp on their false mustaches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all alone ? " Maida said plaintively . " See , Parn , there 's no quicker way to ruin a good house-broken stenographer than to let her play detective for a day . " " Almost as bad as queen for a day , " Parnell observed with admirable neutrality as Maida plodded out to her salt mine . I leaned back and lit one of my Neapolitan stink weeds . " Parn , all this stuff we 've been discussing is simply further evidence of the crazy state of the law on the defense of insanity in criminal cases , " I said . " Take this notice to Mitch . Is n't it a precious example of what I mean ? Here we notify Mitch of our intention to claim and prove insanity and at the same time boldly admit that we have n't got  --  and therefore certainly have n't yet consulted  --  any psychiatrist . Our man is nuts simply because I say he 's nuts . A man is shot down in cold blood . I say his killer should go free because Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson , my black leather sofa ! What a business . " " Do n't you exaggerate the situation ? After all , it is n't you who determines that the man is insane  --  you 'll still have to go find a psychiatrist to back up your guess . " " We 'll find one . You know that , Parn . If we had the money we 'd probably have a half a dozen on ice right now . "  | " Are n't you being a little harsh on the profession of psychiatry , Paul ? Do you claim all of them are quacks and charlatans ? " " No , I did n't mean that , Parn . I do n't mean that at all . What I guess I mean is ? " I paused , " ? is that , as Lieutenant Manion said , this whole insanity procedure is so goddam unscientific . I  --  I guess it grieves me that our profession can prolong such a primitive rickety state of affairs . " " Perhaps , Paul , " Parnell said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . Perhaps this is just further evidence of the wonderful elasticity of the law , of its broad accommodation , of the room it gives a jury to move around in to reach a just result . " Parnell paused thoughtfully . " Justice , you know , lad , can not be measured with calipers . And surely you do not mean to infer that it would be an unjust verdict if Lieutenant Manion were acquitted on the ground of temporary insanity ? Or does your zeal for abstract justice extend even that far ? " Shrewd Parnell was driving me into a corner and both of us knew it . " Well , " I said lamely , " no . . . I do n't mean exactly that . It  --  it 's just ? " " No , of course you do n't mean that , Paul , " Parnell dryly cut in . " So what are you belly-aching about ? How would you solve the problem , if you think the present system is so bad ? What 's the new and improved Biegler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panel of State-paid psychiatrists to say your man was sane when he shot Barney ? Would that make you feel better and more scientific ? Suppose a panel of bearded nonpartisan ' psychiatrists paid by the State pawed over our man  --  as you seem so badly to want  --  to determine his state of sanity when he shot Barney ? What do you think they 'd find ? I give you three guesses . And what would you do when they emerged from their huddle and found him sane ? Why , you 'd scream like a wounded horse and race out to find three more psychiatrists who 'd swear he was nuts . Probably four . Then maybe the State would raise you two , like a couple of night cooks playing stud poker in the kitchen . Well , at least the way things are you 're spared that expensive mockery . It at least wo n't be a battle of which side can produce the most psychiatrists . " " You 're hurtin ' , Parn , " I said , smiling ruefully . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What you forget , Polly , is that criminal trials are from their very nature intensely partisan affairs ? primitive , knock-down , every-man-for-himself combats  --  the very opposite of detached scientific determinations . You of all men  | should know this . In fact I believe that 's one of the reasons why ? in this wonderful laboratory age when everything we touch or buy is pumped full of science and little else  --  people are so drawn to the hurly-burly of a criminal trial . They 're starved for real drama and raw emotion , for the purging catharsis of knowing the chips are really down ; they recognize that a criminal trial is the real McCoy . " Parnell shook his head . " No , Paul , the law may be wiser than you think . Let us hear no more of its being unscientific . " Parnell had pressed me pretty hard . " Well , Parn , you may be right on there being no easy alternatives to the present procedure , " I said . " In fact I rather think you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just gave the People will not only not have an equal crack at our defendant but no crack at all . And is that right and just ? Damn it , I almost hope Mitch tries to file a petition to examine our man . If you 're right under present procedures they ca n't examine him if we wo n't let them . And I still say that 's a primitive , haywire , and goddam unscientific legal arrangement . So suppose we call the argument a draw ? " " Discussion , boy , not argument , " Parnell said . " Yes , let 's call it a draw . And now that we 've neatly drawn and quartered the law of insanity , what else are we doing today ? " " Well , Parn , I think I 'd better go visit my people . For one thing I 'd better go see if they 're still living together  --  which , God knows , I ca n't be sure of from day to day . And I must go over some things with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go along ? " Parnell nodded his head . " That I would , Polly . I 've got a little plan of my own . And I guess I 'll have to ride with you or go on the bus . " He paused and grinned at me . " You know , I have n't done much driving of late years  --  alas , since that careless Dolly Madison folded my Maxwell around a tree . " He blinked his pale blue eyes . " Now I wonder if I could still drive ? Hm . . . . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , Parn , but I 'll drive you , " I said , grinning . " What 're you up to now , you crafty old fox ? " " Do n't be asking , boy . All in good time , all in good time . I 've got me a wee plan . " Maida came in with the finished letters which I signed and she stashed away in their envelopes . " Where to today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to go . " I sighed and shook my head . " All right , all right , " I said . " Put a sign on the door and come tag along . We 'll mail this stuff on the way . "  | " The die is cast , " I said soberly , emerging from the Chippewa post office . " For the lieutenant 's sake I hope we 've guessed right . " For the most part we were silent on the drive to Iron Bay . Maida came to life briefly when we drove past the Halfway House . " Would n't you two like to stop off and recapture your lost youth ? " she quipped . " Ah , to be young and carefree and gay again  --  at four-bits a shot . " " Humph , " Parnell said , morosely smacking his parched lips . " One day I 'm just up an ' goin ' to quit drinkin ' that vile stuff . " " When the moon turns to blue cheese , " Maida sniffed . " Green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someday soon I 'm just gon na up an ' quit . . . . " I let Maida and Parnell off at the side door of the courthouse . " Polly , " Parnell said earnestly , " after you get the Lieutenant up to date on yesterday 's doings , there 's something , one question , I want you to ask him . " " What 's that , Parn ? " " Ask him simply this : If you did n't intend to kill Barney when you went to the bar with a loaded gun , just what did you intend to do ? ' Ask him that , Paul , and make him answer  --  it could be important . " " O.K. , Parn , " I said , shrugging . " Is this part of your mysterious wee plan ? " " Could be , could be , " Parn said , smiling enigmatically . " Come , Maida , let us away . Your unimaginative boss is getting inquisitive again . " " Hm .... " I said , pondering what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 The Lieutenant and I were sitting in the sun on the rear steps of the courthouse directly across the driveway separating it from the jail . " And so , Lieutenant , " I said , " that pretty well brings you up to date on my trip to Thunder Bay . " " Looks like you had a busy day , Counselor , " the Lieutenant said . " Faint praise from the master , " I thought . " Middling , " I said , thinking that he did not know the half of it , that there was much that I had merely hinted at to him , and still much else that I did not tell him at all , including the reluctance of the people around the Thunder Bay Inn to tell us what they knew . Telling him that  --  at least now  --  would only worry and upset him more than he already was ; after all I needed him insane only at the time of the shooting , not at the trial as well . Nor did I tell him what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach with the young Army officer ; however true , this still smacked too much of dreary small-town gossip , and beyond that I had a growing feeling , however vague , that whatever value this tidbit might possess for the defense lay in its not becoming common knowledge . If everybody knew , then .. . " Surely , Biegler , " I thought , " surely you would n't be contemplating a sort of genteel blackmail , would you ? " But blackmail was never genteel ; however one dressed it up it was an ugly word ; perhaps it was prettier to say that I was dimly appraising the possibility  --  somehow , someway  --  of exchanging with Mary Pilant a continued discreet silence for , say , a little helpful truth . Yes , that sounded much better . I turned back to my lieutenant . " Were you aware before that night , Lieutenant , that Barney Quill was an expert shot , especially with pistols ? " " Yes , I 'd heard about it and seen his medals on the bar and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man apparently made no secret that he was good . But personally I never shot against him . " " Only the one time , you mean  --  when he lost , " I reminded him . " 1 ) id you know or ever hear that he owned a lot of guns and pistols and was reputed to keep some behind the bar ? " " It was common talk around the village that he owned quite a collection of guns , including side arms , and that he kept some behind the bar . " " Good . What else ? "  | " Now that you speak of it I recall that one of our officers told me that this Barney and a group of our boys were discussing small arms one day in his bar and this  --  this Barney reached down behind the bar and produced a semi-automatic . " " Good . Very good . And you knew about that , then , the night of the shooting ? " " Naturally I knew before the shooting  --  I 've been in the jug ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the officer could have come and told you after the shooting . Still I prefer it your way . You never saw any of these guns yourself , then ? " " No , I did n't cotton to this Barney character and avoided both him and his place as much as I could . We were never chummy . " I tried to imagine this aloof client of mine being really chummy with anyone , but gave it up . " And this officer that saw Barney produce the pistol  --  where is he now ? " I said . " Doubtless on his way to Georgia if the Army pulled out , as you say . " " Hm . . . . " I said . " Did you also know or had you heard that Barney was good at personal combat , that is , with his dukes and Judo and all ? " The Lieutenant shrugged . " Well , I 'd heard all about that  --  this Barney was not one to hide his light , you know ? ; about how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in some husky young boxer . Then Laura confirmed all that when she told me how he 'd carried on with her that night bragging about how good he was at Judo and all the rest . " My heart sank . " You mean , she told you this before the shooting ? " " No , later  --  either here at the jail or on the way . " My heart rose again or whatever it is that hearts do after they stop sinking . " I see , " I said , " but at any rate that night you knew when you went to the tavern that you were about to face a tough customer , a man who was widely reputed to be pretty well able to take care of himself against all corners ? " The Lieutenant seemed reluctant to concede that there was anything good about Barney ? uill , in any department . " Yes , " he grudgingly admitted , " yes , I 'd heard that the man was pretty good . " " And nevertheless you had the guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said wonderingly . He looked at me sharply . " All hell could not have stopped me , " he said in a low intense voice .  | We were getting on dangerous ground and my impulse was to veer away , and then I thought of the question that Parnell had asked me to ask him . Should I risk asking such a loaded question ? But if I did n't , would n't the People do so later ? Was n't it better to face up to it now ? " Lieutenant , " I said quietly , " I 'm going to ask you a question and I want an honest answer . All I ask is that your answer be honest and that you consider well before you answer . " " Shoot , " the Lieutenant said . " If you did n't intend to kill Barney Quill that night when you went to his bar with a loaded gun , just what did you intend to do ? " " To  --  to grab him , " the Lieutenant answered quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  to stop him . " A dim light was beginning to dawn . Had shrewd old Parnell won again ? " What do you mean  --  grab him and hold him ? " I said . " I  --  I do n't exactly know . Just what I said , I guess . . . . If this ? this man had done what Laura had said he 'd done , what I believed he 'd done , then I knew he should n't be at large . " The Lieutenant paused and spoke rapidly . " Do n't you see . . . I could n't rest with this  --  this animal still at large . . . . It was all so crazy . . . . If he could have done that how could I know that he was n't still lurking out there , or that he might come back again or try to skip or that he might even come for me if  --  if I did n't go grab him and hold him ? " " Grab him and hold him for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brilliance , the audacity of Parnell 's shrewd gamble was slowly coming to me . " For the cops , I guess . All I knew is that I had a feeling I had to go get him before he skipped or somehow got me . I simply had to . " " To kill him ? " I said . " No , no  --  not to kill him  --  to stop him . " The Lieutenant 's eyes darkened . " But I 'll be honest  --  I would have killed him if he 'd made a false move . " " Did he ? " I said . " Did he make a false move ? " " I  --  I really ca n't say . " The Lieutenant brushed the heel of his thumb across his eyebrows . " It 's all so kind of blurred . " " Suppose you try to tell me what you remember , " I said . " Think hard . " The Lieutenant blinked his eyes . " When I got near the side of the hotel I parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment to adjust myself to the light , " he began . " Then I went quickly into  | the bar . This  --  this Barney was behind the bar facing the rear mirror , his back to me . " The Lieutenant spoke jerkily now , as though it were all happening as he spoke . " I see him and he sees me . We watch each other . . . I see nothing else  --  the bar may have been deserted for all I know . . . the scene is frozen , like in a picture . ... I move forward , we 're still watching each other . . . then when I 'm about halfway , perhaps more , between the door and the bar he turns around  --  whirls , more like  --  and drops his left forearm across the bar , in front of him , like this . His right arm is down out of sight . . . his lips are curled and moving . . . . " The Lieutenant paused and sighed . " Then I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy after that . " I lit a cigar and puffed away in silence . An inmate of the jail came out and quickly knelt and retrieved one of my cigar butts . I stood up and silently handed him a fresh one and ground the butt under my heel . He mumbled and squeezed past us with his pail and a mop . Excuse it , please . ' The Lieutenant mopped the sweat off his face . This was the first time I had heard the actual story of the shooting . What carelessness or intuition had ever made me wait till now ? I recalled the pea that had rattled vaguely in the back of my mind the day I had pondered the possible significance of the fact that a Barney Quill at large after the rape was an unarrested felon . The pea was sounding like castanets now . Shrewd old Parnell . But there were still some loose ends to gather up ... . " If you felt this man had to be grabbed , ' as you say , did n't it occur to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney ? " I said . " You knew he was deputized , did n't you ? " Lieutenant Manion laughed briefly and without mirth . " Yes , I guess I knew the old man was a deputy . But I never thought of it or him . Even if I had I would n't have bothered him . " He turned and looked at me . " If  --  if this thing had happened to you , Counselor , would you have sent your aged father ? " I puffed my cigar and stared at the intricate stonework of the barred jail across the way . " I guess that 's the complete answer , Lieutenant , " I said . Mitch could do with that what he would . " Yes , I guess we 'll leave it rest right there . " I sat and thought , a dead cigar in my mouth . Good old Parnell had at last possibly solved one of our biggest headaches : Why had this man gone to the bar ? The pieces were beginning to fall into place . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big news . " Hm . . . . " I said .  | " I wish I had my camera , " a woman 's voice said . " You two look as though you were planning a fishing trip . " It was Laura Manion and her little dog . Laura quickly kissed the Lieutenant , glancing at me , and then shook my hand and joined us sitting on the sun-lit steps . She was dressed in a becoming dark linen suit and wore sheer stockings and high-heeled shoes and a little straw hat with a short veil that fell over her eyes . This was the first time I had seen her dressed up and I calculated that with glasses and a few yards of hawser to lash her in that , yes , I might risk showing her before a jury . " I 'm glad you came , Laura , " I said . " Manny 'll tell you about my Thunder Bay trip later but there are some questions . " I laughed . " With a lawyer there are always more questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sit down , Lieutenant , " I said . " I do n't think there 's anything we ca n't all discuss together . If there is I 'll send you back to Sulo . In fact I want both of you to help if you can . " I turned to Laura . " Did you remember to have the pictures taken and go visit the doctor ? " " Yes , Paul , I 've been photographed and pawed over and peered at like a Hollywood starlet . The pictures will be ready tomorrow . " " Good . Now take this Mary Pilant gal  --  had both of you met her ? " " Yes , " Laura said . " And is n't she charming ? " " Yes , " I agreed , remembering a succinct earthy phrase that old Danny McGinnis had for all attractive women : " She 'd make a dog break his chain . " " Yes , she 's certainly charming . Can either of you tell me anything more about her ? She worked for Barney , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Manny knew but also how little they knew . " Well , " Laura said , " there were stories about her and Barney . " She paused . " But as far as I knew she was a perfect lady . One of our young officers was rather sweet on her , too . " " Who was that ? " " I do n't remember  --  Manny might . " I turned toward the Lieutenant . " Sonny Loftus  --  second lieutenant , " he said briefly . " Were they  --  was this serious ? " I said . Laura and Manny looked at each other and shrugged . " Lord , I do n't know , Paul , " she said , smiling at Manny . " These devilish Army men , you know . . . . All work and no play . . . . " She held up her hands . " Serious ? A summer flirtation ? Who knows ? "  | " And you , Manny ? " I said . He shook his head . " I would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the bartender , Paquette ? " I said . " He made the best old-fashioneds in town , " Manny said . " It was a drink , not a fruit salad . " " He was always courteous to me , " Laura said . " I guess he was just an alert smart bartender , a good man for the house . And he was thoughtful to us after the shooting . " I sat up . " How do you mean ? " I asked . " Well , he came and offered to drive me down to the jail to see Manny that first Sunday  --  I was in no shape to drive  --  and he brought Manny a carton of his favorite cigarettes . " I pricked up my ears . " Anything else ? " I said . " On the way driving down he told me how sorry he was for Manny and me and said  --  how did he put it now ? ? he said he could have told me that Barney was a wolf . " I stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrations  --  of the law are the constant surprises  --  both good and bad ? that its practitioners get from their clients and witnesses . " You mean , " I said , hot on the scent and in full cry now , " you mean Barney 's bartender said that he could have warned you that he , Barney , was a wolf ? He used that word ? He said ' wolf ' ? " " Why , yes , Paul . I thought I 'd told you that before . IIe also said Barney had been drinking hard lately and that it was too bad we had come to Thunder Bay when we had . Is  --  is that good ? " " Clients are clients and lawyers are lawyers  --  and never the twain shall meet , " I thought . " It might help , " I agreed . " Anything else ? " " Well , he brought Manny those cigarettes , as I say . Ile was real nice and thoughtful . " I turned inquiringly toward the Lieutenant . " When he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me how sorry he was for my trouble and said that he wanted me to know that for his part the only thing he held against me was that when I shot Barney I broke a bottle of bonded white-vest bourbon rather than some cheap pilerun cooking whisky . " " He used those terms ? " " Yes . He visited awhile and then he left . Said some friends would drive him back to Thunder Bay . Laura stayed over that night  --  we were trying to reach you all day . And she also had to go visit your ? " he paused and smiled " ? your favorite horse doctor . "  | I restrained the impulse to leap and shout and go seek out Parnell and give him the word . " Have either of you seen him since ? " I said . " The bartender , I mean ? " Laura shook her head . " I saw him once on the street in Thunder Bay  --  naturally I have not been back to the bar  --  and he paused briefly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the last either of us have seen or heard of him . " " Was there any more talk about Barney  --  when you met him on the street ? " " No . Just as I 've told you . " Laura paused and reflected . " Now that you speak of it , it does seem he was sort of restrained and reticent . And in a hurry . About all he did was say hello , ask how Manny was ? and he was gone . " Again I saw the fine silky hand of Mary Pilant at work . What was the gimmick ? What had happened ? Here was a man who 'd gone out of his way to be nice to the Manions , who 'd called his dead boss a wolf  --  and then , by the time I 'd talked to him , had grown shifty and evasive and had referred to Mrs. Manion as a " floozie " and an " easy lay . " What was the score ? I shook my head . I then told the Manions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written his own outfit ; and that they must begin to learn to live with the grim prospect that we might not be able to get a psychiatrist in time for the trial . " It 's only about two and a half weeks away . But I have n't given up yet . I 'll pry a psychiatrist out of this Army of yours , Lieutenant , if I have to make a sign and go picket the Pentagon . Army unfair to Lieutenant . ' " I arose . " Right now I must leave you . Tomorrow is Saturday and I wo n't be down . Next week I must put on my black sateen sleevelets and hit the law books in earnest . I 'll be in touch with you . Good-bye for now . " I turned away . " Happy fishing this weekend , Paul , " Laura called after me . I turned and she and the Lieutenant stood smiling , arm in arm , a picture of wedded compatibility and connubial bliss . It was a pity , thought , that the ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | chapter 27 I went in the sun-blistered back door of the courthouse in search of Parnell and Maida . Gaining the tall main marble hallway I turned and climbed the wide marble stairs leading to the courtroom on the second floor , thinking I might find them in the adjoining law library . My steps rang hollowly along the deserted upper corridors , and it occurred to me that there were fewer places in the world lonelier and emptier than the precincts of a country courtroom between terms of court . For company I 'd any day take a lone beaver dam at dusk .. . . Making my way to the tangle of corridors in back of the courtroom I found the law library deserted and musty-smelling and hot as a Finnish sauna in the bottled summer heat . Packets of unopened and dusty law books and advance sheets and pocket-parts cluttered the tables and chairs . I left this oven and glanced into the jury conference room , where so many fates were decided , and found it empty except for the long table and the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty as a morgue except for a pegless cribbage board on a table . The door of the prosecuting attorney 's office  --  my old one and Mitch 's new one ? stood open ; the office was also empty except for the dusty desk and chairs . A fly about the size of a Russian Mig buzzed crazily up and down one of the sooty windowpanes , with its goal of Lake Superior gleaming far beyond . The court stenographer 's office was empty ; the heavy door to the judge 's chambers was closed but unlocked and I entered . I walked through the dusty book-lined judge 's office and down a short corridor and tried a heavy mahogany door . It breathed open and shut behind me and I found myself standing alone in the dim and empty courtroom . Way back in 1905 the supervisors of Iron Cliffs County outdid themselves when they built the new county courthouse . Conceiving the structure as an undying monument to their statesmanship and proceeding on the theory that if one architectural scheme or motif could be impressive , a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had succeeded beyond their wildest dreams . Few structures in the Peninsula presented a more startling pile of stone and slate and marble and mortar , vestiges of Roman , Norman and Gothic architecture vying mightily with each other for predominance ,  | with authentic nineteenth-century St. Louis Brewery perhaps winning by a nose . The interior of the courthouse was as lined and overlaid with mahogany and marble as a heavily frosted chocolate cake . Whole quarries and forests must have been gouged and toppled in the sacrifice . The tall marble corridors were large enough to play football in  --  including the kicking of high punts  --  while much of the actual business of the courthouse was transacted in cubbyholes . The place was a monument to Thorstein Veblen 's theory of " conspicuous waste . " At the dedication ceremonies ( my mother Belle had told mc ) loggers and farmers and miners had driven in from all over the county , picnicking on the big lawn , listening to the speeches of the rural statesmen , uneasily beholding this remarkable reason for the sharp increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topped by a great oval dome , like a sort of inspired Byzantine architectural afterthought , as though a Turkish mosque had flown over during the night and inadvertently dropped a pup . This rounded dome was visible for miles around Iron Bay , and mariners far out on Lake Superior were said regularly to chart their courses by it . But it was also utilitarian , serving as the skylight of the courtroom ( for once a nice thrifty note ) , and I stood gazing up thoughtfully at its stained-glass windows  --  stained by the pigeons , that is  --  wondering what happy accident had conspired to make this courtroom not only one of great dignity , but also the one place in the entire courthouse where one did not have to shout like a stevedore to be heard . The judge 's bench , a massive mahogany affair , stood like a lone judicial island on the end of the room nearest me , the mahoganyenclosed sheriff 's chair and desk at its right nearer me , the witness stand on the left , and the clerk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly like a truncated battleship with suspended mahogany lifeboats . Glancing guiltily around I ascended to the judge 's bench and sat myself gingerly in the tall leather swivel chair and tilted it ? " Ah " ? and nearly fell backwards . " Oops ! " I glared around looking for someone to commit for contempt . The glowering oil portraits of three bearded deceased judges seemed to frown down even more fiercely from the wall ... . The empty jury box loomed to my left ; the two wide leathertopped counsel tables stood out in front , the People 's ( and plaintiff 's ) table to my left , the defense table to my right , with tall oldfashioned hourglass brass cuspidors standing like tethered watchdogs  | at either corner . Immediately beyond the two tables stood the lawyers ' chairs , running nearly across the width of the courtroom , then the mahogany rail with the gates at either end , and beyond that the double rows of uncomfortable square mahogany benches for the extra jurors and waiting litigants and witnesses and spectators and curious rubbernecks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks they would all be there , craning and whispering and sighing and hiccupping and dozing and endlessly shuffling in and out . I lit a cigar and gazed sightlessly toward the rear of the deep chamber and cleared my throat , gutturally and pompously . " Quiet back there , " I growled , " or I 'll have to ask the bailiff to remove you ! This is my final warning . " Part of my words echoed hollowly back ? " final warning . . . warning . . . ing . . . ing . . . " and I repeated the words , enchanted by the sepulchral effect . Had a psychiatrist seen me at that moment he would have sighed and clapped me in the booby hatch . Were all of us secretly a little crazy ? I slid from the judge 's chair and leapt down off the bench and hurriedly left the courtroom to continue my search for Parnell and Maida . Enough of this summer fantasy . . . . I finally found them in the steel-floored filing vault of the probate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glasses and dictating stealthily to Maida. " jiggers ! " I hissed from the doorway . Parnell started and looked over his steel-rimmed spectacles . " Give us five more minutes and we 'll have it , " he said , almost in a whisper . " Now beat it before someone comes and discovers us . We 're not ready for that . " " Excuse it , please , " I said , and I shrugged and went out and paid rather ponderous court to the lovely Etta , the probate registrar , a maiden lady who possessed more warmth and charm at sixty than most women manage to acquire in a lifetime . Had she been a little younger or I a little older I would certainly have considered making a play for her ... . " Oh , Polly , " Etta blushed , " you say the silliest things , really you do .... " Parnell plodded out of the vault with his battered briefcase , Maida following him like a faithful gun-bearer , the two brushing past me and out into the main corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Etta , and left her blushing prettily , overtaking Parnell and Maida near the far end of the long marble corridor . " What 's the pitch ? " I demanded . " I took a  | bath last week and I regularly anoint myself with Aladdin Salve ? from the large economy jar . What 'd you discover in there ? Oil or a batch of Confederate twenties ? " " Oil , " Parnell said curtly , out of the side of his mouth , like a bookie confiding a tip on the fifth at Pimlico . " Wait till we 're alone , damn it . This stuff is hot . " " Yes , sir , " I said , meekly clamping my cigar in my mouth and following them dutifully out to the car , like little Rover with his faithful flashlight . Parnell had put on the rush act , he explained , because the lawyer for the estate was expected momentarily in probate court and the old man did n't want to be discovered " raiding " the Barney Quill file . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added cryptically . He and Maida were radiant ; they had dug out the probate records in the new file : Estate of Barney Quill , Deceased . The estate had been started the Monday following the shooting , the day I got in the case . Mary Pilant had filed the petition for probate of the will , listing , as required by law , a daughter , Bernadine Quill , age sixteen , as the sole heir at law , with residence at Three Willows , Wisconsin . The will left everything to Mary Pliant , and was dated ? as the bartender had said  --  about three weeks before the shooting . The next important paper had been an appearance and notice of will contest filed by a Green Bay lawyer on behalf of a Janice Quill , individually and as guardian of the daughter , Bernadine , attacking the will on just about all the classic grounds a will can be attacked on , including undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity on the part of Barney Quill due to his excessive drinking and alcoholism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the child 's mother  --  and Barney 's divorced wife . " " Correct , " Parnell said dryly , " except , that the lady does not concede to be the divorced wife ; she has filed a notice and a flock of supporting affidavits claiming that the Wisconsin divorce between her and Barney was void because she had never been served with process or received adequate notice of Barney 's divorce action against her . " " More Technicolor , " I said . " What 's her angle ? " I went on . " Surely after all these years the dame must have known she was divorced . Why in hell should she be trying to undivorce herself now ? "  | " Money , " Parnell answered , hunching his shoulders and rubbing his dry palms together . " Just the same old dreary love story  --  money , money , money . . . . As a fine broth of a former Irish mayor of Chicago once told the graduating school children : Boys and girls , ' he said , remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy happiness , money wo n't buy respect , money wo n't buy honor . Confederate money , that is . ' " Parnell shook his head . " Do n't you see , Paul ? ? if this woman can dump this old divorce and the will , she will come in for her wife 's share of Barney 's property , the daughter getting the other share . If she can dump the divorce alone , even if the will is sustained , she 'll come in for her statutory widow 's third and certain other loot , come hell or high water , even if the daughter is left out in the cold . It 's as neat as bar whisky . And her Wisconsin lawyer 's no slouch either  --  I checked him already in Martindale 's . " " Yes , " I said , " but how can she expect to come into a Michigan probate court and attempt to make a collateral attack on a foreign decree of divorce ? That 's verboten , is n't it , under the full faith and credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polly , " Parnell conceded . " But she also alleges that she is initiating action down there to set aside the Wisconsin divorce . Furthermore , if she claims to be Barney 's wife , it seems to me that it might be up to Mary Pilant to disprove it . " " Yes , Parn . Now it looks like we 've not only got Lieutenant Manion 's murder case to defend but Barney Quill 's will and divorce as well . " Parnell smiled . " How do you mean , boy ? " he said . " What 's that to us ? " " Because this will contest and divorce business are plainly affecting our man 's chances to win this case . That 's why Mary Pilant and the rest of the Thunder Bay Inn crowd have clammed up so . Ca n't you see ? It 's to protect the goddam will , not primarily to hurt us . If they can protect their precious will , Mary Pilant will still get roughly two thirds of the swag , come what may , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming Pilant will get everything if she can sustain both the will and the divorce . So that 's why they ca n't allow Barney to be a boozer and a rounder who was so addled and crazed by drink that he could n't draw a will and would do this thing to Laura Manion . " " That 's just what I figured , too , " Parnell said , smiling dryly . " But I scarcely expected a mere criminal lawyer to see the point . "  | " That 's why the bartender suddenly clammed up with the Manions , " I ran on , ignoring the shaft . " That 's why he 's now willing to make a bag out of Laura . That 's why Mary Pilant is willing to let our man possibly hang rather than let us get at the truth . It 's a fine kettle of fish  --  and I mean bass , damn it , not trout . " " But what do we care about all this ? " Maida said . " How can all this possibly affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " this rape  --  if I may use such an inelegant word in your sheltered presence  --  is the golden key to our defense . Anything that sheds any doubt on that brutal fact hurts our case . " " I still do n't get it . " " Look , one of the biggest areas of possible doubt in this whole case is that a sober man in his right mind would do what Barney did . To the extent that these lovely people  --  whatever their motives ? successfully picture Barney as a sober , God-fearing , un-pistolpacking Boy Scout , and try to pull down Laura Manion in the process , to that extent they cast doubt on our story  --  at the same time building up sympathy for the late departed . This sword has several edges , do n't you see ? What 's more , it happens not to be the truth . " " I see , " Maida said , frowning . " I think I 'll go tear that Mary Pilant 's hair . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the paths of truth , " I said wistfully . " What do you mean when you just said the bartender had Telammed up with the Manions ? " Parnell demanded . " When was the little man ever unclammed ? " " I 'll tell you , " I said . " Things are breaking so fast I have n't had time to tell you . " I told Parnell and Maida what I had just learned from the Manions about the bartender 's expression of sympathy the clay after the shooting , and all the rest  --  this followed by his sudden aloofness . " It 's all tying in , now ; " I continued . " He 's Mary 's star witness and her key man to sustain the will . The Lord knows what his slice of the boodle will be . Probably a cut out of the bar . " I paused . " Let 's sell the plot to the movies , " Maida said , " and all take a trip on the proceeds . " " A trip to the monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days is anti-intellectual and verboten , the mark of the Philistine , the huckster with a pen . There must n't be too much story and that should  | be fog-bound and shrouded in heavy symbolism , including the phallic , like a sort of convoluted literary charade . Symbolism now carries the day , it 's the one true ladder to literary heaven . " Parnell grinned and shook his head . " Ah , the woe of it , the impenetrable mystery . And , since the region is reputed to be somewhat murkier than most , it is better that what little action there is should take place in the womb . " " Whatever are you two talking about ? " Maida pouted , " I 'm sorry I ever mentioned plot . The deal 's off . " Parnell was smiling from ear to car . " And what are you grinning about , you overweight old satyr ? " I said . " I 'm almost getting sorry I got mixed up in this incredible mess . If  --  if I did n't see it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old Martin Mclstrand of town here is Mary Pilant 's lawyer , " Parnell said . " As you know , Martin 's a shrewd old probate and estate lawyer , but lazy as tropical sin . Iie wo n't brief his case till he has to  --  and unfortunately our trial will be over and done before this will contest is heard . That 's still another good reason why our murder case should be continued  --  by then the will contest and all would be over and done , win or lose , and the heat would be off . " " Hell , Parn , " I said morosely , " there 'll doubtless be an appeal from probate whichever way it goes  --  so a continuance in our case is no answer . God , what a maddening case . " " But just think of the law , Polly , the law , " Parnell breathed ecstatically . " Think of all the sweet lovely law we 've got to search for . I can scarcely wait to get at it . Shall we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy uncrating his first bicycle . " Starting tonight I 'm going fishing all weekend , Pam , " I said . " I 'm going to hole up out at the South camp . I 've simply got to crawl off somewhere by myself and submit this case to a jury of my peers ? the trout . And , it 's probably my last crack at fishing . Monday we 've got to start turning over the law books in earnest . " I shrugged . " But if you ca n't wait I wo n't object to your getting a head start . " Parnell 's face fell and I recalled with a pang that he had long since drunk up most of his dwindling law library . " Just to play safe I 'll give you an extra key to my office , " I said , handing him the key . " Any time of the day or night , Counselor , " I said . " Remember , we 're partners now .

" The law of the right of a privy person to make an arrest without a warrant for a felony committ out of his presence . Thanks to you , that subject is now right suiia in the middle of our case . " Parnell 's eyes lit up with quick eagerness . " You remembered to ask him ? " he said gleefully . " You really asked him my question ? T c me what he said ? That 's another one I dreamed up last night in my sleepless bed , Polly . Do n't you see ? ? it  --  it opens up vistas. " 11 ? paused and blinked his eyes and shook his head .
