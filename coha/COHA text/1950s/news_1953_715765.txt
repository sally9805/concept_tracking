Ryan , ' Threatened , ' Gets Police Guard in Hospital By STANLEY LEVEY President Eisenhower 's threeman board of inquiry into the Atlantic Coast dock strike will begin today the job of fact-finding that is expected to result early next week in an anti-strike injunction and the return to work of 50,000 longshoremen . The board , named by the President on Thursday under the national emergency provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act , will hold open ' hearings today at the Governor , Clinton Hotel , beginning at 10 A. M. The three members , headed by David L. Cole , will be under pressure to complete their inquiry and prepare a report for General Eisenhower by midnight Monday. , The report will be based on tes-i timony received from officials of ' Ithe International Longshoremen 's ' Association and the New York Shipping Association , which are in dispute over the terms of a new contract to replace the one that expired last Wednesday midnight . It was at that hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i Me. , to Newport News , Va. , includ- I ing the great Port of New York , were closed to commerce . In addition , there may be testimony from other interested groups , such as the Coast Guard and the ( military services , as well as private organizations with interests ) in the waterfront . That was the case in 1948 when , in another strike situation , a board of inquiry conducted hearings . The fact-finders sent telegrams of invitation yesterday to Joseph P. Ryan , ailing president of the beleaguered I. L. A. , which ( was expelled two weeks ago from the American Federation of Labor for failure to rid its ranks of gangsters , and Patrick J. ( Packy ) Connolly , executive vice president . Other summonses went to the shipping association . A. F. L. Union Not Invited However , the rival International Longshoremen 's Association , A.F.L. , chartered two weeks ago by the federation to . wrest control of the docks from the orphaned Ryan union , had not been invited as of last evening . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a presentation at the open hearing . Mr. Connolly said Ryan , who has been in French Hospital since early this week for treatment of a liver ailment , definitely would not be present . At about the time he was making that statement the Police Department confirmed a report that the 69-yearold union leader was under twentyfour-hour police guard in his private hospital room . One unconfirmed report was that the police guard had been ordered late Thursday night after the Federal Bureau of Investigation . had , passed on information that two thugs were on their way here from Oregon to " wipe out " Ryan . ' One other dock figure , John Dwyer , who this week led Local 895 , which works Greenwich Village piers , out of the Ryan union , also was under police protection . Mr. Dwyer , who is now Manhattan organizer for the American Fedleration of Labor dock group , was accompanied wherever he went along the West Side waterfront by two detectives . The police said the guard was " unofficial . " Thomas ( Teddy ) Gleason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , denied a report published last night that John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers had invited the dock union to join that organization . The same story said the I. L. A. 's strategy committee was considering the invitation . Mr. Gleason , who is secretary of the committee and attended meetings of the body yesterday , said he had never heard the subject mentioned , either at the committee meeting or in conversations with Mr. Connolly . He said there had been offers of " help " from various unions , but he doubted one of these had come from the mine union . ? Despite rumors and an atmosphere of gathering tension , the waterfront and , in fact , the entire coast had no violence . There was picketing in many places , and mass picketing at Pier 45 . For the most part Ryan pickets and partisans for the A. F. L. pier union ignored each other . Thus , in the early morning there was no trouble when Peter Loughran , shop steward of Local 895 , tacked a hand-lettered sign to the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. was good enough for my father by God , it 's good enough for me . Sign up and strike a blow for freedom . " Police Block Free-for-All But for one threatening mo-I ment , at the same pier a few minutes later , the beginning of a free-for-all appeared in the making . An L L. A. picket , incensed by a federation pamphlet passer , took a roundhouse swing ' at him . Then two lines , one composed of pickets and the other of anti-Ryan men , surged toward each other . But swiftly moving mounted and foot patrolmen raceu into the gap and turned back the converging groups . The antagonists parted with threats to meet " two blocks north , " but nothing came of the incident . The Ryan union reported the Atlantic Coast " 100 per cent tied up , with nothing moving . " That was not entirely true of the Port of New York , for there was some activity here , though none of it with the aid of I. L. A. longshoremen or tugboat workers . The office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships in port were strikebound ? thirty of them anchored in the stream and thirty-two at piers . The seventy-five other vessels were tankers , idle ships and vessels under repair in drydock . With a warm sun brightening the waterfront and the water calm and glassy , four passenger liners had no trouble docking safely without the help of tugboats , whose crews , out of sympathy with the strikers , have refused to handle dry cargoes and passenger vessels . One of the four was the 52,000-ton French Line liner Libertd . Another was the NorwegianAmerica liner Stavengerfjord . " We never used tugs in Norway , " explained Capt . Olaf Bjornstad after docking the ship at Pier 42 . Sailing Today Deferred The sailing of the liner Constitution for the Mediterranean , scheduled for today , was canceled by the American Export Lines . The company said the ship would depart as soon as the strike was over . The same line also reported that a public inspection of the Italian Line ship Andrea Doria also has been canceled . That vessel is due in this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategy committee of the Ryan union , headed by Capt . William V. Brad ley , president of Local 333 , representing tugboat workers , charged that Paul Hall , secretary-treasurer of the Seafarers International Union , A. F. L. , and one of the organizers of the rival pier union , was " now a puppet of Governor Dewey . " Captain Bradley asserted that Mr. Hall 's objective was to get longshore jobs for 10,000 unemployed seamen through the new bi-state Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor . But , he added , Mr. Hall " wo n't get away with it . " He said the seafarers ' leader had asked the commission for 10,000 registration blanks for his idle members . Under the trend of the waterfront law , which becomes effective Dec. 1 , all longshoremen desiring to work are required to register with the commission . To that end the commission already has begun to circulate registration forms . Captain Bradley said the law , which is being contested in the courts by his union , gave job preference to men with seniority on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declared , " will never be allowed to work as longshoremen in the New York-New Jersey district . " The commission announced yesterday that 4,000 more registration cards had been filled out and returned to its offices by longshoremen . This was in addition to 2,350 turned in on Thursday . Meanwhile , the commission obtained from Federal Judge Alexander Holtzoff an order requiring Local 1346 of the I. L. A. to show cause why its petition for a restraining order against the commission should not be dismissed . The order is returnable next Tuesday . The I. L. A. is seeking to restrain the agency from enforcing a section of the law setting up the commission . Joseph Kaitz , director of license and investigation for the commission , said he and other officials of the bi-state agency would meet next Tuesday with Mr. Hall and Dave Beck , president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , A. F. L. , and one of five trustees of the new federation dock union . The meeting was scheduled at the request of the labor leaders . 500 Dockers Show Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the no-strike injunction had been issued under the Taft-Hartley Law , reported for work yesterday morning . After taking testimony here the President 's board of inquiry will submit its report to General Eisenhower . On the basis of that report Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . is expected to go into Federal Court to ask for an eighty-day injunction against the strike . The Ryan I. L. A. has announced its intention to abide by any such order and to return its members to work at once . Members of the I. L. A. helped bring the Cunard liner Britannic , which had been diverted to Halifax , N. S. , from New York , into port there , but no cargo was unloaded . George J. Abrams , executive secretary of the Honest Ballot Association , which was to have conducted a vote among members of Local 808 in Brooklyn today to determine whether they wished to stay in the I. L.
