BOLIVIA <P> Irving Florman 's qualifications for the job of U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia were somewhat unorthodox when Harry Truman picked him last November . He had been a Manhattan inventor ( cigarette lighters , mine detectors ) , and a sometime Broadway lyric-writer ( Chauve-Souris , 1943 ) . But he was a faithful contributor to Democratic campaigns-and an individualist . He let it be known right from the start that he planned to run his own show in his own way . <P> For his presentation of credentials to Bolivia 's President Momerto Urriolagoitia ( pronounced ooreo-la-goytcha ) , Florman decked himself put in a colorful outfit of his own devising : formal tails , the waistcoat of a dinner jacket , striped pants , a soft white shirt , black and yellow striped tie and an Ascot hat . When an aide suggested that a regular morning coat might be better , Florman cut him off sharply : " When I need your advice , I 'll ask for it . " <P> Chewing Gum &; Shellac . Since then no embassy aide has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Soon , irrepressible Irving Florman had taken personal charge of U.S. public relations , was busily writing signed articles for the Bolivian press , explaining world events and interpreting U.S. history in a flowery prose style . On July 4th he turned out a story on the U.S. Declaration of Independence which appeared in all Bolivian dailies . " Until Bolivians read my article , " said Florman , " they thought our Declaration was something a flock of millionaires dreamed up . " The delighted Bolivian press printed all he wrote and begged for more . <P> Florman did not confine himself to interpreting the U.S. to Bolivia . He also bubbled over with ideas fof improving Bolivia . Shocked at the coca-chewing habits of Bolivia 's Indians , Florman suggested that carloads of U.S. chewing gum be shipped in for distribution to the Indians , thus wean them away from narcotics . And when Florman sampled the gritty , brown fluid burping from La Paz 's water taps , he got another idea . He recommended that the Paceos pump shellac through their mains to coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes . <P> Diplomacy in Shirtsleeves . Last week bustling Irving Florman was hard at work on his biggest project . With President Urriolagoitia 's grateful approval , Florman had stepped into the foreign-exchange negotiations between Bolivia 's chronically hard-pressed government and the big tin operators . Because the government had threatened to seize the bulk of the tinmen 's foreign exchange , the producers had threatened to cut back production . Said Florman bluntly : " If you gentlemen do n't give in and speed up production , you will be guilty of creating a grave problem for Bolivia and for U.S. security , as well as for the United Nations ' war effort . " <P> These were hard words for any foreign diplomat to use . They sounded even more undiplomatic coming from a U.S. representative who must always guard against charges of interference and yanqui imperialism .
