Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> Unlike most U.S. ex-Presidents , Harry Truman has never seemed stumped over what to do for an encore . Putting in frequent hot licks on his memoirs , building his $1,750,000 memorial library , gadding off to Democratic clambakes to give ' em hell while television cameras strain on their dollies to keep up with him , he obviously has no yen to let history pass him by . Last week bee-busy Mr. Truman had his most historic week since leaving the White House . First , he hopped up to Milwaukee to accept a $5.000 Steinway grand piano ( for the library ) from the American Federation of Musicians . On a convention platform bristling microphones , while some 1,100 professional musicians grinned and bore it , Amateur Pianist Truman banged out Hail , Hall , the Gang 's All Here on the gift instrument , with the nation 's most loose-lipped trumpeter , Musicians ' Czar James Caesar Petrillo , bleating what passed for the south half of a duet going north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in G , later lauded by a Chicago musicritic as " recognizable . " But the worst of his week was yet to come . <P> He scooted back to Kansas City for an open-air performance of the musicomedy Call Me Madam , in which Musicomedian Truman was to surprise everybody by taking the stage to play himself in the last act . Good trouper though he is , he never made it . During the first act , grimacing in pain from what he thought was acute indigestion , he left the theater . Twenty-seven hours later , his longtime personal physician , Dr. Wallace Graham , relieved Harry Truman of a red-hot appendix and a gangrenous gall bladder . Practically bouncing off the operating table , Truman , in " excellent " condition , was a good bet to hit the sawdust trail again soon .
