Only a week remained before Parlia-rrfent would adjourn for the summer , and according to the rules Her Majesty 's loyal Opposition had the right to choose the issues to be debated . The decision was an easy one : nowhere was the government of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in deeper trouble than in its Africa policy . <P> On top of the scandal over Kenya 's Hola camps , where eleven African prisoners had been beaten to death by guards , had come the Devlin report ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) calling the British protectorate of Nyasaland a " police state " and challenging the Colonial Office 's need to avert an African " massacre " of white settlers that never took place . There were editorial outcries that Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd should resign ; his office had been discredited by the very commission it had appointed , headed by a British high-court justice and including on its staff Lord Montgomery 's wartime Chief of Intelligence . The commission had been hailed last March by Lennox-Boyd as " expert impartial people with judicial experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subhuman Individuals . " Arms folded and feet on table , Lennox-Boyd stared stonily ahead in the House of Commons , as the Opposition charged the government with condoning lynch law in Africa by refusing to accept responsibility for the Hola murders . He was not helped much by a volunteered defense from a Tory backbencher that the African victims were " desperate and subhuman individuals . " Next day came the Devlin debate . <P> True enough , said Attorney General Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller , leading off for the government , the Devlin commission had found no reliable evidence that a " massacre " was about to take place . But then , said the Attorney General , the Colonial Secretary , in explaining to the House what had gone on in Nyasaland , had used the word " massacre " only once . " Apparently , " snorted Labor 's Colonial Expert James Callaghan , " if the Right Honorable Gentleman says it once , we are not to take him seriously . " <P> " The Squalid One . " Winding up for the Opposition , Aneurin Bevan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent federation with apartheid-minded Southern Rhodesia , and quoted some 1957 rhetoric by the Federation 's Prime Minister Sir Roy Welen-sky to show what would happen if Britain tried to stand in Rhodesia 's way . Sir Roy had said " I personally would never be prepared to accept that Rhodesians have less guts than the American colonists . " Since the government had jailed Nyasa-land 's African leader , Dr. Hastings Banda , Bevan challenged Lennox-Boyd " to mention anything that Dr. Banda has said which is more provocative than that . " More solemnly , Bevan continued : " We are really trying to decide how to solve a problem which , if it is not solved , will continue to bleed us for generations . " And then , in a peroration that was only a sad echo of the old Nye , Bevan concluded : " This is the worst Parliament I have been in . Some Parliaments have been called ' Long Parliaments . ' Some have been called ' Rump Parliaments . ' But this will be known by history as the squalid one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
