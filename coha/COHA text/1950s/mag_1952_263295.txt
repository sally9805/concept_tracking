A short moment of silence jails upon the Great Hall of the Kremlin . The great Leader rises and directs his steady and measured steps towards the rostrum . All present rise to their feet . The walls of the Kremlin Palace shake with the echo of " Hurrah . " All that fills the soul of the Soviet man , all that has been dearest Jor the Communist is put into this ovation , which expresses a boundless sea of love for their Leader . A minute passes-two , three . The ovation , like an Alpine avalanche , grows greater and greater . It only ends when the desire to hear Stalin becomes uppermost . . . <P> Thus Radio Moscow last week reported the opening of the last session of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party ( TIME , Oct. 13 et seq . ) . Stalin , as expected , was to have the last word . <P> The Word . Shorn of its doublespeak , the word was cynically frank . Henceforth , said the Leader , the Soviet Union will openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Stalin declared that the " export of revolution is nonsense , " * the U.S.S.R. and its underlings abroad have publicly maintained the fiction that foreign Communist parties are independent , national organizations , unconnected , except by ideology , with the fountainhead in Moscow . Stalin 's speech made little attempt to continue the fiction . <P> The Soviet Union , said Stalin , owes a debt of gratitude to its " brothers " in other lands : to the " British workers " who organized " Hands Off Russia " campaigns in 1918 , to Comrade Thorez of France and Comrade Togliatti of Italy for restating for all to hear that their peoples would never fight against the Red army . In helping the Soviet Union , said Stalin , these leaders had naturally helped themselves , yet now that Communism is a " mighty force , " it is the bounden duty of the Soviet Union to help them too . <P> The Leader was careful not to make any warlike promises which might queer the party 's official peace offensive . But he made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist " struggles of liberation , " as in Korea , struggles for the " retirement " of " warlike governments " and the overthrow of capitalism , as in Czechoslovakia and China , and the promotion of war between " imperialist " states . <P> Shock Brigades . At one point the Leader waxed nostalgic . Today , he said , the task of the " shock brigades of liberation " ( fifth columnists ) is easier by far than it was in the glorious days of 1918 when the true Heroes of the Soviet Union ( men like Joseph Stalin ) stood alone against the world . " Today . . . from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary , new shock brigades have appeared in the forms of popular democratic governments . " The Leader set forth a new set of rules : <P> Since Europe 's bourgeoisie have " sold " their nations ' pride and liberty for a mess of U.S. dollars ( the Marshall Plan ) , Communists have a glorious opportunity to pose as patriots ' raising the banner of national independence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans against British , British against Americans . <P> Infiltrate and corrode West Europe 's Socialist parties by enlisting them in anti-rearmament coalitions , i.e. , popular fronts .
