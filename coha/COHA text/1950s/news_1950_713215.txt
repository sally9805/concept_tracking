txt deleted 1st page CRITICS ON KOREA CHIDED BY COLLINS // representing a democracy , he could not ruthlessly confiscate vast areas and let Japanese starve so he could have room for tiaining maneuvers . " Those occupation troops , overnight , had a war on their hands and orders to fly , lightly armed , to the front and start fighting . " And they held , " General Collins emphasized . " The first United States unit to reach Korea was a half of one infantry battalion . They started in early the morning they landed and , until late afternoon , by themselves , they held an entire Communist division . Does that sound like the work of green , untrained men ? " When the critics asked why the United States troops did not have heavy weapons such as the more powerful bazooka , General Collins replied : " Because the weapon had just been developed and gotten into production . It was only two to three weeks before the Korean move that we began to get mass production of heavy bazooka shells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of days . " In explaining why the United States forces had been equipped with light tanks early in the fighting , the Chief of Staff said : " Because the occupation job in Japan called for light tanks . Our so-called medium tanks are actually pretty heavy . Japan has a road system built aroung light bridges . Our mediums , running around Japan on occupation assignment , would have torn up that whole road system . " But General Collins recalled that in a matter of weeks Sherman tanks with 76-mm. guns and Pershings with 90-mm. artillery had been moved across 5,000 ocean miles and put into action . " And in every single engagement since they arrived , they have knocked out everything the enemy could send against them , " he asserted . " That 's our answer to those who say we have no tan* to handle the Communist T-34 . " His patience with , critics of the Air Force performance in Korea ' is as brief as his regard for Army detractors . " Like the Army , the Air Force had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Gen. Walton Walker testifies that , but for what the fliers did those first days , we would have lost Korea . " At the beginning , there was confusion over air support . But , with the inevitable early creaking ; the situation has steadily improved . Special Air Force teams rushed from the States to coordinate close support of ground troops ; we now have one with each American division and have assigned others to Republic of Korea units . Now the system works . " General Collins ' attitude is not based on reports from others . He returned a week ago from a Korean inspection that took him to every divisional headquarters and to individual regimental fronts . He came back sure that the United States forces and supporting units from other United Nations forces would hold . " Unless the Korean Communists get serious outside reinforcements , we wul hold our bridgehead essentially as it is now , he said . " There will be some give and take along the perimeters , but we are there to stay . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
