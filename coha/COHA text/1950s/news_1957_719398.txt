txt The Secretary of Agriculture cut Federal price supports on dairy products as deeply as the law allowed today . That it was not painless surgery was evidenced immediately by outcries from milk areas . Ezra Taft Blzson , the Secretary , said the decrease , effective next April 1 , should give consumers a reduction of half a cent a quart on milk and 2 cents a pound on butter and cheese . Members of Congress from dairy states and milk producer spokesmen termed " shocking " arid " disastrous " , the lowering of price supports to the permitted minimum of 75 per cent of parity . . Parity is a Federal formula designed to give farmers a fair price for their products in relation to their costs . Ouster Demands Foreseen The slash drew criticism across party lines . It will probably revive demands that President Eisenhower drop Mr. Benson from the Cabinet . The Secretary apparently had this in mind when he announced the action at a news conference . He noted that 1958 was a Congressional election year , and added , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do all I can to help farmers , regardless of pressures . " Senators Edward J. Thye , Republican of Minnesota , and William Proxmire , Democrat of Wisconsin , immediately announced they would introduce legislation in the next session of Congress to maintain dairy supports at current levels . Mr. Benson declared that existing supports were building new surpluses of butter , cheese and dried milk . The lower levels , he said , " will provide less incentive - for excessive production , " while maintaining an adequate supply as called for in farm law and encouraging iry product consumption . Milk Supported at $3.25 Supports are now set at $3.25 per 100 pounds of milk used in manufacturing and 58.6 cents a pound on butterfat , These reflect 83 per cent of parity for manufacturing milk and 80 per cent for butterfat . Mr. Benson said dollar-andcent levels at 75 per cent of parity would be set later . At current parity , the drop to 75 per cent would mean $3 per 100 pounds of manufacturing milk and 56.2 cents for butterfat . E. M. Norton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual loss to dairymen-at $250,000,000 through depressed prices . He said the Secretary 's action meant a " windfall " for handlers and dealers , who , he added , mould start to pay the lower prices immediately to produc2rs . Mr. Norton also challenged Ar . Benson 's statement that the cut would mean savings to consumers . " That has not been the history , " he ' said , in recalling previous price support reductions . He ' disputed Mr. Benson 's statement that dairy industry representatives had been consulted on the problem . No producer group was approached , Mr. Norton said . This was the second time Mr. Benson had dropped dairy supTorts to the floor permitted by ' law . In 1954 the subsidy went from 90 to 75 per cent of parity . President Eisenhower cautioned him then against cutting supports too much . The Administration was trying to get the Government out of agriculture and free farmers from controls . Mr. Benson said this time the matter had been discussed at the White House . Last year the President vetoed a high price-support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar - and- cent levels while the Administration undertook an intensive disposal effort . As a result , dairy stocks in Government storage dwindled and once , late in 1956 , the Government ran out of butter . In the last year there has been a slow build-up , which Mr. Benson said had cost the Government $329,000,000 , As of Dec. the Government owned 33,698,000 pounds of butter , 178,144,000 pounds of cheese and 25,074,000 pounds of dried milk . Mr. Benson said the dairy reduction did not pressage a cut in price supports on other crops . However , he said he planned to push his recommendations for eliminating " rigid formulas " to permit him to set support levels with great-. er discretion . State Loss Put at 11 Million The cost to dairy farmers in New York as a result of the support cut will be about $11 , - 000,000 in the marketing year beginning next April , the Dairymen 's League Cooperative Association said here yesterday .                   @ @
