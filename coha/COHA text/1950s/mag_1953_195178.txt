THE MAN FROM MAIN STREET ( 371 pp. ) - Edited by Harry Maule and Melville Cane-Random House ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> Like a good many other U.S. novelists who get a kick out of posing as intellectual primitives , Sinclair Lewis was much more of a literary fellow than he let on . Between novels he wrote almost a million words of essays , sketches and reviews . In The Man from Main Street , two of Lewis ' associates have combed together a miscellany of his nonfiction which contains its full quota of transient fluff but also proves that Lewis had a lively if undisciplined gift for criticism . <P> Most of Lewis ' pieces about other people 's books were really implicit defenses of his own . Throughout his life he kept up a running journalistic battle in behalf of realism , by which he meant his idea that the American village could be " as inquisitorial as an army barracks ' ' and the American businessman " the most grievous victim of his own militant dullness . " At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " genteel philosophy " personified in William Dean Howells , a writer with " the code of a pious old maid whose greatest delight was to have tea at the vicarage " ; literary commercialism , which bent the imagination to a soapsuds formula , and highbrow professors who " like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead . " <P> The single most interesting piece in The Man from Main Street is an unpublished introduction to Babbitt in which Lewis discussed his caricature of " the Tired Business Man . . . who plays third-rate golf and first-rate poker at a second-rate country club . " But there are other , highly readable things : a sly reminiscence of a month spent with Upton Sinclair in a Utopian-socialist community ; a group of sketches about his apprenticeship as a reporter ; a picture of Jack London trying to read Henry James and bursting out with a wail : " Do any of you know what all this junk is about ? " <P> In Babbitt , Main Street and other novels , Sinclair Lewis broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Yahoo-but later he failed to realize that the fight he had fought was over and won . In his articles he kept shadow-boxing at opponents he had knocked out years before , and perhaps it was this tedious concentration on the bogies of his youth that made his later books seem like watery rewrites of his best work . <P> <P> What saved Lewis from becoming a bore was his love for the American scene , and his self-perception . In an obituary he once composed for himself , he described Sinclair Lewis as " a cheerful pathologist , exposing the clichs and sentimentalities of his day " - and then added : " It is evident that Mr. Lewis smote . . . sentimentality because he knew himself to be , at heart , a sentimentalist.
