Editor Hodding Carter of the Greenville ( Miss . ) Delta Democrat-Times has helped make Greenville a notable example of tolerance in the race-and religion-conscious South . Although Negroes outnumber whites nearly two to one in the Greenville area , there is little friction between the two races . Carter , a determined but unfanatical liberal who believes the South can best solve its own problems , has not attacked segregation . He has concentrated on building up respect between races and between religions . At 44-year-old Editor Carter 's urging , Greenville Protestants and Catholics helped build a new synagogue for the Jews . Then he started a campaign to have the Jews and Protestants chip in for a new Catholic school . Moreover , he has made tolerance plus live-wire journalism pay : the Delta Democrat-Times nets some $75,000 a year on a gross of about $500,000 . <P> <P> Last week Editor Carter got a chance to widen his influence . In booming Natchez , whose population ( now 22,678 ) has increased 48% in a decade , a group of businessmen started the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( circ. 4,918 ) . The Times almost caught up in circulation ( 4,513 ) , but made so little money that the owners were glad to turn over the paper 's management and sell half its stock to Hod Carter for an undisclosed figure . Publisher Carter and his 35-year-old general manager , John T. Gibson , who will split Carter 's half-interest in the Times , immediately went to work to make things hot for the competition . In his first issue last week , Carter cleaned out a lot of the dull clutter from the anemic Times , gave it some reader-building liver injections by adding five new columns ( the Alsops , Robert Ruark , Earl Wilson , Lee Bedford 's " Southern Exposure , " Carter 's own weekly , " Looking at the South , " already syndicated in 16 other papers ) . In the lead Times editorial , Publisher Carter tapped out a clean-cut statement of his own credo : " We want the Times to be a mirror in which the community can see its full face . If the face appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper . . . We wo n't seek controversy for the sake of controversy or shun it for the sake of peace . . . " It looked as if things would soon be livelier in Natchez.
