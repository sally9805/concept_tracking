Mr. Potts Goes to Moscow ( Associated British Pathe ; Stratford ) gets hold of a genuinely comic idea but never quite brings it off . Potts ( played by British Actor George Cole , who starred as the kiteflying husband in Somerset Maugham 's Quartet ) is a sanitation engineer who has been designing the men 's rooms at a British atomic-research center . Bound for a French vacation , he innocently walks off with the wrong briefcase , containing top-secret plans of a new Abomb . With England in an uproar and security officers searching everywhere for him , Potts is waylaid by Russian agents , plied with vodka , and whisked off to Moscow for what he thinks is a job of applying badly needed improvements to Soviet plumbing . <P> Once Potts discovers that he is carrying top-secret papers , the film switches from an agreeable spoof of security agents to a slapstick comedy of Keystone Cops vintage . Trying desperately to hide the plans , Potts teeters on the window ledge of a Moscow hotel , temporarily loses himself among the parading delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rooftop to rooftop with police in hot pursuit . <P> Though a far cry from Ninotchka , the 1939 anti-Communist comedy starring Garbo , Mr. Potts does have some fun with the stuffy officialdom of both East and West .
