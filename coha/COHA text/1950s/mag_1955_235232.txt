In loyalty to their faith , a vast crowd of Roman Catholics gathered in Buenos Aires last week and victoriously defied Strongman Juan Pern . While a special Corpus Christi procession was held inside the packed cathedral on the Plaza de Mayo , 100,000 Catholics knelt outside under the afternoon sky . After the ceremonies , the crowd formed into a broad river and flowed , slowly and silently at first , toward the federal Congress building . <P> A Rumble of Prayers . The marchers expected the police of President Pern , who has been feuding with the Catholic Church since last October , to attack . Not a police car came within sight . The pace of the march quickened , and silence gave way to a rumble of prayers and hymns . <P> Halting before the Congressional Palace , the crowd watched as leaders raised a blue-and-white Argentine flag and a yellow-and-white Vatican flag on the building 's flagpole . Several agile demonstrators clambered up the scaffolding of a huge Peronista Party billboard and draped it with the Argentine and Vatican colors . <P> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Catholics sensed that they had won the day ; they were so numerous and so united that Pern &; Co. did not dare to try force against them . <P> What had started out as a grim march of defiance turned into a victory parade , cheered on by watchers from windows and balconies . Until the thinned-out procession finally broke up , the Catholic marchers-and not the police-ruled the streets of the nation 's capital . <P> A Charge of Vandalism . The procession in the cathedral actually took place two days after Corpus Christi Day . Because Pern had cut that feast day from the list of national holidays , the archdiocese of Buenos Aires postponed the traditional Corpus Christi procession from Thursday to Saturday so that more workingmen could attend . In an attempt to divert Catholics from the Plaza de Mayo , Pern &; Co. timed Boxer Pascual Prez homecoming from Japan ( where he had defended his world flyweight championship ) to coincide with the Corpus Christi ceremonies . At midweek the government invoked the law , passed after the church feud broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Announced Interior Minister Angel Gabriel Borlenghi : " The prelates had erred in assuming that a procession could be held on Saturday after permission had been given for Corpus Christi Day proper . " On Saturday , the Peronista press and radio announced that the ceremonies had been called off . The government drastically slowed down service on streetcar , bus and subway lines leading toward the Plaza de Mayo , but the Catholics came anyway , some of them walking miles from their homes in the suburbs . <P> Sunday a mob attacked the Metropolitan Cathedral in downtown Buenos Aires hurling stones and fruit while it chanted " Long live Pern , down with the Pope . " As a priest sang a Mass inside , a crowd gathered on the steps of the cathedral while opponents hurled stones and rotten fruit and fired a few shots . The crowd answered , " Long live Christ the King . " When the faithful were at last driven from the steps , the mob stoned the win dows of the Episcopal Palace . Pern rushed to his office , ordered all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
