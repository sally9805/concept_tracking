To Publisher W. J. Valentine of California 's Antelope Valley Ledger-Gazette ( circ. 6,612 ) the news was significant , and he printed it . AIR FORCE FORECASTS ACTIVITY DECLINE AT PALMDALE AIRPORT , read the Page One banner headline . The story below quoted Air Force officials who said employment at the facility on the edge of the Mojave desert , 60 miles north of Los Angeles , would be reduced from 3,542 to 1,972 by late 1960 . <P> But to Antelope Valley realtors bad news is no news . They were convinced that the Gazette had betrayed their efforts to sell land , and they began a campaign to get Antelope Valley retailers to pull their ads out of the Gazette . Said an angry realtor : " If I were selling apples , I would not put the rotten ones on top of the barrel . " <P> When half of the Gazette 's real-estate advertisers last week canceled or reduced their linage , Publisher Valentine , 42 , an Annapolis-trained ex-commander , U.S.N. , stood fast , ran a story reporting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset by the employment news , were realistic enough not to blame it on the Gazette , refused to go along with the realtors . By week 's end , it was clear to all that Publisher Valentine had won his point : " Everyone in Antelope Valley is entitled to the news , whether good or bad . "
