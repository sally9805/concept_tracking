A new hazard of the nuclear age came to light last week . Five mechanics of Pan American World Airways had been in Gander , Nfld. , to check the Boeing 707 jetliner that went into an unscheduled dive-and almost plunged its passengers into the Atlantic ( TIME , Feb. 16 ) . They did their job and returned to New York . When the mechanics passed through a gate at Idlewild International Airport , one of the unseen Geiger counters that monitor international travelers chattered an alarm ; some of the work clothes they were wearing were radioactive . At the Pan American dispensary , they were decontaminated and pronounced in no danger , but reports of the affair brought Radiation Expert James D. Terrill of the U.S. Public Health Service up from Washington to investigate . <P> The incident revealed that1 ) the U.S. had prudently installed a system to check incoming travelers for radioactive material ; 2 ) nuclear bomb tests have left enough radioactive debris in the atmosphere to contaminate high-flying planes . Pan Am 's 707 had been flying at about 35,000 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces ; when the mechanics checked the aircraft , their gloves and clothes picked up a charge . <P> Radioactivity has been found before on Air Force jets , the Atomic Energy Commission admitted , but this was the first time that a commercial jet had been involved . The amount of contamination was not considered large enough to present any threats to passengers , but might endanger mechanics who were exposed to it for long periods while servicing the plane . Though the Public Health Service had not yet decided what precautions should be taken , Pan Am washed down the rest of its jets , may institute a system of spot checking jet flights for any trace of radioactivity . <P> <P> *In a preliminary report , Federal Aviation Agency inspectors have concluded that the 7O7 's trouble started with the automatic pilot , and in particular with the elevator trim tabs , which control the airplane 's up-or down-or level-flight attitude . They also found breaches of operating procedure : i ) the automatic flight recorder had no tape in it ; 2 ) only one pilot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international flights ; 3 ) the copilot , alone at the controls , had pushed his seat so far back that when the dive began , he could not reach them quickly .
