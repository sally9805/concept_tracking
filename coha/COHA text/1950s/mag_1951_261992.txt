" When her plane put down in Denver , she took a swing at the nearest stranger , apologized when she found the man was not another reporter , but merely an investigator from the District Attorney 's office who wanted to ask some questions . Said she later : " I 've had a hell of a trying day . " Home at last in Spokane , Virginia found that the Government could dish out a few backhand slaps itself .

" <P> Boarding the Swedish liner Gripsholm in Manhattan , bound for Moscow , Russia 's U.N . Delegate Jacob Malik loftily vetoed newsreel and television requests for a parting statement . Apparently not yet accustomed to U.S. editors who cut superfluous words , he complained that his famous Korean cease-fire speech had been censored in part . Said the nettled delegate : " American newsreels and television cut out much of the things I said .
