Correspondent George H. Hall of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch shot a question at the President : " Could you identify the group of persons in the White House or the Administration who give final clearance to nominations . . . before you send them to the Senate ? " <P> Dwight Eisenhower did not miss the innuendo . He stiffened , his eyes sparked and , in a voice that needed no electronic amplification , he barked his answer : I do . Before he appoints anybody to an important post , he said , he calls him in and asks about his philosophy , whether he is biased or distinctly in favor of some doctrinal idea . He always tries to get a man logically devoted to the service , who generally conforms to what the President calls the middle-of-the-road philosophy . He does n't like extremists , Eisenhower added-particularly those who make up their minds before they know the facts . <P> At his press conference the President also announced that he is going to do something about the problems of overlapping functions between federal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a presidential commission to study the problem and try to stake out the proper areas for each authority . <P> Ike gave Chip Bohlen his unqualified support ( see below ) . He again gently reproved the authors of the Bricker treaty limiting amendment to the Constitution : while he is sure the Senators are patriotically well-intentioned , the President said , the amendment would certainly restrict the President 's flexibility in the conduct of foreign relations . The Korean ammunition supply , he said , is equal to the existing military situation there . And he gave the Truman Administration one of his rare slaps , deplored the $709,000 terminal leave collected by the Fair Deal 's top brass ; he would never allow his own officials , he said , to accumulate such an obligation against the Government . <P> Last week the President also : Nominated Minnesota 's Lieutenant Governor Ancher Nelsen , 48 , to be Rural Electrification Administrator , replacing Claude Wickard who resigned by request . A rawboned , farm-bred son of Danish immigrants , Nelsen is a longtime partisan of the farmer . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first sortie into the business wing of the White House . Mamie came down to find the sources of Ike 's recurrent colds , promptly noted the drafty French doors in the Cabinet Room . Met with top congressional leaders to plan drastic cuts in next year 's ( $7.6 billion ) foreign aid program .
