In New York , the society of Ward McAllister 's Four Hundred has become emulsified in cafe society 's bottle . In Washington , the society of the cave-dwellers was sacrificed on the time clock of a U.S. Government that became too busy for measured elegance . But in Chicago , high society has survived almost intact from the days when Mrs. Potter Palmer led the elite around by her pearl rope necklace . Even in Chicago something has been lacking . Not in years-not , in fact , since the Palmer days of the ' 905-has Chicago had an acknowledged queen of society . <P> The lack bothered Athlyn Deshais , a conscientious newshen who runs the Chicago Daily News 's lively society page . Last month Athlyn decided that , since no bona fide doyenne was in sight , she had better arrange to have one chosen-by democratic referendum , of course . Just before Christmas she sent out ballots to 2,000 pedigreed socialites , to elect a new queen . Society reacted with murmurs of pleasure and squeals of outrage . Just about 50% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the News breathlessly reported the latest tabulations . Thirty-five of Chicago 's hostesses were nominated , and even Mammy Yokum , of Dogpatch , received six votes . The old Chicago wheat-pit spirit raised its head . Laughed International Harvester Director Chauncey McCormick : " I 've been offering a dollar apiece for votes for my wife , but I heard Ed Cudahy is offering $1.25 , so I 'm upping my offer to $1.50 . " <P> This week Athlyn Deshais announced the name of the winner and new queen : Mrs. Chauncey McCormick . Sighed Mrs. McCormick : " I 'm completely overcome . " Certainly the new queen was eminently qualified for her job . Marion McCormick , a grandmother in her 60s , is a third-generation Chicagoan , and one of the richest women in the U.S. She gives impeccable dinners , served on gold plate and fine Lowestoft china . She is a cousin by marriage of Bertie McCormick . She owns fabulous emeralds , pearls and old masters , presides over a luxurious Lake View Avenue apartment , a Wheaton suburban estate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami . She is a generous benefactor of the Chicago Art Institute ( her husband Chauncey is president ) , and a bountiful worker for many charities . The queen , nearly everybody in Chicago agreed , was just right . After all , Athlyn explained , " Mrs. McCormick was a Deering , you know . She 's farm implement on both sides .
