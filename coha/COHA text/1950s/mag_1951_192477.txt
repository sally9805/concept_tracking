THE DESERT OF LOVE ( 214 pp . ) <P> Francois Mauriac-Pellegrini &; Cudahy ( $3 ) <P> For the novelist of religious mind , sin is a pervasive subject . But Franois Mauriac , a Roman Catholic and one of the most gifted of living French novelists , was pulled up short 23 years ago by the challenge of a friend and fellow Catholic : Was Mauriac 's fascination with sin a shade too rapt for piety ? Advised Thomist Jacques Maritain : let Mauriac examine his soul to see whether it was pure enough to portray evil " without conniving with it . " <P> Pained , Mauriac wrote an essay in self-defense . " Christianity , " he complained , " makes no allowance for the flesh ; it abolishes it . " The Desert of Love , written in 1925 and one of eight of his novels ( total : 15 ) published in the U.S. , reflects the disturbed Mauriac of those days . <P> Makings of a Saint . The plot is routine -a middle-aged doctor and his young son each fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber and moving story of frustrated love . The father , Dr. Courregs , has had a drab life , and he idealizes Maria Cross , the mistress of a wine merchant , imagines her as wronged by the whole world . Son Raymond does no idealizing ; in his grubby way he just wants to go to bed with her . <P> Father &; son both misunderstand Maria . Neither noble nor vicious , she is simply a handsome , rather slothful woman given to daydreaming , a latter-day Emma Bovary without a husband . And Maria misreads the character of father &; son . It never enters her head that so dull a man as the doctor could love her in selfless fashion . She thinks that son Raymond may bring her romance and a fresh start-until he attacks her crudely . She tries , vainly , to commit suicide . Years later , by now a hardened rake , Raymond thinks to himself : " Everything serves as fuel for passion : abstinence sharpens it , repletion strengthens it , virtue keeps it awake . . . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though love has led all three into deserts , all three have their attractiveness . Mauriac lets Dr. Courrges put his strongest case for Maria Cross : " I know that somewhere in her are the makings of a saint . " <P> The Pleasure of Disgust . The Desert of Love was one of the last of Franois Mauriac 's " unregenerate " novels . A year after his cry that " Christianity makes no allowance for the flesh , " he underwent deep conversion . He approvingly quoted Pascal : " What pleasure is greater than being disgusted with pleasure ? " <P> Mauriac has written seven novels since then . In most of them the characters win their way to painful knowledge of themselves , gain glimmerings of the love of God . In most , Mauriac writes with surgical brilliance . But only one ( Vipers ' Tangle-TIME , Nov. 3 , 1947 ) rates with the best work of his unregenerate days : Therese ( 1927 ) and The Desert of Love .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
