STEVENSON SPEAKS " The Eisenhower Crusade , " the New York Times reported on September 23 , is turning into just another political campaign , featuring all the old platform tricks , all the old debating points , all the old slogans and all the old compromises . " That confirms merely that Eisenhower is an ordinary man . For the struggle to win votes corrupts all but the best . Very rarely in American politics the best among us is nominated for the Presidency ; one who scorns tricks and compromises ; who is contracted to the truth . Adlai Stevenson is such a man . He set himself the highest standards in accepting the Democratic nomination ; not once has he departed from them . His speeches , reprinted here in part , will be studied for their content and passed on before November 4 . Long after November they will be treasured as classics in the finest tradition of the United States . 11 . FAREWELL TO ILLINOIS ... This is the fifth year you have listened to me ? an affliction that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Fair have been among the proudest moments of . my life . And now I must go away in quest of an even greater office , and leave behind not only you , my friends , but also my work here in Springfield . It is not easy to say farewell to you or to that work which has been my total life . For all the sweat and tears I have been richly rewarded . What we set out to do when I first talked to you from this platform as a candidate for Governor in August , 1948 , we have done in three and one-half short years . We have eliminated the useless payrollers , put state purchasing on a businesslike basis , enacted a great road-reconstruction program , raised the sights of the Illinois school system , put the state police on a professional non-political basis , taken the Commerce Commission out of politics , put Illinois out in front in the care and treatment of our mental patients , amended the Constitution , extended aid to tuberculosis hospitals , reorganized many aspects of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws to protect our highways , instilled a new sense of public respon sibility among the state 's employees , and I could go on and on And in contrast to most all the other states , we havenot raised taxes for , the general purposes of the state . You will forgive me for hurriedly mentioning these things . I mention them because they , and many others , have meant much to me , and , I think , to our Party . It has been said that perhaps no state in our time has done so much so quickly . . . But the importance of this work is not measured by my personal interest or satisfaction or by yours . It is important because the states are important . We talk about and deplore incessantly the increasing centralization of power over our lives in Washington . But that tidal drift toward the capital will go on and on unless those necessary functions of government which do n't have to be performed in Washington are performed , and properly performed , at the state or local level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get them at home they will turn to Uncle Sam . And every dollar you send to Washington to pay for them will shrink before it gets back home . Because our enemies are big , because business and labor and agriculture are big , because everything is big and organized nowadays , our federal government has inevitably become bigger too . But it should be unencumbered in the discharge of its monstrous major duties by a lot of other jobs it need not do . Because what we-have been doing here in Illinois is important to our citizens , because it is important to our federal system . . . and because much remains to be done , I had wanted to stay here and have a hand in putting this business of good government on a more permanent basis in Illinois . But I have been assigned another task . . . . I am about to leave you on a long journey , and the route , by the way , wo n't be a military or political secret . I intend to cover as much ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't call it a " crusade " to exterminate Republicans . I like a lot of Republicans , even some very new converts to that faith , whatever it is . Indeed there are some Republicans I would trust with anything ? anything , that is , except public office . . . . And before I leave I want to say to you , shamelessly and sentimentally , that my heart will always be here in Illinois . Here five generations of my family have lived and prospered . My roots are deep in our prairies and I owe Illinois a great debt . I have tried my best to discharge that debt honorably and well . But in the process I have only increased my obligations . Four years ago , when you entrusted me with the reins of state government , I found myself committed to tasks and responsibilities which were new to me and staggering in complexity and magnitude . I have learned more than I can say in these short years . It is easy enough to have bright ideas about the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand government until you are confronted with the concrete pressures and the day-to-day operating responsibilities . The essence of republican government is not command . It is consent . The experience and training of four years in Springfield has given me a unique opportunity to explore and , I hope , to master in some measure the means by which competing branches of government , competing groups in the community can be brought to common action for the common good . . . . ? ILLINOIS STATE FAIR , SPRINGFIELD , AUG. 14. ill . THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT On Corruption . . . I should like to lecture to you a bit about the self-education of voters who want to expiate their sins , if any . I mean if there are any such voters , not sins . You are not going to dean up crime and corruption until you clean up American civic and political life . And who is going to do that ? You are , or it is n't going to be done . In Illinois , I 've moved against the slot-machines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to do their duty . The good people applauded , but they went right on playing the slot-machines in their country dubs , lodges and veterans ' posts . . . . But , my friends , if it is against the law in the corner saloon , it is against the law in the country dub , too . What would you think about the banker who complains when you clean up gambling in his town because it reduces bank deposits ? Or the real-estate owner who complains that the tenants do n't pay as much rent when the restaurant or tavern on the ground floor has to stop gambling ? I 've had those experiences and many more besides , including all of the varieties of businessmen who will corrupt a state inspector to disregard some law violation . I can fire the inspector if I can catch him , but I ca n't fire the businessman . I am reminded of what Justice Charles Evans Hughes said during the Harding era scandals : He said this : " Neither political party has a monopoly of virtue or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let no partisan pecksniffs affect a ' holier than thou ' attitude . Guilt is personal and knows no party . " But there is a great danger in this very healthy public discussion of corruption in government which I hope gentlemen like you do not overlook . The problem of government is the problem of recruiting first-rate personnel .. . just as it is the major problem in your business . We do not lose faith in the banking system because a few bankers turn out to be embezzlers . When you realize that American private business is swindled out of more than a billion dollars each year by its employees from clerks to executives , it is not too remarkable , however deplorable that government should occasionally be swindled . For the information of the public and the morale of the multitude of decent , faithful men and women on whom government depends it is just as important to recognize and support the good as it is to root out and punish the bad . It bodes no good for the public service where recruitment is none too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , when honest , conscientious public servants quit because they do n't care to be abused any longer . I 'm frank to say I get a little confused about corruption in politics . We tend to think of it as something so simple , in the simple , unsophisticated terms of graft ? of cash on the barrelhead . But its forms are many , and Ithink of another which we witness every day , and to which I have become acutely sensitive in my brief experience in public service . Perhaps the proper description is not " corrupt , " but " expedient " for the legislator , be he in Sacramento , in Springfield , Ill. , or in Washington , D. C. , who will vote for all kinds of special-interest bills to catch or to hold some votes while he prates piously about ' economy , and indignantly about waste . Call that what you will , condone it as you please , even profit from it as you do now and then , its cost to you is infinitely greater than all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the logrolling , the lobbying for laws or their repeal to serve the interest of some group at the public expense ? To catch some votes , or for fear of losing some , many things are done which seem to me hard to distinguish from outright bribery . Yet , we condone the one and condemn the other . I have seen many legislators vote for every appropriation during a legislative session , and against every tax , and babble about economy and fiscal responsibility at the very same time , and so have you . And , what 's more , they will be elected over and over again . In the last session of my legislature in Illinois I presented a very tight budget that called for no general purpose taxes ? tax increases ? in spite of all the cost increases in the previous two years . And , I called upon the legislature not to add to that budget without subtracting from it in order to keep it in balance . What do you think they did ? They subtracted $300,000 and added $50 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was an overwhelmingly Republican legislature in both houses . The Republican leader , in that session , sponsored and passed a bill to increase all old-age pension allotments 10 percent automatically , although we have a system of automatic adjustments in accordance with living costs . The cost of that measure we estimated at roughly 14 million , but he made no effort whatever to provide any of the money with which to pay for it . I noted in my veto message that they had omitted from the bill the dependent children and the recipients of general relief ? I suppose because they were not organized politically . . . . Last year I vetoed five of the nine bills passed by the Illinois State Department of the American Legion . I vetoed special-interest bills of all kinds calling for more than $40 million of appropriation . And , I was warned in every case that I would lose the votes of the groups affected . Well , my friends , I did n't believe it then . I do n't believe it now , although if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of the year , I should be glad to have lunch with you again ? and eat crow. ? Los ANGELES , CALIF. , SEPT. 11 . Government ? any government ? is not an end in itself . It exists to serve certain human purposes . These purposes should be enlarged only with caution . Indeed , the effort should be always to leave as wide a range of activity as , possible in private hands and to keep public intervention as far down the scale and as close as can be to the people governed . What ought to be done by government for the public welfare should be done . There should be no wistful dragging of the feet or turning backward to a dead irrelevant past . Government should be competent . Its personnel must not be under the heavy hand of purely political selectito or influence . It must not be afraid of raising and spendingmoney for worthy purposes , but it must detest and fear waste and dishonesty as ever-present threats to the whole moral basis of government by the consent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or misused . Above all , those who hold in their hands the power of government must themselves be independent ? and this kind of independence means the wisdom , the experience and the courage to identify the special interests and pressures at work , to see the public interest steadily , to resist its subordination no matter what the political hazards . Actually , I do n't think the political hazards are very great because the best government is the best politics , t00. - DENVER , COLO. , SEPT. 5. e-.61-0.0-0.491 ? , 91 ? 01 In Government Economy . . I think this is a time for bare-bone economy and the Republican legislators in Illinois can tell you I mean what I say . .. . I think the methods we used in Illinois will work in Washington . I want to give you five concrete rules . I emphasize that they require action , not just words . First , saving money in government requires above everything else , hard-headed , tight-fisted , vigorous leadership ? by men who are passionately concerned with getting the job done at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , civilian leadership is most important in relation to the military , because that is where the great bulk of our tax dollars are spent . . . Rule one , then , is to get strong-minded , economy-minded civilians in top jobs . Rule two is to give them the authority to manage their departments efficiently . This means carrying through the work of government reorganization so ably started by the Hoover Commission . Efficiency in government also requires that we reward people who find ways to save money , and that we promote supervisors on the basis of their ability to get the job done at minimum cost and with the fewest subordinates . I think also we need some improvement in our Civil Service system , to make sure the strong safeguards we need against arbitrary or unfair discharge do not strangle our ability tohold employees to strict standards of efficient performance . The third method for saving money in Washington is to improve the machinery for scrutinizing appropriations , so that the budget presented by the President and the money bills voted by the Congress will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I have suggested that the President be given the item veto ? the power to disapprove individual items in an appropriation bill , without having to veto the entire bill . The President could then wield a sharp scalpel against special interests without bringing the machinery of government to a stop . . . . A fourth step for saving money is to establish more effective means for controlling expenditures after the Congress votes the money . Here , too , the problem is hardest in the Defense Department , where the need for speed in obtaining results must be constantly balanced against the costs of hurrying . My fifth method for reducing federal spending requires action not by the federal government but by states and localities and plain , ordinary citizens . We can do much more to make our smaller units of government strong and vigorous and efficient . In addition , I think it is time for a good deal more self-discipline . . . . Do n't do in Washington what can be done in Indianapolis , and do n't ask Uncle Sam to bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SEPT. 26 . IV . THE FUTURE OF THE SOUTH . . . Here in Richmond . . . I am moved to talk for a few minutes of the past . This is not an idle task . . . . A great philosopher has said that those who ca n't remember the past are condemned to live it again . The South is a good place to take our bearings , because in no part of the country does the past ? i past of great nobility and great tragedy ? more sharply etch the present than in the South . It is a good place to think of the grim problems of war and peace which weigh so heavily on all of us today . For here we can best learn the lessons suggested by the peace of 1865 , made when the great voice of moderation had been stilled . It took the South decades to recover . . .. But however hard it was to bear at the time , we in the more fortunate present can view it with a semblance of charity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Democrats simply because you were Democrats . In its frozen impartiality it also neglected Republican farmers , small businessmen , and working people . Men earned the neglect of the Republican leaders not by their political affiliation , but by being small and poor . . . The Reptiblican leadership did not merely treat the South with arrogant and massive neglect . It did more . It shackled the South , and millions outside the South , through its con- trol of Congress ; its control of money and banking ; its favoritism to powerful interests ; its espousal of high tariffs , high interest rates and unfair freight rates . In the larger sense you became colonials of an empire which , if it was not alien , was at least absentee . Yours was primarily an agricultural economy , depending for cash /income largely on cotton and tobacco . Of these you produced far more than could be consumed at home . You paid exorbitant rates of interest for , mortgage and crop loans . Nobody consulted you about freight rates . You just paid them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not hold them for higher prices . Bitterly they witnessed prices rise only after their crops had gone out of their hands . When you marketed your crops abroad , you sold in free markets for the going price . But when you bought manufactured goods at home , Republican tariffs compelled you to pay through the nose . . . . The Republicans were still at their old game only a little while ago . . . . Over the protest of more than a thousand American economists , they enacted the Smoot-Hawley tariff that raised rates to an all-time high . I need not tell Virginians , or your tobacco-growing and tobacco-processing neigh- bors , what that did to tobacco exports . Nor need I remind Southern cotton growers and cotton manufacturers how they were harmed ; or say that this tariff was a turning point in precipitating the worldwide depression of the 1930s . But I am not going to talk about the depression when the average yearly income of the families of one Southern state was $200 . I have said ? and I repeat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The fact of the matter is , I do n't know who I am running against , but I strongly suspect it is Senator Taft after all . But I most certainly am running against the unchanging Ind apparently unchangeable attitude of the Republican leadrship . Presidents come and go . But attitudes remain . For L political party , as a man , is the sum total of its inheritance , ! nvironment , experience and attitudes . Thus , for example , when the depression was coming on , he Secretary of the Treasury was Andrew Mellon . What vas his formula for dealing with the depression ? How did me propose to act when the magnificent promise of Amerian life seemed at a shabby and ignominious end ? Mr. ioover , in his recently published memoirs , tells us . It was : ' Liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , iquidate real estate . " That is certainly one way to deal with depression ? the graveyard way . But somehow the Amer --  an people were less than enthusiastic about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of life and hope . The Democratic Party of today was born , then , of the sufferings of the people . It is neither all-wise nor all-knowing , for these are not man 's gifts , but God 's . But it is now ? as it always has been ? compassionate , merciful , humane ; no stranger to human needs , and wants and fears . The task of striking off the shackles of the South , begun by Woodrow Wilson , has brought you to your rightful place in the Union , not as a matter of charity , not as a sectional matter , but because a happy , purposeful people in a strong , prosperous country is the democratic goal . Some years ago a famous American critic said that the South was the wasteland of the mind . Yet at that very moment , I am told , so many of your housewives had novels simmering with the soup ? among them Gone With the Wind ? that many husbands had to wait for supper . And men ? in an effort perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Ellen Glasgow ? were writing books and plays , too . So it was that the Nobel prize for literature came to the Mississippian , William Faulkner ; a prize that he accepted in an exalted address , extolling the unconquerable spirit of man . . . . In the course of this resurgence , I hope that it may be possible for us to keep all that was good of the Old South , while embracing all that is good of the New South . . Among the most valuable heritages of the Old South is its political genius , which in many respects was far ahead of its time . Even today , some of the finest products of Southern governmental thought are only beginning to win the general acceptance which they have long deserved . A dassic example , it seems to me , is the Constitution of the Confederacy . Scholars of constitutional law have long recognized it as a sound and most thoughtful document .. It contained some brilliant innovations , including the so-called item veto ? authorizing the President to disapprove individual items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message . This inspiration of the Confederate statesmen has since been incorporated into the constitutions of about three-fourths of our states , including my own state of Illinois . is it too much to hope that the federal government may soon adopt this priceless invention of Southern statesmanship ? I hope not , because it is a most useful tool . It has enabled me to veto more appropriations , involving more money , than any Governor in Illinois history . . . Just as the governmental contributions of the South sometimes were not fully appreciated in the past , so too , I suspect , some of the problems of the South have not been fully understood elsewhere . One of these is the problem of minorities . . One thing that I have learned is that minority tensions are always strongest under conditions of hardship . During the long years of Republican neglect and exploitation , many Southerners ? white and Negro -- -have suffered even hunger , the most degrading of man 's adversities . All the South , in one degree or another , was afflicted with a pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a hundred other ills flowing from the same source of poverty . The once low economic status of the South was productive of another ? and even more melancholy ? phenomenon . Many of the lamentable differences between Southern whites and Negroes , ascribed by insensitive observers to race prejudice , have arisen for other reasons . Here economically depressed whites and economically depressed Negroes often had to fight over already gnawed bones . Then there ensued that most pathetic of struggles : the struggle of the poor against the poor . It is a struggle that can easily become embittered , for hunger has no. heart . But , happily , as the economic status of the South has risen , as the farms flourish and in the towns there are jobs for all at good wages , racial tensions have diminished . In the broad field of minority rights , the Democratic Party has stated its position in its platform ; a position to which I adhere . I should justly earn your contempt if I talked one way in the South and another way elsewhere .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alchemy of election , be converted into an honest President . . . . I should like to say a word about the broader aspects of minority rights . First , I utterly reject the argument that we ought to grant all men their rights just because if we do not we shall give Soviet Russia a propaganda weapon . This concept is itself tainted with Communist wiliness . It insultingly , implie5. . , , , , that were it not for the Commumsts we ' SWUM not ao wriat is right . The answer to this argument is that we must dc right for right 's sake alone . . . . ? Second , I reject as equally contemptible the reckless assertions that the South is a prison in which half the people are prisoners and the other half are wardens . I view with scorn those who hurl charges that the South ? or any group of . Americans ? is wedded to wrong and incapable of right . For this itself is an expression of prejudice compounded with hatred ; a poisonous doctrine for which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . So long as man remains a little lower than the angels , I suppose that human character will never free itself entirely from the blemish of prejudice , religious or racial .. . But I do not attempt to justify the unjustifiable , whether it is anti-Negroism in one place , anti-Semitism in another ? or for that matter , anti-Southernism in many places . And neither can I justify self-righteousness anywhere . Let none of us be smug on this score , for nowhere in the nation have we come to that state of harmonious amity between racial and religious groups to which we aspire . The political abuse of the problem of discrimination in employment , the exploitation of racial aspirations on the one hand and racial prejudice on the other ? all for votes ? is both a dangerous thing and a revolting spectacle in our political life .. It will always be better to reason together than to hurl recriminations at one another. ? maimoND , VA. , SEPT. 21 . V. THE STEVENSON PROGRAM Labor Legislation . .. I suggest five general principles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they represent the public interest . 1 . . Point Number One is that the law must accept labor unions , like employer corporations , as the responsible representatives of their members ' interests . The Taft-Hartley Act assumed that unions could not be trusted to determine whether their members wanted a union shop . After the expenditure of millions of dollars to hold thousands of government-conducted elections ? in 95 percent of which the employees voted for the union shop ? the Congress last year finally repealed this gratuitous insult to the labor unions . But the at still prohibits other forms of union-security arrangements developed over many years , by labor and management together , in such cases as the maritime industry , . the building trades and the printing trades . The Congress arbitrarily said we know better than unions what is good for employees . The result could have been predicted . Today several thousand employers and several million employees are operating , under bootleg agreements in flagrant violation of the statute . Point Number Two is the other side of point Number One . If labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardians of employee interests in the collective-bargaining process , then labor unions must conform to standards of fair conduct and equal protection in the exercise of their stewardship . A few unions , made by law the exclusive representatives of certain groups of employees , abuse that trust by excluding from union membership some who want to work , denying them a vote , denying their seniority rights ? because of the color of their skin or because of restrictive nations about employment security . This is not democracy . Unions which are given powers by government should be open to all on equal terms . . . . Number Three of my suggestions is that a new federal labor law must outlaw unfair bargaining practices by companies or unions .. . . It is only common sense to acknowledge that we must forbid such practices as jurisdictional strikes , and strikes or boycotts attempting to force an employer to deal with one union when another has been certified as the representative of his employees . It is equally dear , however , that the prohibitions ? in the Taft-Hartley Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper along with improper conduct ? even , on occasion , to require union members to act as strike-breakers . These proPoint Number Four is rejection of the labor injunction . We agreed on this once . In 1932 Congress overwhelmingly passed the Norris-LaGuardia Act to prohibit the labor injunction . The vote was 326 to 14 in the House and 75 to five in the Senate . Then , 15 years later , in the Taft-Hartley Act , the labor injunction ? the process of haphazard prejudgment ? was disembalmed . No showing of need was made for it . And that tyrannical power to have men and women ordered back to work in smothered silence has no place in today 's labOr law . . My fifth and last point is that new methods must be found for settling national emergency disputes . We are willing , as a nation , to put up with serious inconveniences when bargaining stalemates result in shutting down production . Collective bargaining is a form of tree competition . And , in Justice Holmes ' phrase , " free competition is worth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , tolerate shutdowns which threaten our national safety , even that of the whole free world . The right to bargain collectively does not include a right to stop the national economy . The Taft-Hartley answer for this problem is the injunction . All that law boils down to is that in national emergency disputes employees shall be ordered to work for another 80 days on the employers ' terms . This remedy has been admnistered now nine times . Far-administere critics have conduded that in only two of these cases did it do the slightest good . In the others it either had no effect at all or actually delayed private settlement . I have no miracle-drug solution for this problem . I am clear , though , that where the government must intervene in these private disputes , its purpose must be not just to stop the strike , but to see that the dispute gets settled . I am dear , too , that the new law must recognize that these emergency cases are always different . It is a proven mistake for Congress to prescribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . What we need is a completely new law ? one that will provide for investigation and reporting to the public on the issues involved , one that will provide for more effective mediation between the parties . Its purpose should be to keep these cases out of the White House , if possible . But Congress should give to the President a choice of procedutes when ' voluntary agreement proves impossible . . . . Such a law would leave the obligation to settle these disputes where it belongs ? with the parties . But it would not strait-jacket this settlement process . It would express the firm voice of a nation which demands a fair and quick settlement , and offers constructive help toward a solution . - DETROIT , MICH. , SEPT. 1 . 091 ? .01 ? 91 149'wg'x Farm Legislation ? A society can be no better than the men and women who compose it . The heart of any farm policy , must therefore be the life of those who work the farms . Our objective , is to make that life full and satisfying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first on the question of farm income . . . . The way we have chosen to maintain farm income is to support farm prices . Our platform lays this out in dear language . Here is , what it says : " We will continue to protect the producers of basic agricultural commodities under the terms of a mandatory price-support program at not less than 90 percent of parity . " There are no ifs , buts or maybes about this . And I think it is a policy that most farmers today understand and believe in . I only wish that everybody understood so well ; One place it was clearly not understood was at the great fracas in the Chicago stockyards , two months ago , where one of the casualties was the farm plank in the Republican platform . As you all know , the Chicago slaughter ended in a ceasefire agreement . According to that agreement ? better known as the Republican platform ? Republican policy is " aimed " ? that is their word ? is " aimed " at parity levels . That phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is n't very clear here in the daylight in Minnesota . There is , and no one should know it better than my distinguished opponent , a vast difference between aiming at a target and hitting it . How good is their aim anyway ? Their sights were a mile off in June of this year when more than half the Republican members of the House voted against the law that extended price support at 90 percent of parity through 1954 . If the Republican candidate says one thing , and the Republican platform says something else , and the Republican members of Congress say still others ? how then can anyone tell what a Republican Administration would do ? What the support program does do is to encourage farmers to grow more food . You can now plant crops fairly secure in the knowledge that prices will still be good at market time . That is one reason why farm production has increased almost 50 percent in the last 20 years . The price-support program is doing a good job for the basic crops ? corn , cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan and storage operations are now in effect . . . For perishable products , however , such as hogs , dairy products , fruits and vegetables , these loan and storage operations do not work well . Yet these products provide about three-fourths of all the income received . by farmers . Our first line of defense for the producers of perishables is , of course , a. strong economic policy that will insure , so far as it is humanly possible to do so , high employment and purchasing power . But behind this there should be protection against unreasonably low prices for those producers of perishables who need it . Price policy is the heart of the farm program but it is not the whole of it . Farming is a way of using our great inheritance of water and land ; and it is a way of life .. . Farm ownership and the family farm are the founilation on which our whole agricultural system is built . From 1880 to 1932 we lost ground on farm ownership . In these years ? years , incidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented that slogan , " It 's time for a change " ? the proportion of farm owners declined , until by 1932 , 43 percent of all farmers ? two out of every five ? were either tenants or sharecroppers . That trend has now , been reversed ; three-fourths of our farmers now own their farms . We have recovered , in 20 years , the ground lost in the previous 50 . ? Things are not yet as they should be . Many young , vigorous and ambitious men would like to become owners of farms . What is more serious , many farmers can not , with their existing land and equipment , make a decent living from the soil . There is a notion abroad that all farmers are now prosperous . In 1950 , more than one million farmers had net incomes from all sources including outside employment of less than $1,000 . How can a farmer rear , clothe and educate a family on that ? Who can say that such a family shares in the American abundance ? . . . Research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of rural poverty . No one should promise miracles here ; but there must be ways to help the industrious small farmer who wants to help himself . That kind of American is a good risk . And no one knows it better than my running mate , Sen. John Sparkman , who has led the battle for them , and who was himself one of 11 children of an impoverished tenant farmer . .

This is our goal . It requires far more than action by government . Laws are never as effective as habits .

This is a job for the East , the North and the West , as well as for the South . I know . I have been the Governor of a great Northern state . I have had to stop outrages committed against peaceful and law-abiding minorities .

I am proud to say that the Democrats in our legislature voted almost solidly for the bill . But I must report in simple truth that the bill was lost in Springfield , Ill. , because of virtually solid opposition from the party which claims descent from Abraham Lincoln . All the same , gratifying progress has been made , in Illinois toward the elimination of job discrimination by the initiative of business itself .

Of course there is a problem in the South . In many respects the-problem is more serious there than elsewhere . But just as it is chastening to realize our own failures and shortcomings in the North , so it is both just and hopeful to recognize and admit the great progress in the South . Things are taking place in the South today that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago . In the last two years alone 10 state universities have admitted Negro students for the first time to their graduate and professional schools . And that is only one of many examples that ' could be cited of the wonders that are working.in the South . . . . I have often affirmed my belief in strong state and local administration . I believe . . . that affirmative state govern-mint can rise to meet many pressing social problems and can thereby arrest the trend toward over-centralized federal power . In Illinois I have worked to make the state government responsive to the needs of the people so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wphihgton for help . . . . In the case of equal opportunity for employment , I believe that it is not alone the duty but the enlightened interest of each state to develop its own positive employment-practices program ? a program adapted to local conditions , emphasizing education and conciliation , and providing for enforcement . This is the kind of law I proposed in Illinois . . . . But our platform favors federal legislation particularly , I assume , when states fail to act and inequalities of treatment persist . The problem , of course , is - what kind of legislation . Personally I have been very much impressed by a bill reported favorably by the Senate Labor Committee . Only three members opposed it , one of whom was Sen. Richard Nixon . . . . It encourages the Federal Commission to stay out of any state with an effective commission ; by the same token , however , it encourages the states to act because , if they do not , the national government has the power to do so . The bill requires , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to proceed by very careful deliberation and full and fair hearings . Enforcement would be by order of a court , not an administrative body . You know as well as I do that we have readied a sort of legislative stalemate in this field in the Congress . In so far as this is due to real , legitimate objections to the substance of the legislation , I think this Senate bill goes a very long way toward meeting such objections . It may be that ' it can be improved still further , especially in the direction of giving the states a reasonable time in which to act : In so far as the present stalemate is due to misuse of the processes of deliberation and debate in Congress , the problem is somewhat different . I believe firmly in the principle stated in our platform the principle that majority rule shall prevail ; after reasonable debate , in both houses of our Congress . And , from my ex-periences with the practical workings of representative government , I would interpret " reasonable " very liberally because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the changes that should be made in the present rules of Congress , is of course , a problem for the Congress itself , for each House , under our Constitution , makes its own rules for doing business . As President I could not make the decision , but I could and would use whatever influence I may have to encourage the Congress to shake off its shackles.17 I would urge in these fields and in many others that affect national . policy , that all of us resolve to take a , fresh look . There has been too much freezing of positions , too much emotion , too many dogmatic statements of irrevocable attitudes . We are dealing with human situations , with human emotions , with human intelligence ; our purpose must be to reason together for the common betterment of us all ; our interest must be , not in controversy , but in results . . ?

The bomb is but one part of ' a general system . It can not be a substitute for such a general system , . Until it is subjected to safe international control , we have no choice but to insure our atomic superiority . . . . Because our government knew the futility of the arms race , it made its great decision to seek an international system for the control of atomic power . . . . Unfortunately , as we all know , the Soviet Union has thus far refused to join in a workable system . . . so the negotiations have long been deadlocked , and , in irritation and disgust , some of us have rebelled against the whole idea of negotiation itself . Some of us have even felt that our possession of the bomb makes negotiation unnecessary ; and if our Allies are alarmedby our uncompromising attitude , so much ' the worse for them . When we have the bomb as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other . Such ideas are folly . If we started throwing our atomic weight around the world , no stockpile of bombs could remotely make up for all the friends we would lose . And the irony is that it is our Allies which make our atomic strength effective . We built the bomb with the help and co-operation of foreign scientists . Our atomic production program today depends on foreign supplies of uranium . Our air , power would be gravely crippled without foreign bases . Even in terms of the bomb itself , going it alone would be a short cut to national disaster . . . . We must strive constantly to break the deadlock in our atomic discussions . But we can never yield on the objective of securing a fool-proof system of international inspection and control . And we will never confuse negotiation with appeasement. ?

And it is against Democrats , so far as I can see , not after a sober and considered review of the alternatives , but automatically , as dogs are against cats .

But I am in favor of a two-party system in our press , to . And Iam , frankly , considerably concerned when I see the extent to which we are developing a one-party press in a two-party country . I earnestly wish that the newspapers so highly agitated over the hvo-party system , in politics would contemplate the very real dangers of the ' one-party system in the press . I do n't say this because of any concern over the coming election . My party has done all right in recent elections in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will do all right this year too . But , as an ex-newspaper man and a citizen , I am gravely concerned about the implications- of this one-party system for our Americafi press and our free sdciety . A free society means a society based on free competition and there is no more important competition than in ideas , competition in opinion . This form of competition is essential to the preservation of a green press . Indeed , I think the press should set an example to the nation in increasing opposition to uniformity . . . . We need to work harder for the time when all editors will honor their profession , when all publishers will have a sense of responsibility equal to their power and thus regain their power , if I may put it that way .

Across the continent of Asia more than a billion of the world 's peoples are churning in one of history 's greatest upheavals . The causes behind that upheaval are many and varied . But there is nothing complicated about what the people want . They want a decent living ? and they want freedom . The word used most frequently by Asians to describe their aspirations is nationalism . Nationalism to Asians means a chance to stand on their own feet , a chance to govern themselves , a chance to develop their resources for their own welfare , and a chance to prove that the color of their skin has nothing to do with their right to walk with self-respect among their fellowmen in the world . It means the end of a legalized inferiority . It means pride , spirit , faith . This type of nationalism is not inconsistent with doser co-operation among nations nor with the need for an enforceable peace . . . . The strategy of Communism in Asia is to pose as the champion ? the only champion ? of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the forces behind Asia 's vast upheaval . It is attempting to give direction to those forces , it seeks to impose its own label on the multiple revolutions going on in Asia today by identifying itself with the deeply felt needs and hopes of the Asian peoples . It constantly proclaims its sympathy for the goals of national liberation and independence . It promises human and social equality . It offers two bowls of rice a day where now there is one or none . It , offers land to those who work the land , There is an important difference between Communism as we view it and Communism as some of the Asian people view it . When we think of Communism we think of what we are going to lose . When many of the Asian peoples think of Communism they think of what they are going to gain ? especially if they believe they have nothing to lose . It is important that we know these things and think about them , for we shall never be able to cope with Communism unless we understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incite the workers to revolution in Western Europe . They have failed to turn the Western Allies one against the other . But the Communists may well believe that in the aspirations and grievances of the East they now have the key to world power . In Korea we took a long step toward building a security . system in Asia . As an American I am proud that we have the courage to resist that ruthless , cynical aggression ; and I am equally proud that we have had the fortitude to refuse to risk extension of that war despite extreme Communist provocations and reckless Republican criticisms . Whatever unscrupulous politicians may say to exploit grief , tragedy and discontent for votes , history will never record that Korea was a " useless " war , unless today 's heroism is watered with tomorrow 's cowardice . This defensive effort in Korea and elsewhere in Asia is building a shield behind which we have the- opportunity to assist in the other great task ? the task of development . Listening . to the debate over China this past year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressmen whose vocal chords were most active in the cause of isolation and against foreign entanglements were the same ones who were now talking as if they had wanted us to take part in a civil war in China . The time , to stop a revolution is at the beginning , not the end . But I do n't recall any pleas from these critics for help for Sun Yat-sen and Chinese democracy back in the twenties . Nor did I hear them demanding intervention by the US in the mid-thirties when civil war with the Communists broke out . Indeed it was not until quite recently , when the Chinese wars were about over , that there was even an audible whisper that we help fight in hindsight war , that we should have given more help , to China than we did . It would seem to me that the Republican critics could better demonstrate the good faith of their concern for Asia by doing something about India today rather than talking about China yesterday . Tearful and interminable post mortems about China will save no souls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Africa . India is not caught up in civil strife . It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it : help in the ways of peace and social progress . India has to grow more food . It has to restore its land . It needs new resources of power . In short , it needs a Democratic helping hand in the development programs it has already charted . The same is true in many other countries . It is help of this kind that we can provide by sending agricultural experts , engineers and other trained people to these countries , and through programs of assistance to economic development . By working with , each country to expand the production of goods which are needed by other countries in the region , a self-generating and self-financing cycle of trade and development can be initiated , which will reduce and can eventually eliminate the need for . American aid . At the same time , we can enlarge our export markets , and develop new sources of the products we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can help to guide this economic , development in ways which will give powerful support to democratic political institutions . These programs are in accordance with our best traditions . ? . . . America will never seek to dominate their political and economic development . We will not try to make their societies over in the image of our own . On the contrary , we respect the integrity of their institutions and the rich values of their cultures . . . These programs are primarily concerned with the material needs and wants of individual men and women . Yet we do not make the mistake of believing that the answer to Com munist materialism is a different brand of materialism . The answer to Communism is , in the old-fashioned phrase , good works ? inspired by love and dedicated to the whole man . The answer to the inhumanity of Communism is humane respect for the individual and Asians desire not only to rise from wretchedness of the body but from abasement of the spirit . In other words , we must strive for a harmony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed with the rest of the world . The means of our co-operation are primarily material . If we believe the Communist threat to Asia is dangerous to us , then it is , in our own self-interest . to help them defend and develop , adjusting our policies to the constantly changing circumstances in a world of accelerating change . But we must not , in our necessary concern for the urgent tasks of defense and development , permit the means to obscure the end . That end is the widening and deepening of freedom and of respect for the dignity and worth of man. ? sAN FRANCISCO , CALIF. , SEPT. 9. 4.9*.4x49 . On Communism . . . What is the nature of the threat which Communism brings to the free world ? It is the threat of an all-powerful state dedicated to the extinction of individual dignity and individual freedom . . . . Communism is the death of the soul . It is the organization of total conformity ? in short , tyranny ? and it is cornmitted to making tyranny universal . Now , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . How do we counter this external threat of Communism . by increasing the strength and the unity of the free world .. But the building of free world strength does more than just restrain Soviet ' aggression . Its effect is to make the free world itself ? both because of its freedom and because of its strength ? a potent counter-attraction to Soviet power . And the emergence of this world , united , powerful , friendly and free , will exert an over-increasing influence , on the captive states within the Soviet Empire . . . . But we would err , certainly , if we regarded Communism as merely an external threat . Communism is a great international conspiracy and the United States has been for years a major target of that conspiracy . Communist agents have sought to steal our scientific and military secrets , to mislead and corrupt our young men and women , to infiltrate positions of power in our schools and colleges , in business firms and in labor unions and in the government itself .

There is only one way for a free society to deal with this internal threat , and that is through the ' processes of justice . ? ALBUQUERQUE , N. MEX. , SEPT. 12 . Foreign Policy . One lesson which I had , hoped that most of us learned from the past is an understanding of what the present threat to our freedom really is . I thought that my distinguished opponent , of all Americans , would agree that this . threat is the threat of World Communism . It is surely fundamental to the making of wise policies to decide whether the threat to the US is internal or external . Either the threat to our security is world Communism or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences of degree which , according to Senator Taft 's statement following the Peace Conference on Morningside Heights , are all that separate him from the General on , foreign-policy matters . It is not a question of degree whether we measure our defense by an arbitrary budget or measure our budget by the needs of survival . If we should follow out this theory that the threat is internal , we would undertake the delibeiate and systematic weakening of ourselves and our allies . And such a policy of national weakness and international weakness can lead to a single result : That is , to invite the expansion of Soviet power . . . My opponents say the threat to our ? liberty comes from within . I say that the threat comes from without ? and I offer the , fate of the enslaved peoples of the world as my evidence . My opponents say America can not afford to be strong . I say that America can not afford to be weak . I promise no easy solutions , no relief from burdens and anxieties , for to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to attack the foundations of our greatness . I can offer something infinitely better : An opportunity to work and sacrifice that freedom may flourish .

FAITH IN THE FREE MIND . . . The Wisconsin idea ? the faith in the free mind and in the application of reason to government ? was one of the hopeful ideas of our century . Today we find that idea everywhere under attack . Throughout the world , the whole conception of the free intellectual community is menaced by those who fear freedom more than they love it . As darkness falls upon this earth , the area of freedom shrinks . New philosophies arise ? new theories of the state ? which recoil from freedom , detest it , exterminate it , and seek to found new societies upon its extermination . In the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first casualty of the Communist regime is the free mind , and , once the free mind disappears , all else must follow . Thus in Soviet Russia today the last trace of freedom has been extinguished . Not only history and eco-. nomics and politics but science and art and music are enslaved by the regime . The unorthodox experiment , the unacceptable melody , the extreme painting , become evidence of disloyalty . Unorthodoxy is treason to the state . This process reaches its grim dimax , of course , in the Soviet courts . Here injustice , wearing the gowns of justice , stages the last act of the cruel joke . Men are accused at random of infamous and fantastic charges ; they are transformed into enemy agents , spies , traitors ; documents are misrepresented and falsified ; past associations are uncovered and distorted , past remarks torn from context ; guilt comes in the end , not just by association , but by accusation . And triumphant above all rises the figure of the great accuser . whose word can brand men 's lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and spread through all society the reign of suspicion and terror . Because we believe in the free mind , we are opposing Communism with all our will . We are opposing it abroad , where its relentless pressure seeks further to narrow the it i area of freedom . We are opposing t at home , where its agents and its dupes seek to undermine our society and strangle our freedom in its own paradoxes . As President , I would use all the power of the federal government to expose and identify Communist activity , to remove Communists and their tools from places of position and prestige in our society and to protect our free institutions from Communist espionage , sabotage and subversion . It is because the Democratic Party believes in fighting Communism that this administration has established a loyalty system in our federal government , has indicted and convicted the Communist leaders and spies and has exposed Communist influence and activity in our national life . But , because we believe in the free mind , we are also fighting those who , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . The liberties of expression and conscience are the basic liberties of American society . They are sustained by our whole structure of law and justice . That structure has sufficed for us in the great crises of our past . I see nothing in the future which requires us to throw it overboard now . I would call to your mind the words of a great Republican patriot , ' Theodore Roosevelt : " No greater harm can be done to the body politic , " Theodore Roosevelt said , " than by those men who , through reckless and indiscriminate accusation of good men and bad men , honest men and dishonest men alike , finally so hopelessly puzzle the public that they do not believe that any man in public life is entirely straight ; while , on the other hand , they lose all indignation against the man who really is crooked .

" Way back the- re ! - i Disturbing things have taken place in our own land . The pillorying of the innocent has caused the wise to stammer and the timid to retreat . I would shudder for this country if I thought that we , too , must surrender to the sinister figure , of the inquisition , of the great accuser . I hope that the time will never come in America when charges are taken as thee equivalent of facts , when suspicions are confused with certainties , and when the voice of the accuser stills every other voice in the land . So long as America is populated by Americans , this can never be the case . We shall defend the free mind and the free spirit , as we always have in the past . We love and cherish the light of freedom . We will not be ' stampeded into the dark night of tyranny . With faith in our great heritage of individual freedom , we . can ? and will ? keep America the land of the free . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to redefine our own values . It has made us restate the ideal of freedom for the complex industrial society of the twentieth century . And the process of redefinition and restatement ? fOr most of us , anyway ? has only strengthened our faith in the durability of free society . . . . We are hearing a lot today about American division , Weakness , hesitation , fear . Some , perhaps , find it politically profitable to cultivate the vineyards of anxiety . I would warn them lest they reap the grapes of wrath . I believe21 that our people have begun to tire of hearing how weak they are , how feeble is their faith , how urgent it is to limit and surrender their freedom . I would say : Enough of this weakness and coWardice . The experience of the past two decades has forged a new American will . We are no longer that fat and complacent nation which fell into the pit of depression and lay for a season in bewildered impotence . We have conquered fear . We have climbed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves a new patience , a new self-discipline , and a new serenity in the face of crisis . We have be- - gun to build a new nation for ourselves and our children . .. , I have said elsewhere in the campaign that this election is a struggle between accusation and fear , and confidence and faith . I say to you today that we need not dwell in fear . We have shown in these 20 years the mighty things we are capable of ? if we but maintain faith in ourselves , in our heritage of liberty , and in the invincibility of free men . Fear begets fear , as faith begets faith . My party knows where it has been and where it is going . The opposition does n't like the road we have traversed and is sharply divided about the road ahead . The future stretches ahead , untrodden and uncharted ? but ours to take and to master . The future is mostly yours and the roads yours to choose . MADISON , WIS. , OCT. 7. tGrat0-$49a . .

The world has been at war ' almost - continuously now for 40 years . The intervals between the wars grow shorter . The wars increase in dimensions and in destructiveness .

Today there is less communication between the great groups of man than there was , in the roadless world of a thousand years ago . We can no more communicate with half of mankind than we can raise the dead .

Unprecedented times demand of us unprecedented behavior . The task that confronts us will try our soul , it will exact a high price in discipline of mind and of austerity of spirit .
