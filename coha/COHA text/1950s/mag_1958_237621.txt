Before the saddened eyes of the loyal citizens of Milwaukee and several million television viewers , the Braves fell apart . <P> Milwaukee fans could spot the man and the moment when they began to have that sinking feeling . Man and moment came together in the fifth game , with the Braves basking in the 3-1 series lead . Switch-Hitter Red Schoendienst lined a drive toward left . Elston Howard took off with the crack of the bat , ran straight into the murderous glare that makes left field at Yankee Stadium the toughest sun field in the major leagues . Diving to his knees , Howard sprawled forward , stuck out his gloved hand , and came up with the ball that had looked like a sure base hit . Howard scrambled to his feet , gunned a strike to first base to double a surprised Bill Bruton , who had confidently rounded second before he recognized his mistake . <P> The Yankees , who had played like bush-ers in the first four games , came to life . In their half of the sixth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never beaten them three times running in the 1957 series , piled up six runs in their first sustained scoring outburst of the series . Bullet Bob Turley , blasted out in the first inning at Milwaukee when he pushed his fast ball up to the plate too enticingly , produced a suddenly dipsy curve to baffle the Braves with a scrawny five hits and breeze to a 7-0 victory . <P> Back in Milwaukee , the gallant Warren Spahn , who had beaten the Yankees twice , tried to do it again after only two days ' rest . For a while it looked as if he could bring it off . In the second inning Milwaukee led 2-1 , and loaded the bases . But Howard was there again , this time to catch Johnny Logan 's short fly , make a perfect peg home to throw out lumbering Andy Pafko by 15 ft . In the tenth inning the ubiquitous Howard singled and scored what proved to be the winning run as the Yankees licked Spahn 4-3 . <P> In the last game the Braves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torre messed up two routine infield taps that gave the Yankees a pair of unearned runs in the early going . Catcher Del Crandall failed twice at bat with the bases loaded . It hardly mattered that he struck a solo homer to tie the game in the sixth ; pesky Elston Howard promptly untied it with an eighth-inning single , and the Yankees were home , 6-2 . <P> Not since 1925 , when Pittsburgh did it to Washington , had a team come off the floor to win after losing three of the first four series games . Post-mortem accolades went to the Yankees ' burly Turley , who had a hand in every one of the last three-in-a-row victories-winning one singlehanded , getting the last out in another , saving the final game with a spectacular 6 innings of two-hit relief pitching . Hard-bitten Rightfielder Hank Bauer led the Yankees at bat with a .323 average and four home runs . But the man Milwaukee will remember most vividly was a catcher-outfielder , Elston Gene Howard .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
