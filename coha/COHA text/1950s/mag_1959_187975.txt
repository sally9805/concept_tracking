In the college town of Oberlin , Ohio ( 1950 pop . 7,062 ) , neighbors knew Alice Cowles Little as a dear old maiden lady with a sharp memory and a penchant for collecting . Her memory , even after more than half a century , still warmly cradled the color and sound of the faraway Pacific islands that she visited as a young missionary for the Congregational Church . Her collections-sea shells , bits of pressed vegetation , samples of earth and coral-cluttered her antebellum house on Oberlin 's East College Street , where she lived quietly the last 50 years . <P> But meticulous Alice Little , it turned out , had brought home more than sea shells and memories . Early in World War II , U.S. Naval Intelligence heard that she had lived in the west central Pacific , interviewed her . To the Navy 's delight , Miss Little rooted out other items in her collections-maps , charts and the journals she carefully kept for the board of missions on trips around her islands aboard the sailing vessel Morning Star . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these : how the tides swept in and the heights of shoreline cliffs , how deep the channels were and how wide the sandy beaches , where in the crystal water lay hidden coral reefs and where lay clear passage at low tide . The Navy borrowed books , charts , fauna and sand . Alice Little settled back to her quiet spinster existence . <P> Last week Alice Cowles Little died at 93 . And in the midst of the sea shells and pressed plants and a vast collection of postage stamps , friends found a well-creased , patently cherished letter from Naval Intelligence thanking the little old lady from Oberlin for her role in the successful wartime invasions of the islands Tarawa , Makin and Kwajalein.
