txt President Eisenhower 's physicians , after examining him today , Dr. White reports on President 's condition . I said he appears physically fit to run for a second term . The six man team of physicians , including Dr. Paul Du White , Boston heart specialist , reported that the President 's recovery from his Sept. 24 heart attack has gone without a hitch . They said he has carried on the " full duties " of his office the last five weeks " without any difficulty . " " The President should be able to carry on an active life satisfactorily for another 5 to 10 years , " Dr. White told a press conference if ter the three hour medical consultation . Approved by Snyder Under questioning , Dr. White said the term " active life " included the Presidency . Dr. White 's findings were concurred in by the other five physicians , including Dr. Howard M. Snyder , the President 's personal physician . The physicians said they gave the same report to the President that they were making to reporters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Eisenhower that he seek reelection . " The choice is his , not ours , " Dr. White said . The physician added that he would vote for the President , if he runs again . Mr. Eisenhower , w h o flies south tomorrow for a week to 10 day vacation in Thomasville , Ga. , said last week that he expects to announce his decision on whether to run again by March 1 . This would be soon after his return from Georgia . Boost for Admirers The physicians ' report gave a new shot in the arm to Eisenhower admirers who have been urging him to seek reelection if his health permits . The President has said , however , that in making his decision he probably will rely more on his own feelings than on reports from his physicians . Dr. White was asked how the President reacted to today 's report from his physicians : " He seemed pleased , " White replied . The six physicians based their findings on the results of tests the President took Saturday at Walter Reed army hospital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was his first full medical checkup since Dec. 17 . They met with more than 100 reporters , after they had seen the President , in the conference room across from the White House , where Mr. Eisenhower holds his weekly press conferences . James C. Hagerty , White House press secretary . prefaced the meeting by telling reporters that " these gentlemen are doctors , not politicians . They are here to report medically and only that . " In spite of this injunction , Dr. White and Dr. Snyder , who served as spokesmen , showed almost no hesitancy in voicing the opinion that Mr. Eisenhower is medically able to serve another term . Dr. White shied away , however , from giving an opinion on whether campaigning for election , as distinguished from the regular duties of President , might unduly tak Mr. Eisenhower . Calls Question Political Asked whether " medical limits " on campaigning were indicated , White turned the question aside as " political . " He added that the President probably would discuss this matter when he announces his decision on whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decides to run he will not barnstorm " the country for votes . Dr. White , one of the world 's foremost heart specialists , said he does not believe that " strain and stress " such as a President is under are themselves a cause of heart attacks , but he said they are something that must be weighed in any medical diagnosis . Dr. Snyder , at the outset of today 's conference , read a statement in behalf of the six physicians reporting that Mr. Eisenhower 's health " continues to be satisfactory . " " No Sign of Failure " Dr. Snyder said all medical findings showed a " good recovery " by the 65 year old President from his attack of coronary thrombosis . He added that there is " no sign of heart failure or the beginning of heart *fature . " " There ate no symptoms , " the statement said , " indicating either weakness of the heart muscle or insufficient coronary reserve ; that is , lack of blood supply to the contracting heart muscle . " The President 's heart scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " well healed " and X-rays of Mr. Eisenhower 's heart going back 10 years show no enlargement of that organ , the statement said . The President 's temperature , pulse , blood count , and blood clotting rate were found to be within normal range . His circulation was described as excellent . His weight has remained constant at 172 pounds , where the doctors want it , on an average diet of 1,800 calories a day . The President continues to take an anti-clotting drug regularly , but otherwise needs resumption of full duties of his office " since the first of - the year . " As to the future . " Dr. White continued , " after weighing all available evidence . including our own experience , and fully aware of the hazards and uncertainties that lie ahead , we believe that medically the chances are that the President should be able to carry on an active life satisfactorily for another 5 to 10 years . But the choice is his , not ours . " White and Snyder said the President still is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his activities . " Very Good Health " Dr. Snyder was asked whether Mr. Eisenhower is in as good health now as he was before the heart attack . Snyder replied that the President is " in very good health . " He added , however , that he had thought his patient was in better physical condition just before he was stricken than at any time in 10 years . " And yet he had a cardiac accident , " Snyder said . " We do n't know that he wo n't have another cardiac accident . We do n't know that I wo n't have one tomorrow , altho I am feeling pretty fit today . And so it goes . " Today 's examining physicians , besides White and Snyder , were Col. Thomas W. Mattingly , chief heart specialist at Walter Reed ; Cbl . Byron E. Pollock , chief of heart services at Fitzsimons army hospital in Denver where the President was confined after he was stricken ; Maj. Gen. Leonard D. Heaton , commandant at Walter Reed , and Maj.
