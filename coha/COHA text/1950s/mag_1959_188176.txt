The editor of the brand-new Stockholm daily newspaper asked his boss just one question as the first day 's issues hit the streets in 1944 : " How long before I have to start making money ? " Said volatile Tor Bonnier , head of Sweden 's biggest publishing house ( books , magazines , the Stockholm morning Dagens Nyheter ) : " It 's a question of how long my nerves hold out . " Replied Editor Carl-Adam Nycop : " In that case , I 'll have to hurry . " <P> Editor Nycop hurried . Within 18 months the evening tabloid Expressen rocketed into the black , and it has since come to soothe Publisher Bonnier 's nerves as the largest paper in all Scandinavia ( circ. 370,000 ) . Expressen is hale because it is hearty . Its formula : a smorgasbord of culture and sensationalism enlivened by flashy picture play and bellowing headlines . Last week , Expressen outdid itself , produced 600,000 copies of a 64-page issue , biggest in Scandinavian history . <P> Spunk &; Sparkle . Expressen was an extravert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a paper that would back the Allies ( only some 20% of Sweden 's editors were pro-German at the time ) , needed an editor with enough spunk and sparkle to put Expressen apart from the rest of the Swedish press , which was generally cast in the sobersided Scandinavian tradition . <P> On that basis , Bonnier 's choice for editor was obvious . Well-born Carl-Adam Nycop , now 49 , had been headed for a stuffy life of upper-class responsibility when his fellow junior aristocrats at Sweden 's swank Lundsberg boarding school began to mock him as a runt ( he is now 5 ft. 7 in . ) . Nycop was so embittered by the attacks that he rebelled against his convention-bound background , to become a news-and-be-damned reporter . In 1938 he was tapped by Bonnier to start the LiFE-like picture weekly Ssee , soon showed an executive 's firm hand for organization , an editor 's sure touch for pictures and pithy sentences . <P> Beat of the Year . Then came Expressen . Nycop hired Sweden 's best young newsmen ( one impoverished reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave them lessons in writing simple Swedish ( which is not at all simple ) . He kept his sharp eye out for the big news beat , and on May 7 , 1945 he found the biggest of the year-the surrender of Germany , broadcast by Grand Admiral Doenitz and picked up by Expressen 's radio monitors . Nycop had been hopefully holding his presses for the news , now says that his Expressen became the world 's first paper to carry the story , by rolling out an edition just 22 minutes after the announcement . <P> Swedes had never seen the like of Nycop 's Expressen . Circulation climbed as Nycop championed the underdog ( e.g. , juvenile delinquents ) , riled Sweden 's neutralist government by urging membership in NATO , gibed at the institution of monarchy . " The monarchy , " says Nycop , " is undemocratic . I 'm all for King Gustaf . He 's a remarkably good executive . But the next one could be an idiot . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
