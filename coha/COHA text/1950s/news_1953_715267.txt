txt John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , today disclosed a goal of achieving a balance with the Soviet Union in the Far East by disengaging United States and French ground forces and steeping up military aid to native troops fighting the land wars in Korea and Indo-China . In his discussion of possible future moves in the Korean and IndoChinese wars , the Secretary emphasized that the Soviet Union held a marked advantage in the Far East because it was able to tie down substantial United States forces in Korea and French forces in Indo-China . This and other clues to foreign policy , as reshaped under the Eisenhower Administration , were set forth by Mr. Dulles this afternoon at his first news conference since he became Secretary of State . Gradual Withdrawal Is Aim Gradual withdrawal of all but indigenous ground troops  --  Republic of Korea troops in . Korea slid native troops of the Associated States of Indo-China would , in the belief ' of Mr. Dulles , help redress the imbalance with the Soviet Union  --  wrse own forces have not been employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration policy of relying *Ire heavily on Asian forces to fight Asians applies to IndoChina , The Associated Press reported . The United States would be glad to make available to the French the American experience in building up the South Korean forces , he commented when asked whether increased American aid was planned for IndoChina . In Paris , it was said France had asked the United States and Britain to exchange military information on wars against the Communists in the Far East . In Saigon , it was said Marshal Juin 's trip to Indo-China and Korea was linked with the plan . All Possible Ways Studied The Secretary also revealed that the State Department was examining closely all possible ways , in. eluding a naval blockade , to " interrupt or minimize " the flow of strategic goods to Communist China . Such a study has been going on " pretty continuously " in the department ever since the Communist Chinese intervention in the ' Korean war , he said , but is now " under perhaps more intensive scrutiny . " Mr. Dulles at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower and the Congress that would repudiate certain so-called " secret " agreements with the Soviet Union . Such a declaration , the Secretary said , would have two " primary purposes . " The first would be to " register dramatically what we believe to be // the many breaches by the Soviet Union of the wartime understandings , " and the second would be to " register equally dramatically the desire and hope of the American people that the captive people shall be liberated , " he declared . The Secretary indicated that the joint declaration might originate with either Congress or the White House . His outline , he made clear , was that of the latter . " It will be up to Congress itself , " he went on , " to decide what to do if it is a Congressional resolution . There had been no final agreement yet as to precisely what ' process or form would be used to carry out the spirit of the President 's statement on this subject that was made in his message to Congress . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " thus , perhaps , tempering some of the criticism that had been leveled at such wartime agreements as those made with the Soviet Union at Yalta . and Potsdam . Moreover , in response to a question , he expressed his belief that Soviet " abuse and violation " of the agreements , rather than the agreements themselves , were responsible for the " enslavement of these captive peoples . " " We are told , at least by those ' who made the agreements , " Mr. Dulles continued , " that the way they have been carried out by the Soviet Union was c , ntrary to what they understood to be the intention of the agreements . " Fringe Wars Tie Down Troops Behind Mr. Dulles ' forecast of future efforts to reduce the advantage held by the Soviet Union in Asia at this time is the conviction that United States and other Allied forces can not be occupied in fringe wars while Soviet troops stand mobilized for a thrust into almost any direction . It is felt in some quarters that the gradual disengagement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the French troops from IndoChina could evntually bring the Communist forces around to a negotiating position . This might be accomplished , according to these observers , in six , twelve or eighteen months , after which  --  but not before ? it might be profitable to resume the truce talks . Without referring specifically to such plans , Mr. Dulles nevertheless said that strengthening of native forces in Korea and IndoChina and bringing to an end the engagement of United States and Allied troops there , would be one way of ending the fighting in Korea on acceptable terms . Strengthening of native forces in Korea would mean a stepped-up program of training South Korean troops . Presumably to avoid any possible conflict in policy with the President , Mr. Dulles had declined to hold a news conference until Mr. Eisenhower had made his appearance at one yesterday . However , Mr. Dulles ' statement about the State Department 's continuing study of the possibility of a naval blockade or similar measures appeared to contrast with the President 's statement yesterday that no study had been made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not expand on the meaning of " naval blockade , " and he gave no indication whether such a weapon would be wielded only by the United States or by other allies in the Korean War . One of the possibilities , it is known , would be a substantiallyincreased program of military aid to the Chinese Nationalist forces on Formosa , especially for strengthening the Nationalist navy . Mr. Dulles observed that there were many ways in which the noose around Communist China could be tightened , and he mentioned in particular a " more strict enforcement " of the embargo recommended by the United Nations . He made it clear , too , that any course on which the United States might embark would have to take into account the views of friendly governments as well as the possible military consequences . Asked whether he planned to introduce such measures as the blockade into the United Nations ' General Assembly opening next week , Mr , Dulles replied that he was " not aware of any plan " to do that . He added , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " commercial intercourse with an aggressor . "
