The Wild Duck ( by Henrik Ibsen ) opened the annual winter season at Manhattan 's City Center . It also opened the door to a musty attic . Under the dust and cobwebs that shroud Ibsen 's classic , there may still lie something vital . But far from uncovering it , the present production treasures every cobweb and <P> merges less a Norwegian problem play than a mid-Victorian period piece . <P> In The Wild Duck , the archrealist Ibsen conceded-long before O'Neill 's The Iceman Cometh-that men need illusions to survive . The Ekdal family are happy so long as Hialmar Ekdal is ignorant of his wife 's past and the true paternity of his child . Ibsen 's exposure of Gregers Werle , the meddling idealist who enlightens Hialmar in the name of truth , is merciless . But his portrayal of flabby , feckless , self-excusing Hialmar is hardly less so . <P> Today , Ibsen-dotting every i , megaphoning every idea-seems most merciless toward his audience . And the current production is not only didactic , but thoroughly inept . Maurice Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be playing Micawber , so stagily that he might be spouting blank verse .
