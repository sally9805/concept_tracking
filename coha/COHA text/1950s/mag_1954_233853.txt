Lavrenty P. Beria , a man who ordered the death of millions , was himself put to death last week . After a secret trial that lasted five days , the Kremlin announced that this " frenzied , insolent plotter . . . this contemptible Judas " had been found guilty of murder , espionage , treason , sabotage and perversion . He was condemned to the " highest degree of punishment , with confiscation of all property and removal of all titles and decorations " ( seven Medals of the Soviet Union , five Orders of Lenin ) . <P> With Beria , Marshal of the Soviet Union , were sentenced six of his top-ranking MVD generals and ex-ministers : Merkulov , Dekanozov , Kobulov , Goglidze , Meshik and Vlodzimirsky . On Dec. 23 , 1953 , said the Kremlin , all seven men were taken out and shot . <P> The court that found Beria guilty was headed by a Red army general , Marshal Ivan S. Konev . This led to a rush of speculation that Dictator Malenkov had called in the army to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshals henceforth must be regarded as the chief power behind the throne in Moscow . Eight Red army men also sat on the supreme court bench that tried Marshal Tukhachevsky and half a dozen other high-ranking officers in the purge of 1936-38 . <P> But whatever grouping of forces had congealed to destroy Beria , the monolithic state remained . While it did , every Communist , however exalted , still faced the dreaded question : Who is next on the list ? <P> Judging by precedent and by the measure of closeness of association with Beria and his gang , the next victims might well be Anastas Mikoyan , 58 , the Armenian Minister of Internal Trade , and possibly Vyacheslav Molotov . Mikoyan brought Beria , " the worst enemy of the motherland , " into the party fold . Molotov promoted Dekanozov , " an archtraitor. "
