Communist trade unions and fronts , gave the Lattimore broadside nation-wide distribution . Summary of Campaign McCarran summarized the opening events in the 1945 campaign to discredit as follows : Sept. ** comintern agent , writing as foreign editor of the Daily Worker , wrote articles slandering as " the tool of reactionary elements in Asia . " Sept. ** Daily Worker violently denounced for stating that the Japanese occupation was proceeding so smoothly that he could reduce occupation forces to 200,000 men in six months .

" Reds ' Chief Obstacle Oct. ** communist press assailed 's role in Japan and called for his ouster in favor of the allied council , of which the soviet union was a Member . " The Communists never gave up on the idea of destroying , " MeCarran told the senate . " ' They regarded him as the chief obstacle to their success in the far east . Communist fronts demanded that he be tried as a war criminal . " Last April 9 , the day before his dismissal by the President , the Daily Worker came out with a banner headline saying the world was demanding 's recall . " During all this period , Gen. was being opposed by officials of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being advanced by the Communists . " Succumbed to Reds " " Gen. rejected the advice of those who would have liked to impose a Morgenthau plan on Japan and drive her people into Stalin 's arms by harsh treatment . Under the misguided policy of the state department , China succumbed to the Communists . kept Japan from the - same fate . " Thanks to , Japan now is our friend . Thanks to the state department , our former ally , China , now is our bitter enemy . The recall of has been interpreted already , in some quarters , as a ' go ahead ' signal to the Communists in Japan . " Attacks by officials of the state department paralleled the communist offensive since 1945 . There is clear evidence that Acheson had undertaken a course paralleling that of the Communists in pursuing a hard peace and was denouncing the general who was resisting such a course . Varning in 194G " In September , 1946 , thur issued a warning against the danger of communism in J a pa n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Carter Vincent , then head of the department 's far eastern division , charged that Gen. was instituting a n anti-soviet campaign in violation of state department directives to use Japan for ' building a bridge of friendship to the Soviet union . ' " In recent weeks , both the communist press and our own state department have been criticizing Gen. Mac Arthur on the broad ground that his policies , if carried out , would lead to World War III . " Today the Communists and the state department are rejoicing at the general 's dismissal . Let us heed 's advice that if we give up Formosa and allow the force of Chiang Kai-shek and all the guerrillas and resistance forces in Asia to languish and die , we will allow the Chinese Communists to realize Stalin 's great goal of making the Pacific a Red lake .
