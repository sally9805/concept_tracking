<P> In 1941 , a young girl Communist named Vjera was caught by the Nazis in Zagreb , Yugoslavia . They jailed her , questioned her , tortured her . One of their most urgent questions : Where was Communist Leader Vladimir Popovich ? Vjera replied truthfully that she had never heard of him before . <P> Popovich was a hamhanded , 6 ft. 3 in . Montenegrin hillbilly who had quit his medical studies in Belgrade to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War . In 1938 , in Paris , he met the new secretary of the Yugoslav Communist Party , one Tito , who took a liking to the big Montenegrin . In Tito 's guerrilla war against the Nazis , Popovich rose to general . He also met Vjera , and in 1946 he married her . <P> Last week Popovich , now 36 , arrived in the U.S. with pretty wife Vjera , to take up his new job as ambassador from Communist Dictator Tito . Dressed to the nines , like an oldtime bourgeois-diplomat swell , Popovich portentously told reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is my government , that we will meet in the U.S. with ever-increasing understanding and ever greater assistance . " He criticized " bloc systems " in the world , charging with lofty impartiality that they led to war- " from whichever side the blocs originate . " <P> The day before , U.S. reporters in Belgrade had cabled more explicit views by Comrade Popovich . In Tito 's theoretical organ Kommunist , a few weeks before setting off for Washington , he had written a long piece about the irreconcilable struggle in the world between Marxists and U.S.-led " imperialists . " Excerpts : <P> " American leading circles announce that they recognize Communism . . . on the condition that states which have adopted this ideology do not interfere in the affairs of states with other ideologies ; and promise that they will not meddle in the affairs of those states which practice the Communist ideology . This bears witness to the weakness of capitalism . . . In 1949 . . . it is a fact that the main imperialist forces . . . did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of open intervention in China . " <P> The first duty of an ambassador is to explain the regime of the country he represents . In this sense Comrade Popovich had made a good start . He had demonstrated to the people of the U.S. that a Tito Communist is still a Communist .
