The high cost of transporting coal is one reason coal has lost ground to other fuels . While the price of coal at the mine $4.85 a ton ; has dropped over the past eight years , the average cost per ton to ship it to market rose from $1.47 in 1948 to $3.24 in 1955 , and is still going up . Last week Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Co. , biggest U.S. independent producer , demonstrated a radical new way to cut shipping costs . On an experimental basis , it sent the first coal through a 108-mile , $15 million pipeline designed to carry 1,300,000 tons of coal annually from Pitt Consol 's strip mine at Georgetown , Ohio to the big Eastlake steam electric plant of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co . The coal is pulverized and mixed with water to form a slurry , which six giant pumps move along at about 3 m.p.h . At Cleveland , a $2,500,000 plant dries the coal so that it can be blown into the furnaces . <P> The cost of transporting the coal plus full repayment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half the $3.32 a ton it now costs to ship coal to Cleveland by rail . Although the pipe is a possible competitor of the railroads , three of them-the Pennsylvania , New York Central and Nickel Plate-allowed the pipeline to cross their right of ways in return for an option to buy 45% of the pipeline-operating company 's stock . If the pipeline proves trouble-free when full-scale operation starts April 7 , the industry expects it to be widely copied and the market for coal expanded .
