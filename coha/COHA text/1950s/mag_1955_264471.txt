Japan 's Socialists , split into left and right wings by the peace treaty with the Western allies , patched things up last week . Amid bouquets of chrysanthemums , carnations and ferns , the two factions joined to become Japan 's second largest political party , with 155 seats in the Diet v. 185 for Premier Ichiro Hatoyama 's conservative Democrats . <P> The Socialists came to windy settlements of many differences , from party dues to rearmament policy , in the end settled everything except the color of the party 's flag . Both sides , the blue-flag right-wingers and red-flag left-wingers , wanted time to consider the logical compromise-purple . The left-wingers , non-Communist but not always discernibly so in foreign-policy issues , promised to quit calling Japan an " American colony , " and to postpone their campaign for disbanding Japan 's modest armed forces . <P> In return , the left-wingers got the chairmanship of the new united party for their leader , Mosaburo Suzuki , a onetime ricksha boy , a poet who writes under the name of Mojin ( growing person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in imperial jails during World War II , a longtime inhabitant of the marshy Marxist terrain between Socialism and Communism . For their part , the right-wingers installed as party secretary general their boss , Inejiro Asanuma , a big-chested , big-voiced union man who has a background of antiCommunism . He is a stronger , more forceful type than Party Chairman Suzuki . The reunited party 's line : preservation of the MacArthur Constitution ( which outlaws war ) , nationalization of some industries ( e.g. , coal , electric power ) , diplomatic relations with Red China and the Soviet Union , gradual steps toward replacing the Japan-U.S. military alliance with some sort of pact between Japan , the U.S. , China and Russia . <P> The reunion upset the balance in the Diet , but was likely to provoke a similar reunion between Hatoyama 's Democrats and the Liberals of Ex-Premier Shigeru Yoshida , which would give conservatives a 147-seat majority and Japan the near equivalent of a two-party system .                  @ @ @
