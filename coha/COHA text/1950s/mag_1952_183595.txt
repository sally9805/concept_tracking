For businessmen who fear that deflation ( see above ) may lead to recession , Harvard 's Economist Sumner H. Slichter had some reassuring words . Said Slichter : " My belief is that during the rest of 1952 the influences making for expansion will be stronger than those making for contraction " ( e.g. , Slichter expects a rise soon in consumer buying ) . As for 1953 , he added , " if there is a recession , it will be quite mild . " <P> For the long pull , Slichter thought that some economists were slighting a new " X " factor in the economy , which throws old crystal-gazing formulas out of whack . The new variable : research . <P> With government and industry now spending $2.6 billion a year on research , more than a fivefold increase since 1930 , huge new markets are being opened up every day through " new and better goods which would have been undreamed of 30 years ago . " Furthermore , said Slichter , industrial research will offer more investment opportunities than there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be financed by credit . This will permit the money supply to increase about as rapidly as the productive capacity of the country . Hence technological progress will not create unemployment . On the contrary , it will enable the economy to generate demand for goods as fast as it raises its capacity to produce . . . The economy has acquired an important new capacity to grow . " <P> There was plenty of evidence last week to support Slichter 's optimism . The appliance industry , shutting down refrigerator plants because the market seemed to be saturated , was in the infancy of a huge new boom , air conditioning . Synthetic fabrics showed signs of breaking the clothing industry 's slump ( see Modern Living ) . And the chemical industry , which pulled these fabrics from its test tubes , had new wonders on the way ( see below ) .
