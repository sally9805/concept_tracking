The wife of a Cardiff workingman , 41-year-old , pink-sweatered Florence Poynter , mother of two , brought cheers from 4,000 representatives at the Conservative Party 's 71st annual conference at Blackpool last week . Her husband , said Mrs. Poynter , earned only 4 17s. 2d. ( about $13.50 ) weekly , so that she had to leave her children and go out scrubbing . She had been better off before the war when her husband had brought home only 2 10s . By thus dramatically emphasizing the rise in the cost of living and affirming her faith in the Conservative Party , now in opposition , Mrs. Poynter had keynoted the Tory campaign policy . Said Party Leader Winston Churchill : " Mrs. Poynter has made her point . " <P> The next day a number of platitudinous resolutions on housing were brushed aside for a specific promise . Cried 38-year-old Harmar Nicholls , M.P . for Peterborough : " Our message should be this : that from existing stocks and available labor we should guarantee to give housing first call up to 300,000 houses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure 300,000 , pandemonium broke loose , hundreds of voices chanted , " We want 300,000 . . . " <P> Lord Woolton ( " Uncle Fred " ) was forced to come to the aid of the lady chairman . Beaming , he raised his hands and calmed the multitude . Then he said blandly : " This is magnificent . You want the figure of 300,000 put in ? " There were roars of approval . Whereupon Lord Woolton purred : " I am sure that those of us on the platform here would be very glad to have such a figure put in . " The conference joyously passed a resolution including 300,000 . The Labor Party had promised only 200,000 new houses . But serious Tory back-room policymakers like R. A. Butler , who had expressed qualms about the feasibility of 300,000 new houses , were worried . If the Tories tried to out-promise Attlee 's welfare program would they be able to keep their campaign promises if and when their party came into power ? Improved Tory organization was reaching down to the working class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
