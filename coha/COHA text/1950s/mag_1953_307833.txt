In the underworld that lies behind the lovely faade of Paris , a new population has moved in on the oldtime apache . In the argot they are les Bicots , but respectable Parisians call them les Algriens . After 1946 , when the people of Algeria were granted full French citizenship , they began pouring into France at the rate of 30,000 a year . Arriving in Paris on the slow trains from the Midi , they drift with their bundles into the old , revolutionary districts of Belleville and Mnilmontant , where whole blocks now have the sound and smell of Algerian medinas . Only one in five of the Algerians in Paris has regular employment ; the others live in the tradition of the Paris demimonde , vociferously free , but desperately poor . <P> Among this population , against whom a strong racial prejudice is developing in France , the French Communist Party has found violent adherents . Last week les communistes Algriens turned the last hours of Bastille Day , traditionally a gay but tranquil celebration into a riot . <P> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 olive-skinned Algerians , marching in disciplined formation and bearing posters demanding the release from jail of Algerian Nationalist Leader Messali Hadj . At the Place de la Nation , a sudden rainstorm sent paraders and bystanders rushing for shelter . When police tried to hold back the stampede , the Algerians overwhelmed the barricades and began attacking with stones , bottles , chairs and broken barriers . Riot squads came sirening to the scene , threw a cordon around the Place de la Nation , opened fire with rifles . When it was all over , six Algerians and one French labor union secretary were dead , and some 130 people , including 82 cops , were injured . <P> <P> Paris was shocked , but many saw the problem in its real light . " Pilgrims of hunger , " said the conservative Le Monde , " to whom we granted full citizenship seven years ago . . . Why do they come to France ? Simply because they can not feed themselves and their families in Algeria . " Said Paris-Presse : " We must take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of them on a criminal scale later . " While the newspapers discussed improved housing and job training , les Bicots drew back into the old , dark , protective alleyways of Paris .
