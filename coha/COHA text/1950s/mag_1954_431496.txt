S WOOSH ! At the sudden rush of a J huge bird 's wings my heart gave a big thump and every nerve tingled . I glued my eyes to the peephole of the blind in which I was crouching , and there , on her cliff-ledge eyrie only a few feet before me , landed the most magnificent bird I have ever set my eyes on ? a golden eagle ( page 275 ) . The eagle eyed the blind with a fierce glint that all but pierced the burlap tent . T held my breath and froze . During those moments of tension the inch-size peephole seemed to gape a foot wide , and the three thicknesses of burlap with their leafy camouflage seemed thinner than cigarette paper . Suddenly I realized her eyes were fixed on the lenses of the movie and still cameras which , though deeply hooded , were set up just below . After a while she jerked a quick look back over her shoulder , glaring down the wild ravine , then up it to where her mate was perching some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked back at the blind again , eying it up and down for a minute or two . At last , after what seemed an eternity , the fierceness vanished from her eye and she looked down to the cup of the nest , made of large sticks , coarse heather , and rushes . There , oblivious of the big world around , nestled her solitary , fluffy white , week-old youngster , sound asleep . Suspicions Overcome The old bird cocked her head to one side a little , regarding the chick tenderly . A glint was still there in her eye , but it was no longer that fierce initial flash of suspicion . Her pose was now irresistible , so I clicked the shutter of the still camera ( page 276 ) . To my great relief , she took no notice of the sound nor of the slight fumbling which followed when I changed the plate . She just kept staring at that youngster . ' At last I felt I could relax and take a detailed look at her . She was tawny brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone ruby-colored in the sun , contrasting with the yellow at the base of her bill . As she moved about . I could see that her toes , each with a huge curved black claw at its tip , were the same bright yellow as her beak . Her legs had " spats " of chestnutbrown feathers right down to the toes , and there were a few of the same color on the flanks by no means a brightly colored bird , but far from dull , either . Clearly she had accepted the presence of the blind well enough . It had been in place several days already and was thickly camouflaged with leafy branches , bundles of heather , and other green stuff so that it merged naturally with the herbage-grown cliff face . Feeding Time Arrives After a while the eaglet started to move about and cheep . At this the mother bird became active herself . The eyrie was several feet across , and lying on it was the body of a grouse partly plucked of its feathers . The old bird reached out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor it down , gripped a morsel of meat in her beak , then tugged upwards , ripping it off . Ever so gently she gave it to the eaglet , who cheeped peevishly , rather like a domestic chick ( page 276 ) . Time and time again for the next 30 minutes she picked off little tidbits and fed them to the baby . It was all done so carefully and gently that it looked rehearsed ? almost , in fact , a ritual . The youngster cheeped , now shrilly as it awaited a morsel , now softly as it gurgled with satisfaction , its maw full of juicy red meat . This often consisted of more tender parts such as liver . And how carefully the old one planted those clumsy-looking , wide-spreading , terribly armed feet whenever she made a move about the nest !  | After the first 10 minutes I decided to risk starting up the movie camera , as the mother seemed so perfectly at ease . In any case , she was so fully preoccupied in feeding the chick that I hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it did start , she just looked up for a few seconds , then continued the feeding . The raging gale that normally blew up that funnellike mountaintop gully was still ; the rain clouds and mist had rolled away , and the sun shone brightly upon the family scene before me . The movie camera purred continuously , the still camera clicked every now and again , and the eagle carried on with the meal . After the many partial failures of years before , I felt that at long last I had found a real chance , here in the heart of the Scottish Highlands , to photograph and film the home lift of a golden eagle from a blind built near its eyrie . But I had no time for reminiscences . Between watching what was going on through the peephole , jotting notes in my notebook , and working the two cameras , my wits and hands were fully occupied . The time came all too quickly when the eaglet , satiated , sank down to rest in the cup of the nest . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gory entrails , feet , and legs . These the adult bunched together in her beak and with an upward flick of her head bolted the whole lot with obvious relish . It was too much to go down all at once . Several vigorous doglike gulps were necessary before the last of the torn carcass disappeared and the bird looked composed once more . After a short spell of cleaning mouth and bill , she jumped off the nest and flew away ( page 277 ) . Fifteen minutes later there came a whis- Cling of pinions , and the cock bird arrived home with a grouse between his feet . He dumped it on the nest and left at once , but not before I had time to see how much smaller and neater he was than his mate . The expression in his eye ? which appeared lighter in color than hers ? was even fiercer . Knowing that the cock bird does nearly all the hunting and that the hen tends the young at this very early stage , I waited hopefully for her return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her cruising round in the currents of air which swept up from certain points above the cliffs of the gully . Sure enough , within 10 minutes she was back , carrying a bunch of newly pulled rushes . These she dumped on the nest and eyed the youngster . Suddenly she picked up a 148e beakful of rushes and placed them right on top of the baby , completely burying him . I stared in incredulity . I had never seen , read of , or heard of such an action . The eaglet did not seem to enjoy the idea of being buried alive at all . The little pile of rushes shuddered , and suddenly out popped the beak , then the head , then the eaglet . Meantime , his mother just looked on . When her chick had struggled free , she picked up a twig of heather about a quarter of an inch thick and a foot long and placed it on him . When he shook it off , she put it on again . At the time , I was puzzled about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I glanced over some old NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINES . In the May , 1929 , number I found an article on the closely related American bald eagle . In it Prof. Francis H. Her- rick said that at only one of four nests he had under observation was it possible to see the eggs or newly hatched young from his blinds in neighboring trees , because of the care the old birds took to cover them upon leaving the nest . This was done to keep them warm . But our eagles in Scotland certainly do not have this habit , at least not with any regularity : and if the chick-burying incident I witnessed was at all related , I am sure it was as unusual as it was interesting . The eagle now started delving with her beak into the nesting material , picking up minute creatures and swallowing them with relish . I could scarcely suppress a chuckle as I watched this mighty hunter among birds pounce upon ? flies ! Mother Does Her Housework From this she went on to tidy up sticks about the nest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the foot of a grouse in her bill and flew off down the gully with it . After this , the eaglet slept peacefully after his meal till about 6 o'clock in the evening , when I heard the scraping of feet on the rocks below . Peering down from the blind , I saw  | the cheery face of my gamekeeper friend Duncan at the foot of the cliff . The eagle 's nest , which he had found some weeks before , was on his Forestry Commission beat , and he had arrived now to relieve me from my vigil in the blind . " Fell , what luck ? " Duncan asked , with a chuckle in his voice and a Highland twinkle in his eye . Before I could say anything , he had answered his own question . " She 's been back , and you 've got plenty of photos , " he said . Gamekeepers Have Long-range Eyes " How on earth do you know , when you went right off down the mountain ? " I asked . Another chuckle , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was slung over his shoulder . ( The Highland folk always use telescopes , not binoculars . ) " I put the glass on the gully from a distance . The pair of them were cruising round overhead when I left you . They were so high I could only just see them with my naked eve . " After an hour and a half I saw the hen bird close her wings to her side and swoop headlong into the gully . She perched on the old tree near the top for a few minutes . then . seeing the coast was clear , flew in to the nesting cliff . Man , it must have been grand to see her coming in from so close . " " Yes , " I said , " it was simply terrific . " Duncan 's help was essential to successful observations at such close  | quarters , for it is futile to put up a blind by an eagle 's nest and simply get inside . The watcher must be accompanied to the blind by a friend , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds , seeing him go , feel it is safe to return to their nest . Likewise , the watcher must not leave the blind until the eagles have first seen his friend return to it . Again the birds will fly off , but will come back when they see the original observer walking away . The next day I climbed up to the eyrie and had my second session in the blind . This was a red-letter occasion , for I was able to picture cock and hen at the nest together with both still and movie cameras . Later the hen left , but she returned after an hour and three quarters and fed the youngster on grouse . She then departed again , but soon reappeared with a spray of dark-green leaves and placed them on the nest . Many birds of prey have this habit of adding fresh greenery to their nests right through the breeding season . It may assist in keeping the eyrie fresh and clean , though all eagles ' nests acquire a pretty strong odor before the youngsters are many weeks old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later on , through the rear peephole , I watched the eagle land on a rowan tree and start tugging at a branch with her beak . She twisted it this way and that until finally it came free . Immediately she launched herself into space . Seeing her coming , I got ready with the movie camera and shot her in slow motion as she arrived .  | She left the nest yet again and flew down the gully . Hardly had T watched her out of view when I heard the now-familiar thrashing of wings and , hurriedly looking out , spotted her back home once more . This time she was all keyed up , craning her neck upwards and peering intently down the gully as if in anticipation of something . Was there danger approaching ? No . I thought , it could scarcely be that : otherwise she would have flown away posthaste . Then I guessed it . She had seen her mate , who was about to bring in prey , and here he was , coming rocketlike towards the eyrie . Eagle Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to the peephole and gripped the shutter releases firmly . Squeeze No. 1 set the movie camera purring . Squeeze No. 2 clicked the still camera . I had caught them both side by side , the bulky hen on the left and her dapper mate , a baby rabbit crushed below his left foot , on the right . He fixed the lens and blind with a cold glare ( page 280 ) . What a magnificent creature ! A king of birds if ever there was one . There simply is n't anything else on wings to equal you , sir ! Not even your wife has quite that regal demeanor . But he must have heard my thoughts , as it were , for he turned abruptly , plunged into space , and was gone . I breathed again , turning my attention to the hen , who was now dealing with the rabbit in a businesslike way . The chick , who had been asleep , was now awake and cheeping and was fed again , a scene I shall never tire of watching . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other more bizarre portions of the rabbit 's anatomy , and that was one rabbit less to ruin the trees . Afterward , the eagle stood motionless above her chick for fully half an hour . As the minutes went by , this statuelike attitude began to get on my nerves . Time and time again I looked out of the peephole , and there was the bird in exactly the same place and pose . I had to pinch myself to be reassured that it was she and not I who was in a trance . Eventually I realized that all that was happening was that she was digesting that last meal of rabbit entrails . Such periods of quiescence are normal with all birds of prey ; in fact , I once photographed a juvenile eagle in such a state ( page 281 ) . I spent several more days hiding beside the eyrie , but for some of them the weather returned to normal thick Scotch mist and rain , making photography impossible . On other occasions the birds stayed away from the nest , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing larger and more active every day . As I sat watching him , I longed for some close-up pictures showing his white-down stage , which lasts five or six weeks . Although a fortunate configuration of the cliff had made it possible to climb up and build the blind behind an outjutting tree , this position was separated from the nest by 30 feet of very fresh , very thin air . That evening , by good fortune , I heard of another nest into which one could scramble from the top of a cliff . Not even a short rope was needed . I had visited the site many years before when it was empty . Now it contained a plump eaglet in white down . Rare Nests Are Protected In a previous year , the eggs had been stolen . Fortunately the culprit had been caught and fined . Orders had now been issued that the nest was to be strictly protected . ( The same applied to Duncan 's and other nests on Forestry Commission ground . ) The news that the nest was in use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mountaineers were to be kept away from that part of the forest . Even photography , without the special permission I had obtained , was forbidden . I was delighted to see how well rare birds were being protected from interference by the Forestry authorities , who were cooperating nobly in the nest-protection scheme run by the powerful Royal Society for the Protection of Birds . Under this , gamekeepers are paid a bounty for every eagle 's nest from which the young fly safely . This nest , however , was of special interest . The gamekeeper , whose name was Neil , accompanied me up the mountain . As we neared the bottom of the eagle 's nesting rock , which at this point must have been 200 feet high , he pointed out the mangled corpses of two ewes below the cliff . " One day , about a month ago , " said Neil , " I was sitting on that hillside opposite the nest , when I noticed something unusual going on . I put my telescope up and saw a remarkable scene at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep V-shaped gully you can see running down from the top of the rock . It had landed unharmed on the nest , and there it was right beside the hen eagle ! " She was astride the eggs , beating the sheep with her wings . The ewe backed out of the way , but I could see how panicky she was becoming , right on the edge of the nest . Behind her and to her right was sudden death over the cliff ; to her left was solid rock : in front of her , barring her only escape route up the cliff , was the old eagle . Double Tragedy at the Eyrie " When I realized what was happening , I dashed across that hillside as fast as T could , but by the time I reached the spot , the sheep had panicked , backed away too far , and fallen . Well , you can see where ? 200 feet if it 's an inch ? but not before one of her hoofs had smashed an egg . " And so , " concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young one in my nest this year for you . Believe it or not , a few days later I saw this second corpse here , too : so the same thing must have happened again . " When we reached the eyrie , panting from the climb and saturated with perspiration , we found the eaglet plump and doing well . It was easy to scramble down into the nest , but , once there , the obvious dawned upon me . The only possible place to erect the tripod was that selfsame fatal spot on the edge of the nest from which the two luckless sheep had overbalanced backwards . More than once as I manipulated the cameras I had visions of those unfortunate creatures . Thanks to Neil 's strong and guiding hands , no such fate befell me , and I photographed the youngster successfully . Even though the normal number of eggs is two , it is , of course , quite usual for only one eaglet to be reared . I learned the reasons for this at the very first eagle 's nest I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many kind friends who have helped me with my eagle work , who found this nest on a great black precipice 1,600 feet above sea level on his Argyll sheep farm . We started a blind on the brink of the cliff . While we were working on it , one of the eaglets delivered a series of attacks on the other . We had noticed that the latter was in poor shape and did not resist these attacks in the least . Clearly the one was dominant over the other , as in the " peck order " of hens . Returning a week or two later , we were not really surprised to find the weaker eaglet lying dead on the edge of the nest . We finished the hiding place , which was virtually a little hut made of boulders , turf , heather , and large sheets of moss , and Farquhar agreed to leave me inside for an 8-hour spell . The eaglet was now dark in color , as feathers had nearly supplanted the white down of youth . I sat watching it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return when I was startled by a series of yapping noises rather like the barking of small dogs . My thoughts flew to the local gamekeeper , who was antagonistic towards eagles . Was he arriving with dogs and gun to shoot the eaglet ? Anxiously I peered out of the blind . There was no man with gun and dogs , but sailing majestically to and fro were two huge brown birds with upturned wings and quills which stuck out like giants ' fingers . The eagles were returning , and it was their calls that I heard . The eaglet started squelping peevishly for food , at which one of the birds broke away from its planing , turned towards the eyrie , and with a mighty swishing of wings came swinging in to its rocky citadel . The youngster now went mad with excitement , bowing in front of its parent in a suppliant manner and spreading its now goodsized wings to each side . Suddenly it dawned on me that there might be a direct connection between those spread wings , which were obviously instinctive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might often have been " fenced off " from the prey by those outstretched , tentlike wings ( page 282 ) . Female May Kill Little Brother Thus a slow process of starving and weakening may have commenced , which , coupled with the direct assaults , had ended in the death of the weakling . The adults would do little or nothing about it , as the chick that gets most attention is the one that makes most noise , and this , of course , is the stronger one . Now , for instance , the adult eagle totally ignored her offspring 's mute , still body , and indeed , as is customary at this stage of the breeding cycle , soon left the nest . Subsequent observations have strengthened my view as to what causes the death of a youngster . It has been my invariable obser- vation , and that of others in Scotland , that of two eaglets in an eyrie one is larger than the other . The larger is a female , the smaller a male . For about the first six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or no effort to resist . If the male is the first to hatch , he will have a probable 3-day lead over the female , and this may help him survive her attacks . But if the female hatches first , she has the double advantage of lead and size , and the male is almost surely doomed . About the sixth week , if the female has failed to kill the male , her attacks diminish and she tends to become lazy and sluggish . The male , on the contrary , becomes extremely active and sprightly and eventually leaves the nest before she does . In view of the frequent death of the male chick , more females fly successfully each year than males , and so it seems reasonable to suppose that there are more adult hen eagles than cock birds . It may even be that the limiting factor in the number of breeding pairs is the number of mature males available . Many gamekeepers have told me that if a hen eagle is shot from her nest , her mate quickly gets a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the dead chick 's body stays ignored , on or near the eyrie . At other times it disappears , probably removed by the hen . But does she , or the survivor , ever eat it ? An incident at a Banff nest two years ago is suggestive . The keeper told me that one day there were two eaglets in the nest , but upon his next visit there was only one , plus the head of the other . This means that one of its parents or its sister was almost certainly the responsible party . Evidence of a Deadly Duel Serious fights between adult eagles are not common : in 12 years of eagle watching I have never seen one . But Bob MacKechnie , a botanist friend of mine , was plant hunting in Wester Ross one day when he came across two male eagles dead on the ground . They were rigidly locked together by each other 's talons . What a spectacle the fight to the death must have been ! Their nests were apparently too close for comfort ? only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied sites to be about four miles . Fights , or at any rate aerial sparring , between other birds and eagles are frequent . I shall never forget an aerial combat between two ravens and an eagle . The scene was a wild corrie , or deep hollow , 2,000 feet up one of Perth 's highest mountains . Pinnacles of rock and towering crags topped by snowcorniced ridges bounded this huge natural amphitheater , domain of the eagle . Range upon range of distant snow-capped peaks and a sky of deepest blue formed a grandiose backdrop for the drama to come ( page 278 ) . Ravens Attack the Queen of Birds I had photographed the queen of birds as she had flown out from her big black nesting cliff . She was sailing round and round above the corrie when suddenly , from out of the blue , arrived a raven , croaking gruffly . From a seat on a rock I watched him maneuver to gain height . Then suddenly his croaking rose to a crescendo , he closed his wings and dived full tilt at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not dare to strike home ; but he kept straight on . A head-on collision in mid-air seemed inevitable . Then one of the neatest pieces of avian airmanship I 've ever seen took place . In the nick of time the eagle closed her right wing , did a quick little aerial side step , and the furious raven. traveling like a black streak , whizzed harmlessly past . The eagle spread her wings once more and soared again as if nothing had happened . Although accustomed to the eagle 's mastery of the air , I nevertheless was astounded at the nimbleness of this maneuver and eagerly awaited the next round . It soon came . Once again the raven climbed above the eagle ; once again he dived headlong , only to be defeated by the last-minute side step . Every few minutes the same thing happened , while the raven 's furious croaking echoed and re-echoed among the gaunt crags . Suddenly from a distance there came a new sound : looking in that direction , I spotted a second large black angry bird approaching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain and was coming to join the fray . For nearly an hour I sat on that rock , entranced by the aerial combat overhead . Round and round the three birds cruised , the eagle as calm and unconcerned as the ravens were frantic . In the end , the hen bird detached herself and returned to her young on the distant crag . Not long after , her mate , too , gave it up and followed , leaving the eagle at long last in undisputed possession of the air above its nesting corrie .  |
