Four years ago , when Communist China poured shout and shell on the Nationalist-held offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu , President Eisenhower came to a decision never publicly announced : U.S. force would be used to help fight off invasion of Quemoy and Matsu by Red China . Last week , with shout and shell raining again ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , the U.S. saw Quemoy and Matsu as being of even greater importance than in 1954 . Said the President at press conference : the Nationalists now have one-third of their strength deployed on the offshore islands , and loss of that strength would lay Formosa itself more open to invasion . <P> Intently studying the moves of the Chicoms ( cablese opposite of Chinats ) , the U.S. State Department fired off three warnings in six days . The message : it would be " highly hazardous " for anyone to believe that a Quemoy-Matsu invasion could be " limited . " <P> Defense of the islands is a planning headache to U.S. military men . But the U.S. , at week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up its blunt diplomatic talk with military beef . To the Seventh Fleet of Vice Admiral Wallace ( " Beak " ) Beakley steamed the carrier Essex and four destroyers from the Middle East , the big carrier Midway and the heavy cruiser Los Angeles from the West Coast . U.S. fighters rolled onto the ready line on Formosa , and Tactical Air Force sent out from the states a reinforcing squadron along with air cargo support planes from the Military Transport Service-all meaningful public warning that the U.S. means business .
