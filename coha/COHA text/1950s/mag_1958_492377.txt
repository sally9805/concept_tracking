One day in 19.1.5 an invitation came to me from President Truman to be a member of the United States delegation to the lust , organizing , meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in London . At lirst I thought it would be impossible for me to accept . I felt I had no background or experience for such a job . I did nut even know that my nomination by the President would have to be confirmed by the Senate , and if I had known it I would have been still inure hesitant , because I correedy suspected that there were some senators unfavorable to my participation . My soil . Elliott . and a number of friends with whom I consulted urged me to accept , however , and finally , in fear and trembling . I did so . and the Senate confirmed my nomination despite the dissent of Sen. Theodore G. Bilbo , of Mississippi . Senator Bilbo had been critical of statements I had made previously in regard to discrimination against Negroes , but when he was asked why he voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so many reasons for opposing me that he would have to write a book to cover them all . I might point out here that during my service in the United Nations I received a salary that , had I worked full time , would have amounted to around $14 , : ion a year because I was a member of the I finnan Rights Commission . However , my work covered only about five months of the year , and I was paid accordingly . In addition , I received about twelve dollars a day extra when I was attending sessions of the General Assembly outside of the United States . The cost of my transportation and hotel was paid by the Government and I received twelve dollars a day for expenses when I was required to travel abroad . My actual expenses always exceeded these figures , but I never knew just how much I was out of pocket , because I did nut keep complete accounts . I suppose my work as a delegate cost me a considerable sum over a period of six years , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official entertainment , since that was all I could claim as a derhict ion on my income-tax return . The United Nations seemed to me to he the one hope for a peaceful world and I knew that my husband had placed great importance on the establishment of this world organization . So I felt a great sense of responsibility when I became a member of our delegation . I received instructions from the State Department as to : ailing for London in late December , a trip I dreaded because I had always been a very bad sailor . It did not occur to Inc that I might take my secretary with me  --  one had to be assigned to me later in London  --  and aboard the Queen Elizabeth I felt heavyhearted and alone . When I went to my state-room I found awaiting me a batch of clocumews printed on sheets of Hue paper . These were marked ( continued on Page .5(i) " secret " and they contained background information regarding the work to be taken up by the General Assembly as well as our Government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become very familiar with these blue documents , but they were new to me then and the language was so complicated that I had great difficulty in keeping awake as I read . But I read them all . As soon as State Department officials began briefing the delegates on our work I went to every session and , finding there were also briefings for newspaper people aboard , I went to all their meetings too . I had a great deal to learn . One day as I was walking to my stateroom , Sen. Arthur H. Vandenberg , of Michigan , once a stanch Republican isolationist , but then a convert to the United Nations , stopped me . " Mrs. Roosevelt , " he said , " we would like to know if you would serve on Committee Three . " I had two immediate reactions to the question . First , I wondered who " we " might be , and why , since I was a delegate , I had not been consulted about committee assignments . Nest I realized that I had no more idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . So I kept my thoughts to myself and humbly agreed , but I asked the senator to see that I got as much Information as possible on Committee 3 . At that time I did not know whom to ask for information . I had no idea where all those blue documents marked " secret " came from , because they simply appeared in my cabin and ? for all I knew , might have originated in outer space instead of in the Department of State . Secretary of State James Byrnes did not accompany the delegation , but he arrived soon after we reached London . He had a dislike for delegation meetings and I never knew him to call one except on one occasion , when the meeting was kind of cocktail party at which we talked about our work in desultory fashion . My adviser in London , Durward Sandifer , was helpful , and several others at our embassy also were available to discuss with me the problems before Committee 3 . By this time I realized why I had been put on this committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were many committees dealing with budgetary , legal , political and other questions and I could just see the gentlemen of our delegation puzzling over the list and saying , " Oh , no , we ca n't put Mrs. Roosevelt on this committee or that committee  --  she would n't know anything about it . The only safe spot for her is Committee Three . She ca n't do much harm there ! " Oddly enough , I felt very much the same way about it . But as Mr. Sandifer began explaining to me in detail the work of the committee . I also began to realize that it might be far more important than was generally suspected . And , in time , this proved to be the case . One early incident in London gave me cold chills . One morning when I walked into the office to which I had been assigned on Grosvenor Square I found a notice to report at once to the security officer . After many inquiries , I found his office in the building and he confronted me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found on my desk during the night . I had left my office when my secretary was out and had supposed she would return and see that all papers were locked up for the night . I was guilty of a serious offense and 1 assure you that we never failed in this way again . Thereafter I made certain the regulations were observed and I always personally carried my heavy brief case , keeping it within reach or putting it in a safe place . I frequently noticed later that information in papers marked " top secret " appeared in the newspapers even before it reached us , but you have to accept these curious inconsistencies in Government work . I also remembered a hit of advice given me years earlier by Franklin 's adviser , Louis Howe , who said it was wiser to appear to know nothing about certain matters , even if people thought you were dumb , I have found that it is a great ' temptation for people who know something that is not yet generally known to show their importance by letting it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is revealed , interested persons will lind ways to discover what you have been told . So it is well to resist the temptation of being important . After the London sessions formally opened . I walked on eggs much of the time , because I knew that as the only woman on the United States delegation I was not very welcome . If I failed to be a useful member I would not only fail as an individual , but all women would have failed and there would be less chance for others to serve in the future . I was chided at first by Mr. Sandifer for my shyness and caution . which caused me to lag behind sometimes when a vote was being taken . " The United States is an important country , " he told me sternly . " It should vote quickly , because others arc waiting to follow its leadership . " I got the point and thereafter when votes were called my hand went up with alacrity . Ironically enough , it was in Committee 3 that one of the subjects raised  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native lands  --  led to the most heated controversy at the General Assembly sessions . I should explain here , in connecnon with the question of refugees , a point that many people ask about : " As a delegate , do you do exactly what you are told or do you have latitude for personal judgment ? " It is true that as a representative of your Government you are briefed on your Government 's position , but it is also true that a delegate has rights as an individual and , later , I exercised those rights on several occasions . At the first session , however , I think I would not have dared question the State Department 's position and it was fortunate that I agreed with that position in regard to refugees in Germany . These refugees had found at the end of the war that they were in disagreement with the political forces dominating their own countries and did not desire to return home . This was true of certain Russian refugees and also of Poles . Czechoslovakians , Latvians , Lithuanians and Estonians  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supported by Yugoslavia . was that everyone who did not return to his country of origin was either a quisling or a traitor and should be forced to return and accept whatever punishment might be meted out . Other governments felt that many of these people were neither quislings nor traitors and that they had a right to choose whether they would re- turn . In Committee 3 , which I found more interesting than the General Assembly plenary sessions , the refugee question was brought up by the Yugoslav representative , Leo Mates , who later became ambassador to Washington . He was quick and bright , and looked engagingly young , ? ? " " ? ..... r 7 and even innocent . But you must never let yourself be fooled , because he knew how to take advantage of every parliamentary trick and , if you let your guard down for 0 moment , he would defeat you . We could smile sympathetically at each other when someone was making a long-winded speech , but that did not mean I failed to watch his every move with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ability . We did not succeed in achieving a meeting of minds among members of Committee 3 on the refugee problem , since the Russians and Yugoslays maintained their position . When our chairman , Peter Fraser , of New Zealand , made his report to the General Assembly , it was opposed for the Soviet Union by Andrei Vishinsky . In this connection , I think it is important to point out some ways in which the Soviet methods at the United Nations differ from ours , because their system calls for great skill and high legal ability , and it illustrates both the grim determination and the intense training of Russian representatives . Their system provides for the man who heads their delegation to carry the re-sponsibility for handling virtually every subject  --  and there are many , many very complicated subjects  --  that comes before the General Assembly . Other delegations usually designate the person who has been in charge of a particular subject during committee meetings to handle debate on that subject in the plenary sessions of the Assembly . Not so the Russians . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question and I marveled at the way he must have been briefed down to the last detail and at his ability to absorb so many facts regarding a complicated subject that had been discussed by the committee for weeks . Mr. Vishinsky 's remarkably developed memory reminded me of something my son , Elliott , had told me when he was in the Air Force . He said the Russian pilots were so intensely trained and had such good memories that they were the only foreigners who could be given the instruction book as to how to fly an American bomber at six o'clock of an evening and be able to fly it away alone early the next morning . Mr. Vishinsky was like a highly trained technician . He gave me the impression of being a legal or business representative of a client rather than a man speaking his convictions . He was able but cold , and I rather thought he lacked any personal convictions . When the time approached for someone to speak ( of ' the United States , our delegation was in a veritable dither . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached me and asked if I thought I could say a few words . " The United States must speak in the debate . " he added rather lamely , " and you 're the only one familiar with the subject . " I said meekly that I would do my best , hut , truthfully , the thought of speaking against Mr. Vishinsky made me tremble . I was tense and excited , but I knew that I believed in what I wanted to say , and I did my best . The hour was late and we rather feared that some delegates on our side  --  particularly our South American colleagues  --  might leave before a vote was taken . So , since their presence was essential . I talked about Bolivar and his stand for the freedom of all peoples . The South American delegates stayed with us to the bitter end and we won a victory in the vote on the right of an individual to decide his own fate . Neither this nor any other victory over the Soviet delegation was easy . The Russian tenacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often believe that by never giving ground on any point they can wear down their opponents and win . This approach has nothing to do with reason . I remember , during debate on another subject , when Sen. Tom Connally , of Texas , told our delegation with great firmness , " I have discussed this question for the last time with the Soviet delegate . He has brought it up three times and I will not discuss it again . " " He probably will bring it up at every opportunity , " I remarked mildly . Senator Connally arose to impressive dignity . " In the United States Senate . " he declared , " when debate is finished it is finished . " But this was not the Senate . We were dealing with a different situation and Senator Connally found himself discussing the same subject on several other occasions , regardless of his own desires . At London and elsewhere , I saw a great deal of the Russians over the years and I felt that perhaps Maxim Litvinov , whose wife was English . was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government officials . V.M. Molotov . who was so rigid as foreign minister and who made " Nies ! " such a well-known word at the United Nations , was always correct and polite . hut , although I saw him frequently and sat next to him at dinners , I never felt at was possible to know him well . Andrei Gromyko knew the ways of Westerners far better than he pretended . I had a personal feeling in regard to him because he made a special trip to Hyde Park after Franklin 's death to pay his respects . But even then he never ceased to give me the impression that he was always on guard , and he certainly maintained the Communist practice of never showing any kind of weakness in the presence of Westerners . My secretary , Miss Malvina Thompson , noticed , when we were at luncheon , that Madame Gromyko was not eating anything and inquired whether something was wrong . Madame Gromyko explained that she had ulcers and was forced to confine herself to a soft diet . " I will have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson said . Mr. Gromyko had been talking to me , but he never missed anything . He turned to Miss Thompson and said severely , " My wife is quite capable of eating anything . " For once , however , I did not pay any attention to the Russian stubbornness . I had poached eggs prepared and brought to Madame Gromyko , and she ate them . Despite the difficult attitude of the Russians , I always felt at the United Nations that the American delegates should refuse to be the ones to show unfriendliness . Some of our delegates would refuse to he photographed shaking hands or talking with the Soviet delegates at the beginning of a session , presumably because they felt the Russians were mortal enemies or perhaps because they felt it would do them no good politically in the United States . The Russians , on the other hand , were always very eager on such occasions to be photographed , smiling and shaking hands with our delegates . I knew that ( Coat/weed on Page 60 ) 6o 1 . S T ( Counnunl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographers the Russians would stand up in the General Assembly and say untrue things about America , and that the Russians knew they were saying untrue things . But I fell that our only course was to persist in what we knew was right , in the belief Ow we would eventually get results . I wanted to be firm , but I did not desire to be the one to show hostility and I never hesitated to shake hands with the Russians for the photographers . I recall an amusing incident in Paris when the entire American delegation received an invitation to attend a reception at the Russian embassy on a Soviet national holiday . This was not long before our 1952 elections , and 15%0 members of our delegation who were coming up for re-election to Congress immediately announced that they had no intention of being seen within miles of the Soviet embassy , because so-called " softness " toward Communism was a loudly exploited issue in the election campaign . Then other members of the delegation who were more or less connected with political affairs at home began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another . plan to attend . This situation finally began to look rather embarrassing . even to our two congressmen , because it obviously would be simply rude if none of us attended . " Well , " I said at last , with a smile , " I 'm the only one left , and since I am not running for office and have no intention of running for office . I will attend . I do n't believe anyone will notice or care whether I pay a call at the Soviet embassy . " So I went to the embassy and , being a little early . I was one of the first guests to climb the long stairs and face the reception line . I was greeted very warmly by Ambassador Alexci P. Pavlov , whom I knew well at the United Nations , but who was quite a different-looking figure in the full uniform of a soldier of the Soviet Union , liberally bestrewn with medals . I stayed only a short time , and then explained that I had to get back to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back to my car , but I prevailed upon him to let his aide sec me ceremoniously to the street . I drove away feeling that I had been granted as warm a welcome as anyone ever received there , but that the next day I would doubtless be subjected to a violent Russian tirade at the meeting of Committee 3 to make up for it ! After a good many attempts , I decided that it was really impossible to have a private and frank talk with Russian offi cials . I followed the custom for a number of years of asking small groups of United Nations delegates from different countries to my home for tea or dinner , so that we could informally talk over problems that had arisen at official meetings , This often proved an effective way to clear up misunderstandings that had arisen or to explain the position of our governments , and such off-the-record talks helped us to reach some kind of formal agreement . But not with the Russians . They simply did not dare talk . Once when Ambassador Pavlov and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fterdinner . I also asked a friend who played the piano . They listened in deep silence for a long time while he played the works of various classical composers . including the Russians . When they were ready to leave , I walked to the door with them , but there Mr. Borisov discovered he had forgotten his hat . He returned to the other room to get it , leaving me alone with Ambassador Pavlov . As soon as his companion was out of earshot , Ambassador Pavlov leaned toward me and in an almost conspiratorial whisper said , " Madame . you like the music of Tchaikovsky . So do I. " And that was as close as I ever came to getting a frank and confidential expression of opinion from a Soviet official . During the first United Nations meeting in London I had learned a great deal , including the importance of selecting just the right word or phrase in framing resolutions . At lirst I had been impatient because so many days and weeks were spent haggling over a word or a sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sol Bloom , who was an expert on this subject , lectured me several times about my attitude . " These things are more important than you think . " he said . " Later , when you arc working in a parliamentary body , you will sec how vital the phrasing of a sentence can be in winning or losing a particular point in debate . " I did see later . and was grateful to him for being patient with me . I was also grateful for an incident that occurred as the General Assembly sessions were being concluded in London . I had been at a meeting until after one o'clock in the morning and was wearily walking up the stairs at my hotel when I heard two voices behind me . I turned and saw Senator Vandenberg and Mr. Dulles . I do n't recall now which one spoke to me , but whichever it was , he seemed to be speaking for both . Fr tin , ..... " Mrs. Roosevelt , " he said , " we must tell you that we did all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations . We begged the President not to nominate you . But now that ! , titi are leaving we feel we must acknowledge that we have worked with you gladly and found you good to work with . And we will be happy to do so again. ? I do n't think anything could have made the weariness drop off my shoulders as did those words , I had no idea there would be further work for me alter I returned home from the first session of the General Assembly , but later I received notice that a continuing group working in London had created u committee to set up the Human Rights Commission , naming members as individuals rather than as government representatives . This commission , created by the United Nations Economic and Social Council ( UNESCO ) , met in New York in the spring of 1946 and asked me to serve on what was called the preparation group , of which I was later elected chairman . 1Ve decided that the commission should draft a charter of human rights , the first part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on governments , but expressing the aspirations of peoples for human rights and freedom . This would be supplemented . however , by a covenant or cos cnants that would be legally binding on countries accepting it as a treaty . We also sought to devise rules of implementation that might be invoked against any country that accepted the covenant , but did not live up to it . I think it is worth mentioning here that in those days we did not have an adequate translation system at the United Nations . There was no simultaneous translation , as there is today . I remember that once Rene Cassin. of France . spoke so rapidly that our young-woman translator gave up and finally burst into tears and lied from the room . We waited for her to return and translate the notes she had been taking , but she was gone for good . Since no other translator was available , I finally had to translate the gist of the speech into English for the other delegates . When such methods are compared to the present system at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ! We did , however , make recommendations for the way the Human Rights Commission should function ; and our proposals were accepted by the Economic and Social Council . President Truman then nominated me as representative on the commission and I served both as a delegate in the General Assembly and on the commission until 1953 . Of course . I had able advisers in this work , including Miss Marjorie Whiteman , James P. Hendrick , James Green , James Simsanan , Herzcl Plane , Herbert Bearer and others . One of the first meetings of the commission . over which I presided , was at Genes a early in December , 1947 . I wanted to get home for Christmas . So I laid out a schedule of work and proposed that we put on full steam from the start  --  the way we usually worked at the end of a session  --  in order to be through by eleven P.M. of a certain date , which would give me just enough time to catch my plane home . We did work hard and we probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven P.M. of the specified dale . But as I was walking down the long corridor of the Palais des Nations Unics I was overtaken by the Soviet delegate , Alexander E. Bogomolov , then ambassador to France , whose wife had acted as a translator . " Madame , - he said to me , " I have never worked so hard at any international conference , and my wife is nearly dead of exhaustion . " I expressed regret for the strain on his wife , but I added , " I am pleased , however , that you have discovered that even we delegates from what you call a bourgeois democracy know how to work hard . " Ile laughed heartily and we all headed home for Christo , Very early in our eosin l meetings we discovered that tit would be possible 10 write a Declaration of Human Rights , but that it could not he done in a hurry . We had differences with the Russians , who proposed various amendments that were defeated . But with their usual tenacity they brought up these amendments again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did accept in the second article of the declaration a single word which the Russian delegation proposed be inserted and , so far as I know , that was the only contribution of the Soviet Union to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The work of writing the covenant was far more difficult because we attempted to put into legally binding language concepts of economic and social rights that would be acceptable to , say , both the United States and India . Each of these nations . for example , wanted the best possible article to further education for t he people . but the economic and political conditions were so drastically different in India and America that it wa 's almost impossible to find language that would he acceptable to both . In addition , our delegation had to present an article recognising states* rights , because under our system of government certain things fall to the jurisdiction of Washington and other things to the various states . It was not easy for some other countries to fat understand that they were being asked to Commit all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited number and hope that all the states would follow suit . The Chinese delegate . Dr. P. C . Chang , was a great joy to us because of his humor and his philosophic observations , which often pointed up some of our difficulties . I once tried to speed up an agreement by asking Doctor Chang ; Dr. Charles Malik , of Lebanon ; and Dr. John P. Humphrey , who became permanent head of the Division of Human Rights in the Secretariat , to ( Cu in my apartment to discuss a troublesome point . I was eager to talk business , but the three men became involved in a philosophical discussion that went on and on and led nowhere except to a suggestion by Doctor Chang , who had a twinkle in his cyc. that Doctor Humphrey should make a thorough study of Confucianism and Buddhism before any real progress would be possible . Not being a philosopher , I found myself reduced to listening , which was amusing but unproductive . On another occasion , Ambassador Pavlov was the Soviet representative on the commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled out like a mer and stopping him was well nigh impossible . At that time , the rash accusations which the Russians were making against the United States and Britain were proving a real detriment to our work . Ambassador Pavlov knew this , but toward the end of one week , when we were about to recess , he began speaking again and seemed likely to go on forever . I waited until he had to stop for breath . Then I hanged the gavel so hard that everybody jumped , and before he could continue I got in a few words . " We are here to devise ways of safeguarding human rights , " I said . " We are not here to attack each other 's gownsments and I hope when we let urn Monday the delegate of the Soviet Union will remember that ! " Quickly , before he could resume , I hanged my wise , to end the meeting . This was a fairly effective maneuver and for about a week Ambassador Pavlos 's orations were brief and more to the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft of the declaration and we foolishls belies ed that it would be accepted without much change or argument by the General Assembly in Paris in 1948 . Secretary of State George C. Marshall told me he believed the 1948 session would be remembered as the Human Rights session . Hosseser , it took two months of hard work to overcome last-minute objections by delegates from Islamic countries , who feared the declaration contradicted the Koran , as well as mans others . Then the Soviet representatives protested that the declaration did not emphasize the most important economic and social rights and that it was an Eighteenth-century concept . The Russians abstained , but no vote was cast against the declaration ss hen it was approved on December 10. 1948 . By 1951 I felt the United Stateshad held the chairmanship of the commission long enough and Doctor Malik , of Lebanon , was elected to succeed me . I continued as a member . Our work on the covenant went on , but this was a long , slow pull because it would he legally binding on governments accepting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a meeting of minds on economic and social rights and that it would be best to hate a separate cos enant cos cruse political and civil rights that would be more generally accepted . We did succeed in getting such a separate covenant , but it was not well drafted and neither covenant has ever been accepted by the General Assembly . Nor will it be accepted in its present form . I believe it would be best to start anew by putting into the covenant only a few basic rights on which all could agree and to provide for adding other rights as it becomes possible to have them accepted . The last session of the Assembly I attended as a delegate was in Paris . Toward the end , early in 1953 , Ambassador Warren Austin , the head of our delegation , became ill and for a short time I presided over the delegation . In the concluding sessions , an effort was made to get France to allow discussion in the Assembly ofconditions in Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria . The French insisted this was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , although some of us wondered whether human rights could ever be called a domestic issue . Then there appeared an American Negro , backed by both Communist and non-Communist groups in the United States , who demanded discussion in the Assembly of a charge of genocide against the United States because of lynchings in our country . We decided not to oppose the proposal , but it turned out that it was too late to get the charge on the agenda . Nevertheless , the Soviet delegates brought up the charge in Committee 3 and Ambassador Pavlov was so carried away by his own oratory that he declared " the United States cares so little about its workers that at this very minute they are dying of hunger in the streets of Los Angeles by the hundreds of thousands . " I replied vigorously that he knew this was untrue and that I would get affidavits from workers in Los Angeles proving it was untrue . Then a young Ukrainian said that , while I denied workers were dying thc streets of Los Angeles , the thing I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hovels and dying intheir hovels " by hundreds of thousands . " The workers of Los Angeles , " I replied , " will not like having their homes culled hovels . " I felt no white person could adequately answer this kind of attack , because it stemmed from the charge of lynchings of Negroes . But later Dr. Channing Tobias , of our delegation , delivered an honest and line explanation of the racial problem in the United States and of our efforts to remedy inequalities among our citizens . This was nearly the end of my work for the United Nations , because it is customary for all delegates to resign at the end of every session to give the President a free hand in naming a new delegation . In the 1952 elections , the Republicans had come into power and all of us who were Democrats knew that our services had come to an end . I volunteered , however , to work with the American Association for the United Nations , because I did not want to be out of touch with the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together the peoples of the world in a program to maintain peace .
