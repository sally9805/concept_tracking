BUOYANT BILLIONS , FARFETCHED FABLES &; SHAKES VERSUS SHAV ( 138 pp. ) - George Bernard Shaw-Dodd , Mead ( $3 ) . <P> The U.S. public was invited to a remarkable but somewhat melancholy show - the farewell appearance of the Daring Old Man on the Flying Trapeze , the one &; only George Bernard Shaw , performing without a net ( also juggling , card tricks , and monologues for all occasions ) . <P> Once , Shaw used to fly through the air with the greatest of ease , from drama to politics and back , followed by the spotlight he loved and accompanied by the rolling drums of Shavian wit-which sometimes would be mistaken for the thunder of truth . But in his last three plays , now published in the U.S.-Buoyant Billions , Farfetched Fables , Shakes Versus Shav-the great performer , by 93 , was plainly coming to the end of his long career under the Big Top . <P> Buoyant Billions is a rambling charade about a young world-betterer who ends up bettering only himself by marrying a rich man 's daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alligators and snakes by playing a saxophone , could have been a great Shaw character had she occurred to the master half a century earlier . The father has been a great Shaw character already-he is a reincarnation of the jovial merchant of death , Andrew Undershaft in Major Barbara , with less wit and more money ( he is a billionaire instead of a millionaire ) . Most of the famed Shavian paradoxes have been reduced to formula ; they sound as if they had been turned out by one of Harvard 's giant calculators after it had digested the properly punched slips . The play 's major morals : 1 ) there is nothing wrong with marrying for money , 2 ) poor people are as tiresome as rich people , 3 ) all men thirst for God , whether he be called God or Hoochlipoochli . <P> Farfetched Fables , which reads like an outline of another Back to Methuselah , is Shaw 's idea of what will happen after the world 's present civilization is destroyed-not by the atom bomb ( which Shaw thought would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned poison gas . As Shaw saw it , men will go onward &; upward until they learn how to live on air , to get the same sensual pleasure from the pursuit of pure knowledge which their gross fathers got from the pursuit of other things , and finally to take leave of their bodies , becoming a species of intellectual angels . Then , a new race will develop , remarkably like the old , all set to start the whole business over again . <P> In Fables , Shaw has pulled himself together to add one more preface to his long and brilliant stock . It is entertaining , but not too entertaining to obscure the fact that perhaps the only things Shaw consistently believed in were himself and that lean deity , Creative Evolution , a sort of mixture of Lilith and Mrs. Sidney Webb . Apart from that he never made a joke which he did not sooner or later pass off as truth , and never stated a truth that he did not eventually turn into a joke . <P> It was a terribly lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience were not apt to notice it , because they , like Shaw , always had a wonderful time .
