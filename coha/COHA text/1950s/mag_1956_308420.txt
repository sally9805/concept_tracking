" Something extraordinarily promising has happened to the theater in Canada , " wrote Critic Walter Kerr in New York 's Herald Tribune . What particularly excited the admiration of Critic Kerr and the audiences was the adroit use of both French and English-speaking actors in this year 's Shakespearean Festival at Stratford , Ont . Players drawn from bilingual Canada 's two major language groups , acting in the plays of Shakespeare and Molire , are onstage together for the first time in a unique theatrical bill that reflects the nation 's dual cultural origins . <P> In its fourth season the Stratford Festival has a new director , Michael Langham , 36 , of London 's Old Vic , who took over early this year from Director Tyrone Guthrie . Guthrie and other founders of the festival , fearing that Canadian cultural development was being overwhelmed by U.S. influences , * hoped to make Stratford a distinctively Canadian theater . But new Director Langham detected a flaw in their approach : How could Canada claim Stratford as a national theater unless the country 's French-speaking population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on this year 's program , afforded an opportunity to experiment . Canadian-born Actor Christopher Plummer , who had a Broadway triumph as the Earl of Warwick in The Lark ( TIME , Nov. 28 , 1955 ) , was cast in the title role . Opposite him , as the French King Charles VI , Langham put Gratien Glinas , the ranking clown of French-Canadian musical revues . Members of Montreal 's theatrical corps , schooled in the French acting tradition , were brought to Stratford to people the French scenes . The play was a solid hit , with Shakespeare 's French and English contrasts made twice as vivid as a one-language company could play them . The effect in the battle scenes , one critic noted , " was of whole armies feeling their way toward battle with radically different sets of nerves . " <P> Last week , it was the French Canadians ' turn to take top billing . Twelve players from Montreal 's Thtre du Nouveau Monde turned in crackling , rapid-fire performances of three Molire one-act plays . Most of their audience was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they romped through the Molire farces got the meaning across . The addition of the French plays and French style to the Stratford program was hailed not only as a theatrical coup , but also as a rare illustration of Canada 's dual culture . <P> " A fresh festival hit , " cheered the Montreal Star , " and , probably more important , a significant step forward in intercultural understanding . " <P> <P> *Such fears are not widely shared in Canada . A Gallup poll last week showed that only 27% of Canadian adults believe that U.S. cultural influence is too strong in Canada .
