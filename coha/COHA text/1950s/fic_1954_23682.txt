The True Confessions of Henry Pell A Story by John Cheever Drawings by Edward Sprague Janes M Y NAME is Henry Pell and I live in Remsen Manor . Remsen Manor is a colony of four hundred and seventy-four identical houses on the north shore of Long Island , hounded on the south by a parkway and on the north by the high brick wall of one of the last estates to remain in a neighborhood that I imagine was once occupied mostly by parks and manors . ( When I spaded up the backyard for a garden I uncovered a jar for p ( im de foie gran , a rotted tennis sneaker , and some smoked glasses ; but so much for these old bones . ) We own the house we live in although we think of it as a temporary ownership and there is always at the back of my mind the image of a more spacious house and a more romantic landscape . The firm I work for has offices in all the larger cities and before we moved to Remsen Manor my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bloomington and Tacoma . We moved to Remsen Manor in the spring , bought a furnished house , and occupied it happily  --  or so it seemed to me . We were surrounded in general by open-minded and sympathetic people and we made friends , joined some community projects , planted a garden , and cooked hamburgers in the back yard when the days were long . What is wrong with places like Remsen Manor has been stated often enough , and my aim was to discover and use what was right in such a development . It was unbeautiful certainly , but it answered all our immediate needs and some day we would move into a house with a broader view . Our neighbors and their ideasof entertaining were not exactly what we were used to but they were all good-hearted people and there was nothing really wrong with Remsen Manor excepting that it made my wife unhappy . To tell the truth , we are poor and have been poor ever since our marriage . The down payment on the house took all our savings and the financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tacoma , so we had less money than before . We are the kind of people who eat eggs for breakfast once a week and think of a half-day cleaning woman as a luxury . Lucille carries home the milk from the supermarket to save the price of delivery and she does most of the washing and ironing for the family . We have always felt , like most people who are young and poor , that our circumstances were about to change . When I was transferred from the Tacoma offices to New York a half-promise of advancement was made , but business was slow that summer and the promotion never came through . The promise was made again at Christmas and broken in March . I was disappointed , of course , but it seems that Lucille felt this more than I. My wife is a beautiful woman  --  I think  --  and our marriage up to that point had been a changeable and a hot-blooded relationship with some humor in it , much understanding , lust , mutual respect , and the flow around us of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accounted for , I know ; they seem susceptible to weathers of considerable violence that we , although we lie beside them , do not feel at all . I have never known a woman who could he called transparent and I have never worried much about motivations , but in Lucille 's case I could see plainly enough that her faith in my ability to improve our circumstances was weakening . She is a young woman who went . to school in Fiesole and graduated from Smith , but in Bloomington and Tacoma she had been competent at patching up the disparities between her education and her married life . She seemed to fail at this on our second spring in Remsen Manor . Culturally , the development had the atmosphere of a parking lot and I think that the architectural monotony that we looked out onto from every window depressed Lucille and weakened her ability to imagine opportunities and changes . At the same time the dark , Lenten rains had begun to fall and our ranch house smelled of wet plaster  --  a clammy pungency that reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to the theater , I remember , one Friday night in March or April . I had tickets for a revue , but the revue was n't much good or we were n't in the mood for it . At the intermission we put on our coats and left the theater . I took Lucille from there to a bar , trying to breathe some fire into the evening but she was quiet and sad . I kept hoping that something would save the evening and because of my stubborn hopefulness we missed the 12:18 and had to go home on the most harrowing of the locals . On the trip I put my arm around Lucil &,; but she drew away from me . Then  --  as we were approaching Hempstead  --  she began to weep . I tried to speak to her  --  to touch her  --  but she resisted . When we got off the train at Remsen Manor the cab-stand was empty and the last bus had gone . We started to walk home in a peculiar formation  --  single-file . She did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her high heels and I brought up the rear , resignedly . We must have walked like this for nearly half an hour . Finally she stopped at a corner and waited for me to catch up . I had not been looking where we were going and I did n't understand her hesitation . Then I saw that we were lost . The most sensible thing to do , perhaps , would have been to go back toward the station and make a fresh start but I heard , or thought I heard , the noise of traffic on the parkway . It was a good bearing and I reasoned that if we went due south we would be bound to come into our own neighborhood . I took the lead then and Lucille followed . My hunch seemed to be right because after another fifteen minutes of walking I saw the lights of our house . I opened the door and Lucille went ahead of me into the living-room . I remember the first thing she did was to take off her shoes . I looked around for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucille went over to the fireplace and straightened the picture on the wallPicasso 's " Woman in White . " It was that idle moment of home-coming when your attention seems to wander before you pour yourself a glass of milk , look at the children , and undress for bed . Then I noticed a note on the table and , assuming it was from the baby-sitter , I started to read : " Dear Joe , I 've taken the children and gone back to Denver and please , please , please do n't try to follow me again . If you follow me so help me God I 'll do something awful to myself or the kids . . . . " Lucille glanced at the note over my shoulder and we both saw , at the same instant , that we were in the wrong house . She stepped back into her shoes and put on her coat . Neither of us spoke . We let ourselves out and closed the door quietly and continued our lonely walk home . T HE next day I remember was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky when I returned from work . The children met me at the door and I went into the kitchen , looking for Lucille , but the kitchen was empty . I found her in our bedroom , sitting by the window . She was reading poetry and I think she had been crying . I did n't understand . I lifted the book out of her hands . " When like a running grave time tracks you down , " I read . I gave the book back to her and spoke with bad feeling , for it seemed to me to have been a long time since there had been much tenderness between us . " Do you have any plans for supper ? " I asked . " I 'm hungry . " She did n't reply . " What 's the matter Lucille , " I said , " what in hell 's the matter ? " " I do n't like this life , " she said . " What did you say ? " I asked . It was only spitefulness that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , and spitefulness , I guess , that made her answer . " Nothing , " she said . " You came in on this with me , " I said , skipping my claim not to have heard her . I knew that she was expressing her loss of faith in me as a provider  --  a loss of faith that seemed deepened by the dismal view outside the window . Her lack of spirit made me angry and I spoke with absolutely no restraint ; I was bellowing . " Now look , " I said , " I 've worked a hard day and a long day and I do n't have the patience to be met with sighs and tears . I know that you think you have a hard life , but I think you exaggerate your lot . Just because you went to school in Fiesole does n't mean that you do n't have to adjust yourself , the way the rest of us do . You have a loving husband , two beautiful children , a good house , and plenty of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - you , but you do n't have to put oatmeal in the hamburger . There are many women who would give a lot for what you have . Here you sit languishing  --  here you sit pining like a maiden in a stone tower . The Rapunzel of Remsen Manor . I do n't have the stomach or the patience for ittonight . " I gave the door a good bang on my way out . I went to the kitchen . In the icebox I found some kind of big fish and I put this into the oven . My daughters came into the kitchen to help and I love my daughters , but even this love seemed shadowed . When the fish was cooked I called to Lucille but she did n't reply . I ate at the kitchen table with the children and when supper was finished they put on their bathing suits and we went into the back yard where / turned the hose on them . We do this almost every fine evening in the spring and summer . The air rang to their sweet voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it made me sad the way that your sadness can be deepened by hearing distant dance music and cheerful talk when you 're in no mood for these things . I watered the children until their lips were blue , washed the grass off their feet , and gave them a parting shot as they went toward the back door . Then I got them to bed , kissed them good night , and closed the door . In the hallway I seemed to feel the stillness of a foundering romance settle over the house . I went out into the back yard . I WAS discouraged then and I needed hope and patience badly . I could whistle for patience , I could wreathe my face in a smile , I could speak in a loud and a cheerful voice but what was the point of all this if my heart felt black ? For almost the first time in my life I felt lost , miserable , and tired . I would have been able to like Remsen Manor if Lucille had helped me , but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , the backs of the indenHeal houses , curving away from me into the distance , looked like the spit and image of hell . I felt like a fight , but there was nothing to punch but the clothes on the line and I started walking . I strode around MacArthur Circle , but Remsen Manor is not much of . a place to walk in . It has no real thoroughfares and the streets only lead deeper and deeper into the belt of residences . Night was falling then and the air was full of idiotic music . God how I hated the place that night ! The atmosphere seemed barbarous , genteel , and insane : a breeding place for all the hideous tragedies of vulgarity . I walked on  --  I broke into a run now and then  --  out beyond the houses to a place where new roads and sewers were being excavated for an addition to Remsen Manor to be called Remscn Park . Then I saw the brick wall of the last remaining estate in the neighborhood . This cheered me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was about fifteen feet high and posted at regular intervals with the threats and warnings of the Pinkerton Agency . I interpreted the height of the wall and the threats and warnings as a sterling challenge . The mortar had loosened here and there in the brick and I got a handhold and a foothold and began to climb . I fell twice but my reason seemed to depend on my ascent and I finally got a grip on the top , pulled myself up , and swung over . Then I fell . I FOUND myself in a garden , as you might expect . The lawn was like a cloth . There were dark trees and white statues and urns full of flowers  --  petunias , I think . It was all spread around a long marble pool , fed by a fountain . The arrangement of statues and urns and water reminded me of an old theatrical backdrop  --  a threadbare vision of wealth and peace that I had seen somewhere . Only the peacocks were missing . With a brick wall between myself and the troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The atmosphere was of sanctuary and had in it too something of the past for the garden was clearly dated  --  the urns and the statue of Venus with a dolphin all belonged to the turn of the century . " Who are you and how did you get in ? " a woman asked . I saw her kneeling at the end of the pool . " I came over the wall , " I said cheerfully . " Thank God , " she said . " I thought it was from the house . Well since you 're can help me. " up the walk to the pool . It was dark around us then , but the sheet of water held the summer twilight , and this reflected light and the sounds of the fountain let me approach the stranger with a feeling of perfect familiarity and affection . I saw what I thought . was a young woman  --  a dark blonde  --  whose hair was cut in such a way that it fell across her cheeks when she bent her head . Her voice sounded very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I was happy to hear this sweetness varied with the charming notes of maturity . She looked tip as I approached . Her arms and shoulders were bare . " What 's your name ? " " Henry Pell . " " We have a dreadful time with trespassers , " she said reflectively , and I ought to make you go away , but you wo n't come back , bringing a lot of Friends with you , will you ? " " No . Honor bright . " " Well then you can help , " she said . " You can open the cans and I 'll empty them . It may seem like a foolish waste of time to you , but it 's Mother 's idea and the poor soul has so little fun these days that I do n't feel T can refuse her anything . " 1 sat at her side and saw what she was doing . Near her were two cartons  --  forty-eight cans  --  of concentrated alphabet soup . She was emptying the soup into the pool by the fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the cans and hand them to her . She rinsed the empty cans in the pool and returned them to the carton . There was nothing straitened or peculiar about her in spite of her peculiar occupation . " Dad 's a snob , " she explained , " and he has someone at the house he 's anxious to impress . He 's terribly proud of his pool and they 'll go for a dip in the morning and Mother thought it would be marvelous if they found themselves wallowing around in alphabet soup . He 'll be wild . " The work of opening the cans went quicker than the work of emptying them and when I had finished she asked me to make her a drink . " Everything 's there , " she said , nodding over her shoulder to an arcade at the back of the pool . " Make yourself one . I drank too much before dinner and I may just as well continue . I am going to stop smoking , " she said , putting out her cigarette . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tonics . She had finished her work when I returned and was standing at the edge of the pool with her hands clasped in front of her . " Is n't it divine ? " she asked . " I can hardly wait until morning . " She took her drink and walked to the edge of the pool where there were some long chairs . Her shoes were silver and she seemed to he dressed for a party . " Oh dear , " she said suddenly , " I suppose you wanted to go swimming and now I 've spoiled your swim . " Self-reproach overtook her as it will a young girl . " You did want to go swimming , did n't you ? Most of the people who climb the wall do . It 's very dangerous . George , the head gardener , shoots at trespassers with a crow gun . Well you can go swimming some other night . I 'll make George take his wife to the movies and you can climb the wall and go swimming but you must n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a long chair close beside her . My spirits were soaring . " This is so pleasant , " she said . " I had expected to spend the evening alone . I 'm Nancy Pleyel . I used to be Nancy Martin but I got a divorce last month and now I 'm Nancy Pleyel again . " Without mentioning Lucille I told her about myself . I have never seen an attention that was so easily engaged . When I told her that my feelings about Remsen Manor had driven me to climb the wall , tears came to her eyes . " Oh , I know how dreary it must be , " she said tenderly . " I 've seen it from the parkway . Mother ca n't stand to have it mentioned . She meant to buy the land , you know , but her agent forgot all about it and when we came hack in the fall the houses had all been built . She wo n't let the maids shop or go to the movies there . But this is so cozy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have another drink and I must stop smoking . " E TALKED and drank a lot  --  i remember opening a second bottle of gin . I had no intention of going until I was asked to go . Nancy seemed prepared to stay up all night and I do n't think she was the kind of girl who worried much about the passage of time . Her grandfather had built the estate , she told me ; she had been born there and in her childhood Remsen Manor and Remsen Park had been estates belonging to her aunts and uncles . When she spoke of her family she made the alphabet soup in the swimming pool seem like the mildest kind of joke . All her friends and connections seemed to be occupied with high jinks . It was my idea , early in the morning , that we go swimming after all . It was her idea  --  I say this in her defense  --  that we turn off the lights that illuminated the water . The only thing questionable in what she did was the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . She was not a tramp  --  it seemed to me that there was sweetness and innocence in her hones . At four in the morning she took my arm and walked me back to the wall . Her light breathing , her light step , the darkness and the lightness in her hair and her voice made me feel like a lion and I mounted the high wall with great agility . ? " You 'll come back tomorrow night , wo n't you , " she called . " At about eight then ? I 'll keep George occupied and put up a ladder . Good night , good night . " All the windows of Remsen Manor were dark when I walked home and it seemed to me not only to be a sleeping but a dreamless community . No dogs barked at the sound of my footsteps  --  there were no dogs in Remsen Manor , no trees to speak of , and no song birds . But I felt less loathing for the place then than I did compassion for all of us who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched out such uniform and ugly boxes . My own windows were dark . Lucille slept . I took a shower to wash the alphabets out of my hair and smiled tenderly as I watched them go down the drain because they refreshed my sense of the reality of what had happened . I stretched out in bed feeling strong and kindly  --  even toward Remsen Manor , for I was indebted to the fluidness of a world whose housing developments mushroomed around the parks of old millionaires where the golden apples grow . M Y GOOD memories of that night took me through a day of office politics so dense and frustrating that it is still remembered and talked about . The vice president in charge of merchandising had set a trap for the advertising manager and the atmosphere was like the atmosphere that surrounds the fall of a Balkan cabinet . None of this could touch my happiness or dim my memories and I came through that tiring day as if I had spent it swimming in the sea . On the commuting train I looked at my neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad that none of them had climbed the wall before me , but I pitied them for their bad luck . When I got home the children ran to me and I kissed them tenderly . I hardly looked at Lucille because I was afraid she might have picked that evening to refresh her faith in my abilities and amend our affairs . I had left a good part of myself on the other side of the Pleyels ' wall and I had at least to go over there and collect it . " I 'll eat later , " I told her . " I 'm going to take a walk . . . . " / changed my shirt and left the house . The squalor of Remsen Manor could n't touch me . I hardly heard the strains of idiotic music . Sonic boys were playing ball by the excavation arid one of them shouted to me as I started to climb the wall : " Do n't goover there , Mister , they 'll get the cops after you . You better not go in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the wall I saw that she had placed a ladder against it and I climbed down . S HE was waiting in the garden and she turned quickly and went to inc to be kissed . She took my arm and walked with me to the arcade . " Let 's have a drink , " she said , " and then we 'll go up to the house . I want you to meet Mother and Dad . Dad may be able to get you a job and then you can get rich and leave Remsen Manor . I 've told them you 're a friend of Brother 's . Brother lives in Texas . When Mother asks you if you 're related to anyone  --  and she will ? say yes . Say that he 's your uncle . Say that he 's abroad . You understand , do n't you ? Oh I knew you would , I 'm sure that Dad will get you a job  --  you 're so intelligent . You 're the most intelligent man I 've ever met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lawn was broad and at the bottom of it I could see the ocean . I was enraptured by the space , the quiet , the company of the dark blonde on my arm , and the color of the sea . We entered some glass doors into a large hall , lined with marble columns . In the distance I saw a man and an old woman in a wheel chair , bent over a backgammon hoard . Another man stood near them We approached the group and Nancy introduced me to her mother . " How do you do , " the old lady muttered rudely . She did n't even raise her head . " Are you related to Charlie Pell ? " " He 's my uncle , " I said . " Really . " She raised her head then and gazed at me admiringly . She seemed to welcome me cordially to her friendship . She groped with her right hand for a considerable length of time among the layers of gold lace that covered her bosom . Filially her hand emerged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her front . This exhibition of beads seemed to be a gesture of confidence . " That 's the Count d'Alba , " she said , pointing to her opponent . " How do you do , " the count said . " And this is Daddy , " Nancy said . " Yes , yes , " her father said . " Nancy tells me that you want to get rich quick . Well you ca n't even get rich slowly these days . " Mr. Pleyel laughed at his own joke . He had a stubborn , cheerful , and u ncomprehend ing air . " There is n't a man in the United States who could afford to build a hall like this today , " he said . " The stone come from Massa . " He rapped one of the pillars . " Solid . " " Double sixes , " the count said . " That looks to me like a five and a six , " the old lady said . " I 'm sorry , " the count said wistfully . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleyel said . " Your uncle wanted to marry mc , " the old lady said . " Oh I was beautiful ! I had the most beautiful nose . The bridge of it fell during the twenties . It simply collapsed . I 've no idea what went wrong . Where 's Charlie Pell now ? " " He 's abroad , " I said . " Why . do n't you take your young gentle-man down and show him the pool ? " Mr. Pleyel said . " Oh I will , " Nancy said . She took my arm . " The pool is very interesting , " Mr. Pleyel said . " The stone was quarried in Saint Vicenzo . It 's solid . " " Now I owe you four hundred and thirty-dollars , " the count said . " Let me see those figures , " the old lady said crossly . Nancy and I walked back through the garden . " You poor kid , " I said , meaning to express my sympathy to her for being related to the caricatures in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She seemed to sing . " I think they 're simply marvelous . " It was her tact and suppleness that overcame thiS misunderstanding . " It 's probably because you do n't know them that they seem odd , " she said . " After all you only saw them for a minute . " W E HAD returned to the lawn that sur- rounded the pool and to the noise of water . Loved and loving and encircled by space , I seemed to have come into a kind of paradise . The warm ' sun raked the full length of the lawn with light but the air had already begun to smell of the clamps in the trees . The sound of someone playing the piano came down from the house . It was an old musical comedy song about the tribulations of love and Nancy explained that the count was playing . " He was playing the piano in a saloon when Mother picked him up . " The seaward sky was dark  --  the marble gods and goddesses gleamed as the dark clouds rose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we went into the arcade where the thin roof only magnified the noise of the rain and leaked here and there and seemed to mc to have some bearing on love as if the plain fact of a leaky roof in a storm belonged to my romance . The rain passed over and when we went swimming we found that it had softened the water . I went away at twelve and she walked with me to t he ladder . " 1 wo n't be able to see you tomorrow night , " she said . " A friend of Brother 's is corning East and I have to entertain him . . . . " This made me uneasy since I was a friend of Brother 's and how could I tell that the newcomer was n't an impostOr like myself . I protested but it did not take much to change her mind . " Well for a little while then , " she said . " I 'll meet you at eight . " I kissed her good night and climbed the wall . W 11F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have been correct . At least Lucille had on a pretty dress and the children were scrubbed and the smells from the kitchen were appetizing , but I was too anxious to get to the Pleyels to feel a pang of guilt . I got over the wall at eight and climbed down the ladder . The garden was empty . I looked for her on all the walks and in the arcade . Then I sat by the edge of the pool , waiting for her to come . Alone , the noise of the fountain sounded mournful to me . The sky blazed with color ; . a few birds sang . It was nearly dark when I heard her light step on the walk . She ran to me and when I took her in my arms she began to cry . Her crying aroused in me the strongest sense of anger and I wanted to bash in the nose of whoever it was who had hurt her feelings . " It 's poor Mother , " she said . " Poor Mother 's so upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart to see her troubled . It 's all because of the Count d'Alha . She won some money from him and he paid her with a bad check . She called the police  --  she felt that she had to  --  and now he 's in jail . It made her so sad . It 's the sort of thing she hates . And Brother 's friend came in the middle of all the trouble and now I have to go back and entertain him . But I 'll meet you tomorrow night . 1 ' 11 shake Brother 's friend . " She put a hand on my arm and smiled . " Now 1 have to fly . " This encounter left me feeling frustrated and impatient and I went to the garden early on the next night . I did not go home at all . The place was empty when I climbed clown the ladder , but someone had recently been swimming in the pool . The curb was wet and there were some towels thrown over the balustrade . I waited patiently , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talk and laughter . Then , at a little before dark , I saw two men coming over the grass . They were hatless and in their shirt-sleeves and one of them wore at his belt a pistol and a large watchman 's key on a chain . They came directly up to me . " Get out , " they said . " I 'm waiting for Miss Pleyel . " " We know , " the man with the pistol said . " She 's the one who told us . Now get the hell out or you 'll spend the night in the Port Washington jail and get a fifty-dollar fine for trespassing . " I GOT to my feet and started moving to-ward the wall with the men on either side of me . When I looked back at my sanctuary they hurried me along and when I had climbed the ladder they removed it . Then they turned their backs . on me and disappeared up a path and I sat on the top of the wall for a last look at my garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sounding down the path . " Not so fast , not so fast , Manfred , " she cried . " You 'll make me spill my cocktail ! " She came into view . Her chair was being pushed by a fat little man with yellow hair . Nancy and a stranger followed . Nancy clung to the stranger 's arm with a suppleness that I had often admired , but T saw for the first time that she was not young . She was a well-preserved woman of perhaps forty . " So you 're Peter Parson 's nephew , are you ? " ; he old lady asked . " Yes , " the stranger said . " Where is Peter now ? " the old lady asked . " He 's abroad , " the stranger said . " He wanted to marry me , " the old lady said . " Oh I was beautiful . I had the most beautiful nose . .. . " " I must stop smoking , " Nancy said , tossing her cigarette onto the grass . Mr. Pleyel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adonis with his knuckles . " Solid Carrara , " he said . The procession moved out of sight . When their voices had faded some crows flew down from some trees at the edge of the garden and began to hunt in the grass , talking with other crows . Their loud , harsh cries seemed to create space and to sound the particular notes that I needed for my parting with the Plcycls . Some early yellow leaves fell diagonally across the air onto the water and the wind blew the fountain spray this way and that on the stone . Then I turned , climbed down the wall into the excavation for Remsen Park , and walked home . It was a home-coming in the fullest sense of the word , for while I might seem unworthy , my return was waited with some anxiety and much tenderness . Lucille sat with me in the kitchen while I ate my supper , and I could see that she was prepared again to believe any promises that I made , and I made her quite a few . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip on a boat ; we would have a house some day with a staircase and a view . I was grateful for my memories of the Pleyels , for they had kept my feelings occupied and my senses open when the situation might have been otherwise . T owe something to the Pleyels for the fact that we have been happy and contented ever since ; all of us , since I read in the paper last week that Nancy %vas married for the fourth time . And so good friends and travelers , forbear to damn the crumbling walls of old estates and the flat roofs of Remsen Manor when you see them from the parkway . All is well .
