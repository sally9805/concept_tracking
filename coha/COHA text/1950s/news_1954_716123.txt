txt PRESIDENT RISENEEOWER : " Officials in the Executive Branch will have my unqualified support in insisting that witnesses * * be treated fairly ! ' DEFENSE SECRETARY WILSON : " The idea that the Army is coddling Communists is just damned tommyrot . We have been fighting them in Bores . " Harris &; Ewing , The Nevi , York Times ( By George Tames ) SENATOR M'CARTITY : " If a stupid , arrogant or witless man in a , position of power * * is found aiding the Communist party , he will be exposed . " Battle Goes On McCarthy vs . Eisenhower The warfare between Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and the Administration last week turned largely on three press . conferences . The conferences were held by : President Eisenhower . The President held his conference Wednesday morning in the high , ornate Indian Treaty Room of the Old State Department building across the street from the White House . The room was jammed with 256 reporters , the largest turnout ever for an Eisenhower conference . The President came forewarned and forearmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " ultimate responsibility " for the Executive Branch , of Congress as the mirror of " America 's convictions and beliefs . " He did not mention the name . McCarthy . But his statement was regarded as a declaration of White House intention . to intervene directly if Senator McCarthy again dealt with an executive department witness as he had with Gen. Ralph W. Zwicker , Camp Kilmer commandant , in the Peress case . Senator McCarthy . The Senator held his conference less than two hours later before TV cameras in Room 155 of the Senate Office Building . His statement was only 250 words long ; evidently it had been written in advance in anticipation of a stronger blast from the White House . He spoke a " this silly tempest , " of " certain Army brass , " of " stupid , arrogant or witless " witnesses . His statement was regarded as a sharp reminder that the Senator had , for the moment at least , no intention of changing his ways because they displeased the President . Secretary of Defense Wilson . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was his first opportunity to comment on the controversy , which started while he was vacationing in Florida . Repeatedly reporters sought to get him to comment on the Senator 's charges that the Army had been " coddling Communists . " Finally , the Secretary said that idea was " damned tommyrot . " Despite that phrase , Mr. Wilson 's general attitude of caution was regarded as a symptom of the reluctance of many Republicans to throw down the gage to Mr. McCarthy now . At the week-end it was plain that a frontal collision was yet to come . The Eisenhower and Wilson statements emphasized the Administration 's aversion to bringing the controversy to a decisive showdown . At the same time Mr. McCarthy seemed determined to force the issue without let-up . Accordingly there were in prospect further tests  --  tests of the Republican party 's capacity to close the wide breach in its own ranks , and tests of the President 's capacity to assert leadership in the party and the nation in an election year . The Controversy All week long Senator McCarthy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the narrowest sense , the issue was the Senator 's treatment of Government witnesses . The question had arisen over the case of . Maj. Irving Peress , dental officer at Camp Kilmer , N. J. , and an alleged Communist , who had been honorably discharged . ? Genera/ Zwicker had drawn the Senator 's ire by refusing to answer questions on the Peress case . The issue had been muddied when Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens at first put his back up and ordered General Zwicker not to appear before the committee again , and then retreated . Nor had it been settled when the President finally supported Mr. Stevens ' stand against the " browbeating " of Army officers . Despite Senator McCarthy 's insistence that he would pursue his investigations regardless of " embarrassment " to the Administration , White Rouse officials were hoping last week-end that the controversy would simmer down . These hopes were short-lived . On Monday the Senator began hitting at the Army again . He called two witnesses before his committee  --  one of them had been discharged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long since recanted ; the other was still in the Army , even though he had pleaded the Fifth Amendment . Conflict Over ' ' ' . On the same day the opportunity arose for a possible new attack by the Senator on the State Department over Scott , an old friend of McCarthy , who has been for the past year in charge of State Department security and personnel , two functions that were formerly separate . When he took the job , Mr. insisted they be combined . The department has been unhappy over the arrangement , holding that it put Mr. in the position of both policeman and judge ? he supervised loyalty investigations and determined whether employes should be fired . Monday the State Department announced that Mr. would henceforth have control only of security matters . Senator McCarthy said : " Every lover of the old Acheson regime " ? has been using Scotty as a whipping boy . " He announced that he had written to Secretary Dulles for an explanation . As the Senator went on the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , National Republican Chairman Leonard W. Hall , who recently called Senator McCarthy a Republican " asset , " came out of a conference with the President and said the Senator was hurting the party . The President 's Statement When reporters asked James C. Hagerty , the White House press secretary , what the President had said to Mr. Hall , the answer was to wait until the next day 's press conference . Upon learning that the President was preparing a statement , Senator McCarthy let the news agencies know that he would have a reply , Thus was the stage set for the press conferences that kept the McCarthy-Administration feud aboil . In the super-heated atmosphere of Washington , expectation was running high Wednesday morning and reporters were queuing up a half hour before the President arrived . After the build-up the reporters found the President 's statment not as hard-hitting as ' they had expected . Some called it " turning the other cheek . " He began by conceding the Army 's errors in the Peress case and said corrective measures were being taken . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing communism we must use methods conforming to " the American sense of justice and fair play . " Senator McCarthy 's reply was in marked contrast to the President 's tone . He said that further exchanges were a " pointless waste of time , " and that he would spend his time " in the continued exposure of those who are dedicated to the Communist enslavement of the world . " In his TV statement , he said , " Apparently the President and I now agree on the necessity of getting rid of Communists . We apparently dis : agree only on how we should handle those who protect Communists . " Later he deleted the " now . " Attack and Counter-AttackThe contrast between the two statements was most sharply pointed up on the question of treatment of witnesses : THE PRESIDENT : " s ? ? every governmental employe * " is expected to respond cheerfully and completely to requests of the Congress * * * . In doing so , " * they should be accorded ? ? * respect and courtesy * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Congress to assume the primary responsibility for fair conduct . SENATOR MCCARTHY : " If a stupid , arrogant or witless man in a position of power appears before our committee and is found aiding the Community party , he will be exposed . The fact that he might be a general places him in no special class * * * . " In his conference Thursday , Secretary Wilson was alternately soft and tough as the reporters sent volleys of questions , At first he seemed critical of the Army . Peress should not have been commissioned ; the case had been handled badly . Secretary Stevens was " technically responsible because he is the boss , " but he " would n't think " Stevens was going to resign . The Communist problem was small in the Services , and the Defense Department could take care of it . He said the whole question was being studied because the law now does not exempt a Cornmunist from service . . Then , in re-. sponse to a question Whether Senator McCarthy 's methods had been harmful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The idea that the Army is coddling Communists is just damned tommyrot . " During Mr. Wilson 's conference , the McCarthy committee was examining a doctor , Marvin S. Belsky , who had been denied a commission . and inducted as a'private . Private Belsky thirty times invoked the Fifth Amendment before the committee . When Senator McCarthy came out of the hearing and was informed of Mr. Wilson 's statement , he grinned and said the Secretary should read the committee records . On Friday John F. Kane , an assistant to Secretary Stevens , resigned . He gave health as one reason , but said he would have stayed if the Secretary had been backed up . Yesterday the White House announced . that ' Under Secretary of Defense Roger M. Kyes would resign May 1 . The White House said that his resignation had no connection with the McCarthy dispute . The Balance Sheet Where do the Senator and the President stand after three weeks that have had the country by the ears ? As for Senator McCarthy , the feeling is that he has scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly that it . handled the Peress case badly and that the procedures in such cases ( though some of them are set by Congress ) need overhauling . On the other hand , only his most devoted following are thought to accept his charge that the Army is protecting Communists . In some quarters there is a belief that he has overreached himself with his treatment- of General Zwicker and his language in reply to the President The New York Herald Tribune said , he was growing " increasingly insolent " in " reckless demogaguery and irresponsible power . " As for the President , it is felt that he has not yet regained for the Administration the prestige it lost in Secretary Stevens ' avoidance of a showdown the week before . While there was general approval of the President 's statement last week , there was also criticism that it fell short . The New York Times said that the President " must now recognize that generalized statements of good-will after the event are not enough . " The Washington Poet , recalling that during the 1952 campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight if Eisenhower were elected , " said that it had " waited some 400 nights for the President to exert the kind of leadership that would bring that happy result . " Problem for Administration On the other hand , it is argued that the problem confronting the President is not easy . He has many times refused to take the initiative against Mr. McCarthy , and informed quarters in Washington question whether he could profitably do so now . If he took the initiative he would be courting an open split in the party , which would imperil his program in Congress and perhaps ruin the Republicans ' chances winning solid control of Congress in November . Thus the initiative still appears to lie with Mr. McCarthy , and he has given much evidence that he will continue to ' use it , He and his staff of investigators are constantly on thehunt for new ammunition . Moreover , some major tests are ready to hand if the Senator chooses to force them . There is , of course , the continuing question of Communists in the Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a right to demand all the facts and question the motives of all the Army men , high and /ow , who may be involved . There is also the case . The Senator 's remarks last week indicate he takes the restriction of Mr. 's authority as a personal affront and may besides question Secretary Dulles on its wisdom . The Davies Case Finally , there is not far ahead the prospect of a. new turn in the long story of John Paton Davies. , the oft-investigated career officer who served in China during the war and afterward in the Far Eastern Section and Policy Planning Staff of the State Department . A new investigation of Mr. Davies has been under way and the final decision will be up to Secretary Dulles ; it may be forthcoming soon after he returns from the Inter-American conference in Caracas . A decision in Mr. Dairies ' favor might provoke Mr. McCarthy into a determined effort to examine the motives of all the Stele Department concerned , up to the Secretary himself , It is in these tests , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with the McCarthy question , And the question of " abuse " of Administration witnesses , which Ms had much prominence in the Peress case , may be involved . But many think a more basic question in the McCarthy-Eisenhower dispute than the Senator 's behavior with witness is whether he goes beyond the traditional limits of Congressional inquiry and encroaches upon the authority and responsibility of the President for the conduct of affairs in the Executive branch . Hope for Compromise There is no certainty , of course , that Mr. McCarthy will force matters to such lengths . Although he seems unflinching in his contention that not the President 's program but the issue of communism . In government is the big issue for ' M , some politicians think he may stop short of an explosion within Republican ranks if only because that might pave the way for Democratic control of Congress and the loss of his own great power as an investigating chairman . At all events , most Republican leaders last week plainly were hoping that a big break would not come . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , desertion of the first man to lead them to power in twenty years and , on the other hand , a commitment to what may be politically the " wrong " side of the ? powerful issue of communism . Their mood was apparent last week when , after earlier talk or curbs on " oneman committees " in Congress , the Republican leadership took the position that there could be no " forcing a set of rules " on any chairman . Moreover , they feel that the McCar. thy-Eisenhower dispute already has given the Democrats too , many chances to needle the Republican party with the charge that ? as Adlai E. Stevenson put it yesterday at a Democratic meeting in Florida  --  the G. 0 . P. is " divided against itself , half McCarthy and half Eisenhower . "
