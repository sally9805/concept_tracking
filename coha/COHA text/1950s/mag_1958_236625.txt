To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction , wrote Sir Isaac Newton in his third law of motion . He might also have been describing a political law for the Middle East . Last week , only days after Gamal Abdel Nasser had announced the union of Egypt and Syria in a new United Arab Republic , the Kings of Jordan and Iraq reacted by proclaiming a union of their two nations in a rival Arab Federation . <P> Chief engineer was Jordan 's doughty young ( 22 ) King Hussein . As he well knew , the Palestinian Arabs and refugees who comprise two-thirds of his 1,500,000 subjects were most susceptible of all the Middle East 's Arabs to Nasser 's new appeal to the ancient dream of Arab unity . Urgently , Hussein called on Saudi Arabia 's King Saud and his cousin King Feisal of Iraq , to confer on a new union . Saud held aloof , but Feisal came . <P> Early last week Feisal arrived in Amman with a planeload of aides . The negotiators deadlocked in shouting dissension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's men said their Palestinians would riot rather than be party to a pact that Nasser 's propaganda labels a symbol of Western imperialism , and that Saud would never join them unless Iraq pulled out of the pact . <P> The solution that satisfied everybody was to borrow the United Arab Republic 's formula that international agreements signed by either Egypt or Syria would remain binding on whichever country had signed them . Under this formula , Iraq could stick by its Baghdad Pact commitment until August 1959 , when the treaty provides that all members may reconsider their membership . <P> " Happiest Moment . " With this obstacle to unity neatly bypassed , Iraq 's pouchy-eyed Crown Prince Abdul Illah flew to Amman to make the clinching decisions for his nephew , King Feisal . But another deadlock still loomed . Hussein 's negotiators battled doggedly to get their master equal turns with Feisal as head of state . At 4 a.m . King Hussein , who needed federation far more than his oil-rich cousin , rose and announced that he would defer to Feisal as head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervise typing of the final draft . At 7:45 a.m. 22 negotiators crowded round a table in the main hall of King Hussein 's palace and signed a twelve-point federation agreement bound in the red , green , black and white colors of Jordan and Iraq . " This is one of the happiest moments of my life , " cried Feisal , and embraced his cousin . <P> The royal federation is to be much looser than Nasser 's republic . The two monarchs are to keep their individual thrones and sovereign titles . The federation , to be organized within 90 days , is to have one flag , one army , one foreign policy , one foreign service . Both nations will keep their own legislatures . A combined federal legislature will be set up to deal with federal policies , in which Jordan and Iraq will have equal representation . It will sit half the time in Baghdad , half the time in Amman . Though Feisal is designated head of state , " the question of the head of state will be reviewed " if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint that it is not too late for King Saud to line up with his fellow sovereigns . At week 's end Amman reported that the oil-rich Persian Gulf sheiks of Kuwait and Bahrein were " considering " joining too .
