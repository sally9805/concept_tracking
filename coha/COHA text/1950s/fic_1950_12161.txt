PROLOGUE ( A light shine down on a small space in center stage before the curtain . It reveals a costumed figure at a microphone . ) Friends , Visitors , Neighbours ! Greetings ! A very hearty greeting to you all ! We know that from city and town , from hill and dale , From far and near , From across the vast , undulating sweeps of mighty America , You have come , You have come to this sublime and verdant hill , You have come To witness and participate In a time honored ceremony , a sacred ritual In which a great , profound and fearless leader - A knight of the intellect - Will utter the immutable oath , Unsheath his sword of valor and high courage , And advance with the faith of high destiny Into the never ending battle Against evil and ignorance . On this festive week end in chill Novemeber You shall see Our Captain , guide , and resolute pilot Accept the symbols of a noble leadership Of this , a great American college - Of Famcee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that will come later . Tonight in song , And dance and pantomimic story We shall turn back the hands of all recording time And show what Femcee , how it grew And what it is today As it nestles here Aloft on this ancient hill . And so we welcome you again tonight To this sacred distingished place Ad bid you in mind and spirit To take off your shoes For you are indeed upon holy ground . For nowhere can great America boast Of a collage which has a more Beautiful , historic , or traditional site Then the rolling , treasured heights On which you now do sit . For on this hill - This ancient , historic hill A famous Seminole Indian chief Once held great pow-wows And watched his whirling , swirling braves Dance the war dance And later smoke the pipe of peace . And here on October 5 , 1539 The gay and gallant swashbuckler , The conquering Hernando De Soto , Led his fighting , Spanish Conquistadores Across the storied Swannee Searching for a fabulous land of gold . He planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill And untehed a Pawnee sunset Turn purple and gold in the dying west . Know you not , kind and loyal friends You are sitting now where De Soto , the great Captain of Conquest once did sit , As time rolled on This sacred , sublime altitude Was home again to yet another fighting soldier . This time the year was 1818 . Only three years after he had ? ? 1 . text blurred unreadable the glittering redcoats in gay New Orleans , Old Andy Jackson and his Tennesse Volunteers Here fought the Indians and pitched his corp . In a report to Washington he wrote : " The pursuit was continued Through Muckasukio towns Until night compelled me To camp upon a hill . " That hill , my friends , is the one On which now you do sit . Bid you not know that on yon site On which the Fine Arts Building stands Once stood the house of the first Governor of Florida - The spacious home of pioneering Governor Duval ? And still further , my friends Did you not know that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of Jocia T. Walls . The only Florida man of color Ever elected to the marbled halls Of the great United States Congress ? And here , too , once lived Jonathan C. Gibbe - Another great and brilliant man of color - The only one of his race to ever serve As Secretary of State And Superintendent of Education Of this , our beloved State of Florida Yes , these great and many more Once treaded God 's green sacred earth On the exact spot on which you now do sit . Would that we could say That all was glory here . But we can not . For here , too , was once a nation 's shame . For on this , our college hill , Close by the dining hall Once stood a massive oak with chains That told a tale of toil and servitude . Of anguished days under the blistering Florida sun , And long weary nights of stinging pain ! How those black folk - Those unsung and forgotton of the universe - Broke those adamantine chains And built around that evil oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and love Is the tale we now shall tell . And when , dear friends and noble visitors , This , our song and play and epic story , Has moved inevitably to its destined end , Pause and reflect : And with bowed heads and humble hearts Ask the dear Lord God of all To help us always to remember Our noble , dark hued , unknown ancestors Who toiled here High on this our hallowed hill , Who fought the fight of Joshua , And dreamed the dream With which we close our show . May God grant that each of us Will be worthy of that fight and dream . Flourish of music , marching tone . ( The lights go down and come up with great intensity on the large center stage .

Neither do they spring into life full grown like Menerva from the brow of Zeus . And walls do not ordinarily come tumbling down as they did for Joshua . p. 3 SECOND COMMENTATOR No . Walls of brick and stone have to be wrecked , or blasted down with dynomite . But the hardest of all walls to be torn down is that unseen , imaginary one of ignorance , poverty and a hostile enviornment . FIRST COMMENTATOR And no more impregnable a wall was erected anywhere than the unseen one That was erected against the Negroes in Florida , especially in the field Of education . In 1887 , twenty two years after the Emancipation Proclamation many people of the other race of the state thought that the elementary knowledge of reading and writing was sufficient for the recently freed slaves .

Mr. Thomas De Sable Tucker is answering questions of a farm couple , Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Green and their daughter , Sarah . ( The lights go down on small stage right and come up on small stage left .

GREEN We do n't mean to doubt you , lawyer . But Coleman Smith , he told Me he got a piece of paper , too . He tought he was through payIng , too ; but they told hem he owed $50.00 more on his land . TUCKER Sometimes , unsrupulous farmers will take advantage of our people when they buy land , especially when they do n't know how to read .

SECOND COMMENTATOR Thomas De Sable Tucker was born on July 21 , 1844 in Sierra Leon , West Africa . He was the sone of the daughter of an African king and a French explorer . He came to this country in his youth and was educated at Oberlin College . He afterwards taught school at Georgetown , Kentucky and New Orleans , Louisana . FIRST COMMENTATOR But as you have seen he is now a practicing attorney in Pensacola . Several clients have come to his office since the visit of Mr. And Mrs. Josiah Green . SECOND COMMENTATOR But now we find another visitor coming in . This man is destined to become one of the great men in Florida education . FIRST COMMENTATOR This man is Thomas Van Gibbs . He , as well as the lawyer , was educated at Oberlin College . p. 9 SECOND COMMENTATOR He has , however , recently returned from West Point , N. Y. where he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lights go down on small stage right and come up again on Mr. Tucker 's office on small stage left . ) TUCKER Well , how is my good friend , the younger Gibbs ? GIBBS Oh fine ! Fine , I thank you ! And how is the great lawyer ? TUCKER I ca n't complain too much . No one expects to get rich practicing law . GIBBS And at few other things these days . TUCKER I thought you had gone back to West Point . GIBBS Oh , I am not going back at all . TUCKER And why ? GIBBS For many reasons which I do not care to relate just now , West Point is not ready at present to graduate a Negro officer . Remember Grover Cleveland is in the White House and the influence and point of view of the democrats are being felt more and more in every type of national organization . TUCKER I can well understand that . GIBBS Well , I came to Pensacola on business which I have just concluded . While here I thought I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - GIBBS It is about the problem of higher education for our people in the state that I want to talk to you about . TUCKER What about it ? GIBBS You know while he was a member of the state legislature my father introduced a bill which would provide for higher education in the state for our people . TUCKER Of course , of course . Everyone in the state knows the record in the legislature of my friend , your great father . It is n't that we do n't know about the bill for higher education , the question is what about it ? GIBBS I am assured that it will be voted favorable in the coming season . TUCKER Is your information reliable ? GIBBS As reliable as things can be in politics . TUCKER And how reliable is that ? GIBBS Several of those who control things in the legislature have told me . TUCKER I am certainly glad to hear that . Now Sarah will not have to go out of the state for her education . GIBBS Who is Sarah ? TUCKER You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. And Mrs. Josiah Green not far out from the city . Neither can read nor write ; yet they Have bought a fifty acre farm and have paid for it . They have eleven Children . All who are old enough are going to school . Sarah is the oldest . She Finishes next year . They are working hard now to send her away to Tuskagee or Fisk next yeat . The only thing that scares them is the thought of sending her out of the state . p. 11 GIBBS Well , from what I can learn the Normal school is assured . TUCKER I know they will be tickled to death to learn they wo n't have to send Sarah out of the state . GIBBS They have gone as fas as to ask me if I would consider becoming the president of the school . TUCKER Of course you told them yes . You are the logical one for it . GIBBS No . That is not what I told them . TUCKER You acted too hastily . Whom did you name ? GIBBS You . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know I 've given up teaching to practice law . GIBBS There is no law making you practice law . You finished Oberlin College and are one of the best educated men in the state . TUCKER Yes , but you finished Oberlin , too . And in addition you have been to West Point . GIBBS But you have had experience . You know something about schools . You taught at Georgetown , Kentucky and New Orleans . This school will need not only an educated man but an experienced man to run it . Of course , I told them I would be glad to assist you if I could . p. 12 TUCKER Well , we 're getting the cart before the horse . We 'd better wait until we get the school before we start arguing over the presidency . GIBBS The school is certain , I tell you . TUCKER You ca n't be to sure . There are many people in this state who do n't believe that Negroes should have any higher education . As you said Grover Cleveland is in the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . There will be a great deal more debate about the Negro 's unfitness as well as his fitness for higher education before we get the school . GIBBS I know they will continue to debate and debate the question ; but all we need to get is that school to continue to keep our hands on the plow .

" ( After the quartet finishes the lights go down on small stage right and come up on small stage left and reveal the Commentators . ) SECOND COMMENTATOR And Attorney Tucker was right from the narrow bredth and long length of the peninsula of Florida . Men debated the fitness and the unfitness of the Negro for higher education for Negroes. p. 13 FIRST COMMENTATOR Some said he was ; and others said he was n't fitted for higher education . SECOND COMMENTATOR Some pointed to the Negroes 's progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up on the right half of stage center . The Commentators are now in darkness .

The Fourteenth Amendment made him a full citizen of these United States . Of course he is entitled to higher education . Give him that school . ( Lights go down and come up on the left half of stage center ) p. 14 FIRST COMMENTATOR There were rabble rousers who thought differently . ( A man comes in followed by " Hinderance . " ) SECOND SPEAKER The Fourteenth Amendment was a dirty trick forced on the prostrate south by the damn yankees . The Negro is a servant . Whoever heard of giving higher education to servants ? He can not absorb our culture . I say millions for taxes but not one cent for Negro higher education ! SECOND COMMENTATOR Some spoke of his harvesting the growing citris crops of Florida . ( A group of dancers come from stage left and dance a dance across the stage as if they were picking oranges . They quit right . " Progress follows them . ) FIRST COMMENTATOR Others agreed about his laziness and general shiftness . Many spoke of their lack of seriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter from stage left , and a group in a party mood come on the stage .

The minister is standing at the pulpit . ) THE MINISTER I wish to thank the congregation for turning out in such large numbers tonight . I have two very distinguished men up here with me on the platform . Of course , all of you know Mr. Thomas Van Gibbs of this city from his famous father , The Honorable Jonathon C. Gibbs , who lived and labored faithfully and mightily so long among us . But many of you do not know the gentleman here on my right . He is from our neighbouring city of Pensacola . He is Attorney Thomas De Sable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I have the two men up here tonight . Well , you know what a long hard fight we have put up for a school where our boys and girls could get higher training and academic subjects as well as normal training and industrial subjects . Well here is a piece of paper . I want to read you a bit from it . This is a section from a law passed by the legislature last week . It is not printed as yet but this copy was given to me by a good friend in that body . ( Reading from the paper ) Laws of Florida 1887 , Chapter 3692 #13 , page 36 . Establishment in accordance with the following constitutional provision and legislature enactment . Section 1 . That a Normal School for the training and instruction of white teachers be and is hereby established at Springs , Walton County . You are not particularly interested in that section . All of that is on page 36 . What you are interested in will be on page 37 . Ah , here it is . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 37 . Section 4 . That a Normal School for the colored teachers be also established at Tallahassee , Leon County , similar in all respects as prescribed above for the establishment of the Normal school for the white teachers and subject to the supervision and direction of the State Board of Education , and the same amount be appropriated to meet the current expense of the said Normal School for colored teachers . ( After he finishes reading , enthusiastically ) This means that at last by the act of the legislature we have the State Normal School . ( The audience applauds rigorously . After the applause have died down . ) That is not all . I have another paper I want to read from . ( Holding up paper ) This is a notice from Superintendent Russel .

Let us pray to God that they wo n't be doubting Thomases . ( The audience is wild in their applause ) We 'll hear a word from the vice-president . p. 16 GIBBS ( Rising ) From now on Professor Tucker will be the one to speak officially for our new school . All I can say is I shall work hard to prove worthy of my father who introduced the bill to make this school possible . I shall also be glad to work cooperatively and enthusiastically with one of the most learned men in Florida , our president , Mr. T. De S. Tucker .

For the past eighteen years , I have been practicing law in Pensacola . I accepted the position of presidency of our first school for higher training because it poses a challange . It is a challange to build - to build from the ground up . Florida deserves the best ; and it is going to get the best . Ladies and gentlemen , I may not live to see the towering super-structure ; but so help me God I am going to lay the foundation for the greatest college in America . MINISTER Praise the Lord ! Praise the Lord ! THE CONGREGATION ( Which is the choir , rises and sing with fervor ) " Praise ye the Lord . " ( The lights go down on the congregation singing with spirit and jubilant happiness .

FIRST COMMENTATOR The school opened with fifteen students and one teacher , the vice-president , on College Hill , the site of the present Florida State University . The other teacher , President Tucker , took longer than he anticipated in closing down his law practice in Pensacola and was a month late in reporting . SECOND COMMENTATOR So the school was actually opened by the vice-president , T. V. Gibbs FIRST COMMENTATOR But now the fifteen member student body is waiting the arrival of their new president .

One chair is vacant . ) GIBBS ( Speaking to the students ) Now students in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We want to give him a hearty welcome .

( One of the men students steps aside and Mr. Tucker walks in , The students stand and applaud rigorously until Mr. Tucker takes his seat on the platform . ) Student body , may I present to you Mr. T. De S. Tucker , our new president . p. 18 TUCKER Student body , I am very sorry I was not here to greet you on the opening day of school , a month ago . Nothing but the pressure of exceedingly urgent business could have kept me from you at such an historic moment in your lives , and in that of this state in its new program for higher education for Negroes . I understand that we have fifteen students enrolled for our opening year . That may not be many from the standpoint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , a very large number from the standpoint of character and achievement . ( Pauses for a moment ) Will you stand up , Sarah ? ( She obeys ) You may now be seated . ( She sits ) I did not ask you to stand up to reprimand you , Sarah . My aim is to cite a living example . I know Sarah 's parents well . They are farmers outside of Pensacola . They can not read nor write . But do n't blame them . Blame those who are responsible for making it impossible for them to seek learning . If ever there were one , this couple is the very salt of the earth . They bought a farm and paid for it . They have eleven children and all who are old enough to walk two miles , they are sending them to school . Sarah walked the distance to and fro until she finished the little country red school house . Now Sarah is like several of you in this student body . I want to advise you to be proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are farmers and are forced to wear dirty clothes most of the time . Do n't mind the fact they can not read nor write . Do n't mind the fact that some mothers have to wash cloths to help earn a living . Respect them ! Honor them ! They are doing those things so that you wo n't have to do them . For off the farm and out of the wash tubs of this state will come a greater , more educated next generation . Your generation . You are the first student body to come to this new school . What this institution will be in the future is largely dependent on what you do . If you do well those who come after you will do well . If you fail or do poorly , they will very likely follow your example . So it is up to you to set a good example in character and achievement for them to follow . Shakespeare once said , " Act well your part . " That is what I now say to you . Act well your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life after you leave here . Future generations down the centuries will be looking at you . Our first student body . Will you measure up ? " Act well your part . " ( The studens applaud . Progress crosses the stage from left to right . The lights go down and come up on the Commentators on small stage right. ) p. 19 SECOND COMMENTATOR With these challenging words two teachers and fifteen students set out on a pioneering voyage in higher education and technical education in this state . A voyage to lead where ? FIRST COMMENTATOR Where ? No one at the time could foresee ? Who at that time could peer into the future and see at that time that little school with that inauspicious beginning would become . SECOND COMMENTATOR Of one thing they were sure - the voyage begun in 1887 would come to a safe port somewhere if they would heed the words of their president and " Act their part well " on the great stage of life and keep moving ever forward . Moving ! Moving up the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and come up again on center stage as the choir files in . ) CHOIR ( Singing spiritedly ) " Moving up the King 's Highway . ( The choir files off as the lights go off and come up on the small stage left and the commentators . ) FIRST COMMENTATOR And so the State Normal and Industrial School moved slowly along on the highway of progress - maybe inching along . SECOND COMMENTATOR Only five students composed the first graduating class in 1892 . This small band , however , proved to be worthy ancestors of the thousands of alumni that have come since . All lived useful lives and were highly respected in the state . p. 20 FIRST COMMENTATOR The school soon outgrew its original site of College Hill in the City . In 1891 the present site , then called Highwood , was acquired and the school was then moved to its present permanent location . Highwood when it was purchased was a thickly wooded section on the outskirts of the city . SECOND COMMENTATOR Mr. T. De . S. Tucker , pioneering president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice law in Jacksonville . He passed away in 1903 and was interned in Baltimore , Md . FIRST COMMENTATOR Nathan B. Young , educated at Talladogn and Oberlin Colleges , became the second president of the College in 1901 and served until 1923 . SECOND COMMENTATOR During Mr. Young 's tenure , the State Normal School continued to grow . Many changes occured in the program of the institution . In 1905 by legislative action the institution was taken from under the State Department of Education and placed under the Board of Control which meant that the school from then on was officially a part of the program of higher education in the state . FIRST COMMENTATOR Along with this change in statues came a change in name . The State Normal School became officially , the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College , a name the school proudly bears today . p. 21 SECOND COMMENTATOR The school was organised into three divisions : Academic , Mechanical , Agricultural . The physical plant expanded . Under the leadership of Mr. W. W. Howard , then vice-president , the first military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had some type of Military organization . FIRST COMMENTATOR Athletics made its debut at the college during the administration of the illustrious President Young . At first , students participated in athletics in a spasmodic sort of way without too much faculty interest and faculty supervision . In 1889 George M. Sampson , a former quarter back on the Wester Reserve University team came to the college as head coach . He was followed by D. Bragg in 1904 . Under these two champions of sports the new college built a foundation for athletics and sports which have riveled the best schools of the country . SECOND COMMENTATOR Two features of interest about the college 's life during the first score Years of the 20th century that are worth remembering and emphasising . One was the social life of the students in those early years . ( The lights go down on the commentators and reveal a group of young men dressed up in their best suits . A group of young ladies led by the preceptress , or dean of women , come into the room. ) p. 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had socials . Boys did not go to the dormitories then and escort the young ladies to the socials . SECOND COMMENTATOR The boys all went to the hall and waited for the young women who were mached down in a line almost in military formation . FIRST COMMENTATOR They did not have matrons in those days . The one in charge of the Dormitory was called a preceptress . SECOND COMMENTATOR Now the preceptress has brought the girls into the hall . They march Leisurely around in a circle . The boys cut into the line and pick out Their favorite girls . ( Music starts up ) FIRST COMMENTATOR Rules were very strict in those days . The slightest infringement brought Drastic punishment . The preceptress watched the boys and girls like a hawk in order to make sure the rules were not violated . SECOND COMMENTATOR ( Music in March time ) The music has started for the grand march . No dancing was allowed . ( The students march around the ball obviously enjoying , themselves . They get in half dance steps now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a hawk in order to be sure That they do not get too closely together . ( Finally in the march the couples lock hands overhead and made a tunnel through which the others bow and march under .

W. Avent , Professor of English at the time . He is busy at a table writing . He writes a few lines , balls it up and throws it into the waste basket . He continues to do this for awhile . MRS . AVERT What on earth are you writing ? I should say trying to write , because all you seem to be doing is throwing things into the waste basket . AVERT I just ca n't get it right .

AVERT Do n't bother me now . I 've got it ! I 've got it ! ( He writes furiously for a while . Then he balls it up and throws it into the waste basket . ) MRS . AVERT Did you say something , dear ?

MISS BURWELL Well , after faculty meeting the other night , a group of us got to arguing about the college songs . MRS . AVERT And I know one who got into it . MISS BURWELL You are right . Your husband said he did n't like the songs of most of our colleges . They were all unoriginal . They were all words fitted to the well known tones : " Believe Me If All Those Endearing Yound Charts , " or Cornell 's " High Upon Cayoga 's Waters . " MRS . AVERT Tuskagee has a beautiful and original song . Everybody knows it was written By Paul Lawrence Donber. p. 27 MISS BURWELL Somebody told him that . He liked that one because it was original and Written especially for the school . But he did n't like those of any other School  --  except , of course , Mordhouse , where he graduated himself . MRS . AVERT Well that is interesting . MISS BURWELL Anyway he did n't like th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed a real original one here . And he sasid he was going to write a better one and have it ready tonight . MRS . AVERT ( As he throws another ball of paper into the waste basket . ) I see he is getting along famously .

Writing a college song is far more important , than that . It is a deep feeling down inside . AVERT You are right . Anyone studying or living the history of this college is bound to get that deep feeling . MISS BURWELL You are right . I know you have it . ( Looking at the paper ) Guess what lines I like best . AVERT What are they ? MISS BURWELL I 'll fight and win whate'er the battle be . AVERT So you really like them ? MISS BURWELL Yes . I can hear future alumni down the decades singing those beautiful words : " I 'll fight and win whate'er the battle be . " AVERT ( Repeating in deep thought ) " WHATE'ER THE BATTLE BE ! " ( The lights go off and come up on the commentators on stage right . ) FIRST COMMENTATOR Thus was born one of the most noble college songs in America . It 's original , inspiring , stirrring , and challenging . No college song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Femceans have a right to be proud of such a beautiful , ringing song . p. 31 SECOND COMMENTATOR The services of President Young were terminated at A and M College in 1923 . He afterwards became President of Lincoln University in Missouri , and later Inspector of Colored Schools for the state of Missouri . He passed away in Brought back to his beloved Tallahassee . FIRST COMMENTATOR The facts surrounding President Young 's leaving the institution have never Been understood . It was generally believed that he was too much of a classi-Cist for an Agricultrual and Mechanical College . Anyway his going was deeply Resented by faculty , students , and townspeople . SECOND COMMENTATOR This smoldering resentment was vented on the administration of President , William H.A . Howard who lasted only one year in that high office , from 1923-1924 . FIRST COMMENTATOR This university flared out in a series of fires which mysteriously broke out in the school 's wooden buildings . Duvall Hall , the academic building burned completely . The Mechanic Arts building was partially burned . And now the third fire : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the commentators and come up on the center stage and everal the side of wooden building on stage left . Smoke comes from behind the building . ) GIRL STUDENT Fire ! Fire ! She runs across to stage right . Fire ! Fire ! ( The blasing fire can now be seen throwing the shadows of it 's flickering flames across the stage . Girls pour from the building partly dressed in robes and night caps . A group of boys come running with pails of all kind . They run behind they building throwing water . A melody of shouts is heard . ) Bring down my trunk ! Get my coat and sweater ! Get my parisol and gum shoes ! Be sure and get my composition boook ! It has my home work in it ! Sarah , where are you ! Susie ! Pearl ! Boonie , are you safe ? p. 32 FACULTY MEMBERS ( Running in ) How did the fire start ? Who started it ? Did anyone see any suspicious characters ? STUDENTS Do n't ask us ! We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire just started , that 's all ! STUDENT Let 's sing the Alma Mater ! ( Starts ) Femcee ! Femcee I love thee ! STUDENTS Ah , shut up ! We do n't want to sing the Alma Mater now ! OTHERS ( Shouting ) We want President Young ! Bring back President Young ! ( The fire continues to flicker and the smoke continues to rise . A babble of voices and general confusion . The light die down and come up on the commentators on small stage right . ) FIRST COMMENTATOR Though sung frequently at practically every type of school program , this is one time the students refuse to sing the stirring words of Avent 's Alma mater song . SECOND COMMENTATOR The affairs at Femcee become critical . The school needed a president  --  a great president . So towards the end of the year the Board of Control sought a permanent far seeing president to replace Acting President Howard . Their nationwide search finally led them to one of the most famous schools in the entire world - to Tuskegee Institute founded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Board of Control was told at that great institution that the one they needed to head A and M College as president once worked at Tuskegee ; but that he had left and was principal of the Lincoln High School in Kansas City . That great educator was J. R. E. Lee , Senior . SECOND COMMENTATOR The high regard wich Booker T. Washington has for Dr. J. R. E. Lee , Senior may be gathered from the interview the great educator hd with Mr. Lee when he tried to get Dr. Lee to accept employment at Tuskegee Institute . ( The lights go down and come up on the office of Booker T. Washington in Tuskegee during the spring of 1899 . Mr. Washington is seated at his desk with Mr. Lee on the other side . ) LEE I appreciate very much your consideration of me , Mr. Washington ; but I am afraid I can not accept your kind offer to work at Tuskegee . WASHINGTON This is a good opportunity for you , Dr. Lee . Why do you refuse ? LEE I have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave it at this time . WASHINGTON ( Gets up and walks to the side thoughtfully ) I know you have a good position . I know your record . You graduated from Bishop College , in Marshall , Texas . You have been teaching Latin and history there for the past ten years . You have excellent recommendations . As for leaving a good job , we would n't invite anyone to work at Tuskegee who did not have a good job , or was capable of filling a good job . p. 34 LEE Thank you Mr. Washington , but I do n't think I can leave just now . WASHINGTON You know of my long standing aim to build here one of the great schools in America . You know , of course , of my point of view about industrial education . We have an excellent trade school here at Tuskegee . We have trade students here from all parts of the country . But now we are getting a large number of high school graduates who want academic training . It will be increasingly necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to continue to be good tradesmen in the future and compete with the technical graduates of the other racial groups . Do n't you think so ? LEE I most assuredly do , Mr. Washington . The two certainly go hand in hand . WASHINGTON I want the best men in the country to head every department at Tuskegee , and I have succeeded in getting many great men to come here to work with me . There is Benett Scott , outstanding educator and executive , who is private secretary ; and George Washington Carver , great scientist , as director of our Agricultural Department . We need now a man of real ability to join us as head of our Academic Department . We need you , Dr. Lee . Wo n't you join us ? LEE ( Thinks deeply for a second ) I think you have persuaded me to change my mind , Mr. Washington . Only you could have done it . ( They shake hands as the lights go down and come up on the announcers ) p. 35 SECOND COMMENTATOR And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he made an outstanding contribution to that great school from 1899 to 1915 . Then he became principal of the Lincoln High School in Kansas City from 1915 to 1921 , and then extension secretary of the National Urban League until 1924 . FIRST COMMENTATOR Dr. J. R. E. Lee then accepted the offer of the Board of Control and came to Femcee as its fourth president . In addition to his wide reputation for learning , Dr. Lee brought the excellent qualities of tack , persistence , patience , and faith in the friends of humanity . SECOND COMMENTATOR With these qualities he proved in every way to be the leader the college needed in the critical time after 1924 . He was soon able to get increased support for the state and to interest the Foundation in the work of the school . Among these were The General Education Board , The Rosenwald Fund , and The Carnagie Foundation . FIRST COMMENTATOR With this aid he was able to expand the physical plant tremendously . Among the buildings erected on the campus under his administration were Jackson-Davis Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Dining Hall , The Mechanic Arts Building , South Hall for Women , now McQuinn Hall , Sampeon Hall , formerly South Hall for Men , the President 's home and the crowning monument to his genius , J. R. E. Lee Hall , the Administratiion Building . p. 36 SECOND COMMENTATOR Now growing older with the strain of work and the years , there was one more building be ardently wished to build before he was called to the great beyond . FIRST COMMENTATOR Black despair has seized him for the moment , however , as he talks to Dr. Foote , Medical Director of the Hospital . ( The lights fade down and come up on small stage right . It is the president 's office . The time is March , 1944 . ) DR . FOOTE I tell you , Mr. President , we must expand the hospital . We can not go on longer with the crowded conditions as they are . LEE You have told me that before . I 've been working on plans for building a new hospital - a fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to do something else that 's urgent . DR . FOOTE I know , Mr. President , but three and four sick students , teachers and other patients have to be put in rooms designed for one . Our facilities and supplies are far too inadequate to take care of our needs . LEE You know I 'm just as interested in a better hospital as you are Dr. Foote . It is the one building that I am vitally interested in seeing built here . I have given it my best thought and most of my time lately . But now I must put off my plans until next year . p. 37 DR . FOOTE Next year ! Then I see nothing left for me to do but to resign as Medical Director . LEE Resign . Do you realize what you are saying ? DR . FOOTE Yes , Mr. President . It is simply that I am a physician . My duty is to prevent disease . I , above everybody else , am suppose to have conditions around me so that they will not spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an epidemic is likely to break out at any time . It is simply that as a pysician , I would have no defence against an investigation for an epidemic . LEE None of us want to see an epidemic here . DR . FOOTE Not only would a new hospital alleviate the crowded conditions for the sick , but it would give us the necessary improved facilities for the training of our nurses and interns . It would attract more young physicians to the state which we badly need . The hospital is a necessary must now , Mr. President . LEE I told you that I have worked and worked on that building , Dr. Foote . I 'm getting old now , I 'm tired . I have something else to do . MRS . BRIGGS One of the boys out in the hall has hurt his hand badly , Dr. Foote . Can you come out and look at it ? DR . FOOTE Tell them to take him over to the hosptial , I 'll be over in a few minutes . p. 38 MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you 'd better look at it before he goes . LEE Yes , you go on out and see your patient . Come back when you have examined him . I want to think for a few minutes . ( Dr. Foote rushes out . Mr. Lee gets up and walks slowly around then sits wearily in his chair and stares up at the ceiling . Progress comes in . ) PROGRESS ( Reciting slowly and impressively ) " Never Give Up . " NEVER GIVE UP Do not give away so easily in despair If things come not your way . Your time will come if your work goes up , For Rome was n't built in a day . It takes longs years of struggle and toil For a man from a babe to grow ; It takes long years to wear a foot away From the rocks , by the waters that flow . It took an unknown time for the earth to form Into the state which now you see ; It took an unknown number of chrystal drops To make our boundless sea . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in the mud and the slime ; For like is a long rough journey , Across the ocean of time . Faith and hope are needed ships , And will is the power that drives ; We must sail on til life has gone From the scene of our earthly lives . Faith in this world , and faith in men , And faith in the distant fool ; Faith in ourselves , yes we must have And faith in the human soul . Hope is the thing that makes us stand When evils of life descends ; Hope is the torch that lights the path To the far away journey 's end . Will is a force that all must have Whatever the price it may cost , It drives one to seek in the tangled maze The moment his vision is lost . With faith , hope and will , why never give up You will win in the end you see , Just like the world 's great savior Who hung on Calvary . ( Dr. Foote comes into the room . Mr. Lee snaps out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't badly hurt . He was more shocked and frightened than anything else , It would n't hurt him to rest a day in the hospital , however . We are so short On beds that I sent him to his room . LEE I have been thinking while you were gone . If conditions are as bad as you Say , I should make the hospital the first thing I should work on . Maybe It will be the last thing , too . That might be one reason why I have n't Worked as hard on it the last month or so . Somehow we approach with dread And reluctance what we feel will be the last thing we shall do on earth . DR . FOOTE Nonsense , you will live to build many more building besides the hospital , Mr. President . LEE I do n't know ! I do n't feel so anyhow . Anyway , you run around . I will go to New York tomorrow to see if I can get some aid from the General Education Board . I will stop on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington that are beginning to give assistance to building and Furnishing hospitals . We will leave no stone unturned in this matter . I 'll Promise you that you will get some relief for the hospital by fall , however . You can bank on that . DR . FOOTE Thank you , Mr. President ! Thank you ! ( Lights go down and come up on the commentators on small stage right. ) p. 40 FIRST COMMENTATOR Dr. Foote did not get a new hospital that fall , but he did receive relief . SECOND COMMENTATOR Man 's purpose does not always coincide with that of the divine . So Dr. Lee Was not here to see the hospital started . On this trip he contracteda deep Cold which turned to pheumonia . He soon passed on to the land of the eternal . FIRST COMMENTATOR In accordance with his last wish , his body was taken to its final resting place at Marshall Texas . Thousands of old friends and neighbors who were with him when he went to school and taught at Bishop College ; and students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to the great educator .

The crowd masses in a large semi-circle around the grave with their black umbrellas pointing backwards to the audience completely shielding the grave . The singer pauses for a moment. ) p. 41 MINISTER ( Intering ) God is praised in heaven for his judgments . And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , Alleluia , Salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God . ( As the last umbrella files out the lights die down and come up on the commentators on small stage right . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . In the word of Thomas S. Boone , and I quote : " Lee is one of the greatest characters the South has produced . All true professers - teachers- are true servants . It is theirs to serve in the great and responsible tasks of rightly shaping the minds of the youth for the right living and helpful service . History records no name of an individual who has rendered a greater service in this field than J. R. E. Lee . He was the relayed inspiration of Booker T. Washington . Lee has been honored , but he was won every one by the sweat of hard toil and the daring of a brave heart . " Unquote . SECOND COMENTATOR An eloquent and worthy tribute by the great author , Thomas S. Boone . FIRST COMMENTATOR For Famcee , besides the buildings he built , he was instrumental in getting the college accredited by Association of College and Secondary Schools of the Southern States in 1931 . In the same year he secured the admission of the college into membership in the Association of American Colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was also the founder and first president for many years of the American Teachers Association , one of the important teacher 's organizations in America . The Negro race has produced no greater educator than J. R. E. Lee , Sr. p. 42 SECOND COMMENTATOR Mr. Jubie B. Bregg , the grand old man of athletes at Famcee followed Mr. Lee as Acting President from April until September of 1844 . Mr. Bregg endeared himself to Famceans everywhere during his long connections with the institution , and especially for seeing , that the program of the institution moved along progressively until a new president was elected . Sempeon - Bregg Stadium , named partly in his honor is a lasting tribute to one of the noble men who helped to make Famcee great . The new president finally elected was Dr. William H. Gray , Jr. , who served from 1944 to 1949 . During his administration he was instrumental in getting the State of Florida to make substantial increases in the appropriations for expanding the physical facilities of the college .

Workmen also commenced building the hospital during his administration . ( A musical interlude ) SECOND COMMENTATOR During the years 1948 and 1949 waves of unrest were sweeping the colleges in America . In order that trouble would not come to Femcee administrative leaders constantly urged friends , alumni and students to stand unified in their support of the college and its program . p. 43 FIRST COMMENTATOR They warned that if Famcee was allowed to walk peacefully along on its campus- ( The lights go down and come up again on center stage . Miss Famcee comes in on stage left reading a copy of The Famcean . She is dressed in a costume of orange and green stripes of paper .

Then commence the wild dance of Miss Famcee trying to escape . The music increased in tempo . She runs frightened from one to another . Each one tears a strip of orange and green from her .

END OF ACT 1 @x ( Lights come up on commentators on small stage right . ) SECOND COMMENTATOR The Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr. , and gave them the necessary authority to administer the affairs of the college during a transition period in the history of the college . FIRST COMMENTATOR Mr. Efferson for twenty-six years had worked successfully in many important offices of the college from teacher of Mathematics through Dean of the College to Administrative Assistant . Mr. Lee , Jr. , had served for years as business manager , handling all of the fiscal affairs of the college . Thus in this period of great crisis , Officials of the state turned to two able administrators who had the knowledge and experience necessary to run the affairs of a great institution . SECOND COMMENTATOR Here we see Mr. Efferson conduction the first faculty meeting after the crisis . Mr. J. R. E. Lee , Jr. , is beside him . ( The lights go down and come up on a faculty meeting on stage center . The chairs of the faculty members are facing stage left . Mr. Efferson is facing the members on stage left behind a rostrum . Mr. Lee is sitting down-stage of him ) p. 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things you ought to know . I say officially because a great many of you might have heard unofficially . You know we have been passing through a crisis since the sudden resignation of Dr. Gray . The Board of Control has asked me to administer the affairs of the school as Acting-President . Mr. Lee here at my side has been given complete responsibility for the fiscal matters of the college . That is why at this meeting he is sitting up here beside me . Now no one can tell what will happen in the history of a great institution like Famcee . This we do know , however , that Famcee is bigger than any one person or all of us . Because it is bigger and more important than any of us , I am going to ask you to continue your work as if nothing has happened . If we can count on the loyalty of our faculty and students we need never fear what has happened , is happening , or will happen in the future to this great institution . Let us pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( All bow their heads . " The Lord 's Prayer " begins on a record to a creative dance by the dance group . At the end of the dance Progress walks across the stage from left to right . The lights come up on the commentators on small stage right after they have dimmed out on center stage . ) FIRST COMMENTATOR And so the Board of Control , the faculty , the alumni , and the student body rallied around and supported the administration of Acting-President Efferson while a permanent president for the institution was sought . p. 47 SECOND COMMENTATOR Although Acting President Efferson served as leader of the college only from September 7 , 1949 to April 5 , 1950 Progress in the growth of the school continued both in spirit and physical development . FIRST COMMENTATOR The Home Economics Building and Lee Hall were renovated and redecorated . Roads were paved around several building .

DR . FOOTE ( Bowing to Mr. Efferson ) Thank you , Mr Efferson ! ( Turning to the Audience ) Ladies and gentlemen , it gives me a deep and personal pleasure to introduce to you the main speaker of today . First because the speaker has been one of my life long friends . The second is because he was one of my classmates . We studied medicine together at Howard University . A third reason is that for nineteen years he has been a member of the Florida A and M Clinical Association which has been cooperating with us in developing a better health program as president of the organization . It , therefore , gives me great pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. J.A . Long of Pelatka , Florida . p. 48 DR .

It was in the beginning the brain-child of Dr. L. H. B. Foote , fertilized by our beloved , ( The Late President J. R. E. Lee ) and prepared for delivery by our former president Dr. Wm . H. Gray , Jr . and is now about to be presented to us by Acting President Dr. H. Manning Efferson . I have reference here to the Florida A and M College Hospital , which is now under construction and is nearing completion . An edifice that will stand as a monument to Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and as a memorial to the fine co-operation between our good friends of the other race and Negroes of the State of Florida and elsewhere . These forces have joined together throughout the past years their prayers , time thought and influence3 to show you the concrete and material edifice which you now gaze upon , the dream they have been dreaming all these years , and which will now be dedicated . p. 49 EFFERSON The dedication ceremonies will now be conducted by the Grand Master for the Sovereign State of Florida and his officers , assisted by the Grand Lodge .

It is a high privilege for me to be here and say a few words to you at this time . It is a greater privilege for me to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it is in the history of the most colleges , Famcee has been passing through a period of uncertainty prior to the period of the election and the inauguration of a new president . Now is the time she needs you more than ever . Now is the time for all good Famceans to really come to the aid of their college . The alumni of any college are an important factor in the running and operation of that institution . They along with the administration , the Board of Control in State Institution , and the Board of Trustees in Private Schools , form the triple pillars on which the program , the ideals and the traditions of that particular institution rest . If one pillar gives way the others might continue to support the structure but that support will be weak . So let us as loyal alumni bear with courage determination and strength our obligations to Famcee . In Dr. Gore we have one of the finest men in the country as the future leader of our college . He is one of the best educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauw , Howard and Columbia Universities . His long record of achievement at Tennessee State College , and in the great educational associations of this country where he has for many years held high office shows that he is a man with a program  --  not the showy , frothy type , but a man with a solid and basic philosophy of education that will better fit out boys and girls of Florida for a life of service and accomplishment . His name was suggested to the Board by the alumni . So we are doubly obligated to support him and his program . The time has passed now for words . The call is now for action . I have with me some of our most faithful alumni : Mrs. Lange , Mr. Connely , Mrs. Washington , etc .
