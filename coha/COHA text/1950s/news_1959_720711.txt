txt A major revision in Massachusetts tax laws designed to encourage expansion of Bay State industries was signed into law this week by Governor Furcolo . Under the new law Massachusetts now will not collect a capital gains tax on the " paper profits " realized when a shareholder in a corporation being reorganized receives shares of another corporation of a higher value . Instead , the state tax would be deferred until the stock is sold and cash realized . Under the former Massachusetts income tax law paper profits were taxed at 6 per cent , plus a 23 per cent surtax in connection with exchange of stock transactions resulting from mergers and reorganizations . The tax was based on the excess of the fair market value of the new shares over the old shares even though the owner realized no cash . Long-Sought Change Massachusetts tax commissioners for several years have sought the tax change to remove inequities and to simplify administration of taxes on such stock exchanges . Robert T. Capeless , the present State Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation , and his predecessors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed the new statute as a major step forward in Massachusetts tax administration . The bill was filed by Representative Arthur D. Heaney ( R ) of Newton , on the petition of Herman Stuetzer , Jr. , ? of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce . The Massachusetts Tax Commission , headed by Commissioner Capeless , held in a recent report that the old law was unfair to small stock holders and tended to restrict expansion of Massachusetts concerns . The new law follows the federal practice . On this situation the tax corn- mission pointed out that the new law will be far easier to administer than the present one . " When a tax is to be imposed upon the excess of the value of the new securities received on a reorganization exchange over the cost basis of the shares surrendered it is , of course , necessary first to determine what such ' value ' is , " the commission said . " Where actively traded securities are involved , this presents no problem , but in quite a number of cases , the new securities have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most States Conform " Such questions are among the most difficult which tax administrators have to face .. . " Finally , both in the interest of taxpayer compliance and of ease of cross checking between Massachusetts and federal returns , there is every reason fon striving for uniformity between the Massachusetts and the federal law , " The commission pointed out that of the 34 states and the District of Columbia which impose income taxes , 25 follow the federal rule regarding defer- ' ment on reorganization exchanges , five do not tax gains , on the sale or exchange of securities , and the laws of four states now do not correspond to the federal law . Those states are Mississippi , Missouri , North Dakota . and Oklahoma . The commission has estimated that the annual tax deferment under the new law will be about $220,000 as far as reorganization exchanges are concerned . The commission explains that " in the usual case where a taxpayer incurs a tax on a gain , he voluntarily accepts tax liability by taking the affirmative step of selling his stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains tax , he does not sell his stock . In either event , the initiative is his . Must Accept . Vote " In the case of a reorganization exchange taxable in Massachusetts but not federally he has no choice in the matter . The corporation is controlled in the majority of cases by stockholders residing outside of Massachusetts who have no knowledge of , or if they do have such knowledge , have no concern with , the unique Massachusetts tax law on the subject . " Even if he votes against the reorganization , the small Massachusetts shareholder still is forced to accept it and pay the Massachusetts tax . Often , he has no free cash with which to pay the tax and is forced to sell some of his newly received securities to do so . " This has the dual disadvantage of cutting clown his investment and consequently his future income and also of subjecting him to a federal capital gains tax on the shares sold . " This situation is corrected under the new law just signed by Governor Furcolo ; furthermore . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would not have been advantageous to them under the old law .
