Outside the little shack the snow was packed in deep drifts . Beyond its white expanse lay the forbidding waters of the Sea of Okhotsk , already thick with pack ice drifting down from Siberia . Inside , protected from the cold by walls papered with pages from popular Japanese magazines , barefoot Minoru Goto shuffled toward the iron stove with another piece of kindling and awaited the return of her children from school . " The first thing they 'll say is , ' I 'm hungry , ' " she sighed , " but even if they ask , we do n't have anything for them these days . " For all the other 400 families in the little village of Kaitaku , it was the same story . <P> Minoru and her husband , a onetime airplane mechanic , had been faced with a choice at war 's end : to return to the hopelessness of the burned-out ruins of Tokyo or to start a new life as pioneers on the far northern island of Hokkaido . Government posters showed Hokkaido 's inviting green landscapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its snug , warm farmhouses . Along with some 190,000 other Japanese families , the Gotos seized the opportunity . <P> Unlike the Posters . Life in Hokkaido , the northernmost and second largest island in the Japanese chain , turned out not to be like the posters . In winter the farms of the homesteaders lay under snow that heaped in drifts up to 6 ft. high . In summer the island 's rocky , clay-filled soil was stubbornly unproductive . Hokkaido crop yields were only half of those harvested elsewhere in the nation . <P> This fall Hokkaido 's farmers suffered their worst crop failure in 42 years . Hokkaido 's fishermen were doing just as badly : harried by Russian gunboats from the Kurile and Sakhalin islands , they were desperately forced to overfish their own meager waters . <P> Girls for Sale . In the midst of a Cadillac-plated prosperity in Tokyo , only the efforts of a group of charities ranging from the United Nations International Children 's Fund and Catholic and Protestant groups to Japan 's own Association of Pinball Machine Manufacturers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the U.S. Air Force last week flew in three planeloads of food . Hokkaido 's farmers face both hunger and bankruptcy . " We 've sold even the gold from our teeth , " one farmer told TIME Correspondent Curtis Prendergast . " The only thing we 've left to sell is our daughter . " It was not a joke . Many a farm family , in desperate need , has returned to the old but recently outlawed custom of selling off a daughter to some enterprising brothel keeper in exchange for ready cash . So far this year , the Hokkaido prefectural police headquarters reported , 1,454 girls have been sold to restaurants , brothels and geisha houses , and 1,040 persons had been charged with brokerage in girls . Some teenagers have been sold for $15 ; in rare instances , more attractive girls have gone for as high as $550.
