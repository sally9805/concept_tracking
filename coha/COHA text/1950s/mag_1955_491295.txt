THE POST REPORTS ON JUVENILE DELINQUENCY : The Shame of America By RICHARD CLENDENEN , Executive Director , and HERBERT IF BEASER , Chief Counsel , of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency The Senate investigators tell why they believe that we , as a nation , have deserved the present increasing wave of juvenile crime , and offer their own expert opinions on what we must do about it . CONCLUSION MERICA has the scientific knowledge and the resources to lick the problem of juvenile delinquency ? if only we have the moral courage to use them . " I submit to you , " G. Howland Shaw , of the National Association of Training Schools and Juvenile Agencies , told the United States Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency , " that our cities in America are getting today , as they have in the past , precisely the juvenile delinquency they deserve . " Our sixteen months ' investigation for the Senate subcommittee left little doubt that , as a nation , we have deserved the 45 per cent increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real question that was before the subcommittee was What can we do about it ? There are many answers , and most of them have been made perfectly clear by experience , study and research , if only we will look facts in the face . " There is no subject matter today to which more people , more groups , more committees , schools and churches are devoting attention than that of helping youngsters avoid some of the pitfalls which have led potentially useful citizens into lives of crime , " Senator Estes Kefauver has pointed out . To capitalize on this broad interest , instead of attacking juvenile delinquency in dribbles and dabbles , we must get behind a broad , concerted plan of action that gets everybody into the act . Delinquency is not just the problem of police or social agencies  --  it is everybody 's business . We must stop believing that we can get something for nothing . We can not get good probation officers to supervise wayward children , for instance , by paying them less than we ( Continued on Page 91 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF AMERICA ( Continued on Page 30 ) pay the man who cares for monkeys in the zoo . We have to decide whether we want to pay more now to prevent delinquency or to pay many times as much later to build bigger and stronger prisons for adult criminals . We must stop looking for the easy way out ; stop ignoring what experience has taught us . One more boys ' club , one more probation officer or one more anything else will not solve the problem ; only an over-all campaign to get at the many roots of delinquency can be effective . The war against juvenile delinquency must be fought simultaneously on two fronts . First , we must combat the influences in the family and in the community that make children more susceptible to waywardness . Second , we must concentrate our greatest efforts on locating as early as possible the children who are most likely to become delinquent , and giving them the kind of help they need . Throughout the subcommit tee 's hear- ings in many cities across the nation it - was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , recreational centers , settlement houses , and boys ' clubs  --  were failing to reach the child who is rebelling against society and is in gravest danger of delinquency . Who is this child ? He is a youngster who , in one way or another , has been kicked around and he sees the world as a jungle that is hostile to him ; as something he must light in order to survive . His private war against the world brings retaliation or punishment , but this merely reinforces his feeling that the world is against him . As a result , he isolates himself from the very ! agencies that are intended to help  --  him . He takes no interest in school activities if he can avoid it , because he is fighting established authority . He keeps away from church-sponsored groups , the Boy Scouts , the Y.M.C.A. and the recreation center . He refuses to keep appointments at the child-guidance center or the children's-aid society . Yet this is the child who must he reached before he becomes a confirmed delinquent . it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the techniques that have been developed to do it are now known as " aggressive case work " and " the detached-worker " programs . Examples of both can be drawn from the work of the New York City Youth Board . The aggressive case worker is an important departure in social service . Many social workers have felt they were severely handicapped unless per-stone needing aid came to them in a - operative attitude . But since the twtile child seldom comes to the agency , the aggressive case worker now takes the agency to the child and persists in his efforts regardless of the attitude of the child or the child 's family . This might seem to make the aggressive case worker a futile , snooping busybody . But what happens in practice ? In New York one worker was given t he case of Louise B. , a fourteenyear-old girl who was a persistent truant , who twice had been picked up by police for loitering late at night and who refused to co-operate with any child 's agency . The worker called at the cold-water flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. , a slovenly woman who opened the door only a crack . " No , we do n't want you , " the mot , her said , trying to shut the door against the worker 's strategically placed foot . " We 've had plenty of snoopers from the welfare around here . Co away . " " But you want Louise to get along better , and I 'm merely trying to help you , " the worker replied . " Go away . " " All right . But here 's a card with my name and Phone number , if you want to call me . And I 'll be back to see you on Wednesday . " She went back on Wednesday and could n't even get her foot , in the door . She did discover from neighbors that Louise 's father usually got home at eight P.M. , so the next night she returned at nine P.M. and talked to him . He did n't invite her in , but he seemed to take an interest . She kept going every week for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Louise 's mother was more friendly but it was several weeks longer before she began at last to talk about her daughter . Once the barrier of hostility was broken , it was obvious that beneath their outward belligerence the family had wanted help all the time . Even Louise began to talk freely to the worker about school problems and , at last , the agency was reaching the roots of the problem . The limited experience that agencies have had in this kind of program already has shown enormous possibilities . Louise 's family , like the girl herself , had heen distrustful and host ile toward agents of a society in which they had felt the pinch of poverty and discouragement . Their first reaction was distrust and resentment against the worker . What the worker did was difficult , but essentially simple . She let I he family blow off steam  --  figuratively. kick her in the shins ? and she avoided any retaliation . When the family had thus drained off some of their hostility toward society and found the worker still helpfully on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack at them . Only then could they let their real desire for help come to the surface . This , of course , did n't mean that Louise 's problems were solved , but at least the worker had found a way of building a bridge over which the girl could cross the gap separating the delinquent from normal society . The importance of this bridge-building process was emphasized by an older boy who tried to explain why some youngsters got into trouble . " Guys who do n't feel like they are counting , " he said , " who feel like they are worthless to everybody  --  well , they are the guys who go and try to make names for themselves by being stickup guys . It is on account they feel like they are nobody . " The detached-worker program is designed to help these " nobody guys " by getting in contact with delinquent gangs , preventing their street tights with other gangs and redirecting their activities into constructive channels . " We sometimes use the hang-around method , " Kenneth E. Marshall , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I found a candy store where one gang congregated and simply hung around there . I was able to pass nut a cigarette or maybe put a nickel in the jukebox when they ran out of money . They gal to know me , but I hey are suspicious , " We try to get contact with the lead-ere of the gang because if we do n't gain the leaders ' confidence our work will be impossible . One boy ? not a leader -- was interested in a job , so then I told them I was from the Youth Board and that this was one of the ways I could help them . This boy promised that next day he would come to my office . But it was interesting that instead of him , the leader of that gang came to case the joint , so to speak . I was able to help both the leader and the other fellow , with the result t hat they called me the ' job man . ' " Marshall later attended a " session , " or dance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-room apart ment with their " debs , " or girl friends . " I took my wife . That aroused comment because they could n't understand how I could bring my wife to such a grimy affair . One boy asked if I did n't have any regard for my wife . But this sort of thing gave them the feeling I was what I said  --  a guy out to help them do some of the things t hey wanted to do . " Their sessions were a tinder box because if a youngster accidentally stepped on the toes of a youngster from another gang or danced with his girl friend , that might start a gang tight . They had to keep their hats and coats on while dancing , for fear of having them stolen . I brought to them the idea of hiring a hall and having a regular dance . " Often we know when a gang fight is in the offing . Then we talk to them . We point out that some are on probation ; others are on the police records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they meet and talk it over . Maybe we drive the two leaders around in our car for an hour and stop for coffee and  --  although maybe nothing is settled over the long period  --  we are often able to stop the light for the time . " When the boys in the past were not assisted by workers and had no mediation , every incident invariably ted to a fight . Regarding fighting , we have definitely had some impact . Then some youngsters seem on the border line and we have been able to help them get over to the right side of the fence . One was a member of the gang and he fought , but his heart was n't in it . We discussed his problems over coffee many times and , without any preaching , he began to see that his problem had to do with some-1 hing about himself .... He went on  --  I do n't say as a direct result  --  and finished school and got a job in a hank . " In many communities , other organizations such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for delinquents by getting interested , responsible men to act on a continuing basis as friends and counselors to boys in danger of becoming delinquent . That such work is slow and difficult was demonstrated by the case of Freddie , a short , thin-legged boy of ten who one clay marched across u crowded playground in Minneapolis brandishing a revolver and threatening to shoot his playmates . Freddie 's mot her , a woman of eome education , was embittered by her husband 's desertion of her and her hree children . She complained that she was overworked ; she denounced the Government because relief payments Ira n . I were small . Perhaps unconsciously , directed most of her complaints at I children and , if something was miteiii she almost automatically accus Freddie of having stolen IL Often had . The effect of all this was that the el dren , especially Freddie , who want adult love , got no recognition at hot and tended to feel like misfits at echo Freddie desperately wanted a hicyc so he stole one from another boy , fell and broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wh Freddie stole a revolver and carried to the playground , he wag rebelli against the downgraded position he c cupied at home . He wanted to attrs attention and show he was a big she but , of course , he also might have kill somebody . Instead , his shooting rat page was happily interrupted and , short time later , he came to the atte tion of Luther Youngdahl , later govt nor of Minnesota and a Federal juc4 An active leader in the Big Brothel Youngdahl asked Freddie to come s him in his chambers at the courthoui He talked to the boy about his mist havior and his good behavior , too , as made a standing dale for a conferen each Saturday morning . Thereafter , the frail , thin-faced hi would come whistling into the judge chambers once a week , wave his hat and say . " Hi , judge ! " in a friendly , y offhand way . Then he would start tal ing about what he had been studyit and what he did after school . Mat times he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of gloves from t automobile .

I believe in you . " But a couple of weeks later he woti steal something else .

And when the be got away From his disturbing home a mosphere , he began to make progress i school .

" Such efforts to turn back children who are teetering on the edge of waj wardnes.s are vitally important in It fight against juvenile delinquency . Bi we must also holster agencies that at designed to rehabilitate the delinquer and thus prevent him from infectin other youngsters in the communitj The child who has resisted all efforts save him from becoming a serious di linquent represents what might 1 called the " hard core " of the over-a problem . One such boy , for example was Ben , who was fourteen and ha been exposed to no less than eleve public and private agencies without an etTect on his progress toward prison . Confirmed delinquents like Ben IA come the responsibility of anothe group of agencies ? the juvenile court probation and parole officers , detentic homes and training schools  --  whit have the prime purpose of rehabilita ' ing them before they become part of II vast . army of adult criminals- This Is job of tremendous importance to ou tuition . Such agencies represent the last clumee of society to save countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last chance to save the taxpayers the billions of dollars which would be required to care for a growing criminal population . Yet , what do we give these agencies to do the job ? In most communities we have given them neither the men , I he money nor the materials . " The fact is that we have not yet really tried , " Sen. Thomas C. Hennings , Jr. , pointed out near the end of the subcommittee lwarings . " It is as though a community decides it will establish a tire department to cut down its losses from fires . It passes a pious resolution establishing the department and appoints a tire chief . But it provides him with no equipment and with no trained men . Then , as the buildings keep burning down , the community very solemnly arrives at the conclusion that fire departments just do n't work . " It is worthy of note that every state in the nation has established a highway commission to plan , develop and coordinate the building of roads . But , with few exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a central agency to do the same thing in the fight against delinquency . No state would think of building a million-dollar-a-mile parkway or even a country road without fitting it carefully into the 1 network of state  --  or even national ? highways . But it is very common for a state to establish an excellent juvenile court and then virtually nullify its el- fectiveness by permitting adolescents in custody to he held in a common jail with adult criminals . We may spend millions developing a good training-school program , but let it go to waste by failing to provide a suitable parole system for aiding delinquents when they return to the community . - Let 's look at it from another angle . ? In the war against delinquency , each ' service designed to aid wayward children is essential to success  --  just as infantry , artillery , tanks and airplanes are all essential to victory in a battle . - In the same way , the strength of our - battle front is measured by the extent - to which these various units are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , notably California and Minnesota , have led the way in de : veloping state-wide , co-ordinated services for prevention and treatment of delinquents . The California Youth Authority , described to the subcommittee by Director Heman Stark and former Director Karl Holton , was established in 1941 , when the state faced a great increase in delinquency due to the rapid influx of war workers . Under the Youth Authority act , all young delinquen t13 committed by juvenile courts to the state come directly into the justody of the authority . These youngsters are taken to a dipgnostic center where intensive tests and studies determine their individual needs . Following study , they may be returned to their community on parole ? or placed in a training school or other SATIlltDAY facility . There are , for example , four schools where boys are grouped according to age and educational requirements . The Fricot Ranch School houses younger and more immature boys requiring minimal physical custody and , in sonic cages , needing a program of remedial education , The Preston School , at the other extreme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custody , but likely to benefit from a program that emphasizes job training . Two schools for girls are operated along similar lines . In addition , California has four forestry camps for delinquent boys over sixteen . They are modeled after the old Civilian Conservation Corps and represent one of the most heartening recent developments in the field of rehabilitation . These camps , limited to sixty boys each , are in the remote state forests . The boys carry on conservation work for the state forestry department , building roads through the woods , constructing firebreaks , maintaining telephone lines for lookout stations and operating nurseries for reforestation . They are paid about a dollar a day , from which fifty cents is deducted for board and room . This system not only saves the state a large sum of money , but it is the kind of rugged outdoor life that appeals to many of the boys , and that has changed the attitude and behavior of a large percentage of those committed . Since the test of any program of rehabilitation is the fate of the delinquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-wide parole service through which all youngsters released from diagnostic centers , training schools or forestry camps are helped to adjust to normal life . The authority also is responsible for helping communities maintain favorable local conditions . It gives consultation to police departments , juvenile courts and detention homes . It inspects county camps for delinquent s and , if they meet certain standards , pays 50 per cent of the expenses of children at such camps . With the University of Southern California , it has established the Delinquency Control Institute , the only school in the nation for training juvenile police officers . The authority , in cooperation with other state agencies and departments , also has undertaken comprehensive studies to help determine and meet all the needs of children m various communities . All these examples give a hint of what can be done when public and private agencies have the courage and resources to co-ordinate activities and get at the roots of the problem . But it would be foolish to imagine that the fight against juvenile delinquency can be won merely by turning it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fight can be won Only if everybody works toward giving all children a better chance in life . We must be willing to put a firmer floor under family life . Such economic-aid programs as Aid to Dependent Children will have to be raised above a starvation level if they are effectively to maintain family life and thereby prevent delinquency . The growth of delinquency in slum areas can not be effectively controlled without vigorous development of low-cost housing projects . And , as the subcommittee was repeatedly reminded , even the beat housing projects have no effect whatever in halting delinquency if  --  as has sometimes been the ease  --  they fail to make adequate provision for playgrounds , recreation centers and other community services . III I 11 is becoming more and more ripper-eel Clint , among elder ! soya and girls , inability 10 100111%. jobs is ii highly important factor in the growl h of delinquency . Most of I hem are midi-nine &; Employers seldom welcome boys who will soon be eligible for military service . The child-labor and compulsory-education laws in this country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when their rigid applicntion is un fort umite and rimy contribute in delinquency . Experience shows I hat certain boys and girls play truant and become delinquents , because of a definitely limited ability to benefit from Iradiiimml school programs . As pointed out In I he subcommittee by the Nut innal Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers , many such youngsters would be heater off and in lees danger of getting into trouble if school authorities were given the legal right ? and exercised it ? to permit them to spend part of the school day at work . This , of course . is not a simple matter . Finding useful jobs for children under sixteen is extremely difficult because opportunities are limited and often undesirable . Even older children who may legally quit school have increasing difficulty in job hunting and are likely to spend their time loafing around the corner store looking for some way to gel a little cash . It is important to remember that not all children steal just because they hate Iheir mothers . Some steal because they need or want money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the opening up of more work opportunities specifically for teenagers . There are in private industry a substantial number of jobs that could be reserved for these youngsters if Roth management and labor co-operated on working out the problem . In addition , the Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers urged t hat " steps be taken on all levels of government to provide training and work experience programs for unemployed youth that will tide them over until they can take their places as productive workers in our economy . " It has been emphasized many times by competent authorities before the subcommittee that effective control of delinquency calls for more schools and more research into the basic causes of waywardness , as well as adequate and uniform state laws dealing with children . But it should not he forgotten , as so frequently happens , that such an obvious thing as honest and efficient law enforcement is also of utmost importance . Experience has frequently demonstrated what an aroused public opinion and a vigorous police force can do  --  as in Boston , for example . A long series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston in 1953 . For a number of years , teen-age gangs bad been operating in the area , healing up other youngsters with heavy garrison belts and , according to District Attorney Garrett H. Byrne , creating " a wave of terror " night after night . Despite a great deal of newspaper agitation , nothing much was done about the gangs . Some police officials minimised the trouble or said there was n't anything that the police could do . When Byrne took office he sent Iwo investigators into the area . Finally the police assigned 150 uniformed men on foot and in cruise cars to break up the gangs and act as " a roving sentry of law and order in full view of the youth of the city . " The gang beatings immediately THE Sial URBAN showed a drastic decrease . In effect , the police performed n kind of " holding action " that , while it did not get at the roots of delinquency , demonstrated they could protect the terrorized areas . Adequate lime and vigorous law enforcement are also needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . The tavern keeper who knowingly or carelessly sells alcohol to minors should be put out of business I hrough revocation of his license . The smut peddler who exchanges pornographic picture hooks for the dimes and dollars of adolescents should not be let off with h a slap on the wrist in the form of a small fine and a suspended jail sentence . We need laws , as pointed out in the subcommittee 's interim report , under which our courts can act far more rigorously against such offenders . We need police officers trained in protecting youngsters to patrol and check potential trouble spots . But , most of all , we need an aroused citizenry that will indignantly demand effective action on a continuing basis . What this can mean in the struggle to control delinquency was illustrated in the course of the subcommittee hearings in 1954 , again in Boston . As previously noted in these articles , witnesses before the subcommittee told how a dozen inverts ' and beer joints were openly selling liquor to juveniles and how , despite official reports from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such offenders by the licensing board . But four months after this was brought out at our public hearings we revisited these same taverns and found not a single teen-age customer in any of them . Instead , t here were large signs warning that no sales would be made to minors . Waiters repeatedly asked young men and young women to provide proof of their ages before being served . And police were making a regular check on all the taverns . Merely the publicity given to the situation in newspaper , radio and that . EVENING POST television accounts of I he ' subcommittee hearings had brought about a drastic change . In the course of these articles we have called attention to many facets of the complex and terrible problem of delinquency , some of which are open to obvious solutions , some of which depend upon the moral climate of our communities , and some of which may be fully understood only after further research and experience . Others , such as the serious problem of delinquency among Indian children , toward the solution of which Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots deep in custom , tradition and tribal mores . It is apparent only a few of the many interlocking parts of the problem can he discussed here , but some conclusions can Ire briefly summarized . For example , the breakdown of neighborhood relationships in modern life , as pointed out earlier , has removed many of the restraints and safeguards which once helped to protect adolescent children . Some of this protection can he restored by development and support of neighborhood councils I o handle juvenile problems and by eliminating various temptations to waywardness , A few years ago , the Michigan cities of Grand Rapids and Lansing had been plagued by teen-agers who " lion-owed " or stole automobiles at an alarming rate . As an experiment , both communities passed ordinances making it illegal for adults to leave an automobile unlocked in a public place . But they did n't just pass another law . They launched a public-education program with lectures and motion pictures to make citizens aware of the situation . Then the police vigorously enforced the law . Result : though automobile thefts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next four years , car thefts in Lansing and Grand Rapids decreased . There are numerous community efforts that have helped pave t he way to successful action against delinquency . Ty 3. laSS In Chicago , for instance , one of the most serious high-delinquency areas of the city was near the stock yards . A public agency  --  the Institute of Juvenile Research  --  made a special study of conditions and encouraged a few residents of the area to take over leader . ship of a cleanup movement . The churches and neighborhood organizations were drawn into what became known as the " Back of the Yards " movement . They inspired virtually the entire population with a spirit of cooperation to " do something " about the delinquency problem and , with the institute providing guidance , a blockby-block campaign was conducted in a manner that substantially reduced youthful waywardness in the area . This kind of co-ordinated effort can get results in any neighborhood or community that will face up to the facts , The war against juvenile delinquency is clearly a widely varied social-action program in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nobody who participated in the subcommittee 's long investigation could ignore one other essential requirement for success . It probably can be stated most simply in terms of the Golden Rule or of the Ten Commandments . Or it can be described in terms of Paul , a ten-year-old Negro boy who ' was sullen and defiant when we talked to him in a suburban detention home in a midwestern city after he had tried to strike a policeman with a club . Paul lived in a mixed neighborhood where racial tensions were strong . He was shut . out of the white school , shut out of the playground and shooed away from the movies . His father and mother resented this discrimination and spoke bitterly against their white neighbors . Paul had no place to play except in the streets of a deteriorated neighborhood . I When he went to the small church I near his home he could see , just across the street , a notorious gambling house which operated under the protection of crooked police and where , night after night , luxurious automobiles brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only world he knew . Unkindness and discrimination bred in him a feeling of resentment and hostility . Toleration of opulent vice increased his resistance to and his disrespect for law and order . And finally he exploded with a club in 11 his hand when a cop grabbed him during a boyish tight in the street . There is n't any way to enact it into law , but it is a hard fact that we need the Golden Rule in our struggle against delinquency . We need desperately to lift the moral climate of the community in which adult behavior and misbehavior set an example for impressionable adolescents . " Above everything else , " Sen. Robert C. Hendrickson has I pointed out , " juvenile delinquency is a moral problem . " As a society , we can not hold up examples of hate , crass materialism , greed and corruption to youth and expect pious precepts to overcome the devastating effects of our had example . Our churches and synagogues , our religious leaders can play an important role in re-emphasizing basic moral and spiritual values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form for our young people only as each of us puts them into practice in I our social relationships , our work and in our public services .
