Together , California 's Imperial and Coachella Valleys form one of the wonders of the New World . Stretching from the Mexican border to the outskirts of Los Angeles , the area is a lush , natural hothouse , larger than the state of Delaware and yielding as many as three crops a year ( " You plant the seeds , " a local saying goes , " and jump out of the way " ) . Within 50 years the valleys have been changed from sun-cracked desert ( summer temperatures range from 100 F. to 120 F. ) into one of the biggest irrigated regions on earth , and one of the richest . In this improbable winter garden last week , warming up for a congressional race , were two improbable political candidates : a platinum blonde who fought her way from hideous poverty to fame and riches , and a county judge with blue-black hair and coffee-colored skin who was born in Amritsar , India . <P> Barefoot Girl . The story of Candidate Jacqueline Cochran is beyond the rosiest dreams of Horatio Alger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she was born an estimated 47 years ago . Her childhood was spent in a succession of Florida and Georgia cracker shanties , in dreary sawmill towns at the dead ends of Tobacco Road . Her dresses were flour sacks , and she got her first shoes when she was eight . Starvation was always lurking outside the door , and Jackie ate mostly what she could steal or scrounge . She learned to read from the signs on railroad boxcars , went to work in a cotton mill when she was eight ( she had been a midwife before that ) . At eleven , she left home to work in a beauty parlor . <P> From such a bleak beginning , Jackie Cochran became a beautician , a nurse , a good airplane pilot , and the wife of Multimillionaire Floyd Odium . After her marriage , Jackie 's career ( or careers ) soared upward like a jet plane . As the head of her own nationally known cosmetics firm , she is a keen and successful business woman . As the U.S. 's No. 1 aviatress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of records , was the first woman to break through the sound barrier . During World War II she headed the women pilots ' ferrying service , the WASPs . As Mrs. Floyd Odium she is a social leader , a world traveler , the friend of celebrities . <P> Last November , when Republican John Phillips announced that he would give up his seat in Congress as the Representative of California 's 2gth District ( the Imperial and Coachella Valleys and surrounding wasteland ) , Jackie instantly tossed her Lilly Dache bonnet in the ring ( TIME , Nov. 14 ) . It was no feminine caprice : Jackie Cochran has long had a hankering to go to Congress , and , unlike many of the big landowners in the Imperial Valley ( 40% of the land is held by absentee owners ) , she has spent a great deal of the past 20 years personally operating the 600-acre Odium ranch , and is well known in the district . <P>                    @
