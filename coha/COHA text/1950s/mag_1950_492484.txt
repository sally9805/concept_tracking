The Reds are Rapping at Our Arctic Door By SALLY CARRIGHAR T the little Alaskan village of Wales one can look across Bering Strait and see Siberia clearly . It is the only place where the United States and Russia have a common boundary , and the boundary for a short distance here is also the International Date Line . The strait is just what such a significant channel should be ? wild , wind-driven water , pouring back and forth between headlands . The current usually flows north on our side and south on the Siberian side . Shoals and reefs make it a hazardous passage . In almost exactly the center , like stranded ships , rise two small rocky islands , the Diomedes . We own one and Russia the other . On each is an Eskimo village . The islands are only three miles apart . The Siberian coast is a high brush-covered slope , Which flattens down into tundra in some places , in other places drops steeply into the sea . It appears to be uninhabited , but Eskimos live in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers . They support themselves as the Eskimos on our side of the Bering Sea do ? by hunting whales , walruses and seals , and to a less extent by trapping land animals . Theirs is a very specialized culture , dominated by frost in the soil , which prohibits agriculture , and by the ice on the sea in winter . The Soviet rulers in Moscow are more than 5000 miles from these hamlets that face Alaska . Are they trying to communize subjects so far away and so isolated ? If so , how can Marxist principles be applied to an economy so different from that of industrial Europe ? During 1948 and 1949 , which I spent in Eskimo towns of Alaska , I heard that some of our island natives had visited in Siberia recently . I decided to find them and question them . It would be interesting to know how our American Eskimos are reacting to the changes that they have seen  --  if there are changes  --  in the Siberian villages . Would the American Eskimos welcome invaders who came bringing communism ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and St. Lawrence who have gone to Siberia regularly . These islands became United States territory when we bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 . Before that , the islanders , being nearer Siberia than Alaska , had turned their boats westward when they set out to trade , and they continued to do so . Many have relatives in the Siberian towns . In fact , our islanders speak the Siberian Eskimo dialect . Until almost this very year both parent nations have been lenient about travel and even migration across the boundary . Any Little Diomede Islander with some cigarettes that he wanted to trade for Siberian fox skins could get in his kayak and paddle to Russia 's Big Diomede . He could beach his boat , eat a dinner of muktuk with friends , make his deal and depart for his own island village . The Big Diohouses in Gambell , with his wives and their families established on different floors . Up in the Bering Sea , then , there has been a microcosm of international harmony , but it came to an end during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be described presently ? made further visits impossible . When the islanders want to trade , they come to our mainland now , on Government ships . In past times some actually have made the 200-mile voyage in umiaks , and I wondered how as I set out on my own trip to St. Lawrence Island . Our 180-foot ship , facing one of the world 's most violent oceans , staggered across and through mountains of water . The thought of a small skin boat , heaved and dropped on that surface as helplessly as an inflated balloon would be , stopped the mind with terror . Gambell is out on the northwestern point of the island . There is no harbor . We anchored and went ashore in dories over that active current . Pebble dunes , fifteen to twenty feet high , are drifted along the beach . One sinks to the ankles in gravel at every step on the walk to the village , which is built back from the water , close to the shelter of circling mountains . It is a bleak scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tree or shrub . Fog usually hides all but the base of the mountains . On one slope is the burial ground , where the bodies  --  of women and children lowest , men higher according to hunting skill ? are laid out in open sepulchers . In the clean cold air of the North the bodies dry , mummify , instead of decaying . The small houses are made of imported lumber . Most are six-sided , with window-sized doors set about thirty inches above the floor . I said to one of the Eskimos that the houses looked Russian . He denied that they were , and spoke with so much emotion that I repeated the conversation to the wife of one of our weathermen stationed there . She said that the Gambell Eskimos no longer want to admit any evidence of a Siberian origin . Although I came in July , the natives were wearing what the Eskimos on our mainland do in the winter  --  fur parkas with smocklike covers of cotton cloth . Their dress was similar , yet the islanders , like their dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Their coloring is less ruddy , their cheeks are less round and full , and their manner is more restrained than that of the Eskimos on the Alaskan mainland . I could hardly imagine that they would speak English , and yet they should , having been taught in an American school . How to start talking to them ? At Unalakleet and other Alaskan villages I had learned that Eskimos think in subtle ways and should be addressed with sincerity and respect for their minds . And so I spoke to the first islander that I met  --  an elderly man ? as I would to any intelligent person at home . " I am hoping to talk to someone who will tell me about Oongahzek . In the States we are rather afraid of the communists , but we do n't really know what they are doing , any more than I know what the top of that mountain looks like behind the fog . If we dill know , maybe we 'd be less afraid , maybe more , but it 's better to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a door opening . He took me into his house , where I met his wife and his son and the son 's wife . The house was like all Eskimo dwellings , uncluttered , functional . We sat at the table and talked . The old man , Peter , had not gone to Oongahzek for fifteen years , but he knew of conditions there and had his opinions about them . His face under his graying hair is as firm as a muscular brown fist , and his eyes are sharp and far-looking . The son , Conrad , supplied most of the information . He has been in Siberia several times , most recently only three years ago . He is more exuberant than most islanders , and is one of the Gambell athletes . Later I saw him kick , with both feet at once , a ball suspended seven feet above the ground . It is an Eskimo sport in which a man , leaping , jackknifes both his legs upward . Peter explained in Eskimo what I wanted , and I began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ? . yes .. " Many ? As many Russians as there are Americans in Nome ? " " Not many . Only government men and teachers . " Conrad had answered , but the father replied when I asked , " Have the Russians been in Siberia long ? twenty , thirty years ? " " Before communist revolution no Russians live on Siberian coast . After , they do not come for ten years , maybe . Eskimo same as before . But now everything change . " " How changed ? " " The boats are changed . " An Eskimo 's boat is the most essential thing that he owns , and so Conrad would speak of them first . " There are no more umiaks in Siberia , because the government sends all the walrus skins out to Russia . We think they make shoes out of them . " " If an Eskimo catches his own walruses  --  enough of-them  --  ca n't he still make an umiak ? " " He can not keep one skin . He can not keep anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal , everything , he must give to the government store . " An angry Eskimo generally looks troubled rather than fierce . Now Peter 's eyes were becoming distressed . I continued to question Conrad , " Are the natives paid for these animals ? " " I do not think they are paid in money . They can get other things at the store for them , but they can not get whatever they want , only what the government-store man thinks they should have . Anyway , for one third of the seal they will not be paid . One third is put in a stockpile of food . When a man can not work for some reason , his family is fed from that supply . " I said , " Would that seem like a good idea , perhaps ? You would not have to worry ? " The old man burst into the conversation , " Eskimo always have share ! You come to this village , You are stranger , we feed you . We help each other , we give to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our seal and give it to somebody else . We want to give it . If government man say , You must share ; I will make you share , ' we do not need to have any good feelings , any kind thoughts , any more . Russian way make people selfish . " Conrad carried the point further : " An Eskimo likes to think , ' I can get everything that my family needs , and maybe a little bit more ; maybe take care of somebody who is old and can not hunt . ' It proves that a man is a good hunter if he can furnish the food for more than his own family . " " How about the Siberian Eskimos now  --  do they hunt as well as they used to ? " Conrad answered , " I do not know if they hunt as well , but they do not like the wood boats . A skin boat is light ; it rides all on top of the water . A wood boat sinks down too far . It goes slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the ice , they take their boat out of the water and pull it across . A wood boat is too heavy . Those wood boats are no good for Eskimos . They do not have any pride in them , because anyway , they do not own them . " " The Eskimos do not own them ? " " The government owns them . One time a crew will use one boat , the next time another boat . " Conrad could hardly have spoken with more resentment if the Russians had carried away his own umiak . For an Eskimo loves his boat as an American boy loves his car , or perhaps more , since he has made the boat with his own hands and risked his life to secure the skins . As the boat carries its crew without harm through tempestuous water or rotten Ice , as it slides away swiftly from an attacking walrus or whale , it comes to seem almost mystically associated with a hunter 's good luck . The communists try a bold experiment when they substitute a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Many American Eskimos now use outboard motors . I asked whether the Eskimos in Siberia use them . " Yes , and the government owns the motors too . The government owns everything . " The old man led the talk to another grievance : In Siberia now one man all time hunt . Other man , he all time go upriver for water . Other man all time make fishnet . Eskimo like to change work Many Americans do . In some settlements we have teachers and other community workers who respect Eskimos for their poise and intelligence . But too many tr6at them as children ? children of an inferior race  --  and they show plainly and rudely their disgust with the Eskimo diet . Eskimos are not children . They have a more complex language than ours , a larger daily vocabulary , besides which they readily learn to speak English , whereas very few white Alaskans attempt to learn more than a dozen Eskimo words . When Americans talk down to Eskimos , the natives act dumb , a carefully practiced way of responding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no defense against our dislike of their food or rather our tactless way of revealing it . An American offered one of their delicacies , a piece of white-whale skin or a seal liver , too often shudders , and the Eskimos have become very sensitive about this reaction . But the Russians " like seal meat and walrus meat . " They eat it or at /east they do not treat it as something vile . They do not need to protest that they are democratic . From the Eskimos ' standpoint , they have proved it . " Another thing ! " Conrad said , in-terrupting embarrassing thoughts . " The Russians have bring  --  what do You say ? A balalaika orchestra to Oongahzek . I have heard that Russian Music . I like it better than jazz . " Peter agreed vigorously , " I hear that music last time I go to Siberia . It make ! tie feel good  --  maybe like hunting even if ice running big . " Conrad continued , " The communists have taught Eskimos how to do Russian dances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskimos do them better than Russians , I think . " It was quite possible that they would , for native Eskimo dances include high vertical jumps , executed with marvelous strength and precision . " Now some of the Eskimo women at Oongahzek wear Russian dresses . They have ? " For a moment Conrad could not think of the word . " Skirts ! Come down to their feet , and so wide ! When the women dance , those pretty skirts swing ? " 95 His hands , held palms down in front of him , swirled . To bring an orchestra and full skirts to the Eskimos may be the equivalent of buying their good will with beads , but we are not realistic if we do not recognize that the plan is effective . In Unalakleet , where I stayed for ten months , the American missionaries have forbidden dancing , including Eskimo dancing , for so many years that a generation has grown up without learning this traditional Eskimo art . I asked Peter and Conrad about drinking in the Siberian towns . Have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . He said , however , that the Siberians make a home-brew of imported flour . Conrad wanted to talk about the Siberian native sports , and some of what he told helped to show the kind of people the communists are attempting to mold . Later , when a Little Diomede Islander told me how well the Siberians take to hook learning , I remembered how primitive they had sounded when Conrad described their games . " The fait time we went to Oongahzek , the Siberians had a celebration . First a ball game  --  that went on for twenty-four hours . Men and women both played in it . They did n't care how hard , they did n't care who got hurt . After the ball game there was a race . We ran around and around a track , men and children , until we were so tired we could not run any more . " " A kind of endurance contest ? " " Something like that . Next there were wrestling matches . This time I kept out , because the Siberians will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . A few years ago I was at Nome . Three Siberians came there to trade . Somebody said to me that the Siberians wanted to wrestle . I said , ' I have wrestled in Oongahzek . I will try it ! ' The first Siberian gave me a sudden hard punch in the chest . It knocked out my breath . So I said to myself , ' I guess I will have to fight their way . ' So I did , I did everything to win , and I beat all three of those Siberian Eskimos . " But I must not brag . The Siberians brag too much in their talk . The last time I went to Oongahzek , some hunters came in with many geese over their shoulders . King geese ? No , you say emperor geese . The other Eskimos hollered , ' See how many they get ! The men of Oongahzek are great hunters ! ' Did they think we were stupid ? That month was July , and geese can not fly 96 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters pulled the geese out of the ponds with their hands . Boys of five and six do it . We laughed at those hunters , those great hunters . " We laughed at something else . Every day in Oongahzek there is a meeting . The men in the Eskimo council put their red uniforms on and call everybody together . That makes the council feel big . They talk about something solemnly for a little while , and then the meeting is over . The Russians have built a community house for the meetings and also for dances . There was a fine dance while we were there . I have told you  --  that lively dancing ! Well ! The council came marching into the dance . Everybody stopped , the orchestra stopped . And they had the day 's meeting , all at once everything sober . When the council marched out , t he dancing began again . We thought that was funny ! " " What was the meeting about ? " Conrad sincerely tried to remember . " I am not sure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do they all have rifles ? " " Yes , and the women too . The women drill with their rifles . " " Women drill long time , " Peter said . " Even before last war , women at Oongahzek drill . . . like soldiers . " " Children drill too , " Conrad said . " I do not think they have rifles , but they march , they are taught to fight . I will tell you about one boy twelve years old . Always I have wanted to know what is behind those mountains around Oongahzek . ' Is there game in those mountains ? ' I asked myself . ' Is there a road goes all the way out to Russia ? Or maybe guns , maybe barracks ? ' Every time I went to Oongahzek , I asked those questions , but the men would not answer . They turned their faces away . " The last time I asked this boy  --  a smart boy , I thought he would know . He did know , but he would not tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must not tell what is behind the mountains . ' I gave him a candy bar . He was glad to get that , but still he would not tell me . It was summer , and so it was light all night . We went down to the beach and I showed him our boat . I took the motor apart so he could see how it runs . All night I explained that motor . But still that boy would not tell me what is behind the mountains . How do the Russians make a young boy so strong in his thoughts ? " " Yes , how do they ? " " I do not know , " Conrad said . I learned more about the training of young Siberians from a Little Diomede Islander , Ralph . Not really " Ralph . " It would not be wise to use the real names of these Eskimos , inasmuch as they probably have Siberian relatives . Ralph has gone several times to East Cape , the town at the Asiatic side of the Bering Strait , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward tribe brought up to the level of white men 's learning . " We islanders used to criticize them ? they were so much like savages . Men and women dressed alike , in a fur coverall , never changed . They were not clean . Their weapons and tools were as crude as could be and still do the job , and no care was given to them . But the communist schools have made those natives a different people . All the children learn English as well as Russian , and they grow up to be airplane pilots , weather observers and technicians . " I wondered if Ralph approved of all that communism has introduced in the Eskimo towns , but he does not . " When the communist governors came to Siberia , they found natives willing to be talebearers . They put them into a secret-police system . At first some of the Eskimos probably joined through fear , but they soon found that they had a new power . They were the smaller people  --  otherwise they would not have allowed themselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to destroy anyone . The system is a growing corruption because the talebearers have to keep turning up evidence in order to stay in their jobs . What if there is nowhere any instance of disloyalty or wickedness ? What do you think a talebearer might do in that case ? There are no trials in Siberia like American trials . A man can not prove that he has not done a thing of which suddenly he may be accused . All he is guilty of maybe is carelessness . You can see fear in all the faces in East Cape now . " Ralph said that the ancient religion is banned in Siberia . It was much the same as the one practiced by the Alaskan Eskimos and included belief in a " Man of the Universe " who could annihilate any evil or morose human being . It was a heathen religion by the missionaries ' definition , but it promoted the Eskimos ' just and generous attitude and was a good religion if results are what count . During the summer of 1948 there was excited concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors . They had gone to Big Diomede for a few hours ' trading , and more than fifty days later had not returned . Finally they did come back , and we heard only that they were much emaciated . I intended to go to Little Diomede to interview some of them , but they came , almost the whole village , to Kotzebue , where I was staying . Their umiaks took shape in the offshore fog early one morning . The helmsmen brought the boats broadside to the beach , and the islanders in their parkas and sealskin boots waded ashore . The year before they had gone to East Cape . Now they came ten times as far , to an American village , to do their trading . One of the young men , Frank Okpealuk , had been among the group held on Big Diomede . A year later he was conspicuously healthy . As he walked around town , he might have been a dark-tanned American , a dentist perhaps , on vacation . I found him sitting with another islander , Simon Ahkolik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied to my questions , with Simon , who also had been imprisoned , approving his answers . I asked first , " Why do you think the Russians arrested you ? " " They wanted to ask us some things . " " Who asked them ? " " A Russian captain . He was n't there when we came . We were met on the beach by the soldiers stationed on Big Diomede . They were armed , and they told us that we were prisoners . " " Where did they put you ? in jail ? " " In tents . There were guards outside all the time with rifles . " I asked if they were mistreated . " Not except for the food . The only thing that we had to eat for fifty-two days was watery soup . " " When the Russian captain came , what did he want to know ? " " He wanted to know about Alaska . What fortifications we have , how many landing fields and where they are . He asked how many planes we have based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he wanted to know about the troops , the same thing  --  how many and where . " " Did the captain force you to give him any information ? " " Not accurate information , " said Frank . The St. Lawrence Islanders will not have that unfortunate experience , for they have been warned . The year after Conrad 's last trip to Oongahzek , a white Russian named Minikoff escaped from his Siberian prison and made his way to the town , accompanied by his five-year-old son . They were bound for the island , American territory . Under the very pistols of the Russian authorities , they secured in Oongahzek a boat , motor and gasoline , all communist-government property , and did reach the St. Lawrence village of Gambell . The communists sent a boatload of Eskimos after them , but Minikoff and the boy hid among cartons of food in the teacher 's commissary and were not discovered . The Siberians stayed for a week , which must have been a confusing time for them . They were communists whose political loyalty the officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the islanders were the friends and relatives of these men . When the visitors saw the helium cylinders at the airfield , they thought they were bombs . They showed the American Eskimos that they were pleased to think there was some defense on the island . The Siberian natives had had to help the Russians install long-range guns on the mainland , but at least their American relatives could shoot back . When they were told that the torpedo-shaped objects contained only gas , they said they were sorry . The Siberians were dressed well ; some in European clothes . Their leader had spent ten years in Russia , part of the time in war service and the rest in acquiring a higher education , and the islanders thought that he must be an officer , since the other Siberians always greeted him with the closed-fist salute . The island Eskimos had known him as a boy , on their annual trips to Oongahzek . Then he had had the typical Eskimo 's happy temperament . Now he never smiled . Intensely purposeful and well-groomed  --  wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change that civilization , or at least communism , can make in an Eskimo . The Siberians were inquisitive about the Weather Bureau equipment and the Civil Aeronautics control room . They were as eager for American products as the Siberian Eskimos always had been . They traded for crates of oranges and apples and cases of cigarettes , but they took the fruit out of its wrappings and the cigarettes out of the packages before starting home with them . Asked why , they said that they had been told not to bring back one word of American printed matter . When the week was over , the men from Oongahzek set . out for the return trip in the government 's wooden whaleboat . The farewells disturbed the American Eskimos . The visitors left a warning ? astonishing , troubling ? that the American Eskimos must not come to Oongahzek again , not for trading or sociability . Why ? " You will be put in prison , " said the Siberian Eskimos . " We will do nothing wrong . " " Do not come ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , we will ride over and tell you . Until then , stay away . " " When it is safe again ? " Sometime the friendly visits must be resumed . The Eskimos at Oongahzek apparently feel , with the rest of the world , that a state of distrust and fear can not he permanent .
