FOR six years the industries devoted to the manufacture and sale of records and sound-reproducing equipment generally have been growing at a spectacular rate . Presumably there must at some point be a slowing down , even a regression , as the plateau of balance between supply and demand is approached But no one can yet say with anything like authority just where that plateau will turn out to be One thing is sure : the total sales for 1954 will reach somewhere between $300,000,000 and $400,000,000 The upswing began almost exactly as soon as Columbia Records , in the fall of 1948 , took the cold plunge everyone in the record industry , as it was then constituted , feared , and released the first commercial long-playing records They were successful , to put it mildly , and while one of the other two major producers , London , waited to see just how successful and the other , RCA Victor , countered by releasing the first 45-rpm records , a whole regiment of smaller companies cropped up to issue LP 's . Aside from their novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two advantages they had over the old , conventional 78-rpm records  --  convenience and economy . However , these advantages had not much to do with the pro , liferation of small companies .. This was made possible by the fact that , in the meantime , tape recording had been perfected , or very nearly so , and that LP 's are , characteristically , engraved from taped performances in the laboratory in-stead of from wax discs engraved laboriously and at huge expense , five perfect minutes at a time , with the performing forces cooped up in a recording studio of special design . Thus the initial outlay necessary to go into the record business was drastically reduced , and , in effect , anyone with money enough to buy a tape machine  --  or even money enough to buy bootleg radio tapes in Europe  --  could design his own label , hire a telephone answering service , and be a record company . Columbia itself , out of a desire to establish the new speed , more than anything else , set up a kind of out-patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faced with this , both RCA Victor and London capitulated to the trend and went into LP production themselves , and since its plants are in this country , RCA Victor also began to sell its engineering services to the independents . Obviously , bailing subtleties of the Sherman Act , - this customer-competitor relationship of the small companies to Columbia and RCA Victor puts everyone in a rather tippy social position , but so long as business continues to be as good as it is , - tightening of the noose would be mere humorous caprice When and if a real price war starts , the story may be different . From the customer 's point of view , the only trouble with LP was that the turntables commercially available in 1948 revolved at 78 rpm , at least approximately , and had no provision for gearing down to 331/2 . This meant that anyone buying his first LP had also to invest in at least a new turntable Columbia provided one  --  a cheap , simply designed unit that could be plugged into almost any amplifier-speaker setup It bridged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many people still had . 78 's for which they had a special fondness , and the constant plugging in and unplugging was a nuisance This was the public entree of the term " high fidelity " For the customer in ' search of a turntable capable of playing his records at the proper speeds had , at first , to deal with manufacturers of professional audio equipment , which had for some time been infinitely superior in design and performance to any used in even the best commercial radio-pliono-% graph combinations The story is familiar . Experiment was in the air , and , given , that fact , normal human motivations did the rest More and more people began to scrap the cabinetry and assemble in formations of their own devising components that gave them what sound-engineering hobbyists had for a good while called " high-fidelity " reproThe NATION auction , by which was meant , simply , reproduction of the full range of frequencies audible , or theoretically audible , to the human ear , with as little distortion of any kind as possible . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers and their advertising and promotion men , who began to use it to describe all manner of sound boxes , including television sets , that fell far short of anything even remotely describable as " high fidelity . " All the buyer can do is beware of claims that , if not actually fraudulent , are apt to result in unwise spending of considerable money . The situation is not helped by the fact that even the most reputable manufacturers do not agree straight down the line on just what high fidelity is , and certainly ' not in terms that are understandable to the average layman . The best advice that can be given is always to remember that " high " in connection with " fidelity " is necessarily comparative ? the expression of an ideal , not of an absolute  --  and that the best criterion that can be applied is that of " naturalness. " - The small original high-fidelity clique , with its cabalistic Jargon , its affinity for strange noises , and its general disputatiousness , bore the reputation of being an odd lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as it has expanded has gained others , but it also had plenty of normal , intelligent peo , ple who were simply interested in obtaining the best possible reproduction of sound , and this element is by now a clear majority . More and more people interested primarily in music , and knowledgeable about it , have become interested in high fidelity . It is great fun to pretend that all owners of high-fidelity " rigs " are lunatics interested only in high-frequency " silent " dog whistles and sixteen-foot organ stops that affect the viscera quite as much as they do the eardrums , but it simply is n't so . However , neither is it so that ownership of a shelf of high-fidelity components is any guaranty of taste in their use . It may be that only ' the dedicated hi-fi really knows what everyone - else is missing in the way of music at home . On the other hand , it is just as possible that what he is hearing and everyone else is missing is something that no one in the least musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of recording , records capable of preserving , and components capable of playing back music at extended frequencies , the engineers have also left almost limitless possibility for human error . No matter how clearly the piccolo is recognizable as a piccolo , the bass drum as a bass drum , it is hard to assign aesthetic value to music that has been mangled because someone in the complex process of getting the music into the . living-room twisted the wrong knob . The simplest recording process , under modern conditions , is complicated and frighteningly delicate . Similarly , the home equipment necessary to play recordings is delicate enough in its behavior to make its operation a test of musicality as well as of common sense and manual dexterity . By now almost everyone must have heard the horrid thumpings that can come from a perfectly balanced - iecord just because , as the owner of it says , " I like more bass than they put in , " or the weird keenings that can be given off by the same record in the power . of a sound-dabbler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to picture the world as getting more , and more musical every day in , every possible way with the sale of an-other LP record or another well-designed audio component The theory seems to be that , given the materials to work with , taste will tell , and everyone will be able , perhaps at once , perhaps after a few mistakes of judgment , to put a recording of unspecified characteristics on a turntable , twist the right knobs , and hear the music as it should be heard , without previous experience of it anywhere else , save perhaps in the house of a similarly gifted friend operating under similar conditions . It has been my observation that - this **25;1392;TOOLONG theory has a way of working out very haphazardly When all music tends to come out either bass-heavy or screaming , it does give pause . And when almost everything is played so loudly that the experience becomes mainly physical rather than auditory , it gives even longer pause . Certainly there is great value in being able to listen to music at home , especially so now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly are capable of giving at least a reasonable impression of a living performance But it would be a terrible mistake to think that music on records can do more than that . It would be even worse if because of en-thusiasm for music on records we were to raise up a generation of listeners who entirely on them for their musical experience , guessing as they went along ? for that is what it amounts to  --  how a live concert would sound , what an opera performance would be like in the opera house . Ever and always , a loudspeaker will be a loudspeaker and two Ioudspeakers two loudspeakers And Carnegie Hall is Carnegie Hall , not anybody 's living room . - There can be great value in listening again and again to a fine performance on records , , or , better still to two or three fine-performances of the same work on records . Much can be learned that way , both about the music and about the techniques of performance . But the most important thing that can be learned in this way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more it is repeated  --  not necessarily because the music has less to offer the second time but because the ear comes to know in advance what is to be revealed This simply means that in music as a performing art the recreative function is vitally important , and that repeated experiences of music as it pulses and flows in performances that are never quite the same on different occasions , in different contexts , is vital to the formation of real musical taste and discrimination . Without such experiences no one can take the finest and most modern audio equipment and be sure that his manipulations are helping rather than harming the effect . This problem  --  almost more than the problem of repertoire on-records  --  is basic to consideration of the effect of high fidelity on our musical taste Today , with LP and the technical developments that are loosely called high fidel , ity , it is possible for the first tithe to stay at home and hear something enough like full orchestra concerts and opera performances to be aesthetically satisfying . If this stimulates an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it makes us a nation of sedentary , non-participating listeners  --  a kind of aural television audience that gives nothing back to the performers , and , worse , contents itself with rehearing over and over the same officially pronounced " definitive high-fidelity " performances  --  it can end by being very bad indeed There is evidence both ways , for although it seems sure that performers build audiences for themselves by making recordings , it is equally sure that dollars spent on recordings are , usually , dollars not spent at box offices . And there is so far little-indication that audience-building through records , is doing much for the music of our own time  --  which , after all , is the music that must have a hearing if our musical life is to grow in any direction . No one can deny that it is a good thing for there to be available on records an imposing list of Bach cantatas , of Mozart chamber works , of Verdi operas . It is also valuable to have available for all , rather than a few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Schutz , by Monteverdi , by Vivaldi . From the standpoint of one primarily interested in serious music , it is worth noting that , percentage-wise , more LP 's of ponderable works were sold last year than ever before , with a corresponding decrease in 78-rpm and 45-rpm popular records , even though the leading seller at RCA Victor was a record of Mario Lanza playi-ng Caruso  --  hardly the greatest'artistic triumph of the year but serious music , by and large , at any rate , Bach sold well , for smaller companies , and so , for everybody , did Beethoven , Brahms , Schubert , Tchaikovsky , and other " staple " composers . But it is a plain disgrace that of all Roy Harris 's works only two are to be heard on records , and only two by Wallingford Rieg-* ger , to name but two contemporary Americans of proved status . It is all very well for the record mak-. ers to say , when questioned about contemporary music , that it is up to the public to lead the way , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on , but they can hardly answer so and still claim much-credit for broadening the American people 's musical taste . If they are going to claim credit for bringing music at all to the great outland mass of music lovers and potential music lovers pictured as being untouched by live performances , then they can hardly escape responsibility for the kind of music they ' bring them . In the face of statistics , it would be difficult to deny that the recorded-music boom brought about by LP and high fidelity is having a great influence on the listening habits of Americans . Whether the influence will turn out to be salutary can not be told . If , to Americans , music becomes something that is bought by brand name and then " appreciated " at home , without active participation even to the extent of sitting in an audience , persons seriously concerned with music itself will not feel very happy . Nor will they if broadening of musical taste turns out to mean simply digging deeper and deeper and farther and farther back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do build a vital new audience , interested in listening to music as music and in finding out what musical creativity in their own time amounts to , everyone should be pleased with the development .
