txt So far as I am able to discover , the New York Times is the only newspaper in the United States which still prints daily the full text of the official communiqu  --  s issued by various military high commands of the United States . This might make an impression upon the Defense Department , which has allowed publicity men to take over the writing of communiques to such an extent that their flamboyancy has rendered them almost useless as a sou  --  ce of information . American armed forces possess a tradition in communique writing . Every school child can remember Commodore Perry 's report from the Battle of Lake Erie : " We have met the enemy and they are ours . Two ships . two brigs , one schooner , and one sloop . " Then there was General Sherman 's message of Dec. 22 , 1864 , to President Lincoln : " I beg to present to you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah , with 150 guns and plenty of ammunition , and also about 25,000 bales of cotton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tradition . A A A It would take a military historian to trace the tradition back to its origins . I do not happen to know what kind of reports Hannibal sent back to Carthage from before the walls of Rome or whether the Greek commanders in the Peloponnesian Wars limited themselves to fact . But by the timeof Julius Caesar the practice of terse , factual war reporting was established . He reported the conquest of Gaul in three words : " Veni , vidi , vici . " Good Communiques do not have to be brief . Sometimes the story calls for detail . For such reporting the British Admiralty 's accounts of the Battle of the Platte River and the chase of the Bismarck during the last war are as fine as anything on record . There is not a superfluous or bombastic word . Those reports tell the stories as a sailor would tell them , not as a copy writer for an " underarm deodorant . " A A A During the last war most official communiques stuck to the old style . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is the way SHAEF reported the relief of the 101st irborne Division at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge : " Allied forces advancing from the south have made contact with units holding Bastogne at a point about three miles south of the town . During the period of encirclement units in Bastogne inflicted severe damage on the enemy , and on the day before their relief they repulsed two German attacks . In the first attack , made by an estimated two regiments of infantry and a large number of tanks , an estimated 27 tanks were destroyed and 250 prisoners taken . A similar attack was contained later , and in a third attack the enemy lost four out of five tanks taking part . " The latest war communique from Tokyo on my desk starts out : " Fifth Air Force fighters roared into the air in clearing weather today to resume destructive attacks on Communist targets . " The difference between the two is in the use of adjectives . The adjective is the instrument of the publicity man and propagandist , not of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air for " destructive " attacks on " Communist " targets , the old art of the factual communiqu ? is lost . Hitler is largely to blame for the intrusion of propaganda into the war communiqu  --  s . Reports from his headquarters and also from the German high command usually sounded as though they had been written by Dr. Goebbels , although the German Army itself stuck to the old tradition almost to the end . * Not until the Korean war did American official communiqu  --  s go overboard . The navy was the last branch of the service to succumb , but it , too , finally reached for the adjectives . There was once a good market for war communiques . Most big city newspapers printed them in full daily . The new technique has so debased their currency that only the determination of the New York Times to " print all the news that 's fit to print " keeps them in public circulation . The New York Herald Tribune published its last communique . text on July 24 , 1950.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
