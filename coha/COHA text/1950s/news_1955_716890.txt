txt Stock market investigations are , apparently , as unpredictable as the stock market itself . Not since the midget climbed on J. Pierpont Morgan 's knee during the stock market investigation of the early 1930 's has Congress received the surprise it did when a meek and unknown spectator stepped forward at the current stock market hearings to tell the experts how the Dow-Jones Index works . No one , it seems , not even the head of the American Stock Exchange or bank experts on the Senate Banking Committee could explain how the Dow-Jones averages are arrived at . In embarrassed desperation , Senator Homer Capehart ( R ) of Indiana , asked , " Ca n't somebody explain this ? " Silence . " Any-body ! " Whereupon , to the amazement and amusement of . all , a mild , little man disentangled himself from the rest of the spectators and shyly stepped for the microphone . Amateur Investor ' Morton M. Adler , an investor " from Rye , a quiet voice and a of words , he had the all cleared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tipsters , and revive the recently expired contract-negotiation law to prevent the making of exorbitant profits from government . defense contracts .

Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas . With reference to the growing interest in stock tips , Edward R. McCormick , president of the American Stock Exchange , told the committee that a recent " tip " broadcast by Walter Winchell brought a flood of orders for a Venezuelan oil stock .

In fact , more than 62 per cent of all stock purchases today are reported to be by individuals , brokers , institutions , and others making up the rest . One reason given for this heavy plunging in the market by the average man is the fact that the American people today have the money to invest  --  with billions of it in liquid savings , With stock prices continually pushing up to new highs , the urge to " get in on the market " has been increasing , with investors going in heavily for common stocks , and venturing more and more into the speculative field . Margin requirements were raised from 50 to 60 per cent by the federal reserve board in 1954 in an effort to check the jump in margin-buying . In 1946 , the board raised margin requirements to 100 per cent to curb post-war speculation . Then in 1950 the requirements were lowered to 75 per cent .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
