txt Members of the House ' Ways and Means Committee who voted final approval of a 20 r &; withholding tax on interest and dividend payments can not have thought through to the practical consequences of such an effort to increase Treasury revenue . They are act7 ually proposing to " soak the poor " and leave them no escape from such a fate except through troublesome and delaying claims for refund of taxes to which they are not liable . As the Committee 's plan stands , it would require corporations to withhold from all interest payments on their bonds and dividends on their stock . Banks would be compelled to withhold from interest payments on savings deposits and so would building and loan associations . Even the government would have to withhold from interest on taxable ( nearly all ) federal obligations . including that on tax refunds . All this great accounting task v. ould absorb scarce manpower . It would add to the operating expenses of hundreds of thousands of business enterprises without adding to the production of anything . It would necessitate art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Truman urged all department and agency heads to " conserve manpower . " But the wastefulness and clumsiness of this device is not its worst aspect . Hundreds of thousands if not millions of persons receiving so little income that they are exempt from federal taxation obtain it in the form of dividends on a few shares of stock or interest on a bond or two , or extremely small yields on savings deposits . All these will be deprived of a fifth of their scant income for as long as it takes the Revenue Bureau to " process " their claims for-refunds Can anybody guess how long it will take the Bureau to work its way through a deluge of these claims ? The Committee 's excuse for approving this scheme of misguided " tax experts " is its belief that it would collect an estimated $423 million due from but not now obtained from persons who fail to include interest and dividends received in their tax returns . That is , neither the Treasury nor the House Committee can think of any other way to get at these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment on great numbers of others in no wise guilty of evasion.
