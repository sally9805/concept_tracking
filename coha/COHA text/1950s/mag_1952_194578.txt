Manhattan 's art season was out of the doldrums and clipping along under full sail . From 57th Street to Greenwich Village last week , the galleries opened 40 new shows . Among the most interesting : <P> JACKSON POLLOCK , who once flirted with form in his abstract paintings , then rejected it for pure drippings from a paint can , now seems to be swinging slowly back to brush &; palette art . In five of his 14 new canvases there are signs of brush work , and in four of them there is a bow to form : a writhing , half-kneeling woman , a grotesque head , a suggestion of an animal . The rest is mostly recognizable Pollock : rich blots and dribbles of free-running color . <P> DRAWINGS FROM Punch , a collection of 150 cartoons by 50 of the artists who give Britain 's venerable funny magazine its polite kick . Punch 's jesters like the same simple lines , merrily exaggerated expressions , and hapless characters as their U.S. counterparts : bumbling doctors , madcap crooks , chesty admirals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraitist who has been out of sight for six years studying the old masters ' techniques , at last is ready to show off the results . His 26 formal portraits seem as relaxed and unposed as snapshots ; his subjects are caught speaking , smiling , playing . Two of the smoothest : a winning study of a redheaded youngster totally absorbed in playing with watercolors , a musician 's wife leaning attentively forward as if listening to chamber music . <P> JEAN AUGUSTS DOMINIQUE INGRES , a rare look at the work of a conservative 19th century ( 1780-1867 ) French master who was never fully appreciated in the U.S. during his lifetime . The Ingres Museum in his native Montauban has combed its collection of 4,000 paintings and drawings , sent over 53 of the master 's finest : 16 religious scenes , landscapes and portraits , 37 delicate drawings of prancing nude dancers , a Madonna-like head , a ragged Roman beggar , a man playing cards . All show Ingres ' love of classic line and precise detail . One of his mannered best : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays homage to young Julie Forestier , whom he was engaged to marry but later deserted . ( Julie , the legend goes , put off all subsequent suitors with the statement : " When you have had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres , you do n't marry . " ) Next stops for the exhibit , after a month in Manhattan : Manchester , N.H. , Detroit , Cincinnati , Cleveland , San Francisco .
