In 1854 , William Russell Grace a refugee from the Irish potato famine and a partner in a small ship chandler 's store seven miles from Lima , Peru , changed trades . He decided that he could make more money selling guano fertilizer ( bird droppings ) than from ship supplies He was right . By the time he died in 1904. his W. R. Grace &; Co. was a multimillion-dollar empire whose ship lines , sales agencies , railroads and import-export business touched almost every town and hamlet along South America 's west coast . <P> Last week the company started on a change that was almost as important as the one Bill Grace made some 98 years ago : it began in earnest to turn itself into a chemical company . As a starter borrowed $35 million from four big insurance companies to build , as one part of a wide-sweeping expansion program a $20 million plant in Memphis , Tenn. ' to produce fertilizers by petrochemical processes . Said Grace 's 39-year-old president , Joseph Peter Grace Jr. : " In 20 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Necessity 's Child . Grace &; Co. has been heading toward the big change for the past two years . In 1951 , Grace bought 16% ( later upped to 20% ) of Baltimore 's Davison Chemical Co. , and this year got its fingers in the Dewey &; Almy Chemical Co. of Cambridge , Mass , with a $2,000,000 loan . Grace has also started two new big chemical plants in San Francisco , the Naco Fertilizer Co. of California and the Grace Agricultural Chemical Division , to process and sell bug and weed killers . <P> The chemical change was mothered by necessity . Caught by such pressures as growing competition in Latin America from other U.S. firms ( especially small free-wheeling operators with little overhead ) and a worldwide textile slump , Grace 's profits skidded from $18.2 million in 1947 to $9,480,000 last year , although the gross climbed from about $175 million to $269 million . <P> Hardest hit is the Grace Line , which once accounted for almost half of the company 's total profits . Nipped by competition from shipping lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 40% less cargo than it did in its peak year , 1947 . Furthermore Grace is currently facing dollar shortages all along the line ; South American currencies have been steadily depreciating in terms of the dollar , and the once low South American tax rates have been on the increase . <P> Big Overhaul . Peter Grace has been overhauling his company to meet the new conditions ever since he took over from his father in 1946 . Peter Grace found it short of top executive talent . He brought in executives from other firms and , although a graduate of Yale himself ( ' 36 ) , he put a stop to Grace 's habit of hiring what he calls " rich men 's sons from swanky colleges . " Says Grace : " What we want are hungry , brainy young men who are eager to knock themselves out . "
