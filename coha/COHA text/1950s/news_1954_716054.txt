txt A chemical procedure by which copper , zinc and other metals are said to be recovered from scrap at a relatively small cost was announced by Whitaker Metals Cep . After three years of experimenting , the process was developed so operations can begin in a plant to be established here . The plant would use copper scrap for the recovery of copper and at the same time , it 's claimed , would salvage 100% of the tin , lead and zinc which are alloyed with copper in copper scrap . As the Whitaker company explains the chemical process , copper scrap , such as auto radiators and wire , is simply disintegrated and the metals are later recovered separately in granulated form . Formerly , when scrap with high copper and zinc content was melted down , it became brass and had to be shipped to refiners .

Speeds Crane Operations PHILADELPHIA ? Baldwm  --  Lima-Hamilton Corp . has an electronic device that weighs objects at the same time they 're being lifted by a crane . The new " Crane Scale " is designed to save time on a host of materials handling jobs , but the company thinks it will find its biggest uses in loading and unloading ore , determining shipping weights , checking inventories and safeguarding cranes from overloads . It consists of three parts : The pick-up , the cable and reel , and the instrument . The pick-up supplies an electrical signal , which is claimed to be exactly proportional to the weight of the object lifted : the instrument translates the signal so the operator can read off the result in pounds or tons ; and the cable connects the two . The reel 's job is to get rid of cable             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
