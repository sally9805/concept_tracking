Ever since John Diefenbaker 's Progressive Conservatives bulldozed into power last June for the first time in 22 years , Canada 's defeated Liberal Party has yearned nervously for new leadership . Liberal bigwigs were too fond of defeated Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent , 75 , to dethrone him abruptly . But others were less solicitous : the liberal Toronto Star hammered away with Louis-must-go editorials ; the Ontario Young Liberals Association breathed fire against " our latter-day leaders . " Last week , with the tacit approval of his political intimates , " Uncle Louis " announced that he would step down as Liberal chief , explained : " I no longer have the vigor and energy to lead the party through an election . " <P> Liberal Party custom dictates that a Protestant English Canadian and a Roman Catholic French Canadian alternate the party 's leadership . The only Protestant of English ancestry prominent enough to succeed Louis St. Laurent is Lester Bowles ( " Mike " ) Pearson , 60 , boyish , bow-tied , onetime ( 1945 ) Ambassador to the U.S. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that office he gave Canada ( pop . 16.5 million ) a great say in Western affairs ; e.g. , the U.N . ' s Middle East police force was a result of a Pearson resolution . His only serious political trouble occurred at home , when he was charged , after the suicide of Diplomat Herbert Norman ( TIME , April 15 et seq. ) , with covering up Norman 's Communist connections-a factor in the Liberals ' electoral defeat . Mike Pearson is a proven vote getter in his own riding , is better known than any other Liberal except St. Laurent . He should easily capture the leadership at the Liberal convention at year 's end .
