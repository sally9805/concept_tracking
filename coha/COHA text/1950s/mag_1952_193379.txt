Dressed in their holiday best , the people of Loma Bonita turned out last week to honor their " most beloved citizen . " The man : Frank Peters , 81 , a native of Mount Carmel , Ill . The occasion : the dedication of the Frank Peters elementary school . <P> Tropical Loma Bonita ( pop . 6,000 ) in the state of Oaxaca is probably the only town in Mexico whose " most beloved citizen " is a yanqui . Peters did not actually found the place , but he did introduce pineapple-growing , which is now the basis of the district 's economy . When he arrived in 1906 , Loma Bonita was a tiny village , and not a pineapple was to be seen for miles around . <P> A rover in his youth , Peters went to Mexico at 35 as the agent of an Illinois doctor who had bought land near Loma Bonita , sight unseen , and wanted it fenced , cleared and planted . When the doctor 's son later arrived to take over , Peters bought a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern crops did poorly in the region 's hot , dry climate , he made a trip to Tezonapa , 75 miles away , and brought back pineapple plants of the Cayenne variety . They did well . Peters brought in more plants , and by 1910 he was harvesting 20,000 pineapples a year . Prospering , he bought more &; more land until he owned 7,400 acres . <P> Peters had his downs as well as his ups . Revolutionary forces , considering any yanqui fair game , looted him freely . The depression of the 1930s hit him hard . In 1934 , President Cardenas ' land-reform program expropriated most of his holdings . Said Peters , philosophically : " The people need the land more than I do . " Today his income is $58 a month-just about enough to live on . But if Peters has not continued to prosper , the pineapples have . Cuttings from Peters ' original plants now produce 40,000 to 60,000 tons of pineapples a year , supplying four local canning factories . <P> A lifelong bachelor , Peters lived plainly even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his income for charity and local improvement . He still shares his modest income with the needy , and lets poor families live rent-free in houses he owns . Last week state officials and U.S. Ambassador William O'Dwyer came to praise him . Said Peters : " My only hope is that from this school will come a future governor or President . "
