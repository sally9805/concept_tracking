The professional basketball season still had a few games to go last week when the Detroit Pistons ' George ( " The Bird " ) Yardley broke one of the brightest records in the game . Helping the Pistons beat the Minneapolis Lakers , 132-116. the Bird tossed in 49 points , pushed his year 's total to a record 1,953 . Watching him while he did it was the old titleholder : George Mikan , 33 , the great Minneapolis center who held the seven-year-old mark of 1,932 . By week 's end Yardley had raised his record to 1,975 . <P> The Bird 's closest competitors for scoring honors this season : Syracuse 's Dolph Schayes , 1,755 , St. Louis ' Bob Pettit , 1,644 , and Cincinnati 's Clyde Lovellette , 1,593 . Next to those graceful giants , balding , knob-kneed , bony-shouldered George Yardley , 29 , is an improbable-looking champion indeed . When he puts on his basketball uniform he looks like an absent-minded scientist who left home without his trousers . The illusion ends when the game starts . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , his imperturbable balance in under-the-basket brawls , all blend into a 6-ft. - 5- in. , 195-lb. paragon of pro basketball . <P> Yardley is a graduate aeronautical engineer whose basketball career began when he sandwiched practice sessions between trips to the lab at Stanford ( class of ' 50 ) . He shone as a member of the Stanford varsity , but he really learned the game , he says , when he got out of school and joined the A.A.U. 's high-pressure " amateur " league . <P> Roundball among the amateurs was every bit as rugged as it is among the pros . Now as then , the rougher the game , the better Yardley likes it . He says that he scores best when a guard is climbing all over him : " When a guy is on top of you , you know where he is . You can watch the basket . " Yardley has driven the Pistons to a place in the National Basketball Association championship playoffs . All their opponents know that if bothering Yardley makes him dangerous , leaving him free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a record that nobody could hope to break .
