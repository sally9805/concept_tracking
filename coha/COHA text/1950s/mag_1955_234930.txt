Turkey 's two mightiest political figures last week left their own shores to line up friends abroad . President Celal Bayar turned up in Karachi to cement a military alliance with Pakistan . Premier Adnan Menderes descended by air on Baghdad to sign a Turkish-Iraqi treaty of mutual defense against Communism . <P> The Iraqi treaty quickly became fact . Iraq 's 67-year-old Premier Nuri es-Said , who was an officer in T. E. Lawrence 's World War I desert army against the Turks , pushed the treaty through Iraq 's parliament . Turkey 's National Assembly ratified it unanimously . Since Turkey is a member of NATO , Iraq became the first of the Arab League states to join the pro-Western chain of alliances . <P> Moscow denounced the pact as " a stab in the back " for the Arab League countries . The U.S. , which had carefully taken no hand in the negotiations , was pleased . The pact strengthens the Middle East 's " northern tier " ( the defense line from Turkey to Pakistan ) . Pakistan , hitherto isolated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good to be a bridge instead of feeling like a chasm , " said a Pakistan official . The Pakistani were talking of including Iran too , which like Turkey and Pakistan is Moslem but not Arab . <P> The Arabs were miffed-particularly Egypt , which has long fancied itself the leader of the Arab world and wants to keep the Arab world uncommitted for now in the cold war . Egypt 's pique at Iraq 's " betrayal " was shared most loudly by oil-rich Saudi Arabia , whose ruling Al Saud family hates Iraq 's Hashemite royal house . Some other members of the Arab League-notably Jordan and Lebanon-are eying the Turkish-Iraqi pact furtively , and under the right circumstances might be persuaded to join . Iraq 's bold step has all but finished the Arab League .
