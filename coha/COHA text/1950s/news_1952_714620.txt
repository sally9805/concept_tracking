txt HARRIMAN BACKED FOR THE PRESIDENCY BY 45 COUNTY HEADS State Democrats Will Carry Drive for M. S. A. Director Throughout the Country ARVEY IS FOR STEVENSON Illinois Leader Believes the Governor Could Be Drafted Despite ' Slamming Door ' By JAMES A. HAGERTY Two important political developments yesterday followed Thursday night 's dinner of the Democratic State Committee for W. Averell Harriman , director of the Mutual Security Agency , at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel . A group of forty-five of the state 's sixty-two Democratic county leaders , with half a dozen speaking for delay , voted to recommend Mr. Harriman to the National Convention delegates to be elected next Tuesday as New York State 's candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination . Senator Herbert H. Lehman , who made the announcement , said New York State would push Mr. Harriman 's candidacy throughout the country and seek support for him in other states in the hope that the support would be strong enough to insure his nomination and election . In the second development , J. M. Arvey of Chicago , Democratic National Committeeman from Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that he did not regard the nomination of Gov . Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois as hopeless , despite the latter 's announcement that he was a candidate for renomination for Governor only and " " ould not accept the nomination for any other office this summer . " Mr. Arvey expressed belief that the Governor could be subjected to a draft . To Wait on Convention " So far ? as Illinois is concerned , it will not make any decision as to how it will cast its fifty-six votes until the balloting begins , " Mr. Arvey said . " If Governor Stevenson is nominated , I am confident that he can not refuse the nomination . I 'll bet every dollar that I have that he would have to take it . " Governor Stevenson " stole the show " at the Democratic State Committee 's dinner , the audience clearly indicating by applause that he was its favorite for the Presidential nomination . Mr. Arvey said that , although Governor Stevenson had seemed to " slam the door " on a draft , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any candidate before the National Convention began . The prospect , he said , is for a deadlock among perhaps a dozen candidates , with none within striking distance of the nominafion . He adtled that he regretted that Governor Stevenson had said that he could not accept the Presidential nomination , for otherwise he would have received the nomination without any fight at all . He said that he believed that Vice President Alben W. Barkley had been helped the most by Governor Stevelison 's announcement . Barkley 's Age Among Issues Mr. Arvey added that Mr. Barkley 's age  --  he is 71 years old  --  had been raised as an issue . " That is a prejudice easier to overcome than are issues , " he added . " For instance , the issue of civil rights against Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia and the issue of the oil and gas lobby against Senator Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma . " The nomination of Governor Stevenson would unify the party and he would make a better fight than any other candidate . My feeling is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else . " Mr. Arvey said that Governor Stevenson had told him he had meant what he had said  --  that Mr. Arvey was embarrassing him by talking about nominating him for the Presidency . He said he replied to the Governor : " If you can be so frank and honest about your plans , why ca n't I ? " In 1948 , Governor Stevenson was elected by a plurality of 572,000 . President Truman 's plurality in Illinois that year was 33.000 . The meeting of the Democratic county leaders at the Biltmore Hotel resulted in an endorsement of Mr. Harriman , but little chance of a solid delegation from this state for him was indicated . Five or six of those present , it // was reported , urged delay in taking action until ifter the delegates to the National Convention had been elected . However , so far as could be learned , none of these actually voted against the Harriman endorsement . Paul E. Fitzpatrick , Democratic State Chairman , proposed Senator Lehman as the state 's candidate for the Presidential nomination . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineal tradition of Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt and as typifying the kind of integrity and dedication to the public service that we should require in our Presidential candidate . Mr. Lehman , in declining the designation , said he appreciated the honor but desired only one thing , " to continue to serve my state , my country and also my party in the ofVce I now hold to the end of my term . " If it will be said that I have served well , that will be my reward , " he said . " I ask no other . " In announcing that the meeting had endorsed Mr. Harriman , Senator Lehman said that in his judgment Mr. Harriman would make a great President of the United States . " He has been a member of the President 's Cabinet , Ambassador , adviser and administrator in the highest and most responsible posts any man ever filled . " Senator Lehman said of Mr. Harriman . " He was Roosevelt 's right hand man . He knows the Government . He knows the Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing in all its principles . He is a convinced liberal . " He has a record of performance unsurpassed , has won the admiration and gratitude of the free world and the confidence of the American people . It is my suggestion that we unite around Averell Harriman and make our bid on that basis . " Queens Proposes Froessel Daniel Haggerty of Queens , representing James A. Roe , the county leader , presented the name of Charles W. Froessel , Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals , but there was no vote on naming him as the state 's candidate for the Presidential nomination . Despite the action of the county leaders , the prospect of a solid state delegation of ninety-four votes for Mr. Harriman seemed slim . Daniel P. O'Connell , Albany County chairman , who has suggested Oscar R. Ewing , Federal Security Administrator , for the Presidential nomination , did not attend the meeting nor was Albany County represented . At least one or two prospective upstate National Convention delegates are known to favor Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former Democratic National Chairman , if Mr. Farley should give the word . Francis 3 . Sinnott , Brooklyn Democratic leader , who did not attend the meeting but was represented by Aaron L. Jacoby , criticized the officers of the State Committee for holding the meeting before the election of the convention delegates . " I yield to no one in by esteem for Mr. Harriman , " Mr. Sinnott said . " My admiration for him as a patriotic American is because he ' has rendered valued service to his country both at home and abroad . Few if any Democrats in this state are mor , e worthy of honor and distinction than Mr. Harriman . " Nevertheless , I object to the action taken at the Biltmore Hotel meeing . I am not opposed to the designation as a ' favorite son ' but I am opposed to the method by which it has been proposed . The designation could have waited until after the primary election next week , when delegates to the National Convention will be elected and the members of the State Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
