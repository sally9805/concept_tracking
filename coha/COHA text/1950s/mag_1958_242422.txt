In Rochester and Buffalo , 75 miles apart in upstate New York , Republicans and Democrats met for the election-year business of selecting candidates . Two days later the Democrats left Buffalo tattered and torn with party strife ( see below ) , and beaming Republicans took dead aim on November with a unified front for an appealing ticket . The top Republican nominees : for Governor , square-jawed Millionaire Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller , 50 , of Manhattan and Westchester County ; for U.S. Senator , white-thatched U.S. Representative Kenneth Keating , 58 , of upstate Rochester . <P> The convention was Rockefeller 's all the way , but the road that led there had not been smooth . " I do n't need to tell you , " said Nelson Rockefeller after his nomination , " that I was not drafted for this nomination . I worked and fought from one end of the state to the other . " He had done just that . Rockefeller 's intensive campaign began last June . It started with a big name and a long record of public service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Latin American affairs , Under Secretary of the Health , Education and Welfare Department ( 1953-54 ) , and military reorganization adviser to Defense Secretary Neil McElroy . <P> " Sex Appeal . " But Rockefeller 's big name was not necessarily a political asset , and he was completely untried as a candidate for elective office . He won the nomination by sheer drive and astute politics . Nelson Rockefeller became Political Hopeful " Rocky " Rockefeller , traveled the state in zealous quest of delegate votes , shook hands , slapped backs , kissed babies-and made friends . Of his announced opponents for the nomination , former Republican National Chairman Leonard Hall , longtime ( 14 years ) Congressman and a veteran political pro , was the first to give way to the Rockefeller drive . Then followed State Senator Walter Mahoney and Manhattan 's ex-U.S . Attorney Paul Williams . <P> Nelson Rockefeller thus faced the first ballot at Rochester unopposed and , as delegates waved banners proclaiming WE WANT ROCKY and ROLL WITH ROCK , his defeated rivals were still trying to figure out how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's magic in that name . I figured it would be just the opposite , that I 'd go in and shake a woman 's hand and that 'd be that . Rockefeller did the same thing , and the women jumped for joy . I guess I did n't have that political sex appeal . " <P> " Rarin ' &; Itchin ' . " With Rockefeller 's nomination achieved , the Republicans in Rochester set about selecting a Senate running mate . Rochester 's own Keating had obviously good credentials . A one-time high school Latin teacher , Keating took a law degree at Harvard ( ' 23 ) , went to the House in 1946 , became a ranking member of the powerful House Judiciary Committee . Moreover , he rates as one of the smoothest television performers in politics , conducts weekly programs on eight upstate stations , holds no-holds-barred interviews with leading lights of both political parties .
