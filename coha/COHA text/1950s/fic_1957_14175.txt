The Three Fates are seated on a bench , which is largely hidden by their voluminous draperies . They wear the masks of old women , touched by the grotesque but with vestiges of nobility . Seated are Clotho with her spindle , Lachesis with the bulk of the thread of life on her lap , and Atropos with her scissors . They rock back and forth as they work , passing the threads from right to left . The audience watches them for a time in silence , broken only by a faint humming from Clotho . CLOTHO What is it that goes first on four legs , then on two legs ? Do n't tell me ! Do n't tell me ! LACHESIS ( Bored ) : You know it ! CLOTHO Let me pretend that I do n't know it . ATROPOS There are no new riddles . We know them all . LACHESIS How boring our life is without riddles ! Clotho , make up a riddle . CLOTHO Be quiet , then , and give me a moment to think What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguised . ) APOLLO ( To the audience ) : These are the great sisters  --  the Fates . Clotho weaves the threads of life ; Lachesis measures the length of each ; Atropos cuts them short . In their monotonous work of deciding our lives they are terribly bored , and like so many people who are bored , they find great pleasure in games  --  in enigmas and riddles . Naturally they ca n't play cards , because their hands are always busy with the threads of life . p. 3 ATROPOS Sister ! Your elbow ! Do your work without striking me . LACHESIS I ca n't help it  --  this thread is s-o-o l-o-o-ong ! Never have I had to reach so far . CLOTHO Long and gray and dirty ! All those years a slave ! LACHESIS So it is ! ( To Atropos ) Cut it , dear Sister . ( Atropos cuts it  --  click ! ) And now this one ; cut this . It 's a blue one  --  blue for bravery : blue and short . ATROPOS So easy to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Atropos . ATROPOS This one ? Purple for a king ? LACHESIS Yes ; watch what you 're doing , dear . It 's the life of Admetus , King of Thessaly . APOLLO ( Aside ) : Aie ! LACHESIS I 've marked it clearly . He 's to die at sunset . APOLLO ( To the audience ) : No ! No ! LACHESIS He 's the favorite of Apollo , as was his father before him , and all that tiresome house of Thessaly . The queen Alcestis will be a widow tonight . p. 4 APOLLO ( To the audience ) : Alcestis ! Alcestis ! No ! LACHESIS There 'll be howling in Thessaly . There 'll be rolling on the ground and tearing of garments Not now dear ; there 's an hour yet . APOLLO ( Aside ) : To work ! To work , Apollo the Crooked ! ( He starts the motions of running furiously while remaining in one place , but stops suddenly and addresses the audience ) Is there anyone here who does not know that old story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dear to me ? ( He sits on the ground and continues talking with raised forefinger ) Was it ten years ago ? I am little concerned with time . I am the god of the sun ; it is always light where I am . Perhaps ten years ago . My father and the father of us all was filled up with anger against me . What had I done ? ( He moves his finger back and forth ) Do not ask that now ; let it be forgotten He laid upon me a punishment . He ordered that I should descend to earth and live for a year among men  --  I , as a man among men , as a servant . Half hidden , known and not known , I chose to be a herdsman of King Admetus of Thessaly . I lived the life of a man , as close to them as I am to you now , as close to the just and to the unjust . Each day the king gave orders to the other herdsmen and myself ; each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us and our families . I came to love King Admetus and Queen Alcestis and through them I came to love all men . And now Admetus must die . ( Rising ) No ! I have laid my plans . I shall prevent it . To work . To work , Apollo the Crooked . ( He again starts the motions of running furiously while remaining in one place . He complains noisily ) Oh , my back ! Aie , aie . They beat me , but worst of all they 've made me late . I 'll be beaten again . p. 5 LACHESIS Who 's the sniveler ? APOLLO Do n't stop me now . I have n't a moment to talk . I 'm late already . Besides , my errand 's a terrible secret . I ca n't say a word . ATROPOS Throw your yarn around him , Lachesis . What 's the fool doing with a secret ? It 's we who have all the secrets . ( The threads in the laps of the Sisters are invisible to the audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide circles above her head as though she were about to fling a lasso , then hurls the noose across the stage . Apollo makes the gesture of being caught . With each strong pull by Lachesis , Apollo is dragged nearer to her . During the following speeches Lachesis lifts her end of the strands high in the air , alternately pulling Apollo up , almost strangling him , and flinging him again to the ground . ) APOLLO Ladies , beautiful ladies , let me go . If I 'm late all Olympus will be in an uproar . Aphrodite will be mad with fear  --  but oh , already I 've said too much . My orders were to come immediately , and to say nothing  --  especially not to women . The thing 's of no interest to men . Dear ladies , let me go . ATROPOS Pull on your yarn , Sister . APOLLO You 're choking me . You 're squeezing me to death . p. 6 LACHESIS ( Forcefully ) : Stop your whining and tell your secret at once . APOLLO I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sister . Boy , speak or strangle . ( She makes the gesture of choking him ) APOLLO Ow ! Ow !  --  Wait ! I 'll tell the half of it , if you let me go . ATROPOS Tell the whole or we 'll hang you up in the air in that noose . APOLLO I 'll tell , I 'll tell . But  --  ( He looks about him fearfully )  --  promise me ! Swear by the Styx that you 'll not tell anyone , and swear by Lethe that you 'll forget it . LACHESIS We have only one oath  --  by Acheron . And we never swear it  --  least of all to a sniveling slave . Tell us what you know , or you 'll be by all three rivers in a minute . APOLLO I tremble at what I am about to say . I ssh I carry here in these bottles Oh , ladies , let me go . Let me go . CLOTHO AND ATROPOS Pull , Sister . APOLLO No ! No ! I 'll tell you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days she renews her beauty by drinking this . p. 7 ATROPOS Liar ! Fool ! She has nectar and ambrosia , as they all have . APOLLO ( Confidentially ) : But is she not the fairest ? It is the love gift of Hephaistos ; from the vineyards of Dionysos ; from grapes ripened under the eye of Apollo  --  of Apollo who tells no lies . SISTERS ( Confidentially to one another in blissful anticipation ) : Sisters ! ATROPOS ( Like sugar ) : Pass the bottles up , dear boy . APOLLO ( In terror ) : Not that ! Ladies ! It is enough that I have told you the secret ! Not that ! ATROPOS Surely , Lachesis , you can find on your lap the thread of this worthless slave  --  a yellow one destined for a long life ? APOLLO ( Falling on his knees ) : Spare me ! ATROPOS ( To Lachesis ) : Look , that 's it  --  the sallow one , with the tangle in it of dishonesty , and the stiffness of obstinacy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear . APOLLO ( His forehead touching the floor ) : Oh , that I had never been born ! p. 8 LACHESIS ( To Atropos ) : This is it . ( With a sigh ) I 'd planned to give him five score . APOLLO ( Rising and extending the bottles , sobbing ) : Here , take them ! Take them ! I 'll be killed anyway . Aphrodite will kill me . My life 's over . ATROPOS ( Strongly , as the Sisters take the bottles ) : Not one more word out of you . Put your hand on your mouth . We 're tired of listening to you . ( Apollo , released of the noose , flings himself facedown upon the ground , his shoulders heaving . The Sisters put the flagons to their lips . They drink and moan with pleasure . ) SISTERS Sisters ! LACHESIS Sister , how do I look ? ATROPOS Oh , I could eat you . And I ? CLOTHO Sister , how do I look ? LACHESIS Beautiful ! Beautiful ! And I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a bit of still water , to tell us which of us is the fairest . LACHESIS ( Dreamily , passing her hand over her face ) : I feel like I feel as I did when Kronos followed me about , trying to catch me in a dark corner . p. 9 ATROPOS Poseidon was beside himself  --  dashing across the plains trying to engulf me . CLOTHO My own father  --  who can blame him ?  --  began to forget himself . ATROPOS ( Whispering ) : This is not such a worthless fellow , after all . And he 's not bad-looking . ( To Clotho ) Ask him what he sees . LACHESIS Ask him which of us is the fairest . CLOTHO Boy ! Boy ! You bay meek . I mean , you you may thpeak . Thpeak to him , Lakethith ; I 've lotht my tongue . LACHESIS Boy , look at us well ! You may tell us which is the fairest . ( Apollo has remained facedownward on the ground . He now rises and gazes at the Sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , gazing first at one and then at another . ) APOLLO What have I done ? This splendor ! What have I done ? You  --  and you  --  and you ! Kill me if you will , but I can not say which one is the fairest . ( Falling on his knees ) Oh , ladies  --  if so much beauty has not made you cruel , let me now go and hide myself . Aphrodite will hear of this . Let me escape to Crete and take up my old work . ATROPOS What was your former work , dear boy ? p. 10 APOLLO I helped my father in the marketplace ; I was a teller of stories and riddles . ( The Sisters are transfixed . Then almost with a scream : ) SISTERS What 's that ? What 's that you said ? APOLLO A teller of stories and riddles . Do the beautiful ladies enjoy riddles ? SISTERS ( Rocking from side to side and slapping one another ) : Sisters , do we enjoy riddles ? ATROPOS Oh , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse the big toe LACHESIS The cloud the eyelashes of Hera CLOTHO ( Harping on one string ) : What is it that first goes on four legs ? ATROPOS The porpoise Etna APOLLO Everyone knows those ! I have some new ones  --  SISTERS ( Again , a scream ) : New ones ! APOLLO ( Slowly ) : What is it that is necessary to  --  ( He pauses . The Sisters are riveted ) LACHESIS Go on , boy , go on . What is it that is necessary to  --  p. 11 APOLLO But  --  I only play for forfeits . See ! If I lose CLOTHO If you looth , you mutht tell uth which one ith the faireth . APOLLO No ! No ! I dare not ! LACHESIS ( Sharply ) : Yes ! APOLLO And if I win ? ATROPOS Win ? Idiot ! Stupid ! Slave ! No one has ever won from us . APOLLO But if I win ? LACHESIS He does n't know who we are ! APOLLO But if I win ? CLOTHO The fool talkth of winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wish . One wish , any wish . LACHESIS Yes , yes . Oh , what a tedious fellow ! Go on with your riddle . What is it that is necessary to  --  APOLLO Swear by Acheron ! CLOTHO AND LACHESIS We swear ! By Acheron ! By Acheron ! APOLLO ( To Atropos ) : You , too . ATROPOS ( After a moment 's brooding resistance , loudly ) : By Acheron ! p. 12 APOLLO Then : ready ? LACHESIS Wait ! One moment . ( Leaning toward Atropos , confidentially ) The sun is near setting . Do not forget the thread of Ad  --  You know , the thread of Ad  --  ATROPOS What ? What Ad ? What are you whispering about , silly ? LACHESIS ( Somewhat louder ) : Not to forget the thread of Admetus , King of Thessaly . At sundown . Have you lost your shears , Atropos ? ATROPOS Oh , stop your buzzing and fussing and tend to your own business . Of course I have n't lost my shears . Go on with your riddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much time as it takes to recite the names of the Muses and their mother . LACHESIS Hm ! Nine and one . Well , begin ! APOLLO What is it that is necessary to every life  --  and that can save only one ? ( The Sisters rock back and forth with closed eyes , mumbling the words of the riddle.Suddenly Apollo starts singing his invocation to the Muses : ) Mnemosyne , mother of the nine ; Polyhymnia , incense of the gods  --  LACHESIS ( Shrieks ) : Do n't sing ! Unfair ! How can we think ? p. 13 CLOTHO Stop your ears , Sister . ATROPOS Unfair ! ( Murmuring ) What is it that can save every life  --  ( They put their fingers in their ears ) APOLLO Erato , voice of love ; Euterpe , help me now . Calliope , thief of our souls ; Urania , clothed of the stars ; Clio of the backward glances ; Euterpe , help me now . Terpsichore of the beautiful ankles ; Thalia of long laughter ; Melpomene , dreaded and welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud voice ) Forfeit ! Forfeit ! ( Clotho and Atropos bury their faces in Lachesis 's neck , moaning . ) LACHESIS ( In a dying voice ) : What is the answer ? APOLLO ( Flinging away his hat , triumphantly ) : Myself ! Apollo the sun . SISTERS Apollo ! You ? LACHESIS ( Savagely ) : Pah ! What life can you save ? APOLLO My forfeit ! One wish ! One life ! The life of Admetus , King of Thessaly . ( A horrified clamor arises from the Sisters. ) p. 14 SISTERS Fraud ! Impossible ! Not to be thought of ! APOLLO By Acheron . SISTERS Against all law . Zeus will judge . Fraud . APOLLO ( Warning ) : By Acheron . SISTERS Zeus ! We will go to Zeus about it . He will decide . APOLLO Zeus swears by Acheron and keeps his oath . ( Sudden silence . ) ATROPOS ( Decisive but ominous ) : You will have your wish  --  the life of King Admetus . But  --  APOLLO ( Triumphantly ) : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APOLLO I shall have the life of Admetus ! What is your but ? ATROPOS Someone else must die in his stead . APOLLO ( Lightly ) : Oh  --  choose some slave . Some gray and greasy thread on your lap , divine Lachesis . LACHESIS ( Outraged ) : What ? You ask me to take a life ? ATROPOS You ask us to murder ? p. 15 CLOTHO Apollo thinks that we are criminals ? APOLLO ( Beginning to be fearful ) : Then , great Sisters , how is this to be done ? LACHESIS Me  --  an assassin ? ( She spreads her arms wide and says solemnly ) Over my left hand is Chance ; over my right hand is Necessity . APOLLO Then , gracious Sisters , how will this be done ? LACHESIS Someone must give his life for Admetus  --  of free choice and will . Over such deaths we have no control . Neither Chance nor Necessity rules the free offering of the will . Someone must choose to die in the place of Admetus , King of Thessaly . APOLLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No ! I see it all ! ( With a loud cry ) Alcestis ! Alcestis ! ( And he runs stumbling from the scene )
