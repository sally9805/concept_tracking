The Children 's Hour ( by Lillian Hellman ) is still , after 18 years , vivid and powerful . Into her tale of a child 's fiendish lie that shatters the lives of two young schoolmistresses , Playwright Hellman packed a great deal of sheer vibrant theater . But for all the child 's whispered charges of Lesbianism and her grandmother 's shouted ones , The Children 's Hour is something more than shocking , as it is something more than tense . Despite its heightened stage qualities , it cuts sharply back into life-to the monstrous power of gossip , to the sick , psychopathic nature of evil , to how calamitously the upright people of the world-such as the grandmother-can blunder . <P> For the first two acts-as 14-year-old Mary Tilford exerts her fearful wiles over schoolmates and grandmother and spreads her poison-The Children 's Hour has the lure of mounting melodrama . It is with the last act that something at once harsher and more humane begins to blow through the story , and with the very last scene-when the surviving schoolmistress faces an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionally and morally , a sense of the tragic . <P> The production is not quite all of a piece . Thirteen-year-old Iris Mann ( The Innocents ) plays the brat with remarkable skill , and more convincingly than brilliantly stagy Florence McGee , a grownup , did in 1934 . And , as in 1934 , Katherine Emmet is impressive as the grandmother . As the schoolmistresses , however , Kim Hunter and-despite very good moments-Patricia Neal display a certain lack of shading in their roles and of full impact in certain of their scenes . But if such limitations stress how much the acting can mean to a play , the whole evening proves how much a good play is able to do for itself .
