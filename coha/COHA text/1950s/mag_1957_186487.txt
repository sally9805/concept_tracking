The more they observed him during his first months on the job as night janitor in 1951 , the more the pupils and teachers of the Edwin Markham Elementary School in the Portland , Ore . school district began to realize that there was something special about shy , quiet Horace Bixby . Because of the Depression , " Bix " had never finished college . But he had an obvious talent for science and mechanics-and an even more important knack for getting along with children . He brought them birds and fish to study and care for . He built them an incubator , a model cloud chamber and a <P> Van de Graaff generator , made it a practice to get to work early in order to have time for any problems the boys and girls might have . Then one day in 1954 , three members of the faculty called him into a classroom and made an extraordinary suggestion . " Well , Bix , " one of them said , " we 've been talking about you , and we 've decided that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> For a man of 41 with a wife and two boys to support , it was quite a decision . Bix bluntly told his wife and family , " how we 'd always be broke , how we 'd not have enough to eat . how we 'd never take any vacation trips . " He might have added , had he known the figures , that even if he made the grade by the fall of 1957 , his starting salary as a teacher ( $3,700 ) would be nearly $250 less than he would be making as a janitor . But Charlotte Bixby encouraged him to go ahead . While hanging on to his job , Bix enrolled at Portland State College , later switched to <P> Lewis and Clark College as a major in elementary education . <P> Since then he has spent his mornings studying and attending classes , this term began practice-teaching at Edwin Markham . He went to college last summer , for two years worked weekends at a service station to help meet his new expenses . But by 2 p.m. each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pants , sweeping , cleaning and polishing as if he had nothing more on his mind than being the best janitor Edwin Markham ever had . <P> Last week , with a B.S. assured him , Bix was invited into the office of School Superintendent J. W. Edwards , signed the agreement that will make him a full-fledged teacher in the Portland school system next fall . But for Bix , all this is only the first step in his new career . Eventually , he hopes to earn an M.A. and to specialize in teaching handicapped children . " You see , " says he , " I have a boy who is practically blind . And he wants so much to be accepted as a normal boy , to do the things that are expected of a normal boy . I know what these children go through . If I can do something to help them , I 'll have more than all the money anyone can pay me in dollars and cents . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
