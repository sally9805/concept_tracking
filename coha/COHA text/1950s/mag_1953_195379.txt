Everyone who knew Fred Eugene McManus thought he was just about the nicest boy in the suburban village of Valley Stream , N.Y . He was a handsome lad , tall , well built , with a quick , pleasant smile . He came from a good home-the McManus family lives in a big , white , well-kept house , and the boy 's father , Mose McManus , a well-paid brewery executive , saw to it that his son had a pleasant life . But unlike many a good-looking boy with doting parents , Fred seemed completely unspoiled . He was quiet , notably polite , and rather shy with girls . <P> The boy loved animals and raised hamsters with tender care . He was a good swimmer , and he played on the high-school junior varsity football team . He liked children and was in constant demand as a baby sitter . His father was a little disappointed after his son finished high school last summer because Fred insisted on enlisting in the Marines instead of going to college . But 18-year-old Fred was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on a ten-day leave from Camp Lejeune , N.C. He was tanned , soldierly , and as polite and thoughtful as ever . <P> Road to Murder . Fred left after only two days , however , hurried to Rochester and picked up with a thin , bespectacled , 16-year-old girl named Diane Marie Weggeland. whom he had met on a vacation trip . The girl 's foster mother remonstrated with her for staying out late , and Fred and Diane went defiantly off to the public library . After some research there , they decided ( incorrectly ) that minors could be married in Minnesota without parental consent . They hit the highway . Fred thumbed a ride with a 19-year-old college boy named William Braverman , killed him in broad daylight with a service .45 , buried him in a quarry , jauntily decorated the grave with a rusty antifreeze tin , and headed west with Diane in his victim 's shiny , red and black 1953 Plymouth hardtop . He told the girl he felt no remorse . " It do n't bother me if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is no such thing as conscience . It 's just a feeling of fear that people have . " Before an Iowa policeman arrested them three days later , Fred had shot four more people in cold blood , and held up an old couple ( whom he liked and hence did not kill ) to get money-$58 in all . <P> When the news got back to Valley Stream , the elder McManus cried desperately that it was untrue . He could not remember ever hearing of a Diane Weggeland . " I ca n't believe it , " he said . " This boy is not my son . My boy would n't do such a thing . " He flew to Dubuque , where Fred was in jail , listened in astounded horror to the chilling tale the boy - speaking as politely as ever-had told the police . <P> " I walked into the store , " Fred said , in telling how he killed George Bloomberg , a 56-year-old Keeneyville , ILL. general store operator and his wife Florence . " I told the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up from his TV set , walked toward me and said , ' Now here . Here now , wait a minute . ' He touched my left shoulder , and I let him have it . " Bloomberg 's wife screamed . " I shot her , " Fred went on . " I ca n't stand screaming . "
