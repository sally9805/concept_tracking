That 's the Kind of Dame I Am By ETHEL MERMAN , as Told to PETE MARTIN 0 ' VE been told that writing your autobiography should be like curling up on a head-shrinker 's couch while he makes with the pencil and notebook . They say that the big idea in telling your story is for people who read it to know you when they 've finished it . The things you think about , the things that happen to you , the way you feel about things when they happen ? all that stuff adds up to being you . I know that sooner or later I 'll have to get around to that routine that begins : " I was horn on such-and-such a day in such-and-such a place . " But I 'm going to put off that " I was horn " stuff as long as I can . Maybe by the time I get to it you 'll know more about what kind of a dame I am .

I do n't care how much work there is , how late I stay , how many costumes I have to fit ? if it 's for the good of the show I do it . But if somebody tries to take advantage of me , I speak my piece in what I hear is Anglo-Saxon . All I know is those Angles and Saxons really got down to cases . When I 'm mad I let you know I 'm mad , and when I 'm happy I let you know I 'm happy . I do n't hold anything hack . I can yell loud , but I do n't go in for three- or four-day sulks either . When people ask me how I got the way I am , I tell them I do n't know , unless it 's because I give everything I 've got to anything I go into . Some days I feel bum , and some days good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't ask anybody to do anything at a rehearsal I wo n't do . I 'll stay later than anybody . I wo n't let the chorus kids outwork me . One thing that makes me different from most people in show business is , I never have a case of nerves On an opening night . The producers , directors and actors and actresses I 've known think that amazing . I do n't think it amazing . Why should I be nervous ? Those people out front came to see me ; I did n't come to see them . They were the ones who paid their dough to be entertained . I did n't . Since they are risking their dough , I figure they were the ones who ought to be jumpy . IT/ they could do what I 'm doing any better than I can , I tell myself , they 'd be up here on the stage and I 'd be out there in a seat . The afternoon after the opening of Annie Get Your Gun , Bob Levitt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . home the papers . They contained wonderful reviews . But I had n't bothered to go out and buy them . The way I look at reviews , if they 're good , they 're good , and if they 're bad , they 're bad . All a performer has to care about is whether she knows inside herself that she 's done a good job . You ca n't make a critic praise you by wanting him to . When Levitt came home and said , " Oh , boy , look at these reviews ! " I was sitting at my bedroom desk , checking the grocery bills . I said , " Look at this ! Peaches have jumped three cents more a can than they were last week . " Levitt never got over that . There he was , with those great notices , and me worrying about peaches going up three cents . It was a side of me he did n't get . He never did get it . After six months of being in a Broadway show , there are nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through the same routine again . The audience looks the same to you . Their faces are the same . You begin to think that the part of the theater that is visible to you is never emptied ; the people have never gone home . You put the same effort into it . You belt the songs over with the same sock , but it becomes mechanical . I 've watched my favorite pianist , Lew Kessler , in the pit of many 's the big show . He sits there , looking over the house , casing the audience and playing a beautiful piano . But Lew told me , " After one of my shows has been running for months , sometimes I look down at the music on my rack and I 've played five numbers without knowing it . " After a show has been running for a spell , I can be out there singing a song and thinking , Little Ethel should go for a haircut tomorrow . I have to go downtown and get so-and-so and so-and-so . The first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've planned my whole day . Lew and I call those people who look as if they 'd never gone home " the Dogs . " A Dog is somebody who does n't laugh or clap . He just sits there . He 's got his tickets at . the Dog Ticket Agency or he 's got in touch with a Dog speculator and has forked over twenty-five dollars a seat . He 's sore because he 's had to pay twenty-five dollars for a seat , he wants twenty-five dollars ' worth of blood , and no matter what he 's got , he does n't think it twenty-five dollars ' worth . The Dogs are the ones you see from the stage , reflected in the stage lights . They always come late 411 " Which interview have you got ? " Garland asked . " There 's the old reliable three , " I told him . " There 's I he sure-shot Merman , in which I 've never had a failure ; there 's t he ' doing what comes naturally ' one , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Got Rhythm , in Girl Crazy ; and there 's the wife , mot her and the homebody , in which I loathe t he country and love the city . " There was nothing phony about any of these , but I was so fed up wit interviews I felt like kidding about them . " I 've used them all , " Garland told me . " So has everybody else , " I said , " and with pop-up pia , Or I can give you the ' I do n't think I 'll ever cut off my topknot ' one , or the one in which I discard the Zim ? the first three letters of my real name  --  and emerge as Merman . " If I were bobbing and weaving around the ring with Garland now . l 'd tell him , " I 've got a new one , the ' I 'm crazy about Denver ' one , and ' they 'll never get me hack to the old Broadway treadmill .

There 's Merman , the entertainer ; and Merman , the practical housekeeper , zealous mother and dame who was one of the first to use a washing machine . I admit I 'm hip to what 's going on in my house . Hip is hep in spades : it means I 'm more ou courant than anybody . r I know where everything is . I know every nook and corner . I go around wit h a pinky sticking out , touching the lops of picture frames , windowsills and furniture . If there 's dust there , I know it . I 'm content to leave the effectiveness of Merman , the entertainer , to others . I 'll string along with the girl who , when the house detective asked her , " Are you entertaining a gent leman in your room ?

To me , sex has its funny aspects . It can even be gay . I try to make others feel the same way about it . Even feeling this way about . it , I 'm not the type dame who tries to sell sex on the stage . Can you imagine trying to sell sex in some of the outfits I 've worn ? Take the black cotton stockings , the moccasins and the saggy buckskin skirt I wore as Annie Oakley , with a couple of dead quail hung around my waist . I dare you to sell sex in that outfit . If you can , I know where you can get some handsome offers . When I lived in New York , I attended St. Bartholomew 's Episcopal Church regularly . My former husband , Bob Levitt , got to be quite a guy at . St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection . Levitt uses to complain that it always seemed that he was suffering from a hang-over while passing the plate because , when I was in a show , Saturday nights were the only times we two could go out together on the town and stay up late . Not only did he have to pnss t he plate hung over , but our pew was in the fifth row , in front of the pulpit , so the Lev-it IS were always under the gun . I keep ringing in so much home life ( hat I might as well tell about the first home I ever had . I was horn on the top floor of my grandma 's house at 359 Fourth Avenue in Astoria , Long Island . Mom and pup and I all lived on that floor . I 'm Scots and German . Mom n. is Scuts . Pop is German . Pop was and is an accountant for James H. Dunham &; On. , wholesale drygoods , at 345 Broadway . I ca n't get him to quit . I was baptized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Redeemer in Astoria . Most of mom 's family were Presbyterians . But mom herself belonged to the Church of the Redeemer . The first thing I remember is pop playing the piano for me . He not only played for me for more than twenty years . he was organist for the Astoria Advanced Lodge of Masons . From the first , my voice was easily identifiable . When I was a baby . people in the next room or down the street heard me , They said , " That 's Ether . " ' I do n't know where that voice came from . It must have been God 's gift . because I 've never had a lesson in my life . Pop and mom were proud of my voice and they did n't have to nip at my calves with a blacksnake whip to make me stand up before people and sing . sang Sunday nights at . the Lutheran Reformed Church and at pop 's Masonic lodge . And I sang for the Women 's Republican Club of Astoria . At one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform for the World War I soldiers . I dressed in a plaid skirt and I pulled my hat down over one eye to look tough for I he tough little songs I sang , such as He 's Me Pal , which was the first . song I can remember singing in public . Mom always sat in the front row , and I dedicated t he last verse of a song to her . It went like this : " Friends may he few and friends may be true , but I have one dear friend of old . Bless her dear heart. , we will never part , for she loves me better than gold . " Coming from a six-year-old , this made those doughboys ' tear ducts feel funny . One Christmas I went out to Camp Yaphank and sang Maggie Dooley and K-K-K-Katy , and How Ya Gon na Keep ' Em Down on the Farm ? Some organization had made up knickknack kits for the boys in the wrap-around puttees and the General Pershing-type fell hats . One of those doughboys gave me his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still remember it . If I 'd been a teenage Brooklyn Mats Hari who had obviously matured early , it would have been different , bet . to give a kit to a little kid , t hat was something . When I 'd come home from school in t he aft ernoon , I 'd stand outside of a movie studio in Astoria and wait for the movie stars to come out . They came to work in cars a block long and shiny with nickel . We neighborhood kids stood there , stiff with excitement , watching . I never saw Valentino . I 'd have remembered him . I did see Greta Nissen , Adolphe Menjou and , the most beautiful of all . Alice Brady . She had a Japanese chauffeur . He sat up front by himself , with a sheet of glass between him and Alice  --  the kind you could crank up and down . Watching her , 1 decided to he not . only a singer but an actress too . The trouble was , I did n't think I 'd ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that beauty was n't the only way to fame on the stage and what was catled " the silver screen . " I would never he any raving beauty , but I was n't to he the ugliest person in the world either . When I reached an age bracket where I got testimonials from gentlemen , I was told I was attractive and fun to have along . Now that I 'm older  --  if I 'm not . wiser I 've wasted my time  --  I know that being attractive is better than being beautiful . Beauty does n't last long , to coin a saying . Attractiveness does n't rub off easily . In my Alice-Brady-worshiping period a man called Uncle Tom used to take me to the matinees at the Palace Theater in New York every other Sunday . He really was n't my uncle , but pop and Uncle Tom were pals . I saw all the big stars of the day  --  Nora 19.1935 Hayes and Grace LaRue and Blossom Seeley . Then , afterward , I went , home rind tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Funny thing , ended up not singing like any of them . Then mom took me instead of Uncle Tom . She took me on Friday nights instead of to Sunday matinees . There was no school on Sat urdays . I could sleep in . When it was time for me to go to William Cullen Bryant High School , by the Bridge Plaza in Long Island City , mom wanted me to take s general course and be a schoolteacher . I wanted no part of it . I did n't want to be a schoolteacher . I wanted to be a singer . But / had enough ego not to want to fool around being a chorus or a show girl until something worth while to do on I he stage came along . Until that happened , I 'd mark time as a stenographer . I took the four-year commercial course , which included bookkeeping , shorthand and typing . Typing has always fascinated me . I 'm not bad at it right now . When I graduated from Bryant I went to work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made antifreeze . I stayed there for a while and I was n't doing so dusty  --  I 'd been promoted to the vice-president 's office  --  when I learned that t he B. K. Vacuum Booster Brake Company was opening an office across the street . The Boyce-ite employees ate in a nearby lunchroom . I met Vic Kliesrath there . He was the one who told me that t he Bragg-Kliesrath Corporation was just forming , and that his partner , Caleb Bragg , needed a secretary . Bragg was president of the company . I was drawing down twenty-three dollars a week at Boyce-ite , but I made thirty-five at Bragg-Kliesrath . The Bragg-Klicsrath outfit had a crazy name : The 13 . K. Vacuum Booster Brake Company . People still ask me , " What 's a booster brake , for Pete 's Rake ? " and I still tell them I do n't Kliesrath was the technical one . He 'd g et an idea for a new patent ; then kn Vic e he or Mr. Bragg would dictate the technical stuff to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Louis Prevost Whitaker , the firm 's patent attorney . If I did n't know what Kliesrath or Mr. Bragg was talking about , I left out the technical stuff . If it was too much for me , I skipped it . Occasionally Mr. Bragg read my letters hack and asked with a puzzled air , " Did n't I give you more than this ? " - Sure , Mr. Bragg , " Pd say , " but this is all new to me . They did n't give us that stuff in high school . We just got ordinary language , like people talk . " Mr. Bragg looked at me with a dazed look . Then he 'd insert in longhand what I 'd left out , sign it and send it out that way . I did n't have to type it over again . Although I goofed on the techni-c:1al igl iobliKerish , I handled the rest of his I had n't been with Mr. Bragg very long before I discovered that he had important friends in the theater  --  producers and actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of Mr. Bragg , for by this time I 'd listed my name with agents who supplied talent for private parties and small affairs . You signed their registers , indicated what you did , such as : " Singer  --  Blues . " gcealrl re d you . i tjeu. 3 : If they needed any , t hey I never called Mr. Bragg anything but mister . But I got to know Kliesrath , ( he vice-president , and his wife T111 : S V1 ' 111111 FVENICNI : t .11 ! " .1 . very well , He had A lovely home al Port Washington , and I 'd go out I o visit I hem on Saturday nights if I hey had a party going . They 'd have a marl ! orchestra . in and I 'd sing what was popular . But Mr. Bragg always held himself aloof . I I hink he was shy . Not Hail he meant to be that way . He could n't help it . My desk and Mr. Bragg 's desk were in the saint ' office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butler to tell him , " So-and-So is coming for dinner . ( Mentioning Gertrude Lawrence , or Irene Delray , or George White , or Earl Carrolt.i Have something special . " I used to think , If I could Just meet those people and sing for them , they 'd go for me. 1 know they would . One of my big moments was the day I went on a company picnic at Port Washington . Mr. Bragg 's houseboat , the Masquerader , was lying off Port Washington , but we were n't invited on board . Mr. Bragg did n't make social contacts with anybody connected with h the firm . Out of the office you 'd have thought he did n't know one of us from the other . Still , since his employees were out there having a picnic . he did invite three or four of us for a ride on one of his speedboats . We went almost to the Connecticut shore : then , coming back , we hit a chunk of wood and capsized . We were fished out and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put in a fireless cooker to dry . Mr. Bragg lent us silk pajamas to wear while our stuff was baking , and promised to reimburse us for t he damage we 'd suffered . But while that was important , the important thing to me was that Ruth Selwyn and her husband , Edgar Selwyn. a big stage producer , were on hoard . We all sat down to a dinner . 1 told Mrs. Selwyn who I was , that I worked for Mr. Bragg and that I sang . " That 's nice , " she said . Full stop . I could see her thinking , If she can sing , why is she a stenographer ! So talking to Ruth Selwyn did n't hurry my appearance on the stage any . What with entertaining at night , when I got to the office in the morning , sometimes I was a little tired . So I 'd nap in the ladies ' room until Mr. Bragg caste to work . He spent his winters in Palm Beach and summers on his boat . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Lake Placid , or Pine-burst , or Tuxedo . He 'd come to work on a Tuesday , open his mail , and go hack to his boat at Port Washington on Thursday . Even if he came to the office from his New York apartment . where he lived when ha was n't in Florida or on his boat , he did n't get there early . Ten or ten-thirty was more his speed . So , when I began to work club dates , this was a break for me . But as I 've said , mornings after a club date I 'd be a little sleepy : I 'd take off my dress , hang it up neatly on a hanger , and go to sleep until Mr. Bragg arrived . When that happened , one of the girls rushed into the ladies ' room and warned me by saying , " Chickie ! " That was the same as saying , " Cheese it . the cops ! " Then I put on my dress , and by the time Mr. Bragg had his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter in my hand . I got to thinking about how Mr. Bragg knew Earl Carroll and George White , the producer of the Scandals , until I could think of very little else . Finally I grabbed my courage in both my hands and said to Mr. Bragg , " I have a voice and I think I can sing . Will you give me a letter of introduction to George White ? " is show-liusiiimi legend that Mr. Bragg said to me , " Go ahead and write it yourself , " and that I wrote the letter of in roiluction myself , and he signet ! it . This is not true . Mr. Bragg dictated he letter and I triniscribed it on my typewriter . I did n't ask Mr. Bragg if I could have the afternoon oil ' . I went to White 's office after hours . We quit at live , nod I made it over to White 's office in the Apollo Theater Building on ' ! 2nd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue at five thirty . The whole I hing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his office . He Carrie nut to I he vestibule to talk tome . I gave him the letter , and he asked , " What do you do ? " I said , " I sing . " " Anyone who sings in my show must . have a name , " he said , and I 've already got a name  --  Frances Williams . She 's starring in my new Scandals . However , I 'll he happy to give you a job as a show girl . " He was busy and I was wasting his time , so I said , " Thank you " and left . I was very discouraged . I thought , If a letter like that one from Mr. Bragg does n't do it , I 'm dead . A short time afterward a free-lance agent for whom I 'd done jobs around New York signed me to work a place called the Little Russia . It was near Sixth Avenue on 57th Street . I took the job for two weeks , at sixty bucks a week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might say I was working both sides of the street . I did n't have to audition . Nobody expected Tetrazzini for sixty dollars a The ladies ' side lust . The court threw out the law its unconstitutional , with the comment : " If women are better fitted than men for these jobs , it is for the voters week . Anyhow , the Little Russia was mostly a place for eating and drinking ; yet it . was there I hal , I got a start toward something big . My fired night tit the Little Russia I 'd finished my show when a wailer brought a card . On it was : Lou ir/WIN , THEATRICAL REVILESENTATIVE . The waiter said the owner of the card wanted to talk to me . I said , " O.K. , " and Irwin told me that he thought 1 had possibilities as a singer . He asked me to come over to see him the next day and , since I was under age , bring mom with me to sign papers . So , after working hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lou to represent me for nine years . A couple of days later Lou arranged for me to meet Archie Mayo , a top movie director who was under contract to Warner Brothers . Lou had me audition for Mayo , and Mayo had me audition for Lewis Warner , Harry Warner 's son , and I signed a Warner contract with a six months ' option clause , at $125 a week . Whether I worked or did n't work , I was to get that much each week . It was then that I decided to give up my job with Bragg and Kliesrath . Vic was sorry to see me go . Mr. Bragg wished me luck , That was that . Although Warner Brothers had signed me , they did n't exactly know what to do with h rue . Then somebody had the idea that , having signed a girl singer , it would lie a bright notion if I wrapped my charms up in a leopard skin and raced across the stage at I he to decide that when they cast their ballots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination against male candidates .

The truth is , it was frustrating , even with checks coming in all the time . I began to get itchy and tap my foot mentally . I wanted to be singing , and for 1 he first time it dawned on me that being paid for doing nothing could be a pain in the neck . I went to Lou Irwin , Lou went to the Brothers Warner , and it was agreed that I could take outside singing jobs . This was in November , 1929 . The team of Clayton , Jackson and Durante had just been signed to appear at Lea Ambassadeurs , a brand-new night club , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged for Clayton , the business manager of the trio , to look me over .

Then tonsillitis laid me low . I got so sick I could n't work , and I had to quit , although it broke my heart . I 'd been getting $200 a week at the club , but giving that up was n't what broke my heart . I liked working with Jimmy , but I had no alternative . In January , 1930 , 1 had my tonsils removed . After the tonsillectomy I could n't go back to work for a while , It could be that having my tonsils chopped out bad a permanent effect on my voice and made it even louder .

I worked there for six or seven weeks at $300 per . When the Florida season was over , I came home and teamed with a piano player named Al Siegel . He knew all the hlues-singing dodges , and he gave me some pointers . He made arrangements for me , we rehearsed , and I sang what he gave me to sing . But for the most part I followed my own rules . We formed a vaudeville act and broke it in at the Ritz Theater in Elizabeth , New Jersey . Variety reported " a new singing team has come into existence with interesting arrangements by Siegel .

Finally . in the summer of 1930 , we were booked into the Brooklyn Paramount . It was then that I decided to change my name from Zimmermann to Merman . Zimmermann was too long ever to get up in lights , But I had to go through a big thing with pop about the change . " If my name is good enough for me , it 's good enough for you , " he said . " If I use part of it , will that be all right ? " I asked .

Word got around : " There 's a girl singer out at the Pavillon Royal who 's got that thing . " It was Steinberg who originated a form of entertainment he called Sunday Night Impromptu Entertainment  --  he 'd started it many years before , in 1913 , with Sophie Tucker , at Reisenweber 's Caf ? . It reached its peak at the Pavillon Royal , a big place that seated 1800 people . A lot of performers came out there on Saturday or Sunday night because they liked the food , but mostly because it was a good . flashy showcase in which to break in an act , and sometimes Steinberg called upon them .

" So Steinberg came over and asked me my name . When I told him , he asked , " Do you know another song ' ? " I said , " Yes , sir . " He suggested that I sing it , and once more I got a good hand . Steinberg listened ; then he told Lou Irwin , - Bring her out again next Sunday .

The word about a girl at the Pavillon Royal who had that thing filtered up and down Broadway , and one day Vinton Freedley , a Broadway producer with a big reputation , caught my act at the Brooklyn Paramount . Freedley was casting a show called Girl Crazy , with music by George Gershwin and starring Ginger Rogers . He had signed Ginger at the then fantastic salary of $1500 a week . Ginger had created a furor in the movie , Young Man of Manhattan . She was pretty , she could act , she could dance , but no one called her The Voice . Ginger 's voice was a pleasing one , but small . The way she sang Embraceable You was charming , but the songs she sang did n't require power . Girl Crazy had Willie Howard as its comedian . He could n't sing much . It had Allen Kearns as its juvenile . He was n't Pinza . For its specialty dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't supposed to sing , even if they could . And with a Gershwin score you had to have somebody who could sing . Luckily for me , even then I had a powerful delivery . I was using much the same technique and doing much the same things with my voice I do now . After Freedley hnd caught me in Brooklyn , he arranged for me to meet George Gershwin , so George could hear me sing and I could hear the score he 'd written . I was told to conic to Gershwin 's apartment at 33 Riverside Drive , between shows at the Brooklyn Paramount , so I still had my make-up on when I got there . Ira Gershwin was there , too , and George played the songs he 'd written for the show , especially those I was to sing if I got the job ? I Got Rhythm ; Boy , What Love Has Done to Me ; Sam and Delilah . Then I sang two or three of the swing numbers I 'd been doing in night clubs and vaudeville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his penthouse on Riverside Drive were Little White Lies and Exactly Like You , but I was so excited at the whole deal that , for all I remember , I might have sung London Bridge is Falling Down . As I sang , Vinton began to relax . In preparing me for that visit , he had talked me out of wearing black jet in the daytime . This seemed to bother him  --  Vinton is a very sensitive man ? and , since he had n't liked my hair , he 'd taken me to his favorite barber at the Astor men 's barbershop earlier in the day , and there 'd been a big business with shampoo water and a nail-do . It was the first time I 'd met . George Gershwin , and if I may say so without seeming sacrilegious , to me it was like meeting God . Imagine the great Gershwin sitting down and playing his songs for Ethel Agnes Zimmermann , of Astoria , Long Island . No wonder I was tongue-tied . When he played I Got Rhythm , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like , I 'll be happy to change it . " There was nothing about t hat song I did n't like . But that 's the kind of a guy he was . That I 'll never forget . I smiled and nodded , but I did n't say anything . I was busy thinking how to phrase the music . Gershwin seemed puzzled at my silence . Finally he said again , " If there 's anything about these songs you do n't like , Miss Merman , I 'll be happy to make changes . " It was n't that ; it was only that I was so flabbergasted . Through the fog that had wrapped itself around me , I heard myself say , " They will do very nicely , Mr. Gershwin . " There were those who thought that my reply was funny when El , . EN INI l'OST it was repeated to them , as if I 'd given the great Gershwin the old hauteur treatment . I was so drunk with the glory of it all that I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant it to be grateful and humble . That 's for sure . At the end of the session , I was signed for Girl Crazy at $375 a week . Al Siegel was signed to accompany me . I was given Sam and Delilah , a torchy , narrative song , and I Got Rhythm to do , and a couple of lines to cue me into my songs . When we went into rehearsal and it was discovered that I could read lines pretty well , I was given a few more . In the meantime , Irwin had booked Siegel and me into the Palace Theater in New York . The jump from the Brooklyn Paramount to the Palace Theater was the biggest jump a performer could make . Every variety artist 's ambition was to play the Palace , but they usually had to play the whole country before they got there . Some of them played a whole career in show business and never played the Palace at all . I played it as my second big engagement . I 'd finish my second show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin Theater to rehearse for Girl Crazy . I rehearsed for Girl Crazy in the morning at the Alvin Theater , drove back to the Palace to do a matinee , came back to the Alvin to rehearse , ivent hack to the Palace to do a night show , then came back to rehearse once more . It was a grind and I did n't get much sleep . In Girl Crazy I played Kate Fothergill , the wife of a guy who ran the gambling room at a dude ranch . Billy Kent played my husband . Ginger Rogers played the part of Molly , the postmistress of Custerville , Arizona , where the action took place . My first song was Sam and Delilah . At the close of t he first act , I sang I Got Rhythm , and in the second act , Boy , What Love Has Done to Me . Vinton did n't know whether I 'd collapse with stage fright when I first sang in the big league or not , but he was taking no chances ; he made me lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed up to there , and a red waist cut very low in front . Thus clad ? or unclad ? I leaned against that arch on the stage and sang Sam and Delilah. rebrnary pr . ivaa During the rehoarsals in Philadelphia , Al Siegel was taken sick and went into a hospital when the show came to New York . He came out of the hosp gt ahlt i and New n d epw York , played yendr k , t jeu after otwe r that opening night did n't permit him to continue . We had to get another pianist quickly . So we approached Roger Edens , the pianist with Red Nichols ' band , who was playing in the pit . Roger was scared to death , because he 'd never been on a stage in his life , but he finally consented to go on if the spotlights were kept off him and he could he hidden in protective darkness . Today Roger is a top musical producer and composer at M-G-M . He produced the recent Metro hit musical . Deep in My Heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gershwin openings were important on Broadway . The opening night of Girl Crazy in New York was no exception . In show biz , it 's what you do in New York that counts . You may have done all right elsewhere , but you have n't really done it until you face a New York first-night crowd . That 's when the chips are down . It 's very hard for me to stand back and take a cold , calm look at that first night of Girl Crazy . It 's still thunder in the hack of my head . I did n't know what was happening to me . When I did my first number , opened my mouth and let out : " Delilah was a floozy , " everybody screamed and yelled , and there was so much noise that I thought something had fallen out of the loft onto theistage . That was only the beginning . My rendition of I Got Rhythm stopped the show . As I went into the second chorus of I Got Rhythm , I held a high C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line  --  a big , tooty thing  --  against the note I was holding . By the time I 'd held that note for four bars the audience was applauding . They applauded through the whole chorus and I did several encores . It seemed to do something to them . Not because it was sweet or beautiful , but because it was exciting . Few people have the ability to project a big note and hold it . It 's not just a matter of breath ; it 's a matter of power in the diaphragm . I 'd never trained my diaphragm , but I must have had a strong one . When I finished that song a star had been born . Me . I still did n't get the meaning of what happened . I knew people were beating their hands together and I had to sing encore after encore , but all the noise and excitement made me sluggy . I 've heard honest  --  and even intelligent  --  people describe that first time they heard 1 Got Rhythm as a " high point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience went out at intermission , everybody was saying , " Merman , Merman . " It was the kind of thing that happened when Mary Martin sang My Heart Belongs to Daddy . During the intermission , George Gershwin came up to me and said , " Ethel , do you realize what 's happened to you ' ? " " No , " I told him . All I knew was I 'd gone out and had sung I Got Rhythm the way I 'd been told to sing it ; the audience had seemed to think me a new-type singer , and they 'd liked it . George gave me a funny look and told me , " Do n't ever let anybody give you a singing lesson . It 'll ruin you . "
