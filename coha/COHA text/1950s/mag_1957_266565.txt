In the ten months since Adlai Stevenson tiredly conceded that he had lost an election but gained a grandchild , he has been busy influencing friends and winning column inches . Showing slight interest in settling down to the nonpolitical routine of his Chicago-New York-Washington law practice , Stevenson toured Africa and Europe on a three-month , 16-nation jaunt , wrote articles , delivered speeches , held press conferences , appeared on television shows , enjoyed publication of his biography and his collected 1956 campaign speeches . At intervals , he thumped away at the man who beat him twice-and at some politicians in his own party . Stevenson openly disapproved of the civil rights compromise approved by Presidential Prospect Lyndon Johnson , snorted loudly at the independence and interdependence scheme for Algeria advanced by Presidential Prospect John Kennedy . <P> All this began to touch off speculation about Adlai 's hopes and aims : in the event that none of the new presidential hopefuls seems to have a commanding lead , might not seasoned old gladiator Stevenson be sent out in 1960 for yet another battle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adlai Stevenson 's most avid Chicago followers are plotting to get him to try again . " <P> Last week Stevenson took painful pains to scotch the idea . Said he : " I am not a candidate ; I will not be a candidate , and I do n't want the nomination . " The tone was familiar . There was once a candidate who said , " I do not dream myself fit for the job-temperamentally , mentally or physically . And I ask therefore that you all abide by my wishes not to nominate me . " This was Adlai Stevenson , speaking to his Illinois delegation six days before he accepted his first Democratic presidential nomination , in 1952.
