For the first time in his twelve years as president of the United Auto Workers , Walter Reuther took a licking . With auto-industry contracts due to expire this week , Reuther last week jettisoned his key demand-for profit sharing . He issued a face-saving statement that profit sharing " was never a demand , but a mechanism for giving the stockholders , consumers , workers and managers their just equities . ' ' This fooled no one . Behind closed doors Reuther himself had told unionists that they must cut their demands , take " a more realistic " approach to bargaining . He decided to drive for a 10 hourly wage boost ( v. 7 offered by management ) plus better unemployment benefits , sliding-scale pensions pegged to cost-of-living , and other fringe benefits . <P> Reason for the softening of demands was that the automakers had rallied as never before to put up a united front against the U.A.W. Furthermore , Reuther himself conceded that to strike now " would be insane " because dealers have a two-month backlog of unsold new cars . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , hoping to stall until the 1959 models start to roll out in September , when a strike threat might be heard more clearly . <P> Pressure . Last week the automakers countered by putting on more pressure for an immediate two-year extension of the current contracts . They warned that some 600,000 U.A.W. members covered by the Big Three contracts will not get their annual 2% wage boost ( averaging 7an hour ) and cost-of-living hike ( averaging 2 ) , due on June 1 , unless and until the union signs a contract . In the past , whenever the U.A.W. won a raise , the companies also raised nonunion and salaried employees the same amount . This week the Big Three automakers gave 2% wage boosts and cost-of-living hikes to their 173,000 nonunion and salaried employees . It was a strong hint that the U.A.W. can expect little more . <P> If the unionists persist in working without a contract , the companies can exert more pressure . They can stop deducting union dues from employees ' paychecks , and they can refuse to pay union stewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The union let it be known that if no contract is signed , the U.A.W. will not be responsible for any scattered stoppages or slowdowns by workers . In turn , the companies let it be known that if unionists try such harassing tactics , the plants will be closed down . <P> Settlement ? Detroit dopesters expect that the U.A.W. will settle soon for very close to what management offered originally-the extension of current contracts - plus a few face-saving fringes , such as higher and longer supplemental unemployment benefits . Auto workers would get something more than a 9 package v. the 35-to-45 package that Reuther originally demanded . Such a settlement would be considerable , considering the slump , but less than Reuther has signed for in the past . To date , his most modest settlement was an 11 boost in 1948.
