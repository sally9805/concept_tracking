They have created the " law factories " that sell the costliest advice in the world ... they shun publicity , hobnob with intellectuals , need a million a year to keep the office open ... and seldom step into a courtroom . ADVERTISEMENTS offering new issues of state and municipal bonds usually begin with an italic heading : " Interest Exempt , in the Opinion of Counsel , from All Present Federal Income Taxation . " Counsel 's opinion of a new issue of corporate securities is not printed , because there 's no way to avoid the tax ; but in every ad could appear the more simple statement , " Our Lawyer Says This Is Okay . " A similar slogan could underline every announcement of a change in a corporation 's policies , and could be printed at the bottom of the memorandum slips by which executives communicate with one another .

Most cities of more than a million population have at least one such firm , but they concentrate in Washington , Chicago , Boston , and New York , Especially New York ? the most recent Martindale-Hubbell law directory lists no fewer than twenty law firms with fifteen or more living partners . All but two of these firms are located around Walt Street , in the half-mile square that marks the financial district ; and all but one draw their income almost exclusively from corporations , financial institutions , and large estates . In a law firm with fifteen partners , there will usually be twenty to fifty " associates , " young lawyers who are employees rather than members of the firm ; and for each attorney there will usually be one nonprofessional on the staff .

To meet such a payroll requires a considerable income : no law firm of fifteen or more partners can live on total fees of less than one million dollars a year .

" Clients ' fees are the most belligerently defended secret of a trade in which almost everything is confidential , but there is a written record that Cahill , Gordon , Reindel &; Ohl collected $425,000 from RCA Victor in 1954 . And about 80 per cent of every big firm 's total income is predictable in advance , on the basis of all average year 's work for clients who " retain " the firm .

Nevertheless , the Wall Street lawyers are often famous men , even household names . The late John W. Davis ( Davis , Polk , Wardwell , Sunder* Canon 27 of the Ethics of the Bar holds that " It is unprofessional to solicit professional employment by circulars , advertisements , through touters , or by personal communications or interviews not warranted by personal relations .

It was understood that I could use any and all information that I found for myself from printed or other sources outside the firm .

CULTURAL HIGH JINKS T HESE men are very large frogs in the national puddle ; and some of their partners , lawyers whose names are utterly unsung , may be larger still . Their influence and their acquaintance cover the Western world . Some of them represent foreign governments in their commercial dealings with the American market . Many of them are members , honorary or otherwise , of the British Inns of Court . They have Paris connections : in the clays before the war , most of the big Wall Street firms maintained a Paris office , and the freshly married young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding present . Even today , when governments have usurped the lawyers ' role in international trade , Wall Street partners are constant transatlantic voyagers , for sport or conversation . Several are members of the Royal and Ancient , the great and intensely exclusive club which adjoins the golf course at St. Andrews ; at least one is a member of the Athenaeum , the London club which exists to recognize achievement in the arts . The cosmopolitan attitude , the clubbishness , and the fascination with art are distinguishing marks of the top Wall Street lawyer . Ile wears them as the advertising executive wears Bermuda shorts : they distinguish him from his clients . He is the master of an intellectual discipline . Wall Street lawyers are , or recently have been , Chairman of the Board of the Metropolitan Museum and Secretary of the Morgan Library ; Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Metropolitan Opera ; Chairman of Cooper Union and President of the Grolier Club ( book collecting ) ; Secretary of the Whitney Museum ( modern American art ) ; and President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the learned and artistic is continuous , and in some cases overwhelming . A rough survey indicates that dozens of partners in Wall Street firms belong to the Century Association , which is supposedly for the arts at large ; a few belong to the Coffee House , a club of painters , actors , editors , and writers ; more than a few to the Lambs , the Lotos , and the Salmagundi . If the Algonquin Round Table were still in existence , it would shine with legal lights . Some of these men were brought up to intellectual society , but for most of them participation in Kultur has been a conscious effort and a real accomplishment . They were not to Manhattan born , but come from all over the Conn-try ; in most cases they are the first of their families to see an opera , let alone run an opera house . Entree was admittedly easier for those who were born rich , or made their money early , but it was an accomplishment for everyone . To be accepted as an entertaining fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate triumphs of life . These arc the bons vivants , and they run together in clubs ? but not all Wall Street lawyers belong . Not everyone has a yacht , or even a set of golf clubs ; only a few fly the seaplane commuting service out to Southampton in the summer ; many live in apartments . One partner entertains his office staff with champagne and fish eggs , but another , whose name is writ large in many books , will make a single boiled ham feed a hundred employees . Everyone belongs to a luncheon club , because there is practically no other way to eat on Wall Street ; but presence at the Recess Club or the Downtown Association means one thing , presence in the Perpendicular Gothic chambers of the Lawyers ' Club , another . ( " I ca n't see , " said a banker recently , " why anyone would wish to belong to that . " ) Members of the Lawyers ' Club tend to consider the cultural and social activities of their partners as so much meaningless high jinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Bar Association and its affiliates . ( As one partner put it , suspiciously , " I just do n't have that much time . " ) What maintains the appearance of harmony , and even good-fellowship , is an unwavering respect for the intelligence of any fellow attorney who can earn i100,000 a year . That ? and the fact that every Wall Street lawyer shares in the development of a still new and changing profession , a legal life that would have seemed preposterous less than seventy years ago . To some people , it seems preposterous still . The Bar of seventy years ago was a highly inefficient institution . A lawyer preparing a case had to find his facts and his legal citations for himself . His client paid him for his skills in developing and presenting lines of argument ; but a good attorney had to put in days or weeks of donkey work before he could get to the fee-earning part of his job . He could bring his brilliance and eloquence into play only on scattered great occasions . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he paid them nothing and the work they did was usually worth little more than it cost . Until the turn of the century apprenticeship in an attorney 's office was the usual way to become a lawyer , and no special training came before . In return for his services ( which were mostly copying ) , the clerk was to be taught all about the law . It was a profitless enterprise on both sides ; and shortly after the turn of the century several New York firms announced that they would hire only graduates of accredited law schools , and that they would pay such clerks a salary . Six hundred dollars a year . At about the same time , the nation 's streetcar companies began to drown in their buckets of watered stock . The resultant bankruptcies revealed vast tangles of interlocking interest , dubious assets , and questionable liabilities ; and lawyers were called in to straighten out affairs and defend erring directors . Meanwhile , Teddy Roosevelt was taking after the big trusts , wielding the shillelagh of the Sherman Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented complexity , which would often take several years in the processing , and which demanded the services of teams of lawyers rather than individuals . School-taught clerks fertilized the seedlings of complex cases , and the great law firms grew . Before 1900 there was scarcely a firm which could boast as many as ten lawyers ; by 1920 there were at least twenty New York firms with twenty lawyers or more . Today the top half-dozen Wall Street firms can offer their clients the services of about one hundred members of the Bar . Trained subordinates make it possible for senior partners to devote their time entirely to those parts of the legal function in which their talents are extraordinary , and to earn , as a result , extraordinary incomes . The size of the operation guarantees that every stone will be turned , every detail explored and understood . These mammoth partnerships in the law are among the least understood phenomena of the managerial revolution . They are self-perpetuating bodies , drawing this generation 's partners from last generation 's associates , and what they sell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first went to Cravath , Swaine Pc Moore for legal assistance because Henry Luce 's brother-in-law was a partner in the firm ; social connections , or a parvenu 's desire to make them , may have brought in some of the big firms ' biggest clients . But once the client arrives , he stays , though all the persons depart who were involved in the original arrangement . After a few years as attorney for a large corporation , a large law firm has accumulated so thorough a background in its client 's affairs that it has become virtually irreplaceable . In many cases a partner of the law firm sits on the company 's board of directors , and in almost every case the law firm is regarded as part of the company 's permanent secretariat . BOILERPLATE AND AMOEBAE M U C H of the work which a hundred-lawyer firm does for a billion-dollar corporation is simply a gigantic enlargement of what every lawyer does for every business client . Contracts are the basis of commerce ; like the one-man office , the " law factory " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts are complicated . They may involve direct negotiation with the government , airplanes for the Air Farce or atomic submarines for the Navy , contracts in which the placement and composition of every bolt must be specified ? as well as a formula for possible renegotiation , or even cancellation . They may reflect all the touchy human attitudes subsumed under the heading " labor contract , " or all the statutory trap doors cut by a wise old Congress beside the narrow path which leads to the sale of stocks and bonds . " In the old days , " a partner said recently , " a businessman could walk into a lawyer 's office and describe his troubles , and the lawyer could give him an opinion ? on the assumption that the description was accurate . Today , a man walks into my office and asks for my opinion on a contract , and I have to tell him that my opinion is n't worth a nickel . I 'll have to go through his files and get a full background on the case before I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added thoughtfully , " what I give him wo n't be an opinion . It 'll be advice . " There can be no guesswork here : both the attitudes in negotiation and the terms of the final agreement must reflect a real-life situation . Digging up the facts is often a purely non-legal research job ? but only a lawyer will know which facts are important . Twenty lawyers can work twenty days to draw up the necessary documents for an issue of mortgage bonds . Sometimes the legal element is merely a matter of form , and all the work is research . Most of the giant law firms represent a bank which acts as transfer agent every time a corporation 's stock is bought and sold . The seller 's stock is handed over to the bank , which cancels and hides away the certificates ( in most cases they can not be destroyed ) , and then issues new certificates to the buyer . By the terms of its agreement with the corporation , the bank may be liable for a mistake in transferring stock ownership . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner , but by someone who claims to have the owner 's power of attorney or to be trustee of the deceased owner 's estate . For its own protection , the bank must find out whether or not this claim is legally accurate ; and the suspect certificate is shipped up to the law offices for investigation . A young lawyer then goes out to " examine the amoebae " ? that is , to determine whether the man who sold the certificate actually had the right to sell it . He almost always did , which makes the work of verification about as dull as any work can be . An equally tedious business is the preparation of documents for new security issues , gloomily referred to in the trade as " boilerplate . " Firms which do a good deal of boilerplate always have a high ratio of salaried lawyers to partners ; they , and the firms which service big banks , are unpopular with the younger men . Milbank , Tweed , Hope &; Hadley used to examine amoebae for the Chase National Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Bank of the Manhattan Company . Both firms would Like to get all the work from the Chase-Manhattan amalgam ? but not every associate is rooting for the home team . Partners in the big firms , who order but do not perform boilerplate , find it more difficult to define " dull " and " interesting " work . " At this time , " said one of them , cautiously , " we do n't represent clients that have a great deal of routine work . We do a gond deal of litigation , which is supposed to be romantic and makes us popular with the younger men . Litigation , though , involves much reading in the history of a particular situation , which to my mind is damned dull . " A great deal of practicing law is hard and dull work ? unless you like it . A lot of it is un-exciting . The end result is always very exciting . " A firm which serves a big corporate client must maintain an alert attitude on a dozen fronts at once . RCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in state legislatures and Congress , the state and federal courts . in the Federal Communications Commission , the Federal Trade Commission , the Securities and Exchange Commission , the National Labor Relations Board , the Internal Revenue Service of the Treasury Department , and the Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department . And others . Cahill , Gordon , as counsel to RCA , must be informed on every change of policy in any of these agencies ? and must know what the change will mean to RCA . SIXTH-SENSE STUFF F I N D I N G out what the government and judges have been up to is not so difficult as it looks . The Commercial Clearing House , Prentice-Hall , Kiplinger , and others run expensive services which keep lawyers up to date on all public decisions in various fields . Reading all the reports takes time , but not nearly so much time as finding out and deciphering all the decisions . Knowing the potential impact of each decision is the special skill ? but it requires intimate knowledge of the client 's business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients ' " lawyers , " but its clients ' " counsel " ; and here the word retains its meaning . The lawyer counsels caution or daring , advises specifically on policy and operation . " Your modern corporate lawyer , " said a partner , " is a member of the command staff of a corporation . One : Finance . Two : Law . Three : Engineering . Four : Accounting . It 's like the organization of an army . We like to think of the legal division as G-2 . " The most valuable legal counseling is that which predicts the future : will the courts uphold the New Jersey fair-trade law ? When the decision is to come from a judge a forecast can be plotted : the law works by a system of stare decisis , it stands decided , and a lawyer can look up past court decisions and make at least an intelligent guess at Yes or No . Congress , though , is always unpredictable . And the alphabet agencies in Washington definitely represent a government of men rather than laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less on precedent than on the weight of political and other pressure . The Interstate Commerce Commission , throwing out the basing-point system of steel prices , was merely sending down the lightning from storm clouds that had been in the sky a long , long time . The steel companies were able to make rapid and inexpensive adjustments , despite their howls of anguish , because their lawyers had seen the decision coming . This is sixth-sense stuff ? sixthsense , and a Washington office . Many big New York law firms have a Washington office. - Corporations take more easily to legal advice today than they did two decades ago . An attorney who had advised a client to obey the Wagner Act before it was okayed by the Supreme Court would probably have been an ex-attorney . ( The corporate lawyer of the 1930s , however , was often more irritated than his client ; in 1939 John Foster Dulles of Sullivan &; Cromwell urged the corporate lawyer not to pick fights with government commissions simply " because this will afford the lawyer a chance to vent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , by and large , a corporation comes to a lawyer to find out what the law means rather than how he can get around it . Not , however , in tax matters : every client wants his lawyers to hunt for loopholes in the tax code . Though it may seem morally dubious from the outside , this legal game of hide-and-seek is officially ethical , authorized by no less an analyst than Justice Holmes . The work , again , is mostly in prediction , in counseling rather than advocacy ; rather than help his client make out a tax return , the lawyer tells the client which of alternative business practices will involve the least tax liability . This is the newest and most rapidly growing specialty within the law , and for obvious reasons . At the present corporate tax rates , every dollar that can be deducted adds 52 cents to profits ; hundreds of thousands of dollars can sometimes be saved by a slight change in accounting procedure . Business ventures that seem unprofitable can be attempted without anxiety , because the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aesthetes call it , shows the way for an unsuccessful business to absorb a good one ? most notably in Kaiser Motors ' purchase of Willys-Overland . Kaiser paid much less than the book value of Willys ' assets . The difference between this payment and the hook value was a tax loss for Willys , and could be carried back against its profits of previous years . To Kaiser the price was a bargain ; to Willys the price plus the huge tax refund was a very good deal , The entire plan was conceived and delivered in the offices of law firms . Most of the work which the large law firms do for individuals relates in some way to taxes . Wills , for example , must be carefully drawn to save the individual from the dread prospect of leaving his money to the government . In this part of its work , the law firm can also scratch backs with an important client : estates require trustees , and what trustee could he more dependable than the bank for which the law firm is attorney ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy of a client 's cause before a competent tribunal , occupies less than one-tenth the time of a large law firm . Some firms avoid it entirely . Following the English tradition , they like to consider themselves their clients ' " solicitors " ; when the clients ' affairs produce a lawsuit , they call in a " barrister . " " It 's very convenient for them , " said a litigating member of another firm . " A lawyer 's reputation is on the line every time he tries a case . If you lose a client 's case , you may lose the client . This way , you can say to the client , We got the best in the business for you . There just was n't any way to win it . ' " More charitable attorneys give weightier rea-sons : " Litigation work is sporadic , time-consuming , and tiring . You may not have enough of it over the course of a year to make a separate litigation department profitable . A partner with several clients to serve may find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to slight the others . And then , it knocks you out . You have to stay on top of an argument all day long , and maintain an appearance of calm control when people are surprising the hell out of you , You worry all day and all night , not about what is happening , but about what might happen , all the things you do n't want to have come up in court . It 's no work for an old man . If you look at those older lawyers who do handle court cases , you 'll notice that they do n't drink and they do n't smoke , they were born with the constitution of a dray horse and they keep themselves in shape . " But every year , fewer law firms find that they can still afford the luxury of sending important court cases to independent barristers . Boards of directors are more careful with the stockholders ' money than they used to be , and there is greater reluctance to pay what looks like two fees for a given piece of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbin and Milton Pollack ? have hung up individual shin-gles in the Wall Street area to tweet the demand for barristers , and they do fine . The ordinary run of lawsuits against corporations ? the lady who slipped on the marble floor of the bank and bruised her hip , for an alleged $1,500,000 worth of psychological damage ? never comes into the ordinary Wall Street office at all . Such cases are processed by house counsel , lawyers on the corporation 's payroll or on the payroll of its insurance company . Some large firms maintain a distant , jobber 's contact with such cases because they manage all a corporation 's legal business , and subcontract the chicken feed to experts on corn . A few of the special fields within the realm of corporate law do call their practitioners constantly before the bar or the commission or the arbitrator . Patents involve constant litigation , and so does admiralty law , whirls is usually the province of firms specializing exclusively in this salt-water world . ( The biggest , with sixteen partners and twenty associates , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Labor work means repeated arbitrations , and in time of crisis frequent appearances before a War Labor Board , Wage Stabilization Board , or what-haveyou . Any part of a law practice may produce a lawsuit at any time ? a broken contract , an adverse decision by the Director of Internal Revenue , an insufferable ruling by the Federal Trade Commission . But even the firms which try a plenitude of lawsuits would still hold to Elihu Root 's old dictum that " a lawyer 's chief business is to keep his clients out of litigation . " Saving , of course , an Act of God ? which , to a big corporate law firm , means an Anti-Trust Case . Both the Sherman and the Clayton Acts are vague laws , drawn to secure a general aim rather than a specific objective . For the purpose of bringing a suit , the phrase " restraint of trade " means what the Attotney General wants it to mean . And the corporation which has been sued must defend its business record , especially its dealings with and/or against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loss of an anti-trust suit will always force a company to make costly changes in its operating procedures , and may involve a substantial fine . ( Or an even more substantial judgment of triple damages , if the case has been brought by a private party . ) The " Brandeis brief , " an enormous agglomeration of statistical and other material calculated to stun a court by its wealth of revelation , is standard operating procedure for the defense , and preparing such a brief requires literally years of work . Individual barristers arc not equipped to carry this kind of burden , and they tend to sneer at anti-trust actions as " not litigation at all ? just office work carried on in a courtroom . " Perhaps the greatest whang-do in legal history was the anti-trust case against the investment banking houses . This one took about three years to prepare , and eight months just for the government to present evidence ( the defense did not have to present evidence , because judge Medina threw out the case ) . The total fees , paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abbot Sc Morgan ; Cahill . Gordon , Zachry 8 : Reindei : Cleary , Gottlieb , Friendly &; Hamilton ; Covington &; Burling ; Cravath , Swaine &; Moore ; Davis , Polk , Wardwell , Sunderland gc Kiendl ; Donovan Leisure Newton Irvine ; Emmet , Marvin &; Martin ; Shearman &; Sterling ; Sullivan &; Cromwell ; Webster , Sheffield Chrystie ? have been conservatively estimated around $3,000,000 . They would have been higher , of course , if the case had run the full possible gamut of judgment and appeal . Even larger fees are paid to the attorneys who shepherd a company from bankruptcy to reorganized normalcy . In such a case the SEC recently allowed $831,000 for the services of Guggenheimer Untermyer ( whose cable address is Melpomene , the Muse of Tragedy ; they had asked for $3,200,000 ) . Technically , this work is litigation , too , since it must be performed under the supervision of a court or a government agency . But the lawyers ' time goes into sorting out the company 's obligations and divvying up among bondholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they invested . It takes years to reach an agreement , and by then , like as not , the economic situation underlying the agreement has changed , and everybody has to start all over again . Wills and estates are the most profitable items in every law office , and any lawyer will feel his future best assured by an intimate relationship with a large , successful , federally-regulated corporation . But the drawn-out court cases , antitrust actions and bankruptcies and reorganizations , are still the classic way to support a law firm . There is an old story about the young man fresh out of law school who came into his father 's office and began going through the files with an idea of straightening things out . He came across an overstuffed folder with records of a court action that had been dragging on over the years , and found that the point remaining at issue between the parties was relatively insignificant . He called the attorney on the other side , and in five minutes closed out the case . Then he went into his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ent-Inis matter . " " Everything cleaned up ? " his father said . " All statements agreed upon ? " " That 's right , " said the boy . " Well , " said his father heavily , " when you leave the office this evening , lock the door and throw away the keys , because we are out of business . "
