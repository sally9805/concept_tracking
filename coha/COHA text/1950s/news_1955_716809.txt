txt Eight private economists viewed the 1955 business outlook with much reserve and some concern today . They unanimously agreed that total productiog probably would rise moderately , but not enough to reduce unemployment below the 1954 level . Five foresaw an increase in unemployment . The effect of their testimony before the joint Congressional Committee on the Economic Report was to cast doubt on the optimistic picture of- prospects portrayed by President Eisenhower in his Economic Report to Congress last week . He predicted " a high and satisfactory level " of employment and production this year . The economists appraised the situation at a round table conducted by the committee as it opened hearings on the President 's report : At the close of the session , they were polled by the chairman , Senator Paul H. Douglas , Democrat of Illinois , on several questions . The five who foresaw higher unemployment in 1955 were Gerhard Colm , chief economist of the National Planning Association ; Calvin Hoover , Economics Professor at Duke University ; Leon H. Keyserling , chairman of the Council of Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Journal of Commerce , New York , and itanley Ruttenberg , education and research director of the Congress of Industrial Organizations . Those who saw no change were William F. Butler , consulting economist of the Chase National Bank , New York ; Martin Gainsbrugh , chief economist of the National Industrial Conference Board , and Dexter M. Keezer , economics director of the Publishing Company , New York . All eight of the panelists looked for the gross national product ? the market value of the total out- put of goods and services  --  to exceed the 1954 level of $357,100 , - 000,000 . Four predicted it would rise above the 1953 level of $364 , - 900,000,000 , but none forecast an increase of as much as 3 per cent over 1953 . There was unanimous agreement that farm income would continue to drop in 1955 . In the round-table discussion , much caution was voiced over the outlook for maintenance of the present high levels of automobile production and home building .

Several of the witnesses suggested tax reductions or a stepup in Government spending to stimulate the upturn . Mr. Keyserling , in one of the least optimistic reports , testified that a 6 per cent increase in the gross national product  --  to about $378,000,000,000 ? was essential to " restore " maximum employment and production by the end of 1955 . " If the American economy in 1955 averages a 3 per cent higher level of output than in 1954 , which is in accord with optimistic forecasts , this would not be nearly enough growth to reduce unemployment sufficiently , absorb new entries into the ' arbor force and keep up with advancing technology , " he asserted . The result , he added , would be " considerably higher " unemployment , which was estimated by the Census Bureau at 3,230,000 in 1954 , as against 1,602,000 in 1953 . Mr. Ruttenberg and Mr. Colm recommended tax seductions to bolster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or higher national defense expenditures might be necessary to stimulate both con- sumption and investment if desired production levels were to be attained . A gross national product of more than $400,000,000,000 should be the 1955 goal , Mr. Ruttenberg said . President Eisenhower had charted a rise to about $500,000 , - 000,000 by 1965 . Mr. Butler , in one of the more optimistic reports , foresaw a 4 per cent increase in the gross national product in " a year of high-level activity and also a yewr of lively competition . " Mr. Gainsbrugh agreed with the President 's conclusion that the recent business recovery was " vigorous , " but he suggested that figures in the Economic Report might have exaggerated the pace . He also expressed concern over " speculative elements , already present in the recovery . " He listed such factors as booming home construction and accumulation of stocks by industry . " In many nonspeculative areas , " he added , " recovery has not begun .
