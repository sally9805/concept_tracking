Illustration : Their combined thought-force hit him like a thunderbolt . THE PENAL CLUSTER By IVAR JORGENSEN Tomorrow 's technocracy will produce more and more things for better living . It will produce other things , also ; among them , criminals too despicable to live on this earth . Too abominable to breathe our free air . The clipped British voice said , in David Houston 's ear , I 'm quite sure he 's one . He 's cashing a check for a thousand pounds . Keep him under surveillance . Houston did n't look up immediately . He simply stood there in the lobby of the big London bank , filling out a deposit slip at one of the long , high desks . When he had finished , he picked up the slip and headed towards the teller 's cage . Ahead of him , standing at the window , was a tall , impeccably dressed , aristocratic-looking man with graying hair . " The man in the tweeds ? " Houston whispered . His voice was so low that it was inaudible a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitive microphone in his collar picked up the voice and relayed it to the man behind the teller 's wicket . That 's him , said the tiny speaker hidden in Houston 's ear . The fine-looking chap in the tweeds and bowler . " Got him , " whispered Houston . * * * * * He did n't go anywhere near the man in the bowler and tweeds ; instead , he went to a window several feet away . " Deposit , " he said , handing the slip to the man on the other side of the partition . While the teller went through the motions of putting the deposit through the robot accounting machine , David Houston kept his ears open . " How did you want the thousand , sir ? " asked the teller in the next wicket . " Ten pound notes , if you please , " said the graying man . " I think a hundred notes will go into my brief case easily enough . " He chuckled , as though he 'd made a clever witticism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Houston whispered into his microphone again . " Who is the guy ? " On the other side of the partition , George Meredith , a small , unimposing-looking man , sat at a desk marked : MR . MEREDITH  --  ACCOUNTING DEPT . He looked as though he were paying no attention whatever to anything going on at the various windows , but he , too , had a microphone at his throat and a hidden pickup in his ear . At Houston 's question , he whispered : " That 's Sir Lewis Huntley . The check 's good , of course . Poor fellow . " " Yeah , " whispered Houston , " if he is what we think he is . " " I 'm fairly certain , " Meredith replied . " Sir Lewis is n't the type of fellow to draw that much in cash . At the present rate of exchange , that 's worth three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars American . Sir Lewis might carry a hundred pounds as pocket-money , but never a thousand . " Houston and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither looked at the other . Unless a bystander had equipment to tune in on the special scrambled wavelength they were using , that bystander would never know they were holding a conversation . " ... nine-fifty , nine-sixty , nine-seventy , nine-eighty , nine-ninety , a thousand pounds , " said the clerk who was taking care of Sir Lewis 's check . " Would you count that to make sure , sir ? " " Certainly . Ten , twenty , thirty , ... " While the baronet was double-checking the amount , David Houston glanced at him . Sir Lewis looked perfectly calm and unhurried , as though he were doing something perfectly legal  --  which , in a way , he was . And , in another way , he most definitely was not , if George Meredith 's suspicions were correct . " Your receipt , sir . " It was the teller at Houston 's own window . Houston took the receipt , thanked the teller , and walked toward the broad front doors of the bank . " George , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " Has n't so much as looked at you , " Meredith answered . " Good hunting . " " Thanks . " * * * * * As Houston stepped outside the bank , he casually dropped one hand into a coat pocket and turned a small knob on his radio control box . " Houston to HQ , " he whispered . " London HQ ; what is it , Houston ? " asked the earpiece . " Leadenhall Street Post . Meredith thinks he 's spotted one . Sir Lewis Huntley . " " Righto . We 've got men in that part of the city now . We 'll have a network posted within five minutes . Can you hold onto him that long ? " Houston looked around . Leadenhall Street was full of people , and the visibility was low . " I 'll have to tail him pretty closely , " Houston said . " Your damned English fogs do n't give a man much chance to see anything . " There was a chuckle from the earphone . " Cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before 1968 . When atomic power replaced coal and oil , our fogs became a devil of a lot cleaner . " The voice was quite clear ; at the London headquarters of the UN Psychodeviant Police , there was no need to wear a throat mike , which had a tendency to make the voice sound muffled in spite of the Statistical Information-Bit Samplers which were supposed to clarify the speech coming through them . " What do you know about 1968 ? " Houston asked sardonically . " Your mother was still pushing you around in a baby-carriage then . " " In a pram , " corrected the Headquarters operator . " That is true , but my dear Aunt Jennifer told me all about it . She was  --  " " The hell with your Aunt Jennifer , " Houston interrupted suddenly . " Here comes Sir Lewis . Get me cover  --  fast ! " " Right . Keep us posted . " Sir Lewis Huntley stepped out of the broad door of the bank and turned left . He took a couple of steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a cigarette out of a silver case , put it in his mouth , and lit it . The glow of the lighter shone yellowly on the brass plate near the door which said : An Affiliate of Westminster Bank , Ltd . Sir Lewis snapped the light out , drew on the cigarette , and strode on down the street , swinging a blue plastex brief case which contained a thousand pounds in United Nations Bank of England notes . Houston decided the baronet had not been looking for a tail ; he wished he could probe the man 's mind to make sure , but he knew that would be fatal . He 'd have to play the game and hope for the best . " He 's heading east , " Houston whispered . " Does n't look as if he 's going to get a cab . " " Check , " said the earphone . Sir Lewis seemed in no great hurry , but he walked briskly , as though he had a definite destination in mind . After a little way , he crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . Houston stayed far enough behind to be above suspicion , but not so far that he ran a chance of losing his man . " He 's turning south on Fenchurch , " Houston said a little later . " I wonder where he 's going . " " Keep after him , " said Headquarters . " Our net men have n't spotted either of you yet . They can hardly see across the street in this damned fog . " Houston kept going . " What the hell ? " he whispered a few minutes later . " He 's still following Fenchurch Street ! He 's doubling back ! " Leadenhall Street , the banking center of the City of London , runs almost due east-and-west ; Fenchurch Street makes a forty-five degree angle with it at the western end , running southwest for a bit and then curving toward the west , toward Lombard . " Houston , " said HQ , " touch your left ear . " Houston obediently reached up and scratched his left ear . " Okay , " said HQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't spotted Sir Lewis . Bogart 's across the street . " " He ca n't miss Sir Lewis , " whispered Houston . " Conservatively dressed  --  matching coat and trousers of orange nylon tweed  --  royal blue half-brim bowler  --  carrying a blue brief case . " There was a pause , then : " Yeah . Bogart 's spotted him , and so has MacGruder . Mac 's on your side , a few yards ahead . " " Check . How about the rest of the net ? " " Coming , coming . Be patient , old man . " " I am patient , " growled Houston . I have to be , he thought to himself , otherwise I 'd never stay alive . " We 've got him bracketed now , " HQ said . " If we lose him now , he 's a magician . " Sir Lewis walked on , seemingly oblivious to the group of men who had surrounded him . He came to the end of Fenchurch Street and looked to his left , towards London Bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's looking for a cab , " Houston whispered . " That 's what MacGruder says , " came the reply . " We 've got Arthmore in a cab behind you ; he 'll pick you up . MacGruder will get another cab , and we have a private car for Bogart . " Sir Lewis flagged a cab , climbed in , and gave an address to the driver . Houston did n't hear it , but MacGruder , a heavy-set , short , balding man , was standing near enough to get the instructions Sir Lewis had given to the driver . * * * * * A cab pulled up to the curb near Houston , and he got in . Arthmore , the driver , was a thin , tall , hawknosed individual who could have played Sherlock Holmes on TV . Once he got into character for a part , he never got out of it unless absolutely necessary . Right now , he was a Cockney cab-driver , and he would play the part to the hilt . " Where to , guv'nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Houston . " I 've got a poker appointment with Prince Charles . " " Blimey , guv'nor , " said Arthmore . " You are movin ' in ' igh circles ! ' Ow 's ' Er Majesty these days ? " The turboelectric motor hummed , and the cab shot off into traffic . " According to the report I get on the blinkin ' wireless , " he continued , " a chap named MacGruder claims that the eminent Sir Lewis ' Untley is ' eaded for Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews . " " One of these days , " said Houston , " all those H 's you drop is going to bounce back and hit you in the face . " " Beg pardon , Mr. Yewston ? " Arthmore asked blankly . Houston grinned . " Nothing , cabbie ; it 's just that you remind me of a cultured , intelligent fellow named Jack Arthmore . The only difference is that Jack speaks the Queen 's English . " " Crikey ! " said Arthmore . " Wot a coincidence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , you say ? She ' as to be , do n't she ? " " Shut up , " said Houston conversationally . " And give me a cigarette , " he added . " There 's a package of Players in my shirt pocket , " Arthmore said , keeping his hands on the wheel . * * * * * Houston fished out a cigarette , lit it , and returned the pack . Apropos of nothing , Arthmore said : " Reminds me of the time I was workin ' for a printer , see ? We ' ad to print up a bunch of ' andbills advertisin ' a church charity bazaar . Down at the bottom was supposed to be printed ' Under the auspices of St. Bede's-on-Thames . ' So I  --  " He went on with a long , rambling tale about making a mistake in printing the handbill . Houston paid little attention . He smoked in silence , keeping his eyes on the red glow of the taillight ahead of them . Neither man mentioned the approaching climax of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look forward to the possibility of having their minds taken over , controlled by some outside force . It had never happened to Houston , but he knew that Arthmore had been through the experience once . It evidently was n't pleasant . "  --  and the boss was ' oppin ' mad , " Arthmore was saying , " but , crikey , ' ow was I to know that auspice was spelled A-U-S-P-I-C-E ? " Houston grinned . " Yeah , sure . How 're we doing with Sir Lewis ? " " Seems to be headed in the right direction , " Arthmore said , suddenly dropping the Cockney accent . " This is the route I 'd take if I were headed for Upper Berkeley Mews . He probably has n't told the driver to change addresses  --  maybe he wo n't . " " The victims never do , " Houston said . " He probably is actually headed toward Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews . " " Yeah . Nobody 's perfect , " said Arthmore. * * * * * Forty-five minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis Huntley to Upper Berkeley and to the short dead-end street which constituted the Mews . By the time the dapper baronet stepped out of the machine and paid his driver , the whole area was surrounded by and filled with the well-armed , silent , and careful agents of the Psychodeviant Police . Number 37 was an old concrete-and-steel structure of the George VI period , faced with a veneer of red brick . It had obviously been remodeled at least once to make the facade more modern and more fashionable ; the red-violet anodized aluminum was relatively fresh and unstained . It would n't have taken vast wealth to rent a flat in the building , but neither would an average income have been quite enough . Houston looked out of the window of Arthmore 's cab and glanced at the tiers of windows in the building . Presumably , the man they were looking for was up there  --  somewhere . So you occupy a station in the upper middle-class , thought Houston . It checked . Every bit of evidence that came his way seemed to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed . Soon it would be time to test that theory  --  but the time had not yet come . " Stand by and wait for orders , Houston , " said the speaker in Houston 's ear . " We 've got men inside the building . " Sir Lewis Huntley opened the sparkling , translucent door of Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews and went inside . Arthmore pulled the cab over to the curb a few yards from the entrance and the two men waited in silence . All around them were other men , some in private cars , some walking slowly along the street . All of them were part of the net that had gathered to catch one man . Poor fish , Houston thought wryly . There was no noise , no excitement . Five minutes after Sir Lewis had entered the front door , it opened again . A man whom Houston had never seen before stepped out and gestured with one hand . At the same time , Houston 's speaker said : " They 've got him . Hit him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire exit . " An ambulance which had been waiting at the entrance of the Mews pulled up in front of Number 37 , and a minute or so later a little clot of men came out bearing a stretcher , which was loaded into the ambulance . Immediately after them came another man who had a firm , but polite grip on the arm of Sir Lewis Huntley . Houston sighed and leaned back in his seat . That was that . It was all over . Simple . Nothing to it . Another Controller had been apprehended by the Psychodeviant Police . Another deviant , already tried and found guilty , was ready to be exiled from Earth and imprisoned on one of the Penal Asteroids . All in the day 's work . There 's just one thing I 'd like to know , Houston thought blackly . What in the hell 's going on ? * * * * * In his hotel room near Piccadilly Circus , several hours later , David Houston sat alone , drink in hand , and put that same question to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the face of it , it was simple . On the face of it , the answer was right in front of him , printed in black and white on the front page of the evening Times . Houston lifted the paper off the bed and looked at it . The banner line said : Controller Captured in Lambeth ! Beneath that , in smaller type , the headline added : Robert Harris Accused of Taking Control of Barrister Sir Lewis Huntley . The column itself told the whole story . Mr. Robert Harris , of No. 37 Upper Berkeley Mews , had , by means of mental control , taken over the mind of Sir Lewis and compelled him to draw one thousand pounds out of his bank . While Sir Lewis was returning to Harris with the money , the United Nations Psychodeviant Police had laid a trap . Sir Lewis , upon recovering his senses when Harris was rendered unconscious by a stun gun , had given evidence to the PD Police and to officials at New Scotland Yard . Houston looked at the full-color photo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; late twenties or early thirties , Houston guessed . Blond-red hair , blue eyes . All-in-all , a very pleasant , but ordinary sort of man . There had been evidence that a Controller had been at work in London for some weeks now . Twelve days before , several men , following an impulse , had mailed twenty pounds to a " Richard Hempstead , " General Delivery , Waterloo Station . By the time the matter had come to the authorities ' attention , the envelopes had been called for and the Controller had escaped . Robert Harris was not the first Controller to be captured , nor , Houston knew , would he be the last . The first one had shown up more than sixteen years before , in Dallas , Texas , USA . Houston grinned as he thought of it . Projective telepathy had only been a crackpot 's idea back then . In spite of the work of many intelligent , sane men , who had shown that mental powers above and beyond the ordinary did exist , the average man simply laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic ; it was foolish superstition . It was anything but true . But ever since " Blackjack " Donnely had practically taken control of the whole city of Dallas , the average man had changed his mind . It was still mysterious ; it was still magic ; but now the weird machinations of the supernormal mind were something to be feared . In the sixteen years that had ensued since the discovery of the abnormal mental powers of " Blackjack " Donnely , rumors had spread all over the world . There were supposed to be men who could levitate  --  fly through the air at will . Others could walk through walls , and still others could make themselves invisible . The horrible monsters that were supposed to be walking the Earth were legion . * * * * * Actually , only one type of supernormal psychodeviant had been found  --  the telepath , the mindreader who could probe into the mental processes of others . Worse than that , the telepath could project his own thoughts into the mind of another , so that the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a high-powered form of hypnotism ; the victim could be made to do anything the projective telepath wanted him to . " Blackjack " Donnely had made that clear in his trial in Texas . Donnely had been a big man  --  big physically , and important in city politics . He had also been as arrogant as the Devil himself . It was the arrogance that had finally tripped up Donnely . He had thought himself impregnable . Haled into court on charges of misappropriation of public funds , he had just sat and smirked while several witnesses for the State admitted that they had aided Donnely , but they claimed he had " hypnotized " them . Donnely did n't try to interfere with the evidence  --  that 's where he made his mistake . And that 's where his arrogance tripped him up . * * * * * If he 'd used telepathic projection to influence the State Attorney or the witnesses or the judge or the Grand Jury before the trial , he might never have been discovered as the first of the Controllers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of this namby-pamby stuff , " he had once been quoted as saying ; " if you got enemies , do n't tease ' em  --  show ' em who 's running things . Blackjack ' em , if you have to . " And that 's exactly what " Blackjack " Donnely had done . The trial was a farce from beginning to end ; each witness gave his evidence from the stand , and then Donnely took control of their minds and made them refute every bit of it , publicly and tearfully apologizing to the " wonderful Mr. Donnely " for saying such unkind things about him . The judge and the jury knew something funny was going on , but they had no evidence , one way or another . The case , even at that point , might have ended with an acquittal or a hung jury , but Donnely was n't through using his blackjack . He took over the mind of the foreman of the jury . The foreman claimed later that the jury had decided that they could reach no decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was probably an ex post facto switch . It did n't matter , anyway ; when the foreman came out , he pronounced Donnely innocent . That should have ended it . The other jurors began to protest , but by that time , Donnely had gained control of the judge 's mind . Rapidly , the judge silenced the jurors , declared Donnely to be free , and then publicly apologized for ever daring to doubt Mr. Donnely . The State 's Attorney was equally verbose in his apology ; he was almost in tears because of his " deep contrition at having cast aspersions on the spotless character of so great a man . " Donnely was released . The next evening , " Blackjack " Donnely was shot down at the front door of his own home . There were fifteen bullets in his body ; three from a .32 , five from a .38 , and seven from a .45 . The police investigation was far from thorough ; any evidence that may have turned up somehow got lost . It was labelled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it stayed that way . * * * * * Donnely was only the first . In the next two years , four more showed up . Everyone of them , in one way or another , had attempted to gain power or money by mental projection . Everyone of them was a twisted megalomaniac . Houston looked again at Harris 's picture on the front page of the Times . Here was one Controller who neither looked nor acted like a megalomaniac . That would n't make much difference to the PD Police ; as far as the officials were concerned , the ability to project telepathically and the taint of delusions of grandeur went hand in hand . Controllers were power-mad and criminal by definition . Fear still ruled the emotional reactions against Controllers , in spite of the protection of the Psychodeviant Police . But David Houston knew damned good and well that all telepaths were not necessarily insane . He should know . He was a Controller , himself . * * * * * Brrrring ! David Houston tossed the paper on the bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit , and waited for the phone 's TV screen to show the face of his caller . But the screen remained blank . " Who is it ? " Houston asked . " Is this CHAring Cross 7-8161 ? " It was a woman 's voice , soft and well-modulated . " No , this is CHElsea 7-8161 , " Houston said . " You must have dialed C-H-E instead of C-H-A . " " Oh . I 'm very sorry . Excuse me . " There was a click , and she hung up . Houston walked back over to the bed and picked up his paper . He looked at it , but he did n't read it . It no longer interested him . So Dorrine was finally in London , eh ? He 'd recognized her voice instantly ; even years of training could n't smother the midwestern American of Chicago completely beneath the precise British of the well-educated English girl . The signal had been agreed upon , just in case his phone was tapped . Even the Psychodeviant Police could be suspected of harboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely . Nevertheless , he was n't one to take too many chances . He glanced at his watch . He had an hour yet . He 'd wait five minutes before he phoned headquarters . * * * * * He sat down in his chair again and forced himself to relax , smoke a cigarette , and read the paper  --  the sports section . Perusing the records of the season 's cricket matches kept his mind off that picture on the front page . At least , he hoped they would . Let 's see , now  --  Benton was being rated as the finest googly bowler on the Staffordshire Club ... Everything went fine until he came across a reference to a John Harris , a top-flight batsman for Hambledon ; that reminded him of Robert Harris . Houston threw down the paper in disgust and walked over to the phone . The number was TROwbridge 5-4321 , but no one ever bothered to remember it . Simply dial 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 , and every time a voice at the other end would answer  --  " Hamilton speaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next hour or so ? " " Mmmm . Just a second ; I 'll check the roster . No ; your evidence wo n't be needed personally . You 've filed an affidavit . No , I do n't think  --  wait a minute ! Yes , there 's a return here for you ; reservation on the six A.M. jet to New York . Your job here is done , Houston , so you can take the rest of the evening off and relax . Going anywhere in particular ? " " I thought I 'd get a bite to eat and take in a movie , maybe , but if I 'm due out at six , I 'll forego the cinematic diversion . When 's the trial ? " " It 's scheduled for eleven-thirty this evening . Going to come ? " Houston shook his head . " Not if I 'm not needed to give evidence . Those Controllers always give me the creeps . " " They do everybody , " said Hamilton . " Well , you caught him ; there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have a good time . " " Thanks , " said Houston shortly , and hung up . The windup , Houston thought . Sure . That 's all it will be . A Controller 's trial is a farce . Knock him out with a stun gun and then pump him full of comatol . How can he defend himself if he 's unconscious all through the trial ? Houston knew what the average man 's answer to that would be : " If a Controller were allowed to remain conscious , he 'd take over the judge 's mind and get himself freed . " Houston said an obscene word under his breath , jammed his hat on his head , put on his coat , and left his apartment . * * * * * With the coming of darkness , the heavy fog had become still denser . The yellow beams of the sodium vapor lamps were simply golden spots hanging in an all-enveloping blackness . Walking the street was a process of moving from one little golden island of light to another , crossing seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human faces that passed beneath the lamps , robbing them of all color , giving them a dead , grayish appearance beneath the yellow itself . David Houston walked purposefully along the pavement , his hand jammed deep in his overcoat pockets . One hand held the control box for the little earpiece he wore . He kept moving the band selector , listening for any sign that the Psychodeviant Police were suspicious of a Controller in their midst . If they were following him , of course , they would use a different scrambler circuit than the one which was plugged into his own unit , but he would be able to hear the gabble of voices , even if he could n't understand what they were saying . So far , there had n't been a sound ; if he was being followed , his tailers were n't using the personal intercom units . He did n't try to elude anyone who might be following . That , in itself , would be a giveaway . Let them watch , if they were watching . They would n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dinner . The Charles II Inn , on Regent Street , near Piccadilly Circus , was a haven of brightness in an otherwise Stygian London . It was one of those " old-fashioned " places  --  Restoration style of decoration , carried out in modern plastics . The oak panelling looked authentic enough , but it was just a little too glossy to be real . Houston pushed open the door , stepped inside , removed his hat and coat and shook the dampness from them . As he handed them to the checker , he looked casually around . Dorrine was nowhere in sight , but he had n't expected her to be . There would be no point in their meeting physically ; it might even be downright dangerous . The headwaiter , clad in the long waistcoat and full trunk-hose of the late Seventeenth Century , bowed punctiliously . " You 're alone , sir ? " " Alone , yes , " Houston said . " I 'll just be wanting a light supper and a drink or two . " " This way , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rear of the huge dining room . It was set for two , but the other place was quickly cleared away . Houston ordered an Irish-and-soda from a waiter who was only slightly less elaborately dressed than the headwaiter , and then settled himself down to wait . If he knew Dorrine , she would be on time to the minute . She came while the waiter was setting the drink on Houston 's table . She stepped in through the door , her unmistakable hair glowing a rich red in the illumination of the pseudo-candlelight . She did n't bother to look around ; she knew he would be there . After a single glance , Houston averted his eyes from her and looked back at his drink . And in that same instant , their minds touched . Dave , darling ! I knew you 'd be early ! Dorrine ! And then their minds meshed for an instant . I  --  ( we )  --  you  --  LOVE  --  you  --  ( each other )  --  me !  --  us ! * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorrine to a table on the far side of the room . She sat down gracefully , smiled at the waiter , and ordered a cocktail . Then she took a magazine from her handbag and began  --  presumably  --  to read . Her thought came : Who is this Richard Harris ? He 's not one of our Group . Houston sipped at his drink . No . An unknown , like the others . I wonder if he 's even a telepath . What ? Her thought carried astonishment . Why , Dave  --  he 'd have to be ! How else could he have controlled this Sir Lewis  --  whatsisname  --  Huntley ? Well  --  I 've got a funny idea , Houston replied . Look at it this way : So far as we know , there are two Groups of telepaths . There 's our own Group . All we want is to be left alone . We do n't read a Normal 's mind unless we have to , and we do n't try to control one unless our lives are threatened . We stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are the megalomaniacs . They try , presumably , to gain wealth and power by controlling Normals . And they get caught with monotonous regularity . Right ? The girl caught an odd note in that thought . What do you mean , " monotonous regularity " ? she asked . I mean , Houston thought savagely , why is it they 're all so bloody stupid ? Look at this Harris guy ; he is supposed to have taken over Sir Lewis 's mind in order to get a thousand pounds . So what did he have Sir Lewis do ? Parade all around the city to pick up a PD Police net , and then give his address to a cabman in a loud voice and lead the whole net right to Harris ! How stupid can a man get ? It does look pretty silly , Dorrine agreed . Have you got an explanation ? Several , Houston told her . And I do n't know which one is correct . Let 's have them , the girl thought . * * * * * Houston gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was completely satisfactory , but they all made more sense that the theory that Harris had done what the PD Police claimed he 'd done . Theory Number One : The real megalomaniac Controller had taken over Sir Lewis 's mind and made him draw out the thousand pounds and head west on Leadenhall Street . Somehow , the Controller had found out that Sir Lewis was being followed , and had steered him away from the original destination , heading him toward the innocent Robert Harris . That implied that the Controller had been within a few dozen yards of the net men that afternoon . A Controller ca n't control a mind directly from a distance , although orders can be implanted which will cause a man to carry out a plan of action , even though he may be miles from the Controller . But in order to change those plans , the Controller would have to be within projection range . Theory Two : Robert Harris actually was a megalomaniac Controller ; with a long record of success behind him , who had finally grown careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't it possible that he wanted to be caught ? Houston mulled it over for a minute . A guilt-punishment reaction ? He wanted to be punished for his crimes ? I suppose that might account for part of it , yes . But if he 'd been so successful , what did he do with all his money ? Dorrine gave a mental shrug . Who knows ? What 's Theory Number Three ? * * * * * Number Three was the screwiest one of all , yet it made a weird kind of sense . Suppose that Sir Lewis himself had had a grudge against Harris ? The whole thing would have been ridiculously easy ; all he 'd have to do would be to act just as he had acted and then give evidence against Harris . The thing that made it odd was n't the actual frame-up ( if that 's what it was ) ; these days , every crime was blamed on a Controller . A man accused of murder simply looked virtuous and said that he would never have done such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Controller . Ditto for robbery , rape , and any other felony you 'd care to name . An aura of fear hung over the whole Earth ; each man half suspected everyone with whom he came in contact of being a Controller . So it was n't that the frame-up in itself was peculiar in this case ; it was simply that it was n't Sir Lewis Huntley 's style . If Sir Lewis had wanted to get Harris , he 'd have done it legally , without any underhanded frame-ups . Still , the theory remained as a possibility . I suppose it does , Dorrine agreed , but how does that tie in with our own Group ? What about Jackson and Marcy ? What happened to them ? I do n't know , Houston admitted , I just do n't know . Jackson and Marcy had been members of the Group of telepaths who had banded together for companionship and mutual protection . Both of them had been trapped by the PD Police in exactly the same way that Harris had been trapped . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in the Penal Cluster . Their arrests did n't make sense , either ; they had been accused of taking over someone 's mind for the purpose of gaining money illegally  --  illegal , that is , according to the new UN laws that had been passed to supersede the various national laws that had previously been in effect . But Houston had known both men well , and neither of them was the kind of man who would pull such a stunt , much less do it in such a stupid manner . Dorrine thought : Well , Dave , this Harris case is out of our hands now ; we 've got to concentrate on getting others into the Group  --  we 've got to find the other sane ones . You 're ready to take over here , then ? he asked . * * * * * At the table , several yards away from where Houston was sitting , Dorrine , still looking at the book , smiled faintly . I 'll have to ; you 're being transferred back to New York at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise to bridge the gap between their minds . How 'd you know that ? He had n't told her , and she could n't have forced the knowledge from his mind . A telepath can open the mind of a Normal as simply as he might open the pages of a book , but the mind of another Controller is far stronger . One telepath could n't force anything from the mind of another ; all thoughts had to be exchanged voluntarily . She was still smiling . We 've got a few spies in the UN now , she told him . I got the information before you did . You knew before you left New York ? he asked incredulously . That 's right , she thought . The decision was made last night . Why ? Nothing , he told her . I was just surprised , that 's all . But deep behind the telepathic barrier he had erected against her probing mind , he was thinking something else . He had been assigned to London to capture the Controller  --  then unknown  --  who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order had been decided upon before Harris was caught  --  or even suspected . Someone in the UN Psychodeviant Police Supreme Headquarters in New York must have known that Harris would be caught that day ! Something 's bothering you , Dorrine stated flatly . I was thinking about leaving London , he replied evasively . I have n't seen you for six months , and now I have to leave again . I 'll be back in New York within three weeks , the girl thought warmly . I 'll be  --  Her thoughts were cut off suddenly by a strident voice in Houston 's ear . " Attention ; all-band notice . Robert Bentley Harris , arraigned this evening on a charge of illegal use of psychodeviant powers for the purpose of compounding a felony , has been found guilty as charged . He was therefore sentenced by the Lord Justice of Her Majesty 's Court of Star Chamber to be banished from Earth forever , such banishment to be carried out by the United Nations Penology Service at the Queen 's pleasure . " The words that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dorrine . For a moment , neither of them made any comment . Then Houston glanced at his watch . Twenty-one minutes , he thought bitterly . What took them so long ? * * * * * High in the thin ionosphere , seventy miles above the surface of the Earth , a **28;1135;TOOLONG rocket airliner winged its way westward across the Atlantic , pushing herself forward on the thin , whispering , white-hot jets of her atomic engine . Behind her , the outdistanced sun sank slowly below the eastern horizon . David Houston was n't watching the sunrise-in-reverse ; he was sitting quietly in his seat , still trying to puzzle out his queer recall to New York . When Hamilton had told him about it over the phone , he 'd assumed that New York , having been notified that Harris had been captured , had decided to send for Houston , now that his job was over . But now he knew that the order had come through nearly twenty-four hours before Harris was captured . Did someone at UN Headquarters know that Harris was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was something odd about Police Operative David Houston ? Or both ? Whatever it was , Houston would have to take his chances ; to act suspiciously would be a deadly mistake . A stewardess , clad in the chic BOAC uniform , moved down the aisle , quietly informing the passengers that they could have coffee served at their seats or take breakfast in the lounge . The atmosphere of the plane 's interior was filled with the low murmur of a hundred conversations against the background of the susurrant mutter of the mighty engines . Uhhh  --  uh  --  uh  --  dizzy  --  head hurts  --  uh  --  uh  --  The sounds in the plane altered subtly as the faint thought insinuated itself on every brain inside the aircraft . None of the Normal passengers recognized it for what it was ; it was too gentle , too weak , to be recognized directly by their minds . But David Houston recognized it instantly for what it was . Somewhere on the plane , a Controller had been unconscious . Had been . For now , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of nothingness . Uh  --  uhhhh  --  uhh  --  The Normal passengers became uneasy , not knowing why they were disturbed . To them , it was like a vaguely unpleasant but totally unrecognizable nudge from their own subconscious , like some long-forgotten and deeply buried memory that had been forced down into oblivion and was now trying to obtrude itself on the conscious mind . Uhhh  --  Oooohh  --  where ?  --  what happened ?  --  A fully conscious telepath could project his thoughts along a narrow locus , focusing them on a single brain , leaving all other brains oblivious to his thoughts . Like a TV broadcasting station , he could choose his wavelength and stick to it . But a half-conscious Controller sprayed his thoughts at random , creating mental disturbances in his vicinity . Like a thunderstorm creating radio static , there was no selectivity . Savagely , David Houston did what he had to do . It might be a trap , but he had to avoid the carnage that might follow if this went on . He hurled a beam of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DO N'T THINK ! RELAX ! Normally it was impossible for a Controller to take over the mind of another Controller , but these were abnormal circumstances ; the half-conscious man , whoever he was , was weakened mentally by some kind of enforced unconsciousness  --  either a drug or a stun gun . Houston took over his mind smoothly and easily . Robert Harris ! Houston recognized the mind as soon as he held it . He did n't try to force anything on Harris 's mind ; he simply held it , cradling it , helping Harris to regain consciousness easily , bringing him up from the darkness gently . In normal sleep , everyone 's mind retains a certain amount of self-control and awareness of environment . If it did n't , noise and bright lights would n't awaken a sleeping person . * * * * * In normal sleep , a telepath retained enough control to keep his thoughts to himself , even when waking up . But total anaesthesia brought on a mental blackout from which the victim recovered only with effort . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing to the Normal minds around him , who mistook his disordered thoughts for their own . Like pouring heavy oil on choppy waters , Houston soothed the disturbances of Harris 's mind , focusing the random broadcasts on his own brain . And while he did that , he probed gently into the weakened mind of the prisoner for information . Harris was a Controller , all right ; there was no doubt about that . But nowhere in his mind was there any trace of any knowledge of what had happened to Sir Lewis Huntley . If Sir Lewis had actually been controlled , it had n't been done by Robert Harris . Houston wished he 'd been able to probe Sir Lewis 's mind ; he 'd have been able to get a lot more information out of it than he had in his possession now . But that would have been dangerous ; if Sir Lewis was a Controller himself , and had been acting a part , Houston would have given himself away the instant he attempted to touch the baronet 's mind . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the control of another telepath , any probing into the mind of the puppet would have betrayed Houston to the real Controller . Harris knew nothing . He was n't acquainted with any other Controllers , and had kept his nose clean ever since he 'd discovered his latent powers . He knew that megalomaniac Controllers were either captured or mobbed , and he had no wish to experience either . The Normals had long since discovered that the only way to overcome a Controller was by force of numbers . A Controller could only hold one Normal mind at a time . That was why a mob could easily kill a single Controller ; that was why the Psychodeviant Police had evolved the " net " system for arresting a telepath . Harris , then , had been framed . Or could it be called a frame-up when Harris was really guilty of the actual crime ? Because the crime he had really been accused of was not that of controlling Sir Lewis , but the crime of being a telepath . That , and that alone , damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking over a mind for gain was incidental . The stigma lies in what he was , not what he did . Harris himself was in the bottom of the plane , in the baggage section near the landing gear . After his trial , still drugged , he had been secretly put aboard , to be taken to the Long Island Spaceport in New York . It had had to be secret ; no Normal would knowingly ride on an aircraft which carried a Controller , even if he were drugged into total unconsciousness . With Harris were two PD Police guards . Their low conversation impinged on Harris 's ears , and was transmitted to Houston 's mind . Suddenly , one of them said : " Hey ! He 's moving ! " " Better give him another shot , Harry ; " said the other , " when those guys wake up , they drive you crazy . " Houston could almost feel the sting of the needle as it was inserted into the arm of the helpless prisoner . Slowly , Harris 's thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaotic , finally sliding off into silence and darkness . " Are you all right , sir ? " Houston looked up from his intense concentration . The stewardess was standing by his seat . He realized that there was a film of perspiration on his brow , and that he probably had looked dazed while he was concentrating on Harris 's mind . " Sure , " he said quickly , " I 'm all right . I 'm just a little tired . Had to get up too early to catch this plane . " He rubbed his forehead . " I do have a little headache ; would you happen to have any aspirin aboard ? " She smiled professionally . " Certainly , sir . I 'll get a couple of tablets . " As she left for the first-aid cabinet , Houston thought bleakly to himself : Harris was framed . Possibly others have been , too . But by whom ? And why ? He could see why a Normal might do such a thing . But why would a Controller do it ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controller , or a group of Controllers who were megalomaniacs par excellence . If that were so , he  --  or they  --  could make the late " Blackjack " Donnely look like a meek , harmless , little mouse . * * * * * The one part of Continental U.S.A. over which the American Government had no jurisdiction was small , areawise , in comparison with its power . The District of the United Nations occupied the small area of Manhattan Island which ran from 38th Street on the south to 49th Street on the north ; its western border was Third Avenue , its eastern , the East River . From here , the UN ruled Earth . There were no walls or fences around it ; only by looking at street signs could anyone tell that they had crossed an international border . Crossing Third Avenue from west to east , one found that 45th Street had suddenly become Deutschland Strasse ; 40th Street became Rue de France ; 47th was the Via Italiano. 43rd Street 's sign was painted in Cyrillic characters , but beneath it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Russia . " Third Avenue was technically One World Drive . Second Avenue was labelled as Planetary Peace Drive , and First was United Nations Drive . But New Yorkers are , and always have been , diehards . Just as The Avenue of the Americas had forever remained Sixth Avenue , no matter what the maps called it , so had the other streets retained their old names in conversation . Even the International Post Office , after years of wrangling , had given up , and letters addressed to Supreme Headquarters , United Nations Police , 45th Street at Second Avenue , were delivered without comment , even though the IPO still firmly held that they were technically misaddressed . And , privately , even the IPO officials admitted that the numbers were easier to say and remember than the polyglot street names that had been tagged on by the General Assembly . So when David Houston signalled a taxi at Grand Central Station and said , " Forty-fifth and Second , " the driver simply set his automatic controls , leaned back in his seat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? " When no answer was forthcoming , the driver turned around and took a good look at his passenger . " Maybe you 're a UN cop yourself , huh ? " Houston shook his head . " Nope . Some kids have been scribbling dirty words on my sidewalk , and I 'm going to report it to the authorities . " The driver turned back around and looked ahead again . " Jeez ! That 's serious . Had n't you better take it up with the Secretary General ? I would n't be satisfied with no underlings in a case like that . " " I 'm thinking of taking it up with the Atomic Energy Control Board , " Houston told him . " I think those kids are using radioactive chalk . " " That 's one way for ' em to get blue jeans , " said the driver cryptically . There was silence for a moment as the taxi braked smoothly to a halt , guided and controlled by the automatic machinery in the hood . Then , suddenly , the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along 45th Street , toward Long Island . Far in the distance was a rapidly rising vapor trail , pointing vertically toward the sky , the unmistakable sign of a spaceship takeoff . They did n't leave often , and it was still an unusual sight . Houston said nothing as he climbed out and paid the driver , tossing in an extra tip . " Thanks , buddy , " said the driver . " Watch out for them kids . " Houston did n't answer . He was still watching the vapor trail as the cab pulled away . * * * * * There goes Harris , he was thinking . An innocent man , guilty of nothing more than being born different . And because of that , he 's labelled as an inhuman monster , not even worthy of being executed . Instead , he 's taken into space , filled full of hibernene , and chained to a floating piece of rock for the rest of his life . Such was humanity 's " humane " way of taking care of the bogey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it had long since been proved that legalized murder , execution by the State , solved nothing , helped no one , prevented no crimes , and did infinitely more harm than good in the long run . With the coming of the Controllers , a movement had arisen to bring back the old evil of judicial murder , but it had been quickly put down when the Penal Cluster plan had been put forth as a more " humane " method . Hibernene was a drug that had been evolved from the study of animals like the bear , which spent its winters in an almost death-like sleep . A human being , given a proper dosage of the drug , lapsed into a deep coma . The bodily processes were slowed down ; the heart throbbed sluggishly , once every few minutes ; thought ceased . It was the ideal prison for a mental offender that ordinary prisons could not hold . But it was n't quite enough for the bloodthirsty desire for vengeance that the Normals held for the Controllers . There had to be more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by some ninety-three million miles , were a group of tiny asteroids , occupying what is known as the Trojan position . They were invisible from Earth , being made of dark rock and none of them being more than fifteen feet in diameter . But they had been a source of trouble in some of the early expeditions to Mars , and had been carefully charted by the Space Commission . Now a use had been found for them . A man in a spacesuit could easily be chained to one of them . With him was a small , sun-powered engine and tanks of liquified food concentrates and oxygen . Kept under the influence of hibernene , and kept cool by the chill of space , a man could spend the rest of his life there  --  unmoving , unknowing , uncaring , dead as far as he and the rest of Mankind were concerned  --  his slight bodily needs tended automatically by machine . It was a punishment that satisfied both sides of the life-or-death argument . Houston shook off the bleak , black feeling of terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the UN Police building . * * * * * The thirteenth floor housed the Psychodeviant Division . As he stood in the rising elevator , Houston wondered wryly if the number 13 was good luck or bad in this case . He stepped out of the elevator and headed for the Division Chief 's office . Division Chief Reinhardt was a heavy-set , balding man , built like a professional wrestler . His cold blue eyes gleamed from beneath shaggy , overhanging brows , and his face was almost expressionless except for a faint scowl that crossed it from time to time . In spite of the fact that a Canadian education had wiped out all but the barest trace of German accent , his Prussian training , of the old Junkers school , was still evident . He demanded  --  and got  --  precision and obedience from his subordinates , although he had no use for the strictly military viewpoint of obsequiousness towards one 's superiors . He was sitting behind his desk , scowling slightly at some papers on it when Houston stepped in . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Reinhardt looked up , his heavy face becoming expressionless . " Ah , Houston . Yes ; sit down . You did a fine job on that London affair ; that 's what I call coming through at the last moment . " " How so ? " " Your orders to return , " he said , " were cut before you found your man . We have a much more important case for you than some petty pilfering Controller . We are after much more dangerous game . " Houston nodded . " I see . " Inwardly , he wondered . It was almost as if Reinhardt knew that Houston had found out that the recall had come early . Houston would have given his right arm at that moment to be able to probe Reinhardt 's mind . But he held himself back . He had , in the past , sent tentative probes toward the Division Chief and found nothing , but he did n't know whether it would be safe now or not . It would be better to wait . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , and turned on a display screen . He twisted a knob to a certain setting , and a map of Manhattan Island sprang onto the screen in glowing color . " As you know , " Reinhardt said pedantically , " no Controller can do a perfect job of controlling a normal person . No matter how much he may want to make John Smith act naturally , some of the personality of the Controller will show up in the actions of John Smith . Am I correct ? " Houston nodded without saying anything . The question was purely rhetorical , and the statement was perfectly correct . " Very well , then , " Reinhardt continued , " by means of these peculiarities , our psychologists have found that there is widespread , but very subtle controlling going on right in the UN General Assembly itself ! The amazing thing is that they all bear the  --  shall we say  --  trademark of the same Controller . Whoever he is , he seems to have a long-range plan in mind ; he wants to change , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit by them . Do you follow ? " " I follow , " said Houston . " Good . It has taken painstaking research and a great deal of psychological statistical analysis , but we have found that one company  --  and one company only  --  benefits by these legal changes . Did you ever hear of Lasser &amp; Sons ? " " Sure , " said Houston . " They 're in the import-export business , with a few fingers in shipping and air transport . " " That 's them , " said Reinhardt . " Someone in that company , presumably someone at the top , is a Controller . And he 's a very subtle , very dangerous man . Unlike the others , there is nothing hasty or overt in his plans . But within a few years , if this goes on , he will have more power than the others ever dreamed of . " " And my job is to get him ? " Houston asked . Reinhardt nodded . " That 's it . Get him . One way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you do it , but this one Controller is more dangerous than any other we 've come across , so get him . " Houston nodded slowly . " Okay . Can you give me all the data you have so far ? " Reinhardt patted a heavy folder on his desk . " It 's all here . " Then he tapped the projected map on the screen . " That 's the Lasser Building  --  Church Street at Worth . Somewhere in there is the man we 're looking for . " * * * * * David Houston spent the next six weeks gathering facts , trying to determine the identity of the mysterious Controller at Lasser &amp; Sons . Slowly , the evidence began to pile up . At the same time , he worried over his own problem . Who was betraying non-criminal Controllers to the PD Police ? In that six-week period , two more men and a woman were arrested  --  one in Spain , one in India , and one in Hawaii . There were n't very many Controllers on Earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth , less than an estimated one-thousandth of one percent were telepathic . But that made a grand total of some thirty-five thousand people . Spread , as they were , all over the planet , it was rare that one Controller ever met another . The intelligent ones did n't use their power ; they remained concealed , even from each other . But someone , somewhere , was finding them and betraying them to the Psychodeviant Police . As more and more data came in on the Lasser case , Houston began to get an idea . If there were a really clever , highly intelligent , megalomaniac Controller , would n't it be part of his psychological pattern to attempt to get rid of the majority of Controllers , those who simply wanted to lead normal lives ? And , if so , was n't it possible that both his cases  --  the official and the unofficial  --  might lead to the same place : Lasser &amp; Sons ? It began to look as though Houston could kill both his birds at once , if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction to throw the stone . In the middle of the seventh week , a Controller in Manchester , England , was mobbed and torn to bits by an irate crowd before the PD Police could get to him . There was no doubt in Houston 's mind that this one was a real megalomaniac ; he had taken over another man 's brain and forced him to commit suicide . The controlled man had taken a Webley automatic , put it to his temple , and blown his brains out . The Controller 's mistake was in not realizing what the sudden shock of that bullet , transmitted to him telepathically , could do to his own mind . In the mental disorder that followed , he was spotted and killed easily . * * * * * There was still no word from Dorrine . She had flown back to the States a week after Houston had returned , but she had had to get back to England after three days . Since then , he had had three letters , nothing more . And letters are a damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one other factor that entered in was The Group , the small band of sane , reasonable telepaths who had begun to build themselves into an organization  --  a sort of Mutual Protective Association . Personally , Houston did n't think much of the idea ; the Group did n't have any real organization , and they refused to put one together . It was supposed to be democratic , but it sometimes bordered on the anarchic . He stayed with them more for companionship than any other reason . When Dorrine had come back for her short stay , Houston had met with them and tried to get them to help him trace down the megalomaniac Controller who was doing so much damage , but they 'd balked at the idea . Their job , they claimed , was to get enough members so that they could protect themselves from arrest by the Normals , and then just let things ride . " After all , " Dorrine had said , " things will work themselves out , darling ; they always do . " " Not unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had snapped back . " Someone has to do something . " " But , Dave , darling  --  we are doing something ! Do n't you see ? " He did n't , but there was no convincing either the Group or Dorrine . She was passionately interested in the recruiting work she was doing , and she thought that the Group was the answer to every Controller 's troubles . And then she had rushed back to England . " I 'll be back soon , Dave , " she 'd said . " I think I have a lead on a girl in Liverpool . " So far , the girl had n't been found . Controllers did n't like to give themselves away to anyone , so they kept a tight screen up most of the time . It seemed as though everyone on Earth was in deadly fear all the time . The Normals feared losing their identities to Controllers , and the Controllers feared death at the hands of the Normals . And death or the Penal Cluster were their only choices if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was nothing he could do . She was doing what she thought was right , just as he was ; how could he argue with that ? Houston went on with his job , putting together facts and rumors and statistical data analysis , searching out his quarry . And , at the end of the eighth week , everything blew high , wide , and hellish. * * * * * It was late evening . A cool wind blew over New York , bringing with it a hint of the rain to come . Church Street , in lower Manhattan , was not crowded , as it had been in the late afternoon , but neither was it entirely deserted . The cafes and bars did a lively business , but the tall , many-colored office buildings gaped at the street with blind and darkened eyes . Only a few of the windows glowed whitely with fluorescent illumination . In one of the small coffee shops , David Houston sat , smoking a cigarette and stirring idly at a cup of cooling coffee . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixtieth floor , a whole suite of offices was brightly lit . The rest of the building was clothed in blackness . Who was up there in that suite ? Houston was n't quite sure . He had narrowed his list of suspects down to three men : John Sager , Loris Pederson , and Norcross Lasser , three top officials in the company . Sager and Pederson were both vice-presidents of the firm ; Sager was in charge of the Foreign Exports department , while Pederson handled the actual shipping . Lasser , by virtue of being the grandson of the man who had founded the firm , was president of Lasser &amp; Sons , Inc . Lasser seemed like a poor choice as chief villain of the outfit ; he was a mild , bland man , quiet and friendly . Besides , his position made him an obvious suspect ; naturally , the majority stockholder of the firm would profit most by the increased power of the company . And , equally obviously , a Controller would n't want to put himself in such an exposed position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a good suspect . If anything happened , Lasser could cover by claiming that he , too , had been controlled , and the chances were that he could get away with it . A Controller never did anything directly ; their dirty work was done by someone else  --  a puppet under their mental control . At least , so ran the popular misconception . If Lasser were the man , he stood a good chance of getting away with it , even if he were caught , provided he played his cards right . * * * * * That reasoning still did n't eliminate Sager or Pederson . Either of them could be the Controller . And there still remained the possibility that some unknown , unsuspected fourth person had the company of Lasser &amp; Sons under his thumb . That was what Houston intended to find out tonight . He took a sip of his coffee , found it still reasonably hot . Damn the megalomaniacs , anyway ! Houston subconsciously tightened his fists . He , personally , had more to fear from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprison him , while a Controller would have a hard time doing either , directly . But Houston could understand the Normal man ; he could see how fear of a Controller could drive a man without the ability into a frenzied panic . He could understand , even forgive their actions , born and bred in ignorance and fear . No , the ones he hated were the ones who had conceived and fostered that fear  --  the psychologically unstable megalomaniac Controllers . There were only a handful of them  --  probably not more than a few hundred or a thousand . But because of them , every telepath on Earth found his life in danger , and every Normal found his life a hell of terror . Let Dorrine and her do-nothing friends run around the globe recruiting members for their precious Group ; that was all right for them . Meanwhile , David Houston would be doing something on a more basic action level . He glanced at his watch . Almost time . " How 's the deployment ? " he whispered in his throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice in his ear . " You can go in anytime . " " How about the roof ? " " That 's taken care of , sir ; we 've got ' copter that can be on the top of the Lasser Building at any time you call . They can land within thirty seconds of your signal . " " Okay , " Houston said ; " I 'm going in now . Remember  --  no matter what I say or do , no one is to leave that building if they 're conscious . And keep your eyes on me ; if I act in the least peculiar , handcuff me  --  but do n't knock me out . " And if I 'm not back on time , come in anyway . " " Right . " * * * * * Houston finished his coffee , dropped a coin on the counter , and headed for the other side of the street . The big problem was getting into the building itself . It was ringed with alarms ; Lasser &amp; Sons did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Houston had arranged a roundabout way . The building next to the Lasser Building was a good deal smaller , only forty-five stories high . A week before , Houston had rented an office on the eighteenth floor of the building ; on the door , he had already had a sign engraved : Ajax Enterprises . It was a shame the office would never be used . Houston walked straight to the next-door building and opened the front door with his key . Inside , a night watchman lounged behind a desk , smoking a blackened briar . He looked up , smiled , and nodded . " Evening , Mr. Griswold ; working late tonight ? " Houston forced a smile he did not feel . " Just doing a little paper work , " he said . He took the automatic elevator to the eighteenth floor . He did n't relish the idea of walking up to the roof , but taking the elevator would make the nightwatchman suspicious . He did n't bother going to the office ; he headed directly for the stairway and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All through it , he kept up a running comment through his throat mike . " I wish I weighed about fifty pounds less ; carrying two hundred and twenty pounds of blubber up these stairs is n't easy . " " Blubber , hooey ! " the earphone interrupted . " Any man who 's six-feet-three has a right to carry that much weight . Actually , you 're a skinny-looking sort of goop . " Both men were exaggerating ; Houston was n't fat , but his broad , powerful frame could n't be called skinny , either . When he finally reached the roof , he paused and surveyed the wall of the Lasser Building , which towered high above him , spearing an additional thirty stories in the air . Up there , the lights on the sixtieth floor gleamed in the night . The air was growing cooler , and the beginnings of a mist were forming . Houston hoped it would n't start to rain before he got inside . * * * * * The forty-sixth floor of the Lasser Building had no windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-seventh . Leading up to them was an inviting looking fire escape , but Houston knew he did n't dare take that . By law , every fire escape was rigged with a fire alarm , in addition to the regular burglar alarm . He 'd have to use another way . The Lasser Building was a steel structure , shelled over with a bright blue anodized aluminum sheath . Only the day before , Houston , wearing the gray coverall of a power-line workman , had checked the wall to find the big steel beams beneath the aluminum . He had also installed certain other equipment ; now he was going to make use of it . Concealed in the louvres of the air-conditioner intake of the lower building was a specially constructed suit and several hundred feet of power line which was connected to the main line of the building . In the darkness , Houston slipped on the suit . It was constructed somewhat like a light diving suit or a spacesuit , but without the helmet . In the toes , knees , and hands , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves and powered by the current in the long line . Houston stepped over to the blue aluminum wall , reached out a hand , and lowered one finger . Instantly , the powerful magnet anchored his hand to the wall , held by the dense magnetic field to the steel beam beneath the aluminum sheath . That one magnet alone could support his full body weight , and he had six magnets to work with . Slowly , carefully , David Houston began to crawl up the wall . Turn on a magnet in the right hand ; lift up the left hand and anchor it higher ; turn on the right hand and lift it even with the left , then anchor it again ; do the same with both legs ; then begin the process all over again , turning the magnets off and on in rotation . Up and up he went . Past the forty-sixth floor , past the forty-seventh , the forty-eighth , and the forty-ninth . Not until he reached the fiftieth floor did he attempt to open one of the windows . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken that , too , into account . The powerful magnet in his right glove slid it aside easily . Houston lifted the window and stepped inside . He had ten more floors to go . He took off the suit and rolled it up into a tight package , then dropped it out the window . It landed with a barely audible thump . Houston took a deep breath , drew his stun gun , and headed for the stairway . * * * * * On the landing of the sixtieth floor of the Lasser Building , David Houston paused for a moment . " Sounds like you 're out of breath , " said the voice in his ear . " You try climbing all that way sometime , " Houston whispered . " I 'm no superman , you know . " " Shucks , " said the voice , " you 've disillusioned me . What now ? " " I 'm going to try to get a little information , " Houston told him . " Hold on . " On the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if someone were moving around , but he could hear no voices . Carefully , he sent out a probing thought , trying to see if he could attune his mind with that of someone inside without betraying himself . He could n't detect anything . The sixtieth floor covered a lot of space ; if whoever was inside was too far away , their thoughts would be too faint to pick up unless Houston stepped up his own power , and he did n't want to do that . Cautiously , he reached out a hand and eased open the door . The hallway was brightly lit , but there was no one in sight . The unaccustomed light made Houston blink for a moment before his eyes adjusted to it ; the hallways and landings below had been pitch dark , forcing him to use a penlight to find his way up . He stepped into the hallway , closing the door behind him . Now he could hear voices . He stopped to listen . The conversation was coming from an office down the hall  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long periods of silence , then a word or two : " But not that way . " " Until tomorrow . " " Vacillates . " There were three different voices . Houston moved on down the hall , his stun gun ready . A few yards from the door , he stopped again , and , very gently , he sent out another thought-probe , searching for the minds of those within , carefully forging his way . * * * * * And , at that crucial instant , a voice spoke in his ear . " Houston ! What 's going on ? You have n't said a thing for two full minutes ! " " I 'm all right ! " Houston snapped . Only the force of long training and habit kept him from shouting the words aloud instead of keeping them to a subvocal whisper . " All right or not , " said the other , " we 're coming in in seven minutes , as ordered . Meanwhile , there 's a news bulletin for you ; the British division has picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two in one night ought to be a pretty good bag . " For a moment , Houston 's mind was a meaningless blur . Dorrine ! And then another voice broke through his shock . " Dear me , sir ! Calm yourself ! You 're positively fizzing ! " Houston jerked . Standing in the doorway of the office was Norcross Lasser , with a benign smile on his face and a deadly-looking .38 automatic in his hand . Behind him stood John Sager and Loris Pederson , their faces wary . " Please drop that stun gun , Mr. Cop . " * * * * * In those few moments , Houston had regained control of himself . He realized what had happened . The interruption of his thought-probe had startled him just a little , but that little had been enough to warn the Controller . He wondered which of the three men was the actual Controller . He began to lower his weapon , then , suddenly , with all the force and hatred he could muster , he sent a blistering , shocking thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he 'd been struck . His gun wavered , and Houston fired quickly with his stun gun . At the same time , Lasser 's automatic went off . The bullet went wild , and the stun beam did n't do much better . It struck Lasser 's hand , paralyzing it , but it did n't knock out Lasser . The mental battle that ensued only took a half second , but at the speed of thought , a lot of things can happen in a half second . Houston realized almost instantaneously that he had made a vast mistake . He had badly underestimated the enemy . There was no need to worry , now , about which one of the men was a Controller  --  all three of them were ! As soon as Sager and Pederson realized what had happened , they leaped  --  mentally  --  into the battle . Lasser , already weakened by the unexpected mental blow from Houston , lost consciousness when the others let loose their blasts because his mind was still linked with Houston 's , and he absorbed a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Houston , fully warned by now , held up a denial wall which screened his mind from the worst that Sager and Pederson could put out , but he knew he could n't hold out for long . " Come in  --  now ! " he said hoarsely into the microphone . " Stupid swine ! " Sager susurrated sibilantly . Pederson said nothing aloud , but his brain was blazing with fear and hatred . His gun hand jerked towards a holster under his arm . Lasser was still crumpling towards the floor . The entire action had taken less than a second . Houston tried to fire again with his stun gun , but it required every bit of concentration he could sum up to hold off the combined mental assaults of Sager and Pederson . But they , too , were at somewhat of a disadvantage . In order to keep all their efforts concentrated on the PD policeman , both Controllers had to refrain from putting too much attention on their bodily motions . Pederson was still fumbling for his gun , and Sager had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his consciousness began to return . The resulting fraction of a second of mental static afforded Houston a brief respite ; it disturbed Pederson just as he was getting his fingers on the butt of his weapon . Both Controllers were focusing their mental energies on Houston 's brain , and during the brief respite , Houston made one vital mental adjustment . He allowed both thought-probes to fuse in a small part of his consciousness . They went through him and lashed back at the two Controllers . Both of them had had their minds tuned to Houston 's , and in that instant they found they , were also attuned to each other . The resultant of the energy was shocking to Houston , but it was infinitely worse for Sager and Pederson , since neither of them had been expecting it . Pederson , who had already been slightly distracted , got the major brunt of the force . He managed to jerk his gun free , but his brain was already lapsing into unconsciousness. * * * * * Houston 's fingers tightened on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to lift himself from the floor . Then it swept up and coughed again , dropping Pederson . His pistol barked once , sending a singing ricochet along the hall . Sager , who had staggered to one side when he and Pederson had short-circuited each other , had time to get behind the protection of the office door . He could n't close it because Lasser 's and Pederson 's inert forms blocked the doorway , but at least it afforded protection against Houston 's stun gun . His thought came through to Houston : So the stupid Normals have a Controller working for them ! Traitor ! You 're the traitor , Houston thought coldly . You and your megalomaniac friends . It 's madmen like you who have made telepaths hated and feared by the Normals . And so they should hate and fear us , came the snarling mental answer . Within a few generations , we will have supplanted them . We will control Earth  --  not they. * * * * * The exchange had only taken a fraction of a second . Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get inside before Sager could reach a weapon . You call me a traitor , Houston thought , but you have been framing innocent Controllers , putting them into the hands of the PD Police . That 's a lie ! the reply came hotly . We would never betray another telepath to the stupid Normals ! If a telepath were so bullheaded as to get in our way , we 'd dispose of him . But it would be Controller justice ; we would n't turn him over to animals ! In one blazing moment , Houston realized that the Controller was telling the truth ! No mental communication can be expressed properly in words . In , behind , and around each statement , other , dimmer nuances of thought gleam through . Each thought tells the receiver much more than can be put down in crude verbal symbols . Thus , Houston already knew that Lasser , Sager , and Pederson were the three top men in a world-wide clique of megalomaniac Controllers . This was the top of the madmen 's organization ; these three were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . He knew that there were twelve others scattered over Earth , and he knew where and who they were . That brief exchange had brought all the information into Houston 's own mind as it leaked from the minds of the others . He knew it without thinking about how he knew it . And they were not the ones who had been turning the sane Controllers over to the Psychodeviant Police ! Then who was ? And why ? Houston was right back where he had started . But that brief instant of confusion was Houston 's downfall . Sager instantly realized that he had delivered , inadvertently , a telling blow to Houston 's mind . Physically , Houston had been propelling himself toward the open door . At the instant of the revelation , he had been part way through it . And at that moment , Sager acted . He slammed all his weight violently against his side of the door , knocking Houston off balance as the door swung and struck him . He went down , and Sager was on top of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle ever fought , but its true worth could only have been detected by another telepath . It was intense and brutal . The men fought both physically and mentally . They struggled for possession of the stun gun , at the same time hurling emotion-charged shafts of mental energy at each other 's brains . The struggle lasted less than a minute . Somehow , Sager managed to get one hand on the gun , twisting it . Houston , trying to keep it out of Sager 's hand , jerked it up between them . It coughed once , sending a beam of supersonic energy into the bodies of both men . The effect was the same as if they had both been crowned with baseball bats . * * * * * Little pinpoints of light against a sea of darkness . I 'm cold , Houston thought . And I 'm sick . He could n't tell whether his eyes were open or closed  --  and he did n't much care . He tried to move his arms and legs , found he could n't , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be open , he thought , if I can blink . Well , then , if his eyes were open , why could n't he see anything ? All he could see were the little pinpoints of light against a background of utter blackness . Like stars , he thought . Stars ? STARS ! With a sudden rush , total awareness came back to him , and he realized with awful clarity where he was . He was chained , spread-eagled , on an asteroid in the Penal Cluster , nearly a hundred million miles from Earth . It was easy to piece together what had happened . He dimly remembered that he had started to wake up once before . It was a vague , confused recollection , but he knew what had taken place . The PD Police , coming in response to his call , had found all four men unconscious from the effects of the stun beam . Naturally , all of them had been taken into custody ; the PD Police had to find out which one of the men was the Controller and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they began to wake up ; the resulting mental disturbances would easily identify the telepath . Houston could imagine the consternation that must have resulted when the PD men found that all three suspects  --  and their brother officer  --  were Controllers . And now here he was  --  tried , convicted , and sentenced while he was unconscious  --  doomed to spend the rest of his life chained to a rock floating in space . A sudden chill of terror came over him . Why was n't he asleep ? Why was n't he under hibernene ? It 's their way of being funny , came a bitter thought . We 're supposed to be under hibernene , but we 're left to die , instead . For a moment , Houston did not realize that the thought was not his own , so well did it reflect his own bitterness . It was bad enough to have to live out one 's life under the influence of the hibernation drug , but it was infinitely worse to be conscious . Under hibernene , he would have known nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have realized what had happened to him . But this way , he would remain fully awake while his body used up the air too fast and his stomach became twisted with hunger pangs which no amount of intravenous feeding could quell . Oh , he 'd live , all right  --  for a few months  --  but it would be absolute hell while he lasted . Insanity and catatonia would come long before death . * * * * * That 's a nasty thought ; I wish you had n't brought it up . That was n't his own thought ! There was someone else out here ! Hell , yes , my friend ; we 're all out here . " Where are you ? " Houston asked aloud , just to hear his own voice . He knew the other could n't hear the words which echoed so hollowly inside the bubble of the spacesuit helmet , but the thought behind them would carry . " You mean with relation to yourself ? " came the answer . " I do n't know . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one you 're on . " Houston could tell now that the other person was talking aloud , too . So great was the illusion carried to his own brain that it almost seemed as though he could hear the voice with his ears . " Then there are others around us ? " Houston asked . " Sure . There were three of us : a Hawaiian named Jerry Matsukuo ; a girl from Bombay , Sonali Siddhartha ; and myself , Juan Pedro de Cadiz . Jerry and Sonali are taking a little nap . You 're the first of your group to wake up . " " My group ? " " Certainly , my friend . There are five of you ; the other four must still be unconscious . " Four ? That would be Lasser , Sager , Pederson , and  --  and Dorrine ! Juan Pedro de Cadiz picked up the whole thought-process easily . " The girl  --  I 'm sorry , " he said . " But the other three  --  of us all , I think , they deserve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have our newcomers awakened ? " " Just one of them , my sweet , " replied the Spaniard . " Sonali , may I present Mr. David Houston . Mr. Houston , the lovely Sonali Siddhartha . " " Juano has a habit of jumping to conclusions , David , " said the girl . " He 's never even seen me , and I 'm sure that after three weeks of being locked in this prison whatever beauty I may have had has disappeared . " " Your thoughts are beautiful , Sonali , " said Juan Pedro , " and with us , that is all that counts . " " It is written , " said a third voice , " that he who disturbs the slumber of his betters will wake somebody up . You people are giving me dreams , with your ceaseless mental chatter . " " Ah ! " the Spaniard said . " Mr. Matsukuo , may I  --  " " I heard , Romeo , I heard , " said the Hawaiian . " An ex-cop , eh ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few thousand years to think it over ; in the meantime , you may treat me as a friend . " " I 'll try to live down my reputation , " said Houston . * * * * * It was an odd feeling . Physically , he was alone . Around him , he could see nothing but the blackness of space and the glitter of the stars . He knew that the sun must be shining on the back of his own personal asteroid , but he could n't see it . As far as his body was concerned , there was nothing else in the universe but a chunk of pitted rock and a set of chains . But mentally , he felt snug and warm , safe in the security of good friends . He felt  --  " David ! David ! Help me ! Oh , David , David , David ! " It was Dorrine , coming up from her slumber . Like a crashing blare of static across the neural band , her wakening mind burst into sudden telepathic activity . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soothing her mind as he had soothed Harris 's mind weeks before . And he noticed , as he did it , that the other three were with him , helping . By the time Dorrine was fully awake , she was no longer frightened or panicky . " You 're wonderful people , " she thought simply , after several minutes . " To one so beautiful , how else could we be ? " asked Juan Pedro . " Ignore him , Dorrine , " said Sonali , " he tells me the same thing . " " But not in the same way , amiga ! " the Spaniard protested . " Not in the same way . The beauty of your mind , Sonali , is like the beauty of a mountain lake , cool and serene ; the beauty of Dorrine is like the beauty of the sun  --  warm , fiery , and brilliant . " " By my beard ! " snorted Matsukuo . " Such blather ! " " I 'll be willing to wager my beautiful hacienda in the lovely countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have no beard , " said Juan Pedro . " Hah ! " said Matsukuo ; " that 's all I need now  --  Castles in Spain . " It was suddenly dizzying for Houston . Here were five people , doomed to slow , painful death , talking as though there were nothing to worry about . Within minutes , each had learned to know the others almost perfectly . It was more than just the words each used . Talking aloud helped focus the thoughts more , but at the same time , thousands of little , personal , fringe ideas were present with the main idea transmitted in words . Houston had talked telepathically to Dorrine hundreds of times , but never before had so much fine detail come through . Why ? Was there something different about space that made mental communication so much more complete ? " No , not that , I think , " said Matsukuo . " I believe it is because we have lost our fear  --  not of death ; we still fear death  --  but of betrayal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die , and soon . They had already been sentenced ; nothing further could frighten them . Always before , on Earth , they had kept their thoughts to themselves , fearing to broadcast too much , lest the Normals find them out . The little , personal things that made a human being a living personality were kept hidden behind heavy mental walls . The suppression worked subconsciously , even when they actually wanted to communicate with another Controller . But out here , there was nothing to fear on that score . Why should they , who were already facing death , be afraid of anything now ? So they opened up  --  wide . And they knew each other as no group of human beings had ever known each other . Every human being has little faults and foibles that he may be ashamed of , that he wants to keep hidden from others . But such things no longer mattered out here , where they had nothing but imminent death and the emptiness of space  --  and each other . Physically , they were miserable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to move around , for three weeks , as Sonali had been , was torture . Sonali had been there longer than the others  --  for three days , there had been no one but herself out there in the loneliness of space . But now , even physical discomfort meant little ; it was easy to forget the body when the mind was free . " What of the others ? " Dorrine asked . " Where are the ones who were sentenced before us ? " * * * * * Houston thought of Robert Harris . What had happened to the young Englishman ? " Space is big , " said Juan Pedro . " Perhaps they are too far away for our thoughts to reach them  --  or perhaps they are already dead . " " Let 's not talk of death . " Sonali Siddhartha 's thought was soft . " We have so many things to do . " " We will have a language session , " said Juan Pedro . " Si ? " Matsukuo chuckled . " Good ! Houston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic , Japanese , and French all at once , you do n't know what a language session is . We  --  " The Hawaiian 's thought was suddenly broken off by a shrieking burst of mental static . The effect was similar to someone dropping a handful of broken glass into an electric meat grinder right in the middle of a Bach cantata . It was Sager , coming out of his coma . Almost automatically , the five contacted his mind to relax him as he awoke . They touched his mind  --  and were repelled ! Stay out of my mind ! With almost savage fury , the still half-conscious Sager hurled thoughts of hatred and fear at the five minds who had tried to help him . They recoiled from the burst of insane emotion . " Leave him alone , " Houston thought sharply . " He 's a tough fighter . " * * * * * At first , Sager was terrified when he learned what had happened to him . Then the terror was mixed with a boiling , seething hatred . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an even more terrible hatred for Houston , the " traitor . " The very emptiness of space itself seemed to vibrate with the surging violence of his hatred . " I know , " Houston told him , " you 'd kill me if you could . But you ca n't , so forget it . " Not even the power of that hatred could touch Houston , protected as he was by the combined strength of the other four sane telepaths . He was comparatively safe . Sager snarled like a trapped animal . " You 're all insane ! Look at you ! The four of you , siding with a man who has betrayed us to the Normals ! He  --  " What Sager thought of Houston could n't be put into words , and if it could no sane person would want to repeat the mad foulness in those words . " This is unbearable ! " Sonali thought softly . " That 's not a mind , " said Dorrine , " it 's a sewer . " " I suggest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's find out what makes this thing tick . " " Stay out of my mind ! " Sager screamed . " You have no right ! " " You seemed to think you had the right to probe into the helpless minds of Normals , " said Juan Pedro coldly . " We should show you how it feels . " " But they 're just animals ! " Sager retorted . " I am a Controller ! " " You 're a madman , " said Matsukuo . " And we must find out what makes you mad . " Synchronizing perfectly , five minds began to probe at the walls that Sager had built up around his personality . And as they probed , Sager retreated behind ever thicker walls , howling in hatred and anguish . On and on went the five , needling , pressing at every weak spot , trying to break him down . Outnumbered and overpowered , it seemed as though Sager had no chance . But his insanity was stronger than they suspected . The barriers he built were harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever seen . The five pushed on , anyway , but their advance slowed tremendously . Then , mentally , there was a sudden silence . Sager ? they thought . No answer . " That 's finished it , " said Houston . " He 's retreated so far behind those mental barriers that he 's cut himself off completely . " " He 's not dead , is he ? " Dorrine asked . " Dead ? " said Juan Pedro . " Not in the sense you mean . But I think he is catatonic now ; he has lost all touch with the outside . He is as though he were still drugged ; he is physically helpless , and mentally blanked out . " " There 's one difference , " Matsukuo said analytically . " And that is that , although he has cut himself off from us and from the rest of the universe , he is still conscious in some little , walled-in compartment of his mind . He has no one there but himself  --  and that , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * They waited then . When Pederson awoke , they were ready for him . His hatred took a slightly different form from Sager 's , but the effect was the same . And so were the results when the five bore down on him . Again they waited . Lasser was next . At first , it looked as though Lasser would go the way of Sager and Pederson , ending up as a hopelessly insane catatonic . Like his cohorts before him , Lasser retreated under the full pressure of the thought-probes of the five , building stronger and stronger walls . But , quite suddenly , all his defenses crumbled . The mental barriers went down , shattered and dissolving . Lasser 's whole mind lay bare . Instead of fighting and hating , Lasser was begging , pleading for help . Lasser was not basically insane . His mind was twisted and warped , but beneath the outer shell was a personality that had enough internal strength to be able to admit that it was wrong and ask for help instead of retreating into oblivion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Matsukuo 's thought whispered . * * * * * Eight bodies , uncomfortable and pain-wracked , floated in space , chained to tiny asteroids that drifted slowly in their orbits under the constant pull of the sun . Two of them contained minds that were locked irrevocably within prisons of their own building , sealed off forever from external stimuli , but their suffering was the greater for all that . The other six , chained though their limbs might be , had minds that were free  --  free , even , of any but the most necessary of internal limitations . Eight bodies , chained to eight lumps of pitted rock , spun endlessly in endless space . And then the ship came . The flare of its atomic rocket could be seen for over an hour before it reached the Penal Cluster . The six eyed it speculatively . Although only two of them were facing the proper direction to see it with their physical eyes , the impressions of those two were easily transmitted to the other four . " Another load of captives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , I wonder ? " " How long have we been here ? " asked Houston , not expecting any answer . " Who knows ? " It was Lasser . " What we need out here is a clock to tell us when we 'll die . " " Our oxygen tanks are our clocks , " said Sonali . " And they 'll notify us when the time comes . " " I do believe you morbid-minded people are developing a sense of humor , " said Matsukuo , " but I 'm not sure I care for the style too much . " The flare of the rocket grew brighter as the decelerating ship approached the small cluster of rocks . At last the ship itself took form , shining in the eternal blaze of the sun . When the whiteness of the rocket blaze died suddenly , the ship was only a few dozen yards from Houston 's own asteroid . And then a mental voice came into the minds of the six prisoners . " How do you feel , Controllers ? " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly to the others . " Reinhardt ! " Hermann Reinhardt , Division Chief of the Psychodeviant Police , the one man most hated and feared by Controllers , was himself a telepath ! " Naturally , " said Reinhardt . " Someone had to take control of the situation . I was the only one who was in a position to do it . " His thoughts were neither hard nor cold ; it was almost as if he were one of them  --  except for one thing . Only the words of his thoughts came through ; there were none of the fringe thoughts that the six were used to in each other . " That 's true , " thought Reinhardt . " You see , we have been at this a good deal longer than you . " Then he directed his thoughts at members of the crew of the spaceship , but they could still be heard by the six prisoners . " All right , men , get those people off those rocks . We have to make room for another batch . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen spacesuited men leaped out . The propulsion units in their hands guided them toward the prison asteroids . " Give them all anaesthetic except Sager and Pederson , " Reinhardt ordered . " They wo n't need it . " Then , with a note of apology , " I 'm sorry we 'll have to anaesthetize you , but you 've been in one position so long that moving you will be rather painful . We have to get you to a hospital quickly . " The minds of the six prisoners were frantically pounding questions at the PD chief , but he gave them no answer . " No ; wait until you 're better . " The spacesuited rescuers went to the " back " of each asteroid and injected sleep-gas into the oxygen line that ran from the tank to the spacesuit of the prisoner . Houston could smell the sweetish , pungent odor in his helmet . Just before he blacked out , he hurled one last accusing thought at Reinhardt . " You 're the one who 's been framing Controllers ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How else could I get you out here ? " * * * * * Houston woke up in a hospital bed . He was weak and hungry , but he felt no pain . As he came up from unconsciousness , he felt a fully awake mind guiding him out of the darkness . It was Reinhardt . " You 're a tough man , Houston , " he said mentally . " The others wo n't wake up for a while yet . " He was sitting on a chair next to the bed , holding a smouldering cigarette in one hand . He looked strange , somehow , and it took Houston a moment to realize that there was a smile on that broad , normally expressionless face . Houston focussed his eyes on the man 's face . " I want an explanation , Reinhardt , " he said aloud . " And it better be a damned good one . " " I give you free access to my mind , " Reinhardt said . " See for yourself if my method was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probed . The explanation , if not the best , was better than any Houston could have thought of . When the hatred of the normal-minded people of Earth had been turned against the Controllers because of the actions of a few megalomaniacs , it had become obvious that legal steps had to be taken to prevent mob violence . It had been Reinhardt himself who had suggested the Penal method to the UN government . At first , he had simply thought of it as a method to keep the Controllers alive until he could think of something better . But when he had discovered , by accident , what a small group of Controllers , alone in space , could do , he had set up the present machinery . As soon as a Controller was spotted , a careful frame-up was arranged . Then , when several had been found , they were arrested in quick succession and sent to the asteroids . Always and invariably , they had done what Houston 's group had done  --  the sane or potentially sane ones had improved themselves tremendously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't it be done on Earth ? " Houston asked . " We tried it , " Reinhardt said . " It did n't work . Safe , on Earth , surrounded by Normals , a Controller still feels the hatred around him . He ca n't open his mind completely . Only the certain knowledge of impending death , and a complete freedom from the hatred of Normals can free the mind . " And that 's why you could n't be told beforehand ; if you knew you were going to be rescued , you would n't open up . " Houston nodded . It made sense . " Where are we now ? " he asked . " Antarctica , " said Reinhardt . " We 've built an outpost here  --  almost self-sufficient . When you 're in better shape physically , I 'll show you around . " " Do you mean that everyone who 's been arrested is here , in Antarctica ? " * * * * * Reinhardt laughed . " No , not by a long shot . Most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undiscovered Controllers , so that we can frame them . And , of course , some of us  --  the insane ones  --  have died . They will themselves to die when the going gets too tough . " " Searching for recruits ? Then the Group that Dorrine was working for was  --  " Reinhardt shook his head . " No . They were going about it the wrong way , just as you thought . We picked up the whole lot of them last week ; they 're occupying the asteroids now . " " What do you do with the insane catatonics ? " " Put them under hibernene and keep them alive . We hope , someday , to figure out a method of restoring their sanity . Until then , let them sleep . " Houston narrowed his eyes . " How long have you known I was a Controller , Reinhardt ? " The Prussian smiled . " Ever since you first tried to probe me . Fortunately , my training enabled me to put up a shield that you could n't penetrate ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on because I knew you 'd be useful in cracking Lasser and his gang when the time came . No one else could have done what you did that night . " " Thanks , " Houston said sincerely . " What 's going to happen now ? After I get well , I mean . " " You 'll do what the others have done . A little plastic surgery to change your face a trifle , a little record-juggling to give you a new identity , and you 'll be ready to go back to work for the PD Police . " If anyone recognizes you , it 's easy to take over their minds just long enough to make them forget . We allow that much Controlling . " " And then what ? " Houston wanted to know . " What happens in the long run ? " " In a way , " said Reinhardt , " your friend Sager was right . The Controllers will eventually become the rulers of Earth . But not by force or trickery . We must just bide our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time ; the Normals are becoming fewer and fewer . Within a century , we will outnumber them  --  we will be the Normals , not they . " But they 'll never know what 's going on . The last Normal will die without ever knowing that he is in a world of telepaths . " By the time that comes about , we 'll no longer need the Penal Cluster , since Controllers will be born into a world where there is no fear of non-telepaths . " " I wonder , " Houston mused , " I wonder how this ability came about . Why is the human race acquiring telepathy so suddenly ? " Reinhardt shrugged .
