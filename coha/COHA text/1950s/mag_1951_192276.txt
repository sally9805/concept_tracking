Alberto Giacometti looks like a tormented Chico Marx ; he also sculps and paints with the bug-eyed fury of a Harpo , and creates things undreamed of even in Groucho 's philosophy . His subject matter is the human frame ; his approach to it destructive . Giacometti hacks , picks and pocks his plaster sculptures until they stand thin as reeds , then he generally smashes them . He saved just enough to make an exhibition in a Paris gallery last week . <P> Born in Switzerland 49 years ago , Giacometti found his way to Paris early , dabbled for years in surrealism . To earn a living , he made chandeliers , vases , gimcracks , bird cages and doorknobs . " At first you think commercial work is easy , " he says , " but then you see even that is difficult . " Fine art he finds an almost impossible process : " I 'm not sure of my vision unless I see it on canvas or in sculpture , but as I put it down I modify my vision .

Stretched to the breaking point , they dominate more space than they fill , and this is their sole dignity . But Giacometti 's own dignity and sincerity go unquestioned in Paris . His artist-friends generally revere him , spend long nights debating his methods as well as his elusive aim . <P> Giacometti 's ideal would be to spend a lifetime on a single statue , paring ever closer to its essence , but impatience often makes him reduce bust to dust in a matter of minutes . " Despite all my efforts , " he complains , " ! retain conventional elements I want to get rid of . " <P> In an introduction to the exhibition catalogue , a friend put Giacometti 's problem succinctly : " To make , to perfect , to unmake , then to remake , to reperfect , to re-unmake . . .
