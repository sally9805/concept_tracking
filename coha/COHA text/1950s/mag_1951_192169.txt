For a moment last week , a reader of the Washington Times-Herald might have thought that the newspaper 's printers had gone on a spree . The Times-Herald blossomed with strange new spellings of familiar words , e.g. , sherif , midrif , sofistry , thorofare . But a Page One box explained everything .
