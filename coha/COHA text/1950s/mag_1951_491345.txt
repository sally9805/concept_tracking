America 's Choosiest Club By MILTON LEHMAN The Cosmos Club in Washington is so exclusive that members wo n't even speak to members without an introduction . It has blackballed U. S. Presidents and boasts more brains than most colleges . But the manager of this male stronghold is a woman ! NOWHERE else in Washington , this city of wire tappers , congressional investigations and probing reporters , is there so much respect for a man 's privacy as in the Cosmos Club . A fraternity of Washington 's most fantastic talent , Cosmos is a snug harbor for college presidents , ichthyologists , bishops , surgeons , zoo directors and the brains behind the Government 's bureaus . Within its ancient , high-ceilinged rooms , " Do Not Disturb " is more than a warning ; it 's one of the Ten Commandments . Compared to Cosmos , the Library of Congress is a boiler factory . As a recently elected member observed , " I did n't know whether I 'd crossed the Potomac to get here , or the River Styx . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by such reporter members as Marquis Childs , Elmer Davis , Walter Lippmann , Baukhage and Sinclair Lewis , who has never put Cosmos into one of his books . Some people say that even Drew Pearson , a Cosmos man , holds sacred the secrets of his club fellows , when whispered , over the club 's luncheon table . Yet the dreamy atmosphere of Cosmos serves as an incubator for many hot secrets . Out of Cosmos sprang the President 's Water Resources Commission , the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the National Geographic Society . During World War II , such members as Vannevar Bush , Arthur S. Higgs , Cmdr. USN ( mt. ) , lives at the CA/S11105 , works on a Life of Sir Francis Drake , Arthur Compton , James B. Conant and David Lilienthal lunched here to discuss the manufacture of atomic bombs . Today you will find Dr. Solon J. li Buck , former archivist of the United States , talking i over rare documents with Dr. Herbert Putnam , former Librarian of Congress . The most exclusive of clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equanimity , while welcoming the impoverished scientist deep i in the study of the itch mite . Only three Presidents  --  Taft , Wilson and Hoover  --  were deemed worthy of membership , and they were accepted before they entered the White House . To join Cosmos , one must be sponsored by a member who records Your accomplishments , a record often as detailed as i an FBI report . A while ago , a high government official proposed a candidate without the necessary proofs . The membership committee turned him down . The official wrote a wrathful letter , suggesting that he might resign . His resignation was accepted . Recently a congressman was proposed . Instead of outlining the congressman 's intellectual attainments , his sponsor made the hideous error of telling the membership committee that any congressman was worthy of Cosmos . His candidate was thoroughly blackballed . Among the current acceptable members of Congress are Sen. A. S. Mike Monroney , of Oklahoma , and Sen. Paul H. Douglas , of Illinois . As their sponsors emphasized , both are members of Phi Beta Kappa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hushed precincts , and a backslapper would be paralyzed in the place . " We are n't like most clubs , " one member advised . " When we see a long-lost member , we do n't rush up , pound him on the back and shout , ' Why , hello , you old so-and-so ! ' We just say , ' Hello . ' " Another member  --  a retired obstetrician  --  puts it this way : " Inside the club , you do n't speak to a member unless you 've been properly introduced . But I 'd know a Cosmos man anyplace in the world . If we found ourselves on the x Kamchatka Peninsula ? why , then I 'd go up to him land say , ' You 're in Cosmos , are n't you ? ' " At its front entrance , Cosmos posts a doorkeeper generally considered more critical than Saint Peter . His job is to recognize members and challenge strangers . Some months ago , however , an old gentleman deceived the doorkeeper and successfully invaded the club . A stoop-shouldered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library and immersed himself in the club 's scholarly journals . After a half dozen such visits , he was finally spottedby the club manager . A guard was posted at each door to the library . The old gentleman looked up , walked slowly toward one of the guards , then swung around , overwhelmed the attendant at the opposite door and dashed downstairs and out of the club . The doorkeeper later explained why he had failed to challenge the stranger . " He never said a word to anybody , " the doorkeeper remarked , " so 1 could n't tell him from a real member . " Scratch a Member and Find an Author M OST of Cosmos ' members are actively employed in Washington and come to the dub for lunch , where good talk and good food are served at modest prices . The club also keeps rooms for bachelors and widowers , who carry on their scientific research while the club staff cleans their rooms , changes their bed linens , mails their letters and sends out their laundry and dry cleaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white goatee , lives in a cluttered room at the club among his filing cabinets , roll-top desk and books , manuscripts and photostats . Commander Riggs is preparing a Life of Sir Francis Drake . Down the hall is Navy Captain Miles P. DuVal , Jr. , retired , who is completing a trilogy of research on the Panama Canal . " Commander Riggs , " says Captain DuVal , " is doing the most important biography of Drake ever written . " " No one , " declares Commander Riggs , " has done more authoritative work on the Panama Canal than Captain DuVal . " Occasionally a stranger is invited to spend a few nights at the club among the scholarly lodgers . Not long ago a manufacturer stayed here during a visit to Washington to look into defense orders . At breakfast in the club dining room , he felt uncomfortable with the learned men , unable to draw them into conversation . He attempted to interest a pharmacologist , who ordered corn flakes ala mode and Coca-Cola , pouring the beverage over his ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who kept plotting the maneuvers of the pigeons down on Lafayette Square . He had no success . But after several dreary mornings , the manufacturer finally hit on a useful gambit . " Well , doctor , " he would say , " and how is the new book coming along ? " Cosmos members have produced so many books that the board of management canceled a ruling rePHOTOGRAPHY BY OLLIE ATKI NS quiring new members to provide copies of their wosks for the club library . " We must keel ) room for books by outside writers , " the board decided . The 1Parary was already bulging with such works of its members as the Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America , by Dr. Frank M. Chapman , the ornithologist ; The Butterfly Book and The Moth Book , by Dr. William J. Holland , the entomologist ; and Mosquitoes ? How They Live , by Dr. Leland 0 . Howard . Editorial scouts for the Encyclopedia Britannica , the New International Encyclopedia and the Century Dictionary regularly visit Cosmos to round up contributors and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , the main lounge is somewhat gayer ? " like the anteroom where the pallbearers wait , " one member describes it . The lounge is a long , high-ceilinged chamber with leather chairs and sofas against the walls and solemn portraits of Cosmos founders above them . Except at noon , when the younger members bustle in for lunch , the lounge is taken over by the old-timers dozing in their deep leather chairs . The old men give an air of permanence and repose to the club . " They 're just coasting , " says a middle-aged attorney , " and it 's fine to watch them . Only women think a club means clubbiness and lots of chatter . Here in Cosmos you do n't have to say a word to anyone . " One of the old gentlemen , a retired ichthyologist , was noted for his reticence . He sat in an ancient chair in a dark corner of the room for many years . But recently an unaccountable change came over him . At noontime he now moves from his lonely corner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves of members as they pass . " When I 'm in the line of traffic , " he says ? " you may speak to me . " Through the years Cosmos has fought a gallant battle to maintain itself as a quiet gentlemen 's club , a calm oasis in the midst of Washington 's frenzy . While its members have helped to lead the nation to the wonders of the telephone , television , nuclear fission and antibiotics , the club itself has valiantly resisted change . It has taken pressures no less than women , war and expanding Government to budge it even slightly from its course . The challenge of the women was ably contained . Across Lafayette Square from the club , Cosmos members had watched the first suffragettes chaining themselves to the White House gates and demanding the vote . They could recognize a force when they W it . By a simple AMERICA 'S CHOOSIEST CLUB ( Continued from Page 35 ) outflanking movement , Cosmos added a ladies ' quarters around the corner , 1 but has never permitted the women to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Wars naturally affected Cosmos . It brought hundreds of scientists to Washington for civilian and military jobs , making Washington the scientific capital of the nation . Cosmos opened its doors to many minor scientists , snaking them feel at home ? until the end of the emergency , when it promptly rescinded their privileges . But even war failed to distract some of the older members . In 1917 , when the United States declared war on Germany , Cosmos members gathered in the lounge and excitedly discussed the news . In the midst of the din , two elderly scholars seated on one of the sofas were shouting to make themselves heard . During a sudden break in the tumult one of the old gentlemen was heard roaring at his companion , " Well , doctor , you 've convinced me that the tapeworm ca n't survive in the intestines of the fur-bearing seal ! " For the men in the leather chairs , the most drastic change is now under way . Late this year , Cosmos plans to leave historic Lafayette Square for new , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts Avenue . Nobody in Cosmos likes the change , and the club has undoubtedly resisted it to the last . The first hint that Cosmos had to move came in 1918 , when the burgeoning Government proposed taking over Lafayette Square for Federal offices . " It was a cloud no bigger than a man 's hand , " says Col. Thomas M. Spaulding , the club 's historian . But the cloud grew and gathered substance . In March , 1930 , Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to acquire the club 's property . Nine more years passed while the members held on , trying to brush aside the shape of things to come . In September , 1939 , the Treasury Department made a definite offer of $1,000,000 for the Casinos property , an amount slightly less than its as-gemmed value for taxes . The members met in a ferment and voted to accept the Government 's offer , reasoning that they had no choice . They bought some property three blocks away and drew up blueprints for a new clubhouse . The war postponed both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over . In January last year the evil day arrived . Summoned by the board of management , the members met to consider the Townsend house , a French Renaissance uptown mansion owned by the late Mrs. Sumner Welles . Mr. Weller agreed to sell it to Cosmos for $364,635 . The meeting was the most tortured in Cosmos history . There were eloquent pleas for staying in Lafayette Square . One gentleman , a former senator , borrowed from the Book of Ruth to support his argument . " Whither thou guest , I will go . . . and thy God will he ! my God , " he said , " but , my God , do n't leave Lafayette Square ! " Charles T. Tittmann , of the Bureau of Internal Revenue , a tall , husky attorney who sings bass at the All Souls ' Church , brought his fellow members back to hard fact . In his booming voice he spoke out for moving to Massachusetts Avenue . The club had sillily shallied for thirty-two years , he noted . He declared it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $364,635 , the Townsend house was a bargain , he said , and urged the members to follow him past the teller for a standing count . The resistance collapsed in a vote of 377 to 56 , with twenty-three members abstaining . Cosmos was founded on November 16 , 1878 , by a group of astronomers who felt that Washington was a lonely place for men of genius . Writers , artists and later even attorneys were invited to join . Lafayette Square was already a quarter for Washington 's notables when Cosmos moved in . In the center was the President 's Park , a playground for pigeons and squirrels . With the White House facing it on the south , the park was bordered by handsome town houses and history-making Americans . Stephen Decatur was first to build there . Others who lived on the square included Daniel Webster , Dolly Madison , William H. Seward , Roger B. Taney , John Hay , Henry Adams and Henry Clay . Cosmos established itself on the northeast corner in the former Tayloe residence and later annexed the Dolly Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for Cosmos , the square has now yielded to modern office buildings . " We shall leave these with small regret , " the Cosmos historian writes . " It is the square itself , not the physical , but the intangible , spiritual square , that we have loved and lost . " The founders and first members of Cosmos , whose . solemn portraits and busts now embellish the lounge , included such distinguished scientists as Samuel Pierpont Langley , Alexander Graham Bell , Robert E. Peary and John Brashear . There were Adolphus W. Greely , who got closer to the North Pole than any other man before Peary , and Charles E. Munroe , whose research helped lead to the development of guncotton , smokeless powder and nitrocellulose explosives . To the club lounge and billiard room these members returned with wondrous accounts of their adventures . Henry Stephens Washington would tell of his archaeological travels through Brazil , Italy and Greece , and astonish the members by reading in the course of one evening an ancient Greek text , a modern Greek newspaper , German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go off to bed with a medieval Spanish tome . Otto Hilgard Tittmann , a pioneer in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey , would tell bow he surveyed Pikes Peak and of his voyage from France to New York , bringing back a platinum-iridium bar as the nation 's standard measurement for the meter . John Wesley Powell , who lost his right arm at the battle of Shiloh and devised a billiard mace to keep up his game , would talk of his pioneer exploration of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado . Through the years , Cosmos members went farther and saw more than any other men of their time . In the formative days of the capital city , they brought science out of the laboratory into public view . At their clubhouse they relaxed , played billiards and talked . Harvey Washington Wiley , sponsor and agitator for the Pure Food and Drug Act , took special pride in his post as chairman of the Cosmos foodand-drink committee . " I was so well satisfied with this club , " he once remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I was sixty-seven years old . " A bright spirit , Wiley was frequently made toastmaster at Cosmos functions . Preparing an anniversary dinner many years ago , he advised several members that they might be called on for a few impromptu remarks . Most of the remarks that night were brief and witty . But one member , the director of the United States Weather Bureau , was even too solemn for Cosmos . When Wiley introduced him , the weatherbeen formally educating itself with an astonishing array of subjects . Last season , for example , the entertainment committee presented Dr. Francis W. Reichelderfer , present chief of the United States Weather Bureau , on Recent Research in Cloud Physics with Specific Reference to the Artificial Production of Rain . Mr. Henderson Gregory dazzled his colleagues with an illustrated lecture on A Pleasure Trip Through Canada From Ste. Marguerite , Quebec , to Jasper Park . Robert C. Cook , editor of The Journal of Heredity , took his fellow members into the controversy over the Russian Politburo 's approved theory of genetics . Cook declared that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by " that untutored , so-called scientist who is either a charlatan or a fool , Trofim Lysenko . " Some years ago , Dr. William J. Humphreys , a physicist , was chairman of the entertainment committee . Humphreys conceived of a dinner at which only American Indian dishes would be served . The members ate venison , corn and squash , and the dinner went over fine . But afterward there was some heated objection to Doctor Humphreys serving Pocahontas fizzes , a potent cocktail with a bourbon base . The members observed caustically that the Indians were dry , that they never saw whisky until the white man arrived . Doctor Humphreys , however , had prepared himself . He quickly cited one Doctor Lumholtz , of the Field Museum of Natural History , in Chicago , who had written a text proving that the Huichols , a primitive tribe of Indians in the mountains of Sonora , Mexico , distilled corn liquor by the three-pot method . More recently , the Cosmos critics turned their guns on a brightly colored mural in the Tap Room almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather drab room , the mural portrayed a lightly clad lady amid various jungle vines and shrubs , with a monkey peering at her through the lush foliage . Some of the members criticized the painting because the lady 's anatomy was incorrect , others ' because of the coke 's , and a few because the species of monkey shown would never have been found among the types of plants depicted . The mural was painted out . Behind this club of unique and sometimes explosive gentlemen , concealed even from the members , is a modest , mild-mannered woman . In 1941 , when the club 's former manager retired , Mrs. Margaret S. Kinney took over Cosmos with the grace of a Dolly Madison . For several years she had been the quiet assistant manager and knew of the members ' traditional firmness against women . But the board of management , as well as Mrs. Kinney , realized how difficult it would be to find a new suitable male manager in those days of the manpower shortage . " One morning , " she recalls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might be the new manager . They were very discreet , of course . The club was due for its annual election in a few weeks and , naturally , the old house committee felt that it should n't take so drastic a step during its last days in office . But after the election the new committee agreed that I would do . " During the war Mrs. Kinney carefully budgeted the club 's funds , handled the ration books and saw that the members and their hundreds of wartime guests were well fed . For almost ? two years , Mrs. Kinney admits , she stayed modestly out of sight of the members . " I had my basement office and I was careful not to go through the main quarters except early in the morning and late at night , " she says . " I did n't want to alarm the members , and it was quite a while before most of them knew a woman was in charge . I remember the first time I went through the lounge at noontime . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Kinney thinks Cosmos members are the nicest people she 's ever known . She has found them much less tense than businessmen and more ready to relax . " They have simple tastes , but they do like good cooking , " she says . " When I took over , the president reminded me that the members liked food , but not in enormous quantities nor yet in tearoom servings . ' They 're not stevedores , Mrs. Kinney , ' he told me . Well , it called for judgment and balance , but the members were Ary understanding . They have always treated me tenderly . " Mrs. Kinney , just like a real member of Cosmos , must be careful to be precise . Today she goes over her menus like a proofreader , to he sure they are free of errors . A while back , when the menu listed broiled trout for lunch , an ichthyologist sent in a sharp note of protest . " This is no trout , " he declared . " Its eyes are in the wrong place ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cocoanut " on the menu . Not long ago , one member came down to Mrs. Kinney 's basement office with a piece of cleansing tissue tightly balled up . He unwrapped it solemnly , displaying five small hairs . " I found them on the French pastry , " he announced . " What are they ? " Mrs. Kinney studied them closely . " Why , those are just bristles from the pastry brush , " she said . " Absolutely right , " said the member . " I had them analyzed at the Bureau of Standards . " As Mrs. Kinney knows , there will be many a trial when Cosmos leaves Lafayette Square for the new clubhouse . Cosmos , for all the brave new worlds created by its members , has stoutly believed in tradition . When the old water cooler with its chunk of ice was replaced a few years ago by a modern push button drinking fountain , there were loud protests . As one of the old-timers observed , " This new gadget does n't give you a satisfactory drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not squirted in the eye . " The men who sit in the leather chairs are usually aware of any furniture displacement in the lounge . The cleaning maids are now so mindful of this that , after dusting , they seldom replace a chair more than a centimeter away from its normal position . Some of the old-timers say they wo n't follow Cosmos to its new , luxurious clubhouse . " It wo n't be the same , " a retired entomologist observed . " Of course , it will be fine for the young members , but us old gaffers belong right here on the square . Maybe they 'll let us sit for a while on those benches in the old park . " With its membership limited to 2000 , Cosmos elects younger scientists to succeed the old gentlemen who pass on . But the air of patience and timelessness still remains . The members all sensed this in the spring of 1949 when Paul H. Oehser , the new secretary of Cosmos , reported on the funeral of Dr. A. K. Fisher , long-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field Club . Oehser helped take Doctor Fisher 's ashes to Plummer 's Island , in the Potomac , which had been the old man 's favorite retreat from Washington , a place where he could roam about and identify birds . On his return from the burial , Oehser reported to the club . He wrote : It was not too salubrious a day . It was overcast above and April-muddy underfoot . But the woods clearings were still blue with wild phlox , and the May apples were blooming all around . A short distance upriver , a spot was selected , and without formal speech or rite , A. K. 's ashes were reverently committed to the pungent woods soil of this mid-Potomac island that he loved so well and where he passed so many happy hours . Overhead flew a pair of wood ducks and an osprey , and the ornithologists of the party called out the names of the smaller birds whose spring voices sang no solemn dirge , but rather a sort of paean to that renewal of life that comes with every spring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little dump of twinleaf ( Jeffersonio ) was planted , a beautiful native wild flower fairly common on the island . The spot is in no way identified , and that , too , certainly is as A. K. would have wanted . As a Cosmos member said later , " What a wonderful way to go out . "
