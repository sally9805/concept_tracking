INDOCHINA <P> Communist Ho Chi Minh 's order of the day was " Destroy the enemy , and achieve new feats of arms . " In these terms last week the Communists launched a new major offensive in Asia . First objective : the eastern bank of the wide , fast-flowing Mekong River , fourth greatest in all Asia , and the border of Siam . Further objectives : still to unfold . <P> As the chill mists of the crachin season crept past the French forts of the Red River delta , elements of two Viet Minh divisions , some 20,000 strong , slipped away to the southwest ; they swerved unopposed across Indo-China 's wooded mountain spine , then invaded the " associated state " of Laos in its southern , least strongly defended sector ( see map ) . The Communists fell by night upon a French-Laotian company near the border and cut it quickly to pieces . Then the invaders headed west through scraggy hillsides towards the Mekong , using footpath trails to bypass the French defense posts along the main highway . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were already pulling out . The day after Christmas , the Communists entered the center of Thakhek ( pop . 10,000 ) and gazed across the Mekong to the rich land of Siam . They had split Indo-China in two . <P> Two Theories . At this stage of the battle , Ho 's military intentions are not clear . From Thakhek , he could move northwest against Luang Prabang , the Laotian royal capital ; he could move south towards Savannakhet and its important nearby airfield . He could dig in at Thakhek and wait for the French to send reinforcements from the decisive delta against him . At Thakhek , too , he could pose a threat to neutral but strongly anti-Communist Siam . The Siamese were taking no chances : they declared nine provinces an emergency zone and moved troops and artillery to the Mekong , directly opposite the Communist positions . <P> As always with Communist actions , Ho 's offensive had deeper , political purposes . Theory No. 1 : Ho is now trying to win the war in a series of offensives , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 : Ho knows he can not win the war unless he crushes the delta ; since he can not do this , he is therefore trying to create a position of strength in Laos as a prelude to peace negotiations . <P> One Conclusion . For the past three weeks , Communist capitals of Europe and Asia have been subjected to stereotyped peace rallies . Moscow , Peking and Ho have said the war could be ended by negotiation . French Premier Laniel is on record that " the French government does not consider the Indo-Chinese problem as a matter which must necessarily be settled militarily . " But Ho is demanding that France 1 ) recognize his government and get out of Indo-China , 2 ) exclude Bao Dai 's Vietnamese nationalists from the peace talks , 3 ) make the first formal move to sue for peace . All this , coupled with the challenge of the Mekong offensive , adds up to one inescapable conclusion : Ho 's price is too high .               @ @ @ @ @ @
