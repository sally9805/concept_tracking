txt The nation will be encouraged and gratified , as President Truman was , by General Marshall 's report on the increase in our armed forces . At the time of the outbreak of Korean aggression last June the announced strength of the three services , Army , Navy and Marine Corps , was 1,458,500 ; today our armed forces have attained a total strength in excess of 2,900,000 ; Therefore , without emergency mobilization it has been possible to double thconumber of our nen under arms in a period of just nine months . Thus some of the damage of the too-quick postLwar demobilization has been undone . We are getting back toward the " position of strength " from which , it is quite apparent , we must negotiate if we are to negotiate successfully . There is /lesson for congratulation to the large number of persons who have made this accomplishment possible . It is a genuine achievement , a proof of the strength and resilience of our society . Some of the value in this great gain will have been lost , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of complacency . This is no time for relaxation . The peril is still great . The sense of danger was acute last December when United Nations forces were in general retreat in Korea . The response in this country was vigorous and the program of regaining our strength was greatly accelerated . At that time our allies in Europe seemed to back away from us as we drove ahead . Now the situation is curiously reversed . The successful stand in Korea and General Ridgway 's brilliant counter-attacks , the terrible punishment meted out to the Chinese Reds , the psychological effect of our announced program ? all these things have given heart to our European allies and ' induced them to step up their contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty . Here in the United States the reactical has been paradoxically the opposite . When we saw that the danger in Korea had apparently been overcome we slowed down . The folly of this procedure ought to be obvious . Is it possible that Congressmen , business men , workers , the man-in-the-street have already forgotten the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole free world is not a whit less today than it was a few months ago . Even if the showdown is postponed to next year or the next , does that make the necessity for an all-out rearmament effort any the less vital ? Must this country always have to be goaded into activity by the actions of the Kremlin ? As it happens , the danger to IndoChina is grave and it is probable that a great new ? effort will shortly be made to drive the French out . The chances are still considerable that the Chinese will make one more big drive in Korea ; perhaps the Russians will be involved directly the next time . There are reasons to worry about Iran , Yugoslavia , Berlin . But even if nothing happens to any of these places this spring the danger to the United States and the democratic world will remain incalculably great . This is the plain , simple fact that somehow has to be driven into the minds and hearts of legislators , business men , trade unionists and every other citizen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The danger to us and to the West generally lies in the fundamental , inexorable , inescapable fact that the Soviet Union , Red China and the Communist movement repre sent an expanding force which is corn pletely inimical to us . It was United Nations courage am equipment that stopped the Chinese b Korea . It is going to take all we have ? though we cling to the hope the ; more blood need not be shed  --  to stoi the Communists in other places , this year and for many years to come . Wo have only begun . This is a time to pin on pressure , not to slacken . No oni can doubt that Congress and our busi ness and labor leaders will do the right things when and as they realize tin necessity for them , but there should In no letdown and no failure of under standing . It will be tragic if we have t ( wait for each next move by the Krem lin to keep us stirred to a proper pitc/ of action .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
