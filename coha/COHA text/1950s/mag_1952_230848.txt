Two-Fisted Air Power <P> Sir : <P> . . . Your latest article on U.S. air power TIME , May 12 does not give the complete picture on armed air power . <P> Every thinking person knows Uncle Sam 's air power is two-fisted . The right fist is the U.S.A.F.-smashing , powerful and capable ; the left fist is U.S. naval and Marine aviation-rapier-like , highly mobile and superb . The bloodstream for these fighting fists is Uncle Sam 's civilian aeronautical industry . <P> ERNEST S. PARK Lieutenant Commander , U.S.N. Rio de Janeiro <P> Sir : <P> In your article on U.S. air power you made no mention of the impact of guided-missile warfare on air power . . . <P> In any mid-air contest between a piloted aircraft and a well-designed guided missile , the former has no more than a 50-50 chance of surviving . The missile will always have a speed and maneuverability advantage because the aircraft must be designed around human limitations . . . If it takes two $100,000 missiles to destroy a million-dollar bomber , had n't we better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Control of the air will shortly pass from piloted aircraft to antiaircraft guided missiles and then the piloted aircraft will cease to have tactical significance except for noncombat employment . <P> The Soviets appear to be quite appreciative of this revolutionary prospect . . . It is reasonable to presume that their important targets will be heavily defended by these missiles . How will the B-47 fare against such a defense ? The time has come for us to adopt another yardstick for measuring air power than the air group . We must plan for the impact of guided-missile warfare . <P> <P> GRAYSON MERRILL Commander , U.S.N. Bureau of Aeronautics Washington , B.C. <P> The One That Got Away <P> Sir : <P> Shame on you for saying that Dick Russell would be the " second bachelor-President " - the first being James Buchanan ! <P> Grover Cleveland was a bachelor when he went into office and was later married in the White House . . . <P> <P> ROBERT O. FOOTE Sierra Madre , Calif . <P> <P> Ruffles &; Flourishes <P> Sir : <P> Your article TIME , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is delicious . Twenty years ago we tried one millionaire who gave the national bobsled a push down the icy run . Exhilarating at first , but now we 're going at terrific speed and . . . we 're heading right for a big tree . <P> This time let 's put a man at the control who came up the hard way . Think hard ; his first name is a three-letter word . <P> <P> H. W. JOYCE <P> Brookline , Mass . <P> <P> Bob or Ike ? - ED . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Eisenhower 's victories are termed " smashing , " " atomic , " " revolutionary . " Bob Taft 's are minimized by " expected , " etc . Now good old Senator Lodge informs us that there are not enough Republicans in the U.S. to elect a President . Well , if Eisenhower is nominated , there certainly wo n't be many Republicans at the polls . We 'd rather stay home . . . <P> <P> MRS . MARIAN ERICKSON <P> Chicago <P> Christianity in Fruita <P> Sir : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the May 12 issue , it is gratifying to learn of a community where a man and his family are helped because they need help-regardless of color .
