txt Thousands of the men and women who are called upon each ) year to qualify and to serve as jurors in the courts of this city would not have to be brought in if the jury system were adminlistered more efficiently . Lethlargy and apathy on the part of those responsible for handling some phases of the system , the traditional unwillingness in legal circles to diange the status quo , a jealous guarding of prerogatives and a failure to exchange information have resulted in a great waste of manpower and money . The ' cost of jurors to the city and to the Federal Government is high . In the 1951-52 fiscal year , the city , which pays jurors $3 a day and on special occasions pays for their meals , spent $1,025,551 in juror fees and expenses . The cost to the United States Southern District , which covers Manhattan , the Bronx , Westchester and eight other counties , was $187,390 in the same period , and in the 1952 calendar year the Eastern District , which embraces Kings , Queens , Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these districts , juror 's receive $7 a day and 7 cents a mile for traveling expenses . The cost to business and industry and to individuals in lost time was , of course , much higher . Records of the Consolidated Edison Company show that jury service last year cost the company 11,775 mandays , or more than $200,000 . The figures did not include the time served on juries by the 1,014 persons on the company 's executive payroll , because no breakdown was available . The New York Life Insurance Company , which has a smaller number of employes in its home office here , may be cited as another example , Its cost was close to $15,000 . It should be pointed out that both of these companies , like many others , impress on their employes that jury duty is a public responsibility . It should be noted , too , that all of the jury service can not be charged against courts in the city , because some of the employes served in their suburban communities . Interviews with judges , county clerks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of prospective and actual jurors brought to light bewildering variations from county to county and court to court in the methods used , a surprising lack of knowledge as to what others were doing and a fuzziness as to jurisdictional responsibility . Some of the clerks  --  a hardworking , unfailingly courteous but generally underpaid group  --  were outspokenly critical of phases of the operation , and others who believed their idea of doing things was superior were eager to expound their theories . Pooling of Juries Urged Virtually all of those questioned lagreed that one of the best ways to economize in the use of jurors , and to an even greater extent , to reduce as a consequence the number called in to qualify was for the courts situated in one building to pool their trial or petit jurors . And yet , in Brooklyn and Queens , where this system could be used effectively , it has not been installed . Petit jurors , by far the largest number , are those who sit in judgment in civil and criminal trials . They all pass the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts by chance as ' their names come from the jury wheel . The trend toward pooling has been going on for many years . In a study of the New York County Pupreme Court made in 1931 , William M. Wherry , an attorney , noted that until May , 1929 , each part of that court had drawn jurors separately . He said that in a five-month period in 1929 , after pooling had begun , the number of jurors drawn had dropped by 4,680 and those who actually served by 1,536 , as compared with a similar period the previous year . The saving in jury fees alone , he said , was $63,264 . Mr. Wherry termed the calling of jurors for separate parts absurd from the point of view of Iproper processing , and described pooling as one of the most obvious ways to stop wasting them . The same remarks may well be applied to pooling between courts , which has been recommended wherever feasible by the State Judicial Council and other groups . Putting jurors in a central assembly room , where the separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each of the courts does not have to rely on a large cushion of jurors to protect it from running short . The fear of every court official responsible for determining the quota is that he may have to resort to an " overnight " call : that is , to have the division of jurors in the County Clerk 's office , the agency responsible for qualifying and assigning jurors , summon an extra batch on a ! few days of notice . The fact that these " overnight " calls are rare is taken as an indication that the cushions are liberal . Greater Turnover Provided Another advantage of pooling is that it permits a greater turnover , because jurors released in one court may soon be used in another . Consequently , it tends to eliminate that most unhappy and discontented of all persons , the potential I juror who answers the rollcall each morning and then sits idly by , wondering why he is not used . In Manhattan , Brooklyn and Queens the Surrogates ' Courts , which have relatively little use for jurors now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties . Further pooling is not feasible in Manhattan because the Supreme , City and Municipal Courts and General Sessions ( known as the County Court in other boroughs ) are in different buildings . In the Bronx , where pooling is used most effectively , the Surrogates ' , Supreme , City and County Courts are all in the handsome Bronx County Building at Grand Concourse and 161st Street . The first three draw from a central assembly room on the fourth floor , while the County Court has its own jury room two floors above . John J. Hanley , the County Clerk , said the jurors were sent separately to the County Court to avoid overcrowding , but that the clerks in the two rooms drew on each other when necessary . He and John Ambrose , the veteran jury clerk in the central assembly room , are enthusiastic advocates of pooling as the most efficient manner of operating . In Brooklyn , where the Municipal , City and County Courts are situated in the same building  --  the Central Court Building at Smith and Schermerhorn Streets  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Municipal Courts are all in the beautiful and modern Queens General Courthouse in Jamaica , pooling is not used . Several persons well acquainted with the workings of the jury system estimated that between 35 and 40 per cent of those called each year in Queens to qualify and to serve would not be needed if pooling were used . Others thought this estimate high , but agreed that pooling would mean a considerable saving in both counties . Last year , approximately 75,000 persons were called into the County Clerk 's office in Queens for a check on their qualifications ; more than 26,000 were summoned to , serve , and 14,079 actually served . Considerably less than half of those who were summoned and who served went to the County Courthouse in Long Island City , where the County Court is situated . The three courts in the Brooklyn Central Court Building summoned 18,287 prospective trial jurors and used 6,098 . While everyone agreed that pooling saved on trial jurors and required less money and smaller staffs for operation , there was a wide divergence of opinion when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nolan , Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division , Second Department , which includes Brooklyn and Queens , said he doubted that he alone could direct the courts to pool . John A. Byrnes , Chief Justice of the City Court , thought it was not within his province to seek the establishment of this system in the buildings where branches of his and of other courts shared space . William Lyman , President Justice of the Municipal Court , questioned whether the responsibility for initiating a pooling law lay with the courts , but he said that if this was the case he would be glad to sit down with the representatives of the other courts to discuss the matter . In another field  --  the handling of jurors after they are assigned to a court  --  there are wide variations . In Manhattan Supreme Court , the jurors remain under the jurisdiction of the court from the time they are assigned until they actually serve as jurors , or , as happens infrequently , they are stricken from the jury list . When a person reports to this court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when and where he last served as a juror , how many jury notices he has received since his last service , and if he wishes a deferment , he must say why , and when he will be able to serve . If Francis J. Quinn , the jury clerk , or one of his assistants , agrees to the jury prospect , he is directed to return on the day he has chosen . On his return , he may receive a second deferment under the same conditions , but on his next appearance he must go before a judge . This system , usually called the deferred system , is in effect , with a few modifications , in the Bronx , and in a watered-down version in some other courts . Deferred System Backed David W. Peck , Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division , First Department , which includes Manhattan and the Bronx : Supreme Court Justice Bernard Botein ! of that department ; Mr. Quinn , who has handled jurors for fourteen years , and others thought the deferred system by far the most efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it had eliminated the fixing of jury notices , a practice still quite prevalent and devastating in its effects , inasmuch as the man who thinks someone else is getting off jury service through influence will usually try to escape , too . Justice Botein , who believes that the deferred system is highly eco- , nomical in the use of jurors , said that those who were called in were more inclined to serve , and to serve early , because they knew there was no escape . He said there also was no question but that the quality of the juries in Supreme Court had improved immeasurably . Justices Byrnes and Lyman agreed that the deferred system was the most efficient one , but ' both said their courts could not install it without additional manI power to handle the extra paperwork  --  the Supreme Court found this to be true  --  and that because of budgetary restrictions it was impossible for them to obtain more personnel . An objection voiced elsewhere was that the deferred system tied lup too many jurors in one place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignments to other courts . Would End Special Juries The State Judicial Council and other agencies have urged the elimination of special or blue ribbon jurors and of Sheriff 's jurors . The former are used in Manhattan , the Bronx and Brooklyn and generally in first-degree murder cases on the request of the District Attorney . The latter are used , if at all , in certain limited proceeding* in Supreme Court . Critics say that , with the provement in the caliber of jurors , there is no need for special panels , and the Sheriff 's panels are too often used to escape service . Many jurists believe their task would be made considerably easier if the city increased the jury fee to $6 , the limit allowed by state law , but the city has blocked attempts to get an authorizing bill out of committee in the City Council . The higher fee paid by , the Federal Government has been one of the factors enabling it to operate a relatively efficient jury system here . Others believe that the lifting of exemptions for women , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations , would enable the counties to shorten the period of service or at least lengthen the span between calls . Jurors in Manhattan , the Bronx , and Brooklyn now serve two weeks , , and those in Queens and Richmond ' one . Trial jurors may not be called : for two years after service , and , ! grand jurors for a year , but in actual practice the span is con- ; siderably longer . I Grand jurors , those whose chief task is to hear evidence offered by district attorneys in alleged felonies and to decide whether charges should be pressed or dropped , are . on the whole used effectively , and their interests are protected by vigilant , well - organized associations . Justice Peck , Associate Judge Jerome N. Frank of the United States Court of Appeals here , and an increasing number of other jurists believe that the best way to handle the jury problem is to eliminate juries in civil cases . They ' point out that in England juries. are rarely used in these cases , and that even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
