North Carolinians , who sometimes call their state " a valley of humiliation between two mountains of conceit , " last week had something to crow about . The Civil Aeronautics Board , which ordinarily renews the certificates of " feeder " airlines for only three years , broke precedent by issuing a seven-year renewal to North Carolina 's tiny but fast-growing Piedmont Airlines . In addition , CAB awarded Piedmont four new routes , and gave Piedmont a public pat on the back for its " outstanding record . " <P> In twelve years , Piedmont 's founder and president , Thomas H. ( for Henry ) Davis , 32 , has stretched a $14,000 investment in a plane agency into an airline with twelve DC-3s and 2,230 miles of routes reaching from Wilmington , N.C. to Cincinnati . Although Davis ' airline is technically a " feeder " ( i.e. , a supplier for trunk-line routes ) , 47% of its passengers ride only Piedmont . President Davis runs his line so efficiently that he needed only 24% in airmail pay per $1 of gross revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as 46 for Southwest , 66 for West Coast . <P> Davis achieves this greater efficiency , for one thing , by getting an average of 8 to 9 hours daily use out of each plane ( v. about 6 for most local-service airlines ) . Davis squeezed pennies ( " We even watch pencils " ) , and by running as many flights as possible , lured business passengers , who found that they could make quick round trips the same day . <P> Tom Davis has been flying ever since he was 15 , when he talked his father Egbert , sales manager of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . ( Camels ) , into paying for his lessons . By 16 he had got his private pilot 's license , and by the time he graduated from the University of Arizona ( he went there for his asthma ) , he had qualified as a commercial pilot and a flight instructor . He sold Piper Cubs , then formed Piedmont Aviation Inc. to combine plane sales , maintenance , flying instruction and charter service . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying instructors and ferry pilots . By war 's end Davis had piled up $60,000 in profits and was ready to start his feeder line . <P> With cash from a $675,000 stock issue and a $300,000 bank loan , Davis bought ten more DC-3s . He made a profit ( $65,528 ) in his first full year , then ran up a $62,137 loss in 1949 has been in the black ever since . Last year his profits were up 77% , to $144,562 . Piedmont has carried 515,695 passengers a total of 115.8 million miles without an injury , and its stock has risen from $1 to $3.50 . Moreover , asthma no longer troubles him .
