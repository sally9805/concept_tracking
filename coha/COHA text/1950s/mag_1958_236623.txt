Despite the ribbing to which the stolid old ( 276 years ) city has been subjected for decades , Philadelphia ( pop . 2,200,000 ) has much in common with other big U.S. cities : it is badly in need of a face-lifting . And more than most other cities , Philadelphia is up to its lorgnette in change . The sound of Philadelphia 's mighty billion-dollar rebuilding program this week was clanging merrily from cobblestoned Society Hill to Germantown . <P> But , like many another city , Philadelphia in its ambitious urban-renewal program ( e.g. , rehabilitation of downtown shops , banks , hotels ; 14-acre Penn Center replacing the dowdy Broad St. railroad station ) is faced with a shaky question mark that can not be erased with just so many tons of steel and concrete . It is a human problem : more and more of Philadelphia 's white families are moving out of the city , leaving behind a growing population of low-income Negro families . And the problem of balancing the population becomes more and more difficult because the Negroes are blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites-only communities that Democratic Mayor Richardson P. Dilworth , 59 , calls a " white noose . " <P> The Toll . Slim , outspoken* Dick Dilworth , combat veteran of both world wars , Yaleman and longtime political partner of his City Hall predecessor , Joe Clark ( who is now a U.S. Senator ) , has civic , religious and political organizations , as well as an officeful of assistants , looking for the answers to the problem . " The white noose , " says Housing Coordinator William Rafsky , " is disadvantageous to everyone . Apart from being morally wrong , segregation takes a tremendous economic toll . " <P> Philadelphia 's Negro population numbers about 490,000 , with new immigrants - mostly from the South and 60% unskilled workers-coming in at the rate of 600 a month . Most of the Negroes are concentrated in the central sector of the city , dubbed " the jungle . " There , dismal lines of grimy , red brick row houses huddle bleakly behind paneless or paper-covered windows , and tenants must sometimes use ladders in place of stairways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcrowded , other immigrants fan out into other areas in the city . Some well-off families manage to slip into fine old neighborhoods like Germantown , where they keep well-run homes . But the net effect of the migration is to create new ghettos , drop real-estate values , drain tax revenues , lift the crime rate , + and overburden public schools ( 18 are all-Negro ; in 50 , Negroes comprise from 50% to 90% of the student bodies ) . " There are 60,000 units housing 200,000 people today , " says Mayor Dilworth , " that are unfit for human habitation . " <P> The Density . Why not tear down the slums and simply replace them with public housing units ? Says Dilworth : " Already , 60% of public housing is located in the Negro slum areas . It would take $800 million to rip out the Philadelphia slums . You 'd reduce the density by one-half , and you 'd have no place to put the rest of the people . " Adds Bill Rafsky : " As soon as we displace the Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Example : South Philadelphia , where the big Italian communities are fighting Negro inroads .
