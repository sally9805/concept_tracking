Of all the works Leonardo da Vinci left posterity , only one has been recognized as a self-portrait : a red chalk drawing showing a fierce , lion-headed old patriarch with a furrowed brow and burning eyes . Last week an Italian artist and scholar by the name of Lorenzo Ferri insisted that he had found a second . The face of the Apostle Thaddeus , he said , second from the right in Leonardo 's famed Last Supper* is none other than that of the painter himself . <P> A resemblance between Leonardo and the apostle first struck Ferri in 1937 , when he painted a reproduction of the Last Supper for a Franciscan refectory in Bengasi , Libya . Later , he pored over portraits of Leonardo by contemporary artists , studied descriptions , drew up charts detailing the painter 's hair , beard , nose , eyes , mouth and cheekbones . He photographed the original to compress and sharpen the faded outlines , then worked in the features , adding light and shadow . After years of work , Ferri has a 328-page illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Apostle Thaddeus ' whole manner and bearing point to Leonardo ; he is a man " indifferent to what is happening around him . . . motionless , bent under the weight of a problem he is trying to resolve . " <P> Rome 's art scholars greeted Ferri 's announcement with deep skepticism . " Every painter , " snorted Expert Lionello Venturi , " shows something of his own appearance in his paintings . " <P> Answered Ferri : " They are slow to accept new ideas here in Rome . Leonardo himself had difficulty . He was put to work on machinery instead of painting . " <P> <P> * Painted on the refectory wall at Milan 's Santa Maria della Grazie , Leonardo 's masterpiece started going to pot even before his death , has faded and flaked so badly that only the barest details remain .
