M y phone rang . I picked up the receiver and waited for the vibrations to stop . " This is Beth , " the voice at the other end said . " I 'm calling from camp . We came up for the holidays . There are five feet of snow and perfect skiing . It 's so breathlessly beautiful , you and the children just must drive up for a while . " " Wonderful ! " I said . " I 'll have to be back Tuesday , for the federation meeting at state headquarters , but we 'd love to come until then . " Thanks to the modern car , winter no longer means partial or complete hibernation to women in the northern part of the country . Warmed by the heater , protected by many new car improvements , familiar with correct driving habits , on her way she goes ! And though " winter " does n't mean the same in Texas as it does in North Dakota , still , almost everywhere , driving conditions change to some extent during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state in the union in which major companies do n't report antifreeze sales . Whether you live where winter behaves like a lion or a lamb , at this time of year darkness falls earlier . You should , therefore , allow for this on trips ; see that there are spare bulbs in your glove compartment , in case a light fails ; and drive extra carefully , as it 's harder to see pedestrians or bicyclists at dusk . It 's easier to remember your car 's every-six-months needs if you have them taken care of in the spring and fall ? a seasonal overhauling , like house cleaning . There is a long list of items that any good service station will attend to in a thorough preparing-for-winter checkup . These should n't be neglected , so if you have n't already had this checkup , choose a time when you can spare the car for at least half a day and ask the garage to give it " the works . " A careful mechanic will make sure the pipes that carry off the engine gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the car . This is important in winter , because we are likely to drive with the windows closed . ( It 's wise to always keep one window partially open when you drive , to let fresh air enter . ) Carbon monoxide is nothing to take chances with ; it 's colorless , odorless ,  | I and tasteless , and only one part in 10,000 parts of air can be fatal ! To prepare your car for winter driving , your garage will put in " lighter " grades of oil and grease , which , I find , helps with those cold-morning starts . The I mechanic will check your battery . He will see that your brakes grab to the same degree on both rear wheels ( what he calls " equalizing " the brakes ) and that your wheels line up properly . These help prevent skidding , the most disliked part of winter driving to every woman ? and man . If it has n't already been done , you will probably have antifreeze put in your car . There are two main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car takes in one big dose that protects you all winter , and a less-expensive kind ( usually made with alcohol ) , which does not protect your car as fully . You must have the latter type of antifreeze checked now and then ; more is needed as the temperature drops . The weather you anticipate and the model of your automobile affect the choice of antifreeze , so if you are like me , you 'll consult a reputable dealer . Antifreezes containing kerosene or salt are not approved of by the American Automobile Association and other authorities , as they can harm any rubber or metal with which they come in contact . The average woman has no desire to understand all the inner workings of her car ; but if you have never met your spark plugs face to face , I think you should ask for a formal introduction the next time you buy gasoline . Spark plugs are small white porcelain gadgets ( if your car is old , they may have turned gray ) , which usually line up at the top of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heavy rains or wet and foggy weather in winter , undue moisture may collect on these porcelain surfaces , just as it does on parts of your refrigerator , and this alone may be the cause of your engine 's refusing to start . Let 's assume that some muggy morning you get in your car , with not a minute to spare to keep a doctor 's appointment , and the engine wo n't start . Get out , lift the hood , and wipe off the spark plugs with a cloth . ( The first time I did this , with the result that the engine started up happily at the initial try , I felt as clever as if I 'd taken the motor apart and put it together again ! ) IF YOU have to drive through water , your instinct may be to make a dash for it , but that 's wrong . Shift into second or low gear , and drive slowly yet steadily . This gives you more control ( after all , you ca n't see what the road is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine wires . If your engine should stall and be unwilling to start at the end of such a cold shower , get out and wipe the spark plugs , as well as the wires that lead to them . These wires are attached to the spark plugs and , at the other end , enter what is called the distributor . You do n't have to remember its name ; but you should know that if splashing water has made the car 's insides very wet , the wires are likely to be damp at the distributor end , too . To do a complete job , unplug them one at a time ( they pull out just like an iron cord ) , wipe them off , and then push them back in place firmly , until you hear a little click . To help prevent wet electric wires , you might consult your serviceman about painting yours with a special waterproofing solution . You can do this yourself with a small brush ; one application of this solution protects the wires for about a year . Incidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these wires without risking a shock . If the engine is running , you can get a shock by touching a spark plug , but there is no danger of anything more . To be perfectly safe , however , never touch any part of the engine while the motor is running . Water is also a troublemaker if it gets in your fuel line ? the tube that takes gas from your tank to the engine . In winter , water in this tube can freeze and stop up the line . There are several liquid compounds on the market to overcome this ; most of them are to be added to your gasoline tank , a pint at a time , every thousand miles . Plain alcohol is sometimes used for this purpose , too . COMFORT is important in the winter ; it depends on many things , such as proper clothing , an efficient car heater , a robe carried in the back for passengers . I know some women who like to drive with a throw across their laps ; small , light robes are sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it 's tucked in carefully , so that no hanging end or fringe can get in your way or catch in a foot pedal . In winter , the glove compartment finally earns its name ; an extra , warm pair carried in the car is often a joy unbounded . Nothing is more annoying to a driver than having a persistent draft on his back or neck . Today , cars are designed to avoid this . You will have to discover in your own car how best to adjust large and small windows for maximum comfort . The booklet you received when you bought the car probably makes definite suggestions . If not , ask your dealer . In the same way , investigate all the possible adjustments on your heater , so that you can have the fullest comfort under various weather conditions . I am , like most of my readers , that mythical creature known as the average American woman ? in this case , the average American woman driver . I have driven for many years , rolling up countless miles between my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught my son and daughter to drive , beginning the day each reached the legal age . I have gone alone on long trips , and I have made the move to a summer cottage with the car so full of children and luggage that the family dog and cat scarcely had room to turn around , but they came along , too . Yet with all this very average driving , I can not be sure what your driving problems , questions , and worries are . I hope you will write to me and tell me about them , and I shall try to find the answers for you .  |
