txt Massachusetts tax officials to-1 day are completing final details on their withholding tax ma- chincry , aiming to begin payroll deductions by Feb. 15 . Although hampered administratively by legislative delays in passage of the withholding tax , Robert T. Capeless , State Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation , and his staff are ready to act fast once the bill is enacted into law . That may come before tin day is finished . Already , the Senate has voted initial approval to a compromise measure . Final Senate action is due today , after which the House is scheduled to consider the Senate amendment guaranteeing cities and towns a **25;923;TOOLONG share of the 1959 windfall revenue . Deadline Stressed Once the bill is signed by Governor Furcolo , rush bids will be sought on printing of necessary forms for starting withholding deductions . To achieve the Feb. 15 goal , speed will be required all along the line . To delay withholding beyond Feb. 15 would mean the period of double deductions to make up for the Jan. 1 to Feb. 15 period would stretch longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capeless asserted , " We have got to meet that deadline at all costs . " Printing priority will be given to instruction booklets for employers . These booklets will contain the formulas and withholding tables on which to base payroll deductions for the state income tax . In addition , forms on which employees will make their exemption claims will be printed swiftly , although Mr. Capeless and  --  his =State Tax Commission associates now are considering a plan whereby employers would deduct on the basis of exemptions claimed on federal withholding for the initial period . It is understood that some companies would have difficulty , otherwise , in obtaining from all their employees the exemption certificates in time for the Feb. 15 target date . Payments Due April 15 Also to be printed are forms on which persons with unearned income will make their necessary quarterly estimated tax returns . The ? first quarterly re- , turns and tax payments are due April 15 , along with the regular one-lump-sum payments all Massachusetts state income taxpayers must make on that date on 1958 earned and unearned income .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax payers are going to pay heavily to help the state catch up with its budget deficits . But next year they will be on a completely pay-as-you-go system with no big tax payment facing them on April 15 , 1960 , because they will have paid most of their state income tax via . withholding in the interim . ? Before the withholding system actually becomes law , however , the pending compromise measure faces further rough handling by its opponents . Few observers doubt , however , that final passage of the compromise bill is certain . It has cleared its main hurdle . The 23-to-17 Senate vote on Feb. 4 was the key . On that vote 22 Democrats and one Republican supported the compromise offered by the Senate Committee on Ways and Means . Fifteen Republicans and two Democrats voted against withholding . The compromise allows the state to keep all the withholding revenue collected through June 30 , 1959 , end of the current ' fiscal year . House Aroused The compromise forced on the Governor was a triumph for a controlling Democratic - Republican bloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fiscal picture prove accurate as the year goes on , and drastic tax action is required to make up for the 10 million dollars or more going to the cities and towns , the Governor may emerge as the eventual winner . But observers agree that the real loser , either way , will be the taxpayers , even though many will find the withholding system an easier way to meet their state income tax obligations in the long run . In calendar year 1959 , however , taxpayers will be out of pocket a considerable extra sum because of overlapping payments under withholding . Probably ? the chief danger to the compromise bill lurks in the House , where some dissident Democrats are unhappy about having the original Furcolo bill rammed through the House in one day more than two weeks ago , after the Governor had insister on passage of the bill " as is . " When some Democrats in the House sought to delay action , they were roundly chastised by some gubernatorial spokesmen . Now , after the Democratic Senate has successfully forced the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed . They probably will kick up a bit of political dust before the House adopts the Senate amendment giving the cities and towns some of the windfall revenue .
