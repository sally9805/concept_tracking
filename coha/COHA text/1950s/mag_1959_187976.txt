Pity the girl who marries Frank Duncan , clacked the gossips around the Santa Barbara , Calif , courthouse . The owl-eyed lawyer was arrogant and humorless , lisped so noticeably that teasing court clerks called him a " wicked wascal wabbit " behind his back . But that was the lesser half of it : Frank at 29 was a mamma 's boy . Matronly , smartly dressed Elizabeth Duncan , separated from her husband when Frank was a child , held her son 's hand in court , applauded when he won a case , tongue-lashed the district attorney when he lost . So tight was the noose that once , when Frank threatened to leave home , his mother took a heavy dose of sleeping pills and was carried off to Santa Barbara 's Cottage Hospital . <P> Love &; Leave . There , ironically , romance entered Frank 's life 13 months ago . Mother Duncan 's nurse was slight , auburn-haired Olga Kupczyk , 30 , recently of Vancouver , Canada . After Mother Duncan was sent home , Frank and Olga dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was in love ; in June she and Frank were married . But scarcely had a superior court judge tied the knot than Olga Kupczyk Duncan 's mother-in-law trouble began . The newlyweds checked into a Santa Barbara motel for their wedding night . At 1 : 30 a.m . Frank had to go home to mother . <P> For five months Frank Duncan spent evenings with Olga , nights at home . Sometimes mother Duncan , 54 , would harass Olga by telephone at the hospital ; sometimes she would beat on the apartment door and scream threats . Twice Olga changed apartments to escape her mother-in-law ; each time Mother Duncan trailed Frank to his rendezvous . And one day last August mother Duncan hired an ex-convict to act as her son , posed herself as Olga , got a Ventura County superior court judge to annul her son 's marriage . <P> Defeat &; Death . Olga and Frank ignored the threats ; Olga , in fact , had high hopes that the baby 's arrival might win over Frank once and for all . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing . Frank was no help . Santa Barbara and Ventura police turned up the phony annulment and , with help from the FBI , followed a trail that led to two characters of Santa Barbara 's seamy Haley Street area : blade-thin Augustine Baldonado , 25 , and Luis Moya , a 22-year-old convict ( dope and street fighting ) . Both finally confessed that mother Duncan had hired them to kill Olga for $6,000 . They led the cops to a shallow grave in a Ventura County ditch . There indeed lay the body of Frank Duncan 's bride , the victim of beating and strangulation . <P> Mother Duncan , already in jail for the fraudulent annulment , was led from her cell and charged-along with Baldonado and Moya-with murder . Angrily , she denied all , called the whole thing a frame-up to hurt her Frank . Frank himself hid under an assumed name in a Hollywood apartment until the cops tracked him down . Then he scarcely grieved over his dead wife and unborn child . But he was shocked and shaken by his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother doing anything cruel . She would have to be insane to be linked into it . "
