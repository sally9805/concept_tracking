A blueprint for boosting world trade and developing backward countries was laid down this week in Foreign Economic Policy for the Twentieth Century , third in a series of special reports by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund ( TIME , Jan. 13 ) . Said the report : " There exists no vocal constituency for foreign economic policy . As a result , foreign economic policy has all too often become simply a response to a series of separate crises . Nothing is more important , therefore , than to bring about the conviction that a sustained and imaginative policy is crucial not only for our self-interest but for the peace and well-being of the entire world . " <P> One of the foundations for a foreign economic policy is a reciprocal trade broadening of pacts . The report goes much further than the reciprocal trade bill passed last week by the House , wants the program to be made a permanent part of national policy , with broader presidential powers and a reconsideration of such hobbling provisions as escape clauses and peril points . To answer protectionists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foreign trade , contribute to a trade surplus of $6 billion a year . While " it is unavoidable that some of our imports will compete with segments of domestic production . . . American industry is well able to meet such competition . " Trade liberalization " will increase the competitive discipline that is a major safeguard against inflation . " <P> For countries that depend heavily on one commodity for income , the report has some concrete suggestions to ease the blow when commodity prices fall . It suggests 1 ) a system of international credits to keep up the purchasing power of a hard-hit nation until prices recover , and 2 ) a " ceiling " and " floor " 10% above and below the average price of a commodity in a previous year , to mitigate wild fluctuations of commodity prices . <P> Again and again the report stresses the importance of private capital investment , which is twice the volume of U.S. aid . " The driving force in a free country comes from the initiative , imagination and willingness to assume responsibility on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries have neglected private capital . To encourage it , they must stabilize their currencies , check inflation , provide tax incentives to ensure that profits can be commensurate with risks . The U.S. could also provide tax incentives for the U.S. investors , extending the 14% reduction in corporate taxes enjoyed by companies investing in the Western Hemisphere . <P> Many of the tools , such as loan funds and technical assistance , needed to expand trade , says the report , already exist in United Nations agencies or bilateral agreements . But , the panel notes , they must be more fully implemented . The U.S. must provide more personnel to foreign nations , step up the spread of U.S. know-how , thus show the world an enthusiastic response to the economic challenge .
