An award of $112,291 is " a mere token , " reflected Judge Fred A. Young in Manhattan last week , " for all the wealth of the State of New York could not compensate the claimant for the mental anguish suffered through nearly twelve years of false imprisonment , under the impression that he would be there for the rest of his life . " <P> The claimant , Louis Hoffner , studied the judge from across the hearing room , his face drawn and tired-looking . " Inherent also in this decision . " the judge continued , " must be the fact that the District Attorney 's office had possession of evidence which , if known to defendant 's counsel , would have prevented this tragic miscarriage of justice . " <P> <P> The State of New York , the judge ruled , must deliver to the claimant a check for the $112,291 , taxfree , in compensation for his twelve lost years . The claimant quietly thanked him : " This award gives me complete vindication at last . I feel very good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the Man . " Hoffner , son of a Russian immigrant baker , worked as a runner in Wall Street , an odd-jobs man in a 5 &; 10 store . At the age of 22 he served 30 months in jail for attempted grand larceny , and at 27 he got into more serious trouble . In August 1940 , police arrested him as he was walking his dog outside his Brooklyn home , and hauled him off to the station . Not until much later was Hoffner told that a bartender had been shot dead in a restaurant holdup in Jamaica , eleven miles from where Hoffner had been at the time , and that a waiter had picked out his picture from the rogues ' gallery . <P> <P> In the lineup , the restaurant 's part-owner had a close look at Louis Hoffner and flatly stated : " He 's not the man . " The waiter , who had glimpsed the murderer for only 35 seconds , also failed to identify Hoffner-but after a ten-minute chat with police , the waiter returned and pointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the place the other night . " A jury returned a verdict of guilty , recommending mercy . " I thought it might be well to put the boy away , " was the way one juror , a woman , explained it , " because of his previous trouble . " <P> " A Yen for Las Vegas . " So Louis Hoffner , 28 years old , went off to serve his life sentence in Clinton Prison , Dannemora , N.Y . But outside Dannemora , more and more voices were insisting that Hoffner was innocent . A policeman friend of the family , an attorney , a New York World-Telegram reporter , set to work to dig up the irregularities , and they found plenty , e.g. , that Louis Hoffner 's prosecutors had in effect concealed the shaky identification in the lineup . In November 1952 , Louis Hoffner was set free . <P> Last week Hoffner seemed content with the promise of $112,291 ( the state could still appeal ) . " I 've got a yen for Las Vegas-but I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard so much about that kind of life . " Soberly , Louis Hoffner concluded : " Then I 'd like to find some legitimate business , maybe a liquor store . I 'd like to enjoy life . "
