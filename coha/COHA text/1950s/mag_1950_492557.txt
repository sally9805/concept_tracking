THE POST REPORTS ON DIVORCE 4 . The Children are the Losers By DAVID G. WITTELS T HE nine-year-old boy stood at the head of the stairs and refused to come down when his father arrived for his first fortnightly visit after the divorce . " I hate you ! " he shrilled . " I hate you ! " Then , crying like the baby he tried not to be , he ran Co his room and locked the door . Two hours later his mother discovered that he had disappeared . He remained missing until late that night , when his grandfather telephoned that he had shown up at their hone , footsore , tear-stained and exhausted . He had climbed out the window , shinnied down a rainspout and leaped eight feet from a shed . How he had found the way to his grandparents remained a mystery . But with the instinct of a lost animal , he had trudged elevehmiles across Detroit , seeking the love that no longer existed in his own home . That small boy was one of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems gathered by Dr. William J. Goode , Wayne University sociologist , in Detroit . Since all the divorcees in this survey were mothers , nearly 1000 children were involved ; and since the cases were scientifically selected and analyzed to produce a true cross section , the stories are representative of the problems created for children by divorce . In some respects most of these children suffered more than real orphans . At least children orphaned by death are not torn by the tensions of divided loyalties and the bitterness of most divorces or harrowed by the feeling of having been rejected by a parent . Four of the divorcees in Doctor Goode 's survey had seen this so clearly that , not to get even with their husbands but because they wanted to save their children the greater pain , they had decided to tell the children that their fathers were dead . The range of specific reactions was so wide , however , that at this point the over-all effect of divorce upon children is perhaps best epitomized by the comparison used recently by Dr. Kenneth D. Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Imagine three hundred thousand children stricken in one year by infantile paralysis , " he said . " Yet the chances of these children in divorce being crippled emotionally are far greater than the chances for physical crippling by poliomyelitis . " Viewed in that light , the total number of children thus handicapped is a national tragedy . Exact figures are not available , but expert estimates run up to 5,000,000 children in this country who have had the cards stacked against them by the fact that their parents are divorced . Even that figure does not tell the whole story . It is only for children still under eighteen ; it does not take into account the adults who were stricken by divorce during childhood . The bewilderment and emotional upset such children suffer at the time their parents break up , brutal as that can be , is only part of the picture . All the evidence is that the chances of their getting into trouble is much greater , and that they are far more likely to be unhappy even in their adult life than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divorce , in which they were innocent victims , usually scars them for life . The effect of divorce upon children is therefore by many times the worst plague which ever struck this country . That is why many authorities now argue that when children are involved marriage should no longer be considered a private affair , terminable practically at will by man and wife . Some of these authorities urge that the children and the public should be represented in all such cases , contesting the divorce suits as active parties at interest . " The minute children are in the picture , " says Doctor Johnson , " there is a social unit in the community which , if disturbed and upset , is bound to disturb and upset the entire community .... In such cases divorce is a social collapse which may cause irreparable injury to countless other persons . " It is also a cumulative and self-perpetuating plague . In Doctor Goode 's cases , the percentage of divorcees whose parents had been divorced was at least three times as high as for the general population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness in marriage is to have come from a happy home , and that children of divorced parents are far more likely to become divorced themselves . In other words , divorce breeds divorce . A freakish coincidence points this up . One day recently a Detroit judge of long experience on the bench was struck by a familiar ring to the maiden name of the woman in a divorce case before him . It developed that this was the third such case he had heard in the same family . As a fledgling judge he had granted a divorce to a couple of that name . Some years later he had presided over the divorce of their son . Now he was hearing the divorce suit of their granddaughter . Whether the greater frequency of divorce among children of divorced parents is mainly because they inherit the parents ' emotional weaknesses  --  most people who get divorced show signs of emotional immaturity  --  or because of bad environment created by divorce is a moot question . But Doctor Goode 's survey furnished further proof that it is usually the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marriage . The worst blow to them and the one with the most lasting aftereffects , is the feeling of rejection . The nine-year-old cited above could n't understand the adult friction and motives which led his parents to divorce . To him the divorce meant that his father did n't care enough for him to live with him . He felt betrayed , and so in his anguish he cried out , " I hate you ! " ? which he did n't mean at all . The hurt expressed itself in various ways . There was the case of the small girl who kept her father 's picture in a drawer together with her most cherished possessions . Her mother even found it under her pillow several times . But when her father occasionally came to see her , she would run and hide . Some children who spoke incessantly of their fathers , and kept asking when they would come , froze up when the fathers finally appeared , with the result that the fathers thought the children did n't want to see them . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to meet his father , but when it came time to end the visit , the boy would hide , as if to prolong the father 's presence or because he could n't bear the farewell . When one divorcee scolded her six-year-old daughter for running into the street , impressing upon her that she might get killed , the child burst out , " I do n't care ! My daddy does n't love me any more ! " Sometimes playmates could recognize the hurt better than adults could , and , with the cruelty inherent in children , would taunt the child of divorce . In one case the mother realized for the first time what she had done to her child by divorcing the father when she heard other children yelling , " Yah , yah , your father went away ! Your father went away ! " There were variations of this in a number of cases . One divorced woman noticed that her elevenyear-old son seemed to avoid most other children in the neighborhood . He played only with the son of a widow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't available , he played by himself . Under questioning , he said he " hated " the others because " they 're always talking about their fathers . " Another boy refused to go to school when his mother and he moved to a new section after the divorce . He had never given such trouble before and his stubborn rebellion remained a mystery until finally he explained , " Aw . they 'll ask me questions about my mother and father , and what 'll I tell them about my father ? " In most of the cases there was evidence that the children were harder to handle after the divorce . Though it would seem that this was to be expected , Many of the divorcees were surprised . Apparently they had n't realized the role of a father , even a not-o. - good one in the bringing up of children . They either had n't thought out that phase or had believed that , with the help of the maternal grandparents , they could raise the children just as well without a father . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases downright bad , most of them ascribed it to the lack of the authority of a strong male voice and hand . That is partly true in most cases , but psychologists and psychiatrists believe that usually an even greater factor is that feeling of rejection . " As a defense against further hurt , " says One expert , " the rejected child develops a strong re-8.1Btance against those who have any authority over him , and he becomes more or less ' unapproachable . ' " Criminologists , too , believe that " the roots of delinquency are to be sought in the emotional rejection of children by one or both of their parents . " Though all of Doctor Goode 's cases were studied within less than two and a half years after the di- , verce , and excluded children over eighteen , so that the full effects had not had time to flower , plenty of signs of trouble had begun to emerge . Dozens of the ) ( Is were defying their mothers , and three in their early teens were already running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorbell rings in the evening , " one divorced mother said , " I 'm afraidit 's the police . " Two openly admitted they were already suspicious of the morals of fifteen-yearold daughters . In a family of three children , the two older ones , aged fourteen and twelve , showed no strong outward signs of the hurt they must have felt , but the youngest , a boy aged six , suddenly began throwing tantrums and even became a firebug . He became so bad that his mother took him to a psychiatrist , who diagnosed the boy 's actions as the result of feeling that he had been rejected by his father . Other studies , focused particularly on delinquency and covering a greater extent of years , prove those implications to a frightening extent . One such study , entitled Five Hundred Criminal Careers , revealed that more than 25 per cent of those criminals came from homes broken by divorce , separation or desertion . A study of One Thousand Juvenile Delinquents reported that " our delinquents come largely from homes which were for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hertel , general director of the Family Service Association of America , reports that 53 per cent of delinquent children come from broken homes . Still another study shows that the effect of divorce or separation ? which is really one form of divorce ? is worse than that of the death of a parent or both parents . That study indicated that a boy from a broken home is twice as likely to get into trouble serious enough to cause his arrest as a boy who was orphaned by death . For a girl the odds are even worse : more than three and a half to one . Again , psychiatrists use the rejection theory to explain why so many girls from homes broken by divorce go wrong . That feeling of having been rejected by their fathers can cause them , partly in defiance and partly in search of a needed affection they have missed , to fall readily into the arms of the first man who comes along . There is another factor too . Divorcees , suffering from loneliness , sometimes tend to let their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Goode 's interviewers was talking to a divorcee who had two daughters , aged twelve and eight , when the phone rang in another room . While the mother was gone the twelve-year-old wandered into the room and remarked , " You 've got a long wait . Mother 's talking to a boy friend . " Hoping to get an indication of how the child might feel about a possible stepfather , the interviewer asked her how she liked her mother 's friend . " Oh , " said the child , " I do n't know which one she 's talking to . She 's got so many of them . " That same divorcee later said that she was worried about her older daughter . " She knows too much for her age , " she complained . " The other day she sassed her teacher in school . ' What does an old maid like you know ? ' she said to the teacher ... . I do n't know where she picks up such ideas . " Most of the divorced mothers in Doctor Goode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain the question of divided loyalties put on their children . They tried to make the children partisans on their side . Several , much to the discomfort of the embarrassed interviewers , ings of their former husbands which they could have Learned only through the children . Sometimes this seemed motivated merely by feminine curiosity , compounded somewhat by lingering traces of affection for the former husband , but often it was obvious that the children had been trained to cast suspicious eyes on the father , his surroundings and his friends  --  particularly female ones . That spying factor developed mostly in cases where custody of the children was divided or where the children went to call on the fathers rather than the fathers coming to see them . But it also occurred in cases where the bitterness between the divorced couple was so great that the mother made it a point not to be present when the father visited them . In many such cases the mother 's obvious disapproval and resentment of the visits increased the strain upon the children , because it caused their pleasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt and disloyalty to the mother . It was even worse in the comparatively few cases in which the divorced parents snarled at each other and fought and created scenes when the father came to see the children . In one such case the woman , after admitting that she had used her former husband 's visits as opportunities to " tell him what I thought of him , " complained bitterly to the interviewer that he had stopped coming . " That shows you what kind of a man he is , " she said triumphantly . " A father who does n't care to see his own children ! " Sometimes it was apparent that the mothers used the children as bait in efforts to lure hack the husbands . The methods of using the children for this purpose fell into two main categories . In one , the mothers withheld the children from the fathers , sometimes even in defiance of court orders . The other method , though with the same aim , was the exact . opposite . It is illustrated by the case in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he children as often as he wished but coached them in little speeches to make to their father , telling him how much they loved and missed him . Also , if she knew beforehand that he was coming , she dressed them and herself in their prettiest , and prepared a home-cooked feast . " I want him to see what he is missing , " she confided to the interviewer . " Then maybe he 'll come to his senses . " Of course there were also a few cases in which the children were better off as a result of the divorce . This was usually so where the father was a drunken brute . It also seemed so in some instances where incessant battling between the parents had virtually made nervous wrecks of the children . Sometimes even stepfathers seemed to he better for them . In one case , when the interviewer arrived the stepfather was putting the two small children to bed , and the children were clinging to him , begging for one more story , one more kiss good night . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , after divorcing her husband when he went to jail for an unspeakable crime , married a man somewhat younger than herself . He was a good provider , legally adopted all seven children , and as far as the interviewer could tell , it was a very happy family group . In most cases , however , the intrusion of a step-parent or even a suitor led to some of the worst reactions . One small boy kicked the shins of all men who came to see his mother . An older boy refused so absolutely to accept his stepfather that he had to be sent to live with his aunt and uncle . A sixteenyear-old girl disappeared three days after her mother remarried . There was no trace of her until four months later , when , sobbing and frightened , she telephoned her mother and begged for help . She would not tell where she had been or with whom , but she was pregnant . A thirteen-year-old girl expressed her resentment more subtly . With a keen sense of satire , she mimicked and burlesqued every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children sided with the mother , occasionally they directed their resentment against her . " My daughter acts as if it were my fault , " complained a woman who had very good grounds for divorce . " She will hardly speak to me . " There may also be something of that attitude in most of the cases where the children were harder to handle after divorce . Several of the mothers with very small children worried about that attitude cropping up in the future . " I wonder if my boy will hold it against me  --  that he has n't got a father  --  when he gets older , " one thoughtful young divorcee said . Others were fearful that the divorce might hurt their daughters ' chances for marriage to eligible young men . In many cases the divorced mothers ' problems were complicated by the fact that now the fathers appeared in a new and better light to the children . When he came to see them he usually was , of course , on his best behavior , and gave them attentions and liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents and took them to picnics , shows and amusement parks . In one case , one of the reasons the mother had got a divorce was her husband 's stinginess , even where the children had been concerned . He had beat her one day because she had bought their six-year-old son a tricycle . But when he came to see the child after the divorce , he usually arrived with his arms loaded with presents . The crowning irony was when , at least two years before the boy would be big enough to fit it , he brought him the best bicycle money could buy . In another case , the father , a habitual philanderer , had neglected his daughter as well as his wife . In the divorce proceedings , however , he insisted upon part-time custody of the daughter . The mother did not object . But she went to court to get the arrangement rescinded when she discovered that he was allowing their daughter , by then fifteen , to attend his gay parties and drink champagne , and that he let her entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl became bitter against her mother for spoiling her fun . The most immediately harassing problems , for mother and children alike , arose out of financial difficulties . Except in extraordinary cases , such as incapacity of the wife , no alimony is granted by Michigan courts  --  only support for the children . That is now the pattern in most states . The support granted by the courts was rarely enough to maintain a household . " That 's hardly enough to buy shoes for them , " complained one woman whose forty-fivedollars-a-week divorced husband was ordered to pay fifteen dollars of that sum for his three children . Most of the women were naturally very bitter about this . " It 's a man 's world , " said one . " A man can fluff off his responsibilities with the payment of a few dollars . But how am I and the children to live ? I 'd like to send him his two little responsibilities for a while and see how he likes it . " Oddly enough , the greatest bitterness seemed to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman whose former husband got a fine salary , and who was awarded a sixty-dollars-a-week support order which he paid promptly , and whose parents were rich , regularly petitioned the court to increase the order . And every few days she would telephone his home and tell his new wife she ought to be ashamed of herself for taking the bread and butter out of the mouths of little children . The personal-bitterness factor aside , however , the vast majority of the women found the struggle to feed and clothe their children bitter enough . More than 80 per cent of them had to go to work to augment the support orders . The going to work , though it eased the financial problem , created other problems ; mostly revolving around the care of the children while the mothers were away earning a living . One woman , for instance , had to giire up a pleasant , well-paying position in a downtown department store and take a sweaty job as an unskilled hand in a factory because the latter job enabled her to dash home to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 94 ) Another woman , without training or talent for making a living , could get only a job as a waitress in a greasy-spoon lunchroom . Even with the support money from her former husband , her income , after paying a slatternly neighbor to keep an eye on her two children , did n't add up to enough for more than a dreary furnished room . She , had no parents or other relatives to turn to . Meanwhile her husband had married again . Finally , signing a paper which absolved him of further payments , she gave up her children to her former husband and his new wife . Upon first hearing this , the interviewer was suspicious that she had been so flagrantly an unfaithful wife that the court had taken her children away from her . Her haggard face , her sad eyes , the quiet way in which she said , " If it were n't for the disgrace upon the children , I 'd kill myself , " could be read either way . But the court records showed her story was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " She seemed decent and kind . They had a nice home . I could give them nothing but this . " She simply had sacrificed her own feelings for what she thought was best for the children . Even when , as was frequently the case , the divorced mother moved the children in with their maternal grandmother , there were serious headaches . Often the grandmothers spoiled the children , and often the mother and the grandmother quarreled in front of the children over the proper way to bring them up . In one extreme case the interviewer reported that the child seemed a nervous wreck as the result of his mother , an aunt , a grandmother and a great-grandmother all handling him in conflicting ways . There was also a degradation about the support money . Some husbands used the payments as excuses to intrude upon their divorced wives and to pry into their lives . Some counted it out or slapped it down as if it were charity . Many of them paid only erratically , and some of them seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan their budgets . They lived in fear from week to week  --  would he or would he not pay for the children that week ? ' They often had to beg and battle and go crawling to their ex-husbands , even if they feared or despised them , for a pittance for their children . Some were forced to public charity , some pawned their furniture and even their clothing . If their ex-husbands fled the jurisdiction or simply refused to pay , often there was little they could do about it . The legal machinery for making divorced fathers pay for the support of their children was so cumbersome , wearisome and slow that many selfish men were able to thumb their noses at court orders with impunity . A few years ago the whole method of handling the problem of support for children in divorce struck Judge Joseph A. Moynihan , presiding judge of the Michigan State Circuit Court , as a hor1 rible failure in the courts ' duty . He began casting about for ways to do something about it . He eventually evolved a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to reverse a lot of traditional legal thinking to do it . That was because the roots of the situation which left divorced mothers and their children at the mercy of possibly selfish or irresponsible fathers lay in a peculiar ambivalence in court procedure which seems so cruelly illogical that it is difficult for the lay mind to comprehend . ( Coot:tolled from Page 98 ) lawyers on the Friend of the Court staff . The errant husband is now dealing not with a bewildered woman whom he might he able to flimflam or bulldoze , but with tough-minded representatives of the court . They make it clear to the men that this is not a private matter between them and their ex-wives and children , but a debt to society and an order of the court which must be obeyed , or else . The system has been in effect only a couple of years and it was only a few months ago that it got the backlog of old cases under control and caught up with currentones . In 1948 this setup collected and paid out more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than pays for itself by keeping stranded mothers and children off the public-charity rolls . For the comparatively few cases in which stubborn husbands are sent to jail , an arrangement has been made with the prison authorities whereby the men are put to work and their pay is sent to the Friend of the Court , who turns it over to their wives and children . The collection window is a sight to see . Some of the men make their payments by mail in the form of checks or money orders , but most of them line up weekly at the window on the tenth floor of an office building in downtown Detroit . The window and the cage in back of it are exactly like those in some banks and most finance companies , even to the grilles . Most of the men have by now become trained to announce themselves by the number of their account rather than by name when they arrive at the window . A girl teller takes each man 's money , speedily finds his card , runs it through a machine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he same time supplies a receipt . The majority of the men have come to accept this setup good-naturedly or at least resignedly . But there is one character who has Kunz , who is in immediate charge of the setup , scratching his head . The man is definitely in contempt of court . He refuses to come in once a week and pay exactly the stipulated sum . Instead , he drops in every day , and whatever change he happens to have in his pockets he slaps down at the collection window . It may be sixty-one cents , it may be $2.99 . This unorthodox procedure upsets the bookkeeping system and gives the business machines indigestion . The man 's whole attitude is extremely contemptuous every time he shows up , but since his fluctuating daily payments average out equivalent to the weekly support order , it is debatable whether he can or should officially be cited for contempt of court . The workings of this setup do not halt at Wayne County 's borders or even at the state line . The Friend of the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moynihan 's theory the jurisdiction which grants the divorce remains responsible for seeing to it that the father supports the children , even if neither the father , mother or children remain in that area . As a result , that setup is now collecting support money and sending it to divorced mothers in every one of the forty-eight states and the District of Columbia , and in almost every country of the world , including little Iceland . To wives and children now in countries behind the Iron Curtain , it sends the equivalent in CARE packages or in various ways tries to make sure that the cash is not confiscated . The clients , as Pokorny likes to refer to them , include disillusioned warbrides ; wives and children left behind in other states and foreign countries by men who came to work in Detroit and then , under the legal theory that a man 's place of domicile is his home and his wife should be there , got divorces on the ground of desertion ; and wives who took their children back to the homeland after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still residents of Wayne County . That county was the first , as far as Judge Moynihan , Pokorny or this writer has been able to determine , to adopt that system . Two other jurisdictions are currently experimenting with adaptations of it . If copied everywhere , it would at least reduce the financial suffering of children of divorce . But , except in so far as it might make a few men decide to stay married when they learned they could n't evade their responsibilities by divorce , even its originators do n't pretend that it strikes at the roots of the divorce plague . The children of divorce suffer even when no financial difficulties are involved and there is no overt bitterness . In one of Doctor Goode 's cases there was a seven-year-old boy who tried the best he knew how to solve the problem . It was one of those divorces in which both sides believed in " being adult about it . " They had agreed that there were to he no scenes when the ex-husband came to see the boy ; that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep him from pain over the breakup . How much a small boy that age really understands is hard for a grownup to discern . In most outward aspects he seemed to take the situation in his stride , as if he did n't comprehend what divorce meant . But often when his father came to see him on Sundays and played games with him , he suddenly would stop and say , " Mummy , why do n't you come and play too ' ? " And to his father , " It 's more fun with three , huh , daddy ? " One Sunday the father arrived unshaven because he had overslept . The ex-wife gave him permission to use the bathroom , and the boy followed to watch him shave . The father cut himself slightly , and the mother came in to find an antiseptic for him . As she stood beside her ex-husband , hunting in the medicine cabinet , the boy tried to push them together . " Gee , mummy , " he said . " Gee , daddy . You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he remained an orphan of divorce ; that he failed to solve a problem which his father and mother did n't have sense enough to solve ; and in which the courts  --  and society  --  had failed too .
