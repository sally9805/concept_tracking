Is it not at least possible that the men who arrested the leaders of the Hungarian revolution while negotiating an armistice with them and who executed them despite a promise of safe conduct are now seeking to apply these same methods to weaken the cohesion of the free world and then to destroy its members piecemeal ? <P> HARVARD University 's tough- minded political scientist and military theorist ( Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy ) , Henry A. Kissinger , raises that question in the current issue of Foreign Affairs as he goes on to raise another : Even though Russian and Western scientists agree that detection of nuclear-test violations is possible , has the U.S. really thought through the implications of the nuclear-test ban that it proposes to offer to Russia at a conference this month ? <P> Kissinger thinks not . He argues that a rush to ban nuclear testing would : <P> Be dangerous for the free world for the simple reason that the West has based its defense on nuclear weapons : " Nowhere in the Western world are there sufficient conventional forces to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing now stands in the way of Soviet domination of Eurasia save the Soviet reluctance to pay the price of a nuclear war . " <P> Be a prelude to a Communist-inspired campaign to prohibit nuclear weapons altogether because " the Soviet Union has systematically sought to paralyze the West 's will " to use those weapons . " In the present state of Western defenses , such a prohibition is tantamount to unilateral disarmament . " <P> Make it harder for the U.S. to get on with the task of arming its NATO allies with nuclear weapons ; without nuclear weapons of its own , a Europe totally dependent for its safety on U.S. retaliatory power " will find it impossible to resist the increasingly bold Soviet threats of nuclear warfare . " <P> Tend to freeze nuclear-weapons technology at the big-warhead stage , keep the U.S. from developing compact , versatile , low-fallout nuclear weapons . To provide a range of choices in between " suicide or surrender , " argues Kissinger , the free world urgently needs , along with more conventional forces , a wide spectrum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the perils of a nuclear-test ban , the U.S. has to bow to the Communist-cultivated worldwide fear of fallout . But instead of a ban on tests , he proposes a restriction on fallout . The West and the Soviet bloc could agree to equal fallout quotas . These quotas could gradually shrink to zero within a specified time , say two years . After that , until a general disarmament program came into effect , nations would be free to go on conducting tests , e.g. , underground or in outer space , as long as there was no detectable fallout . Such an agreement-unlike an agreement to end all tests-would be easy to enforce , since radioactive fallout can be readily detected . <P> If such a plan proved workable , says Kissinger , it might be possible to go on to further disarmament measures . But Soviet leaders , he adds , will never accept genuine disarmament as long as Western irresolution leads them to hope that they can " undermine the will to resist aggression with the only effective weapon now at our disposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
