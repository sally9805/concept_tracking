See Cover : <P> As it is essential to liberty that the Government in general should have a common interest with the people , so it is particularly essential that the lower house of the Congress should have an immediate dependence on and an intimate sympathy with the people . So the author of The Federalist wrote of the U.S. House of Representatives- and so , in that same spirit , to five United Auto Workers ' pickets huddled around a fire outside a Buick Motor plant in Flint , Mich , last week , came a small , balding man with a cracker-barrel voice : " Hi , fellows . I 'm Chuck Chamberlain , your Congressman . I brought you some matches in case this fire runs out . " <P> Charles Ernest Chamberlain , 41 , Republican Representative from Michigan 's Sixth District , began handing out red-white-and-blue matchbooks bearing his name , his photograph , and a key word : " Re-elect . " One of the pickets turned his back , growling : " We do n't need you around here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Hey , " said he , " we need two sides to everything , do n't we ? Is n't that the American way ? Gee , I used to work in the plants myself . I know something about your problems . " Cried the hostile picket : " You do n't know anything . All Republicans are lousy , and your President is the worst goddam one of the bunch . " Demanded a second picket : " Why are you coming around here ? " " That , " replied Chamberlain , " is the way our Constitution is drawn . We go out politicking every two years , and if you do n't like us you can kick us out . " " Do n't worry , " snapped the second picket , " we will . " <P> Coming Closer . Campaigner Chamberlain kept at it . " That 's your privilege , " he said . " But if I am elected I will still welcome your criticism . I do n't want you to write and tell me I 'm a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I welcome . There 's plenty of room for differences of opinion . As long as I am Congressman . I represent all the people in the district-those who like me and those who do n't like me . " <P> Somehow , somewhere , Chamberlain hit a responsive chord . A third picket spoke up hesitantly . " I think you 're O.K. , " said he . " I like your approach . " Campaigner Chamberlain moved into the warmth of the fire , rubbed his chilled hands . " Thanks , " he said quietly . " Now if your buddies will stop heckling me for a minute , there is one thing I 'd like to say : the Government is a lot closer to you than you think . Maybe you do n't like me , but every two years you have your chance to put in the man you want . And believe me , that keeps the Government very , very close to what you want it to be . That 's good . That is the way it should be . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
