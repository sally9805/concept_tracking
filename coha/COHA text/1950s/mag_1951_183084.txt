Walter E. Schott , 50 , is a Cincinnati businessman who likes to collect companies . Fortnight ago he called reporters and announced : " We 've just bought the Bunell Machine &; Tool Co. of Cleveland for $1,750,000 . " Next day Schott called reporters again . This time he had paid $1,000,000 for the Novo Engine Co. of Lansing , Mich . This week , Schott 's speculative eye was already on a new prospect . By such hustling and sharp buying , Schott has put together a family holding company with enterprises worth an estimated $20 million and controlling some 26 companies spread over the U.S. and Canada . <P> A typical Schott deal was his purchase late in 1949 of the Royal Vacuum Cleaner Co. for $2,000,000 . By vigorously pushing low-priced lines and reorganizing distribution , he increased monthly sales from $500,000 to $1,000,000 , paid back the $600,000 he had borrowed from the bank in five months . He has his own rule for financing a new business : clean up the bank debt by the end of a year with profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was still in high school at Cincinnati , Walter Schott got some horse-trader 's advice from his father , a cattleman : " Be a salesman , always a salesman . Even if you 're buying , be a salesman . " Schott never forgot the advice . At 18 he hustled off to Richmond , Ind . with his 15-year-old bride , got a job as an auto salesman . <P> Four months later he persuaded a bank to lend him $10,000 to go into the auto sales business himself . In a short time he hit on the idea of buying new cars at reduced prices at the end of the year just when the models were about to change , and selling them well under list prices . Before long his salesmen and brash advertisements were covering the Midwest . <P> <P> By 1938 , he was Ohio 's biggest auto dealer , with a large stock interest in Willys-Overland . <P> But he was n't satisfied . An investment company which Schott had formed earlier with his wife and a brother bought Cincinnati 's J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $700,000 . Fay &; Egan was in poor shape because of overexpansion , but by cutting down and changing the management , the new owner soon had it on its feet . From then on , Schott 's investment company began picking up companies and real estate . In ten years he gathered up more than 18 new businesses , including Whale Harbor Spa ( a Florida fishing resort ) , Columbia Axle Co. , U.S. Air Compressor Co. , Stratbury Manufacturing Co. ( overcoats ) , Farm Tools , Inc . <P> " We 're Fascinated . " Schott insists on getting full control of any company he buys into . Once , in 1941 , he joined a group dickering to buy New York 's Belmont Plaza Hotel . Schott thinks that it was for lack of control that he took a $100,000 loss when the deal went sour . When he knows he can get control , he moves fast . His method : " Do n't jump until you have something to jump for , then jump with all your might . " <P> To run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supervision with his four brothers , has no intention of stopping collecting . Says he : " At first it was family security . But suddenly we gained momentum and we started to roll . Now we 're fascinated . We expect to keep traveling. "
