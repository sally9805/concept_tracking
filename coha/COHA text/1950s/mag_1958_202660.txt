After three weeks , TIME Correspondent James Bell returned to beleaguered Quemoy last week : <P> <P> SUMMER had broken , and the slim cedars along Quemoy 's roadways bent before the first buffeting gusts of autumn . In the fields , the silver , feathery heads of mao-tsao , a grain used for fuel and fodder , swayed like the plumes of medieval knights . At night the moon was almost full , and the pearl and coral-colored bluffs loomed like phantoms above the beaches , pounded by a foamy sea . In other times it was the loveliest of seasons , it was the loveliest of sights . But this year autumn on Quemoy was a nightmare . <P> In three weeks a quarter of a million rounds of Communist artillery fire had raked the island . Roads were slashed up . Entire rows of cedar trees were blasted away . Quemoy City , scarcely scathed when I left , bared its broken windows . Fewer civilians , more soldiers padded through the streets , and the cheerful horde of children was gone . Parents keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused at the sight of long-nosed foreigners , now pass quickly and silently . Since Aug. 23 , Red shells have killed 65 civilians on Quemoy , wounded at least 200 others . Military casualties exceed 1,000 . <P> Underground Village . At Kuning-tou , on the northwest tip of the island , I found a village of 2,000 people virtually deserted . Three weeks ago the streets were full of children , pigs , chickens and ducks . Now the pigs snort angrily in their concrete pens , the chickens scatter hysterically at the slightest noise , but the villagers are gone from dawn to darkness in search of safer places . <P> The harvest season is at hand , but there are no farmers in the fields . Two hours before we arrived , a hunk of shrapnel had blown the head off 40-year-old Li Wen-pi as he tried to lead his horse to safety . Even in the late afternoon , when no shells were falling , Kuning-tou 's deep , dank underground shelter was crowded . The Communists are calculating their artillery fire to harass Quemoy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any crossroads is an unhealthy place to pause . <P> Strewn Shore . Liaolo Beach , where the convoys come when they can , was pockmarked with shell holes . At one end a battered LSM , its back broken by Communist artillery , lay dead in the shallow water . With bluffs above eroded by wind and shellfire , the area looked like a valley of the moon . You feel appallingly naked as you drive along this lonely shore-watched by the tense eyes of Nationalist soldiers dug into their caves and by Communist eyes , natural and radar , on the mainland only a few miles away . There is no cover here . <P> Scattered over the pitted landscape are white , blue and red parachutes from the latest airdrop . Cases of food and medical supplies are strewn about uncollected by the island 's defenders . Amphibious tracked landing vehicles ( LVTs ) piled high with oil drums still have not been unloaded , 48 hours after their arrival .                 @ @ @ @
