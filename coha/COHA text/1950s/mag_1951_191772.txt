It was a great week for Ramon Magsaysay ( rhymes with fog-sigh-sigh ) , Defense Secretary of the Philippines . <P> Last month , Magsaysay alerted all military installations at Manila , on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Communist-led Huk organization . Magsaysay was sure that the Huks would try to celebrate by an attack . Magsaysay s men caught 40 Huks as they stole into town to try to free six members of the Philippine Communist Party 's politburo who had been captured last fall . He put the 40 in jail , sent the six politburocrats on a cruise in Manila Bay , where they would be safely out of reach of any more rescuers , and where , he said bitingly , " they can fish in peace . " But while Magsaysay was busy in Manila , the Huks struck elsewhere . <P> Liquidation Week . Some 50 Huks descended on an isolated dairy farm near Antipolo , 20 miles from Manila , killed the American owners , John Hardie and his wife Irene , and their Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A force of 150 of them , dressed in stolen army uniforms and riding in army trucks , swooped down on Candaba , 48 miles north of Manila , seized the army post sacked the town , and shot 13 antiCommunists . Three days later , several hundred Huks attacked the busy Acoje chromite mines in mountainous Zambales province ( where Magsaysay was born ) , killed six civilians and burned a million pesos ' worth of property . <P> At his headquarters , Magsaysay pounded the table so hard that the ashtray bounced , and barked orders : " Put more men in and around Manila . I want every suspicious person searched , and every suspicious house raided . Get every soldier in the provinces alerted . Keep pounding on all known Huk lairs . Burn the Huks out of Candaba swamps . There are 8,000 Huks in the country . That makes five Huks to each one of our platoons . Let us make this week the liquidation week ! " <P> The Man Behind the Battle . For the next few days , the Huks did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them steadily all over Luzon . In the Sierra Madre , the troops caught up with the Huk band that had murdered the Hardies , killed 20 . The army fell far short of Magsaysay 's quota of five Huks to every platoon ( it claimed a total of 300 Huks killed last week ) , but the Huks were beaten back . March 29 , the Huk anniversary , proved to be one of the most peaceful days the Philippines had known in years . Even bitter critics of the government agreed that Magsaysay was doing a first-rate job . Said one : " He is not all mouth , after all . He gets results . " <P> Magsaysay first started getting results during the Japanese occupation , when he organized a guerrilla force of 12,000 strong , in the mountains where he was born . Says he : " It was no joke , living in those jungles . I had to take care of myself , not only against the Japs but against my own men . For a few Japanese pesos , any one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like men , and shared everything I had with them . As a result , they treated me like a man , too . "
