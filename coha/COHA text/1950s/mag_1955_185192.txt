At the check point between East and West Berlin , the blue Ford sedan of Danish Newspaperman Henrik Bonde-Henriksen was too well known to draw the special attention of the Communist police . Seated beside him as he drove through one evening last week was a man puffing furiously at a pipe , his hat pulled down over his eyes . The guard waved them on . Otto John , onetime head of West Germany 's counter-espionage organization , was on his way back to the West . <P> At a critical moment in the EDC debate 17 months earlier , John had stunned the West by defecting to the Communists . Later , at an East Berlin press conference , he had charged that the Nazis were taking over the West German Republic , and accused the U.S. of creating a " hysterical fear psychosis . " John had given no sign that he was under duress . Said a newsman : " Not a single person who attended the conference left with any doubt that his defection was voluntary . " <P> Ten Years After . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was laboring under some kind of perverted patriotism or pique . In 1944 John had been a member of the famous Von Stauffenberg conspiracy to kill Hitler . When the plot failed , John 's brother was shot ; John himself fled to England . Many Germans regarded John as a traitor for joining the British when Germany was fighting for her life . The U.S. and West German intelligence agencies did not trust him . Largely at British insistence , he got the secret-service job . <P> In West Berlin , on the tenth anniversary of the attempt on Hitler 's life , John met with a bunch of his old " resistance " pals to celebrate . Later that night he had taken a taxi to the house of Dr. Wolfgang ( " Wowo " ) Wohlgemuth , an old friend-as well as a suspected Communist . Together they had been seen driving into East Berlin . <P> Tell , Tell , Tell . After surrendering himself to the West German police last week , John was held in close custody , but Correspondent Bonde-Henriksen had a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that he had visited Wowo that night to " get some support for a widow of an executed anti-Nazi underground leader , " and had been persuaded to go to his other flat in West Berlin ... " I woke up two days later in Karlshorst Russian army headquarters . A female doctor was sitting at my bedside and ... I got one injection and later on another , and I did n't feel clear in my mind . . . Right after the conference with the world press , I was flown to Moscow and was held in custody for two weeks . They kept asking me questions all the time ... I did n't betray any secrets , but of course I had to tell , to tell , to tell . . I have never been very good at remembering names , and in that I was very lucky . " <P> In Bonn ( where there is a treason charge standing against him ) , Otto John 's story of drugged kidnaping and clever fencing with the MVD interrogators was deemed altogether too romantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his defection , had found the loss to Western intelligence less than expected . Strictly concerned with operations inside West Germany , he had had few intelligence secrets to tell the Russians . His propaganda value exhausted , the Communists had given him less and less to do , plainly showing that they also distrusted traitors .
