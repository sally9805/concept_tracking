After a performance in Boston 's Symphony Hall some years ago , an excited dowager swept backstage to the conductor 's dressing room . " Maestro ! " she cried . " Maestro , you play so magnificently ! You - you are God ! " Serge Koussevitzky turned to his fan and , with a perfect deadpan , replied humbly : " Yes , modom , and soch a responsibility . " <P> Last week Russian-born Serge Alexandrovich Koussevitzky was dead , at 76 , of a cerebral hemorrhage . No one could deny that his responsibility , although self-imposed , had been well carried out ; he had made a phenomenal contribution to world music in general , to American music in particular . <P> A Great Dream . At 17 , " Koussy " left his home town of Vyshny-Volochek to study the bass fiddle in Moscow . Soon he was playing with the Imperial Opera orchestra , toured on the side for ten years as a soloist . Not content with his specialized fame as the world 's greatest virtuoso performer on the double bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1909 , already rich* and respected , he went back to Russia to head the Imperial Music Society 's concerts in St. Petersburg . His reputation as a conductor spread throughout Russia , but in 1920 he fled to Paris ( " I left Russia because of Lenin and Trotsky ; I had a million dollars , and they took it from me " ) . <P> Meanwhile , the Boston Symphony which had risen under Dr. Karl Muck , had been floundering badly since the war years . Pierre Monteux made great progress in whipping the orchestra into shape again , but before the 1924 season the Boston 's trustees decided to make another change , and sent the call to Koussevitzky . From Paris he sent word : " I will present in Boston music never heard before . " <P> Thus began the fulfillment of Serge Koussevitzky 's great dream . Composers in both Europe and the U.S. soon learned that in Boston , if nowhere else , their music could get a sympathetic hearing . Nearly every program Koussy scheduled included pieces by such contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and such Americans as Aaron Copland , Roy Harris , Walter Piston , Howard Hanson , William Schuman and Samuel Barber . <P> The dream grew . In 1936 Koussy and the orchestra began playing concerts at the Berkshire summer symphonic festivals . Four years later , he became head of Tanglewood 's Berkshire Music Center . At Tanglewood , students and laymen came each year to play , to listen and to learn . There they also could see their benevolent chief , wearing his favorite tweed cape , strolling along the lanes and chattering in his broken English . <P> A Perfect Gem . In 1949 , tired and grey , Koussy turned his baton over to Charles Munch . In 25 years , he had brought to U.S. ears more contemporary music than anyone else in history . His Koussevitzky Music Foundation had commissioned works from such giants as Bartok and Britten . His dream was realized .
