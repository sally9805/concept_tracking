After four weeks of flexing its muscles at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House , the Royal Ballet ( formerly known as Sadler 's Wells ) moved out to begin a four-month coast-to-coast tour . Along with its new name , the company brought five ballets previously unknown to U.S. audiences-including some of the most gaudily packaged merchandise it had ever displayed . <P> Most satisfying of the new items were Birthday Offering by Veteran Frederick Ashton and Solitaire by Kenneth MacMillan . Ashton whipped out his piece last year in honor of the company 's 25th anniversary ; it proved to be a sequined , dazzling showpiece for 14 soloists , and a convincing demonstration of the kind of high-caliber reserve talent the Royal Ballet can call on when it needs to . Margot Fonteyn 's enchainement ( linked movements ) looked as poised and effortless as everybody expected ; there was also some lithe , beautifully filigreed dancing by Rowena Jackson , Nadia Nerina , Svetlana Beriosova . Solitaire , a less panoplied affair , unfolded the story of a girl who does not belong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anya Linden , in the lead , expressed her loneliness in a series of crabbed progressions that contrasted harshly and movingly with the tossing gusto of the other dancers . <P> Two of the other new ballets-Ashton 's La Pri and MacMillan 's Noctambules-failed despite inspired and startling flashes of choreographic brilliance . The most ballyhooed premiere of all was Prince of the Pagodas ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) by John Cranko , with music by Benjamin Britten ( his first ballet score ) . Choreographer Cranko 's splintered story had in it recurrent themes from Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast , plus snatches of court intrigue reminiscent of King Lear viewed through the wrong end of the telescope . The stage was roiled by gaudy dancers , the sets were feverish with color , but despite all that the ballet did not get across its tale of a rejected princess ( Ballerina Beriosova ) and a prince who has been transformed into a salamander , Composer Britten 's dry , percussive , deftly syncopated score never provided the needed emotional lift . <P> All in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of the soloists if not for the imagination of the choreographers . But as always , the company was at its best in the familiar pageantesque fairy-tale fare-Swan Lake , Sleeping Beauty-and in a revised and turbulent Petrouchka . Fonteyn &; Co. still moved with a cool and stately charm unmatched by any other ballet group seen in the U.S. That seems to be more than enough for U.S. audiences ; half a million people who will see the Royal Ballet during its present tour have already bought more than a million dollars ' worth of tickets .
