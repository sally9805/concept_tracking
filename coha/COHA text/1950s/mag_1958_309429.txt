Tipplers who headed for any of the 17 Whisky Gogo ( Whisky Galore ) bars in Paris and on the Riviera last week found themselves locked out . On the doors were big red , white and blue signs that read cryptically : " Temporary protest shutdown . Scotch remains English . Champagne must remain French . " <P> The Whisky Gogo lockout , which Director Paul Pacini promises will continue indefinitely , was prompted by a new British court decision allowing a Spanish wine company to describe its inexpensive bubbly product as " Spanish champagne . " The French reaction was choleric , for France feels so strongly about its right to the champagne name and label that one clause of the 1919 Versailles Treaty ( which ended World War I ) protected French champagne from German imitation . <P> Twenty thousand bottles of the Spanish champagne , headed by rail for the Christmas market in Britain , were turned back at the French border . Jacques d'Argent of the Champagne Growers Syndicate in Paris thundered that " there is only one champagne in the world just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if Britain did not mend its ways , " we might very well subsidize a French whisky company to sell its produce abroad cheaply . " When it was remarked that the U.S. has long marketed " New York State champagne , " and Burgundies grown in California , Wine Expert Andr Simon snapped in London , " In America all sorts of things happen that do n't happen here . " <P> London newsmen thought the whole French fuss a joke . But in Paris it was no laughing matter . While Whisky Gogo bars stayed locked up , Harry 's New York Bar in Paris took a more popular method of showing its contempt for the British decision : double Scotches were sold for the price of singles . The French Barmen 's Association was " contemplating action to defend France 's reputation . " It did not help to explain that for years the British have been buying South African sherry and Australian port without an outcry from Iberian winegrowers . Said a Parisian barman coldly : " The Spaniards and Portuguese have been foolish to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
