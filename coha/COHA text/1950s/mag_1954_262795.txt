On Page One , the Providence Evening Bulletin last week ran a story with an arch note of warning . " A motorist from Cranston R.I. , " said the story 's lead , " sheepishly swears this story is true-but even if it is n't , a newspaper would have to be pretty selfish not to pass it along as he tells it . " The story was that a motorist , who refused to identify himself , was driving along Connecticut 's Merritt Parkway when his car stalled . He flagged a passing car , asked the woman driving it to give him a push . Since his own car had an automatic transmission , he explained : " You 'll have to get up to 30 to 35 miles an hour in order to get me started . " The woman nodded and backed up as the man climbed into his car . The man waited for the push . When it failed to come immediately , he looked behind him and saw the woman 's car bearing down on him-at 35 miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the Bulletin story appeared , it was picked up by the Associated Press , reprinted in papers all over the U.S. , retold with relish on radio and over a thousand dinner tables . The Bulletin was flooded with long-distance calls from other papers asking for more details . Checking with state police , the Bulletin quickly found out that the story was not true . It had been printed lightheartedly the day before by a Boston columnist , was probably read by a prankster , who phoned it into the Bulletin as straight news . But Bulletin Managing Editor Mike Ogden had no regrets . Said he : " My own feeling is that if a story can be as funny as this , the A.P . ought to go in for this sort of thing more often-always , of course , with due printed safeguards .
