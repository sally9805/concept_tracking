txt Monsanto Chemical Company , as its name implies , is primarily a manufacturer of basic chemicals for industry . But now it looks as if it 's got to make washing powder for housewives , whether it wants to or not . It seems that not making something can also lead to trouble with the law . A few years ago Monsanto chemists developed what they thought was a particularly good detergent , and because it seemed like a good idea at the time Monsanto started making and marketing it under the " All " tradename . Later the company decided it ought to stick to its last and get out of the soap business . So it sold " All " to Lever Brothers . But this week the Justice Department said , " Sorry , no can do . " It filed a suit in Federal District court to make Lever Brothers turn " All " back to Monsanto . The reason given for the suit is that Lever Brothers , by acquiring this washing powder , automatically increased its share of the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All " Lever Brothers would still have nowhere near all of the market . Four-fifths or more of the market would remain in the hands of some pretty fierce competitors for the housewife 's trade . This suit , if successful , is going to leave Monsanto with a puzzler . If they ca n't sell to Lever Brothers , to whom can they sell it ? If Procter and Gamble , or Colgate , or sonic other detergent company takes it over they will also automatically increase their share of the business too . Apparently Monsanto ca n't even give it away without running the recipient afoul the antitrust laws . Under this doctrine Monsanto 's only choice seems to be to liquidate and write off its losses or to stay in the dish-washing business willy-nilly . The moral , we suppose , is to think twice before making anything . Once you start , the Government may make it hard to stop .
