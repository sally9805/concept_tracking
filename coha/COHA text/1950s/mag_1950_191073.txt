False pregnancy has sometimes been a subject for jest , but to doctors , who call it pseudocyesis , it is no laughing matter . Many general practitioners and some specialists have been fooled by women who seemed to be in labor but proved to be not even a little bit pregnant . <P> Three doctors at Philadelphia 's Jefferson Medical College Hospital report in the current issue of Philadelphia Medicine on a study of 27 cases of false pregnancy - the longest such series in medical annals . Some false pregnancies , said Drs . Paul H. Fried , Abraham E. Rakoff and Robert R. Schopbach , had lasted only four months , some as long as 14 months . Some patients had had them two , three or even four times . <P> The symptoms included partial or total lack of menstruation , abdominal enlargements , breast changes ( enlargement , milklike secretions , darkening around the nipples ) , and 22 of the 27 patients reported that they had felt the stirrings of life . Nine had been diagnosed as pregnant by 16 doctors ; heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in labor . " <P> False pregnancy , said the doctors , is mental in origin . All their patients had become overanxious , and said it was because they had tried in vain to conceive . Some had wanted a child to secure a husband 's wavering affections or to prove themselves as " complete women . " Usually their background included insecurity and tension , as well as frustration , and sometimes even a need for punishment . Thus beset , the mind took refuge in " pregnancy " which the body simulated . <P> Since all such patients firmly believe themselves pregnant , it does no good simply to tell them that they are not , said Dr. Fried and his colleagues . A woman with pseudocyesis will go shopping for another doctor to confirm her pregnancy , or her symptoms will soon recur . A careful explanation with a little psychiatric treatment does the trick , said the doctors . Four of their patients , infertile for two to seven years , later became really pregnant .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
