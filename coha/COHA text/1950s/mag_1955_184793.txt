NINE RIVERS FROM JORDAN ( 496 pp. ) - Denis Johnston-Little , Brown ( $5 ) . <P> One summer night in 1942 , as Britain 's Eighth Army reeled back on Cairo under the hammer blows of Rommel 's Panzers , a devil-may-care Irishman employed by the BBC as a war correspondent padded out to the Pyramids on the back of a weary camel . In the far distance , the Tommies sang without a care , <P> O they 've shifted father 's grave <P> To build a sewer . . . <P> while in the lee of the Great Pyramid , a bearded dragoman told the Irishman 's fortune : " Here in your hand I see nine rivers that you must cross . . . When you have reached the last river , you will . . . find what you have been looking for . " <P> Nine Rivers from Jordan is the strange and tempestuous tale of how Irishman Denis Johnston , war correspondent and scholar , maverick and mystic , fulfilled the dragoman 's prophecy in three years of bitter fighting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Danube . Half-diary and half-confession , it is a story of one man 's war , but with this difference : where others wrote of battles with an end in view-victory-Johnston was an outsider , an Irish will-o ' - the- wisp who happened in on the holocaust not caring-at first-who won . <P> Murder &; Common Sense . His first river was the Jordan , symbol of the Palestine campaign . There , with Bible in hand , Johnston set out to find an answer to the question which he never really answers : What is the meaning of war ? His second river was the " once deified and permanently sewage-laden Mother Nile . " He saw the defeat of the Afrika Korps and recorded in harrowing detail " this confusing mixture of rascality and gallantry , of bloody murder and of common sense , of intolerable grimness and of surprising joviality " that was the desert war . When the R.A.F. bombed a port in Tunisia , Johnston went along . And so " the BBC made its first triumphal recording of a member of a bomber crew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bell it came over the intercom : ' Here come the obscenity obscenities , ' " meaning German fighters . <P> The third river was the Sangro , in Italy . Johnston reports a hilltop debate with a priest about faith and heresy . Then , as in a nervous movie , he shifts the scene to a shattered village where hysterical Italians watched a British private thumping out Moonlight Becomes You on a piano in the smoking ruins . Near by , a Gurkha battalion had established its GHQ without bothering to check for snipers in the upper room . A British officer sent his aide to inspect the attic , and when the Gurkha returned , Johnston recorded this conversation : <P> " There were 15 of them up there , sir . " <P> " Good God ! Did they show fight ? " <P> " No , sir . " <P> " Surrender ? " <P> " No , sir . " <P> " Well , what happened ? " <P> " I shot them , sir . " <P> " What ? All of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there . In battalion headquarters , too . "
