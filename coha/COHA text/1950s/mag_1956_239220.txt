Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> With more than a wisp of misgiving , millionaire ex-Bricklayer John B. Kelly and his wife Margaret , parents of Monaco 's Princess ( High Society ) Grace , settled uneasily into theater seats for the Philadelphia opening of a new musical , Happy Hunting . The show , attended by scads of the Kellys ' neighboring Mainliners , was a benefit performance for Mrs. Kelly 's charity , Philadelphia 's Woman 's Medical College . Soon , while others there tittered nervously , Jack and Margaret Kelly learned the worst : Happy Hunting not only satirized the wedding of Grace and Prince Rainier , but also used everybody 's real names and even called Monaco Monaco . One ditty in the show , starring Ethel Merman , gaily spoofed " social climbers , wisenheimers " and informed listening Mainliners that they are " snooty snobs . " Grace 's sister Lizanne made her exit before the first-act curtain- " to get home to the baby-sitter . " Thunderous applause burst out when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellys are nice people . " Rainier and Grace had fortunately missed the show , preferring to stay in Maryland with friends , as the Princess 's mother coolly explained their absence . When the long evening was over , Mrs. Kelly summed up her distaste for its theme : " Something so precious and sacred should not be exploited for profit . " <P> Mum on palace discords back home in The Netherlands ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) , Prince Bernhard , seeming to be enjoying every moment of his bachelor vacation away from Queen Juliana , concentrated on donning a life preserver at Jacksonville . Fla . An able airman and best-known jet pilot among Europe 's royalty , Bernhard then flew off to the aircraft carrier Forrestal for an informal two-day fling with the U.S. 's Atlantic Fleet . <P> Between drafty exposures at an airy London nightspot , Minnesota-born Stripper Lili St. Cyr cited another visitor to Britain , Cinemorsel Marilyn Monroe , as an unchic example of how not to dress when not in professional dishabille . Strange as it seems , Lili deplored Marilyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would dress better . I do n't think it 's nice to show too much . It 's embarrassing for one 's escort . " <P> The prexy of Manhattan 's Barnard College , Mrs. Millicent C. Mclntosh , presented a citation to one of her opposite numbers from the Orient , minute Mrs. Kaoru Hatoyama , wife of Japan 's Premier and head of Kyoritsu Women 's College . Kaoru Hatoyama was on her way home from Moscow , where her ailing husband got crumbs from the Kremlin table in signing a decade-delayed peace treaty with the Russians . <P> During a rehearsal of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London , Britain 's trigger-tempered maestro , Sir Thomas Beecham , an irascible 77 , soothed himself by trying to make music on a sheng , an old wind that few modern Chinese blow good . The cluster of fluty pipes had been presented to Beecham , himself no mean player of the piano and trombone , by touring orchestra members of Red China 's Variety Theater.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
