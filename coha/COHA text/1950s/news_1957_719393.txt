txt The chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce believes that the current slack in business " is likely to be at least as severe " as the recessions of 1949 and 1954 , but that recovery may start before 1958 ends . Dr. Emerson P. Schmidt , the chamfer 's director of economic research , gave his views at the close of a panel discussion on the business outlook . Fourteen business spokesmen gave substantially less pessimistic  --  some even optimistic ? forecasts . A common . opinion was that business activity would continue to contract , or at least would not expand , in the first half of the corning year . There was expectation , or hope , that things would improve in the second half , Doubts ' Major Collapse ' Dr. Schmidt 's estimate of the severity of this recession was not only more pessimistic than any of the panelists ' , but also more pessimistic than most current predictions . He said , however , that " the basic forces making for economic expansion in the long run are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any major collapse . " The normal increase , of unemployment in winter , lay-offs in manufacturing and other industries , and the growth of the labor force " can easily add up to four or five million , or even more , unemployed , " he said . Unemployment in November was 3,188,000 : He also took note of declining new orders to manufacturers , probable reduction of inventories , and the reduction in business spending for plant and equipment . As for plus factors , he said Federal spending , despite the missile program , was " not likely to rise very much in the next six months , but probably will rise in the second half " of 1958. // He also said that the authoritative predictions of a 5 per cent rise in the dollar volume of construction next year " could be on the high side . " The construction industry 's representative on the panel estimated a 4 per cent increase . Dr. Schmidt said that a chamber survey of trade associations had found that 16 per cent of them expected business in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first half of this year , and 40 per cent thought the second half of 1958 would be better than the second half of 1957 . Some Are Optimistic The non-pessimism of the panel might be explained in part by the particular industries that were represented . Among them were electronics ( half of its business is military ) , chemicals ( a leading growth industry ) , food stores ( pinning their expectations on rising population and incomes ) , construction ( the highway program is getting bigger every year ) and finance ( declining interest rates bring expectation of more lending ) . Talk of prices among the panelists was almost all upward , though perhaps more moderate than recently . This might seem paradoxical in the face of the expectations of nonexpanding business activity . It is natural , however , for business not to talk of softening prices any sooner than necessary . Those panelists who defended the maintenance of the current price level said that rising labor and materials costs barred price cuts . The panelists were officials at 115,000,000 to ' 116,000,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . A representative of the National Automobile Dealers Association said new automobile sales next year would rise to 6,100,000 or 6,200,000 against 6,000,000 plus this year . An economist for the Nati6nal Association of Home Builders expected 1,000,000 housing starts in the new year , or approximately the same as in the old . Rise in Loans Seen National Savings and Loan ' League said starts would rise to 1,075,000 next year , and that mortgage interest rates would follow the downward trend of general rates after several months . Those two men and the spokesman for the Associated General Contractors of America note4 particularly the prospects of increased apartment building . Perhaps the most pessimistic of the panel members was the economist of the Association of American Railroads , who said freight traffic next year would be off 5 per cent from 1957 and 9 per cent from 1956 . A representative of-the National Foreign Trade Council forecast a 5 per cent drop in exports and a smaller drop in imports .                 @ @ @ @
