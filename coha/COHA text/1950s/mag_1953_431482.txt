 | For years I had heard the name " Basil O'Connor . " It conjured up an image of a tall graying institution ? something like the Bank of England in a philanthropic mood . And perhaps that 's a perfectly good image for a man who has given most of his life fighting the enemy , polio , that has robbed and crippled so many of us and those we love . It just happens to be a highly inaccurate picture of a thoroughly delightful , if amazing , man . The gentleman is slight , well under six feet tall , and looks a good ten years younger than his officially recorded sixty-one . He 's the man you 'd love to find next to you at a dinner party but never do . He has wit . charm , force , intellect ? and a terror of being considered sentimental . Maybe it is the Gael in him that makes him lean over backward to prove that all he 's done for mankind is an accident , the result of a series of events over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a dear friend of his dearest friend ( that closest friend from whom he never would accept the slightest political favor or position ) would say . " Let 's look at the record . " Basil O'Connor was a newsboy at fen , earned his way through Dartmouth by playing the violin , and after Harvard Law School began his highly successful career as a lawyer . Of his sixty-one years , twenty-nine have been largely devoted to helping human beings . He has probably raised more money for charitable purposes than any volunteer in history . Over $800.000,000 has been raised by organizations under his leadership . He has been president of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis since its founding in 1938. president of the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation , and president of the American National Red Cross from 1944 to 1949 . From none of these groups has he ever accepted a cent of salary . And this is the man who clings to his statement " I more or less fell ' into philanthropy " ! Helen Hayes , in her tribute to Basil O'Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of this determined and brilliant man . " With most people , good  | causes are an avocation ? something in which they are honestly interested but to which they devote , usually , only their spare time . The fight against polio never has been like that for Basil O'Connor . To him this kind of work is his whole life . Even before Fate ironically brought polio into his own family in 1950 , when his elder daughter was attacked , he was dedicated to assuaging the sorrow of those among whom this terrible disease appeared . He gave his time and effort unselfishly . He did not make room for voluntary service in his life ; he adjusted his life so that there would be room for other things besides voluntary service . He always has done this . He will go on doing it until the end . " SO MUCH for the record . It does seem only fair to hear O'Connor 's own explanation of his lifetime of service . In the mid-twenties , two lawyers with some previous legal experience hung out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were friends as well as partners , and so it was inevitable that O'Connor should go south with Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Warm Springs , Georgia , in 1924 . Roosevelt had many loving and devoted friends and relatives . But " Doc , " as O'Connor was called , had a combination to offer that no one else could . He was only ten years younger than F.D.R. ; he could talk business , while others gave pity and inspiration ; he was close enough to sympathize , remote and extrovert enough to be matter-of-fact . In O'Connor 's own words , " I was n't a bit interested in Warm Springs , polio , or public health . Franklin Roosevelt was my partner and friend , so inevitably I met the Springs and polio . At no time did I ever intend to do good ' or choose to ' serve society . ' In 1928 when Mr. Roosevelt was tlected governor of New York State , he Mold me in a matter-of-fact way that he as too busy to go on helping to raise Money for Warm Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful ) and I was to take on that personal ' task . - My decision ' had no more emotional significance than taking over several file folders of unfinished business for a colleague who had embarked on a new project that would keep him overly busy . From that time until 1938 I approached the problems of money raising for Warm Springs and outpatient care in a day-today business way . I ca n't tell you , or anyone else , of any date when it was decided more was needed than Warm Springs . " Just as any businessman makes decisions as a result of a series of experiences that add up to a need for over-all planning , so I gradually realized the need for the new foundation . Polio was a national problem involving millions of people , when you count both patients and their relatives . Polio is an economic problem , presenting expenses of care , treatment , rehabilitation , far beyond the individual family 's ability to pay . Polio is - and I soon hope to be able to say , was -a public-health problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polio is a phase of the nation 's business ? and for adequate fund raising to provide care and research , it reuired a business setup that was nation-wide . " Mr. O'Connor created that business setup , and if his own words are to be believed , he did it with emotional detachment and rigorous business rules . Certainly the structure of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis reflects these two approaches . A careful balance between laymen , who control the financial and organizational setup , and scientists , who control all research and medical areas , has resulted in harmony of aims , methods , and achievements . Each group has its own area ; there is no conflict .  | The magnificent record of 230,000 patients cared for , 1,000 hospitals admitting polio victims , 3,100 chapters , and now the possibility of a preventive for polio , all testify to the soundness of the business approach ? which includes allocation of funds for advertising and education . But Basil O'Connor , a man who apologizes for his " lack of modesty , " is either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivates him . Were he a Quaker rather than a Roman Catholic , he might say , " I feel a deep concern for people . " His average working day is sixteen hours . " I grew up when work was the normal condition of man , " he says . His average yearly travel schedule covers over one hundred thousand miles . " Local groups must see and know the head of their organization . " The organizations he works for are far too numerous to list , but his life has included thousands and thousands of hours freely given not only to polio but to revitalizing a wartime Red Cross , aiding Tuskegee Institute , and raising funds and rousing interest in scholarships and libraries . " If you call on others to help you , you must in turn help them . " IN JUNE of 1952 this man whose normal condition of life is work was stricken with a heart attack . For three months he abided by every rule , however severe , of the attending doctors , giving an injured heart outlet a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to his regular schedule to launch the 1953 March of Dimes ? a schedule that includes almost incessant public appearances and speeches , and the organizational direction of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis . In December 1952 his heart specialists gave him a good bill of health . I saw him after his recovery . Poor health and the vigorous man I talked with seemed far apart , but knowing of his illness and having worked with him in small measure in his latest drive , I commented on and questioned the wisdom of a schedule that would exhaust any man of twenty-five . " I am not foolhardy . I like living . But it seems to me we place too much emphasis on how long we live , not how well we live . " O'Connor insisted he was referring to physical well-being . I would like , at this respectable distance , to contradict the **34;694;TOOLONG . In a world grown strangely bold in admitting its baser motives , Basil O'Connor is quite unable to state his nobler ones . He has given twenty-nine years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best " ? to the betterment of his fellow man . That he has found this so enriching , that he feels he has been the beneficiary , merely tells a little more about him . It is all too clear that he is quite ready to give the rest of his years , many or few , on a full-time basis . It is just as clear that he is quite unable to fall out of the habit of loving his neighbor a bit more than himself .
