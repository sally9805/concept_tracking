 | a spree . It might have been fun , even exhilarating , but like the children with the mud hut , it was time to go home . Her feelings were strengthened by the scene that she encountered in her mother-in-law 's dark , faintly Turkish interior . Genevieve , her long white fingers on the handle of a pitcher of martinis , had been listening with evident sympathy to her indignant son . " Ann , Ann , " she wailed as the latter came in , " what things he 's been telling me ! That vulgar , terrible Mr. Emlen . The idea of Timmy having to apologize to him ! Have a drink , dear ? " There was always a contrast between Genevieve 's languorous air and her sudden efficiency about the ingredients of a cocktail . She poured straight from the bottle like a bartender , leaving no balance over to waste itself in ice . " Of course , the Colts would n't have even known the Emlens two generations ago ! And this Mr. Emlen 's mother , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got her money out of a jewelry store ! " Ann saw Timmy 's filial , almost fatuous smile , noted his empty glass and thought with a sinking heart of the power of mothers . How , in spite of all the hundred ways that Genevieve had failed him , he still cared for her approval . Oh , her disapproval he ignored , yes , as when he had married , but it was Genevieve 's rare enthusiasm that still brought that complacent smile to his lips . As she looked about the room with its tawdry evocation of a past that had never existed , its photographs of possible cousins on horses , the water-color copy of what might have been a grandmother 's portrait , she felt that the alliance of its occupant was the ultimate proof , if proof was still needed , that she and Timmy had lost their heads . " I was wondering , " she said finally . " Is there anything actually wrong about apologizing for bad manners ? " Timmy looked up at her sharply . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's not a question of manners , " he retorted . " It 's a simple question of honesty . "  | " It 's even more than that , " Genevieve intervened , waving her cigarette holder at Ann in languid reproach . " It 's a question of survival . Of not being trampled underfoot by a crew of vulgarians who think they can buy even a Colt with their filthy money ! " " Oh , Genevieve , do n't be dramatic , " Ann snapped at her . " We wo n't get anywhere that way . " " Sure , " Timmy snorted as his mother lapsed into hurt silence . " Decency can always be laughed out of court . Who dares be called dramatic ? " " Timmy ! " Ann straightened up . " Surely you think I 'm decent ? " " Oh , you are where you 're concerned , " he conceded impatiently . " Like most women you 're entirely moral where your own home is involved . But what the breadwinner does in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? Not so important , of course . Not quite real , I suspect ? " Ann drew back before the glitter in his eyes . " Timmy , what do you mean ? " " What do I mean ? " he exclaimed , taking a step towards her . " I wo n't go on with it , that 's what I mean . I 'm going to quit the firm , that 's what I mean . " Ann , gazing down at the rug to conceal her sudden tears , thought dully of the years . that had gone into getting where they were . The endless nights of- the telephone calls to say he would n't be home for supper , until midnight , at all . The short vacations interrupted by Mr. Knox 's apologetic but inevitable remands . The long gossips with office couples , so radiant with the future implicit in them , about the partners , the cases , the ultimate goal . And this was to have been for nothing . For nothing . She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're crazy , Timmy , " she said quietly . " You 're simply crazy , that 's all . " " Then I 'm crazy . So be it . " She closed her lips tightly . It was out of the question to appeal on the grounds of his own career . The more he gave up , the higher would leap the flames of his martyrdom .  | " I ca n't see why you 're taking on so , Ann , " Genevieve intervened , this time in a sulky tone . " It is n't as if Sheffield , Knox was the only firm in town . Do you suppose for a minute Timmy could n't get a job at twice what he 's paid now ? " " Of course , I know that ! " Ann turned abruptly away from her . Genevieve 's mournful face was too dangerously provoking . " But other firms are n't the same thing . We know what this one means to Timmy . " " You 'll see what it means to me , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She raised her hands suddenly to her eyes . She did n't dare look at him . " Timmy , " she said in a low voice , " if I ever had any credit with you , I want to draw on it now . Please do this for me . Please apologize to George . " He was staring at her , hard and straight . " Have you gone crazy ? " " Timmy , I mean it . You told me once that if there was ever anything I really wanted you to do , that mattered to me more than anything in the world , to ask you and you 'd do it for me . I 'm asking you now . " " Ann , you 're not making sense ! " Genevieve exclaimed . " That 's not the sort of thing one asks a husband ! " But Ann and Timmy alike ignored her , their eyes fixed on each other . " It 's true I told you that , Ann , " he said quietly . " And I meant it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been willing to do that . But I also told you something else . I told you there were certain things you 'd much better leave to me . Do you remember that ? " She nodded without speaking . " I say this is one of them , " he continued . " Do you still want me to apologize ? " " I do . " She was barely audible now . " Very well . " He nodded gravely . " I will do what you want . There 'll be no question about that . I 'll do what you want , and I 'll do it handsomely . But you will have assumed responsibility for what happens afterwards . You will have altered the direction of our lives . " Again she nodded .  | " Then I think we 're ready to go out for dinner , " he said , turning to his mother . " We wo n't mention this tiresome subject again . " For the rest of the evening , at the restaurant , Timmy and his mother chatted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard him be more amusing or more informative , but unlike him or Genevieve she was incapable of acting . When they got home she had supposed that he would go to bed without speaking to her . Instead he sat up over another drink and talked about general topics with a sustained artificiality that made her wonder , in the long wakeful hours that followed , how insignificant this day would appear , according to Mrs. Knox 's prediction , in any number of months or years to come .  | TIMMY sat alone in his office the next morning with his door inhospitably shut . Such was not the custom in Sheffield , Knox , but it was the only way to avoid solicitous questioning , even at the cost of seeming to dramatize what he now thought of as his " disgrace . " In the carefully matter-of-fact faces that he encountered at the drinking fountain , in the considerate but not unfriendly silence of his telephone , in the anxious smile of the old librarian , he could read sympathy for his predicament . Word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prairie fire to the remotest corners of the firm . " I'iiuniy was a popular figure , except with one or two of the younger associates whom he might have driven too hard , but there was still the undeniable element of excitement in anyone 's fall from an altitude . The crowd that had watched his slow climb with craned necks and staring eyes might be sorry to see the slip , the loss of foothold ; they might gasp , raising their hands to their lips in horror , but it was too much to expect them to look away . Now he contemplated with still , seething anger the bitterness of his new resolve . It had been his premise since childhood that if one worked till one dropped ? and this , indeed , seemed a condition of being , his being , anyway ? there was still a recompense . Or at least a reason . One owed nothing and deferred to no one , murky God or visible man . They might be overseers of the task , but that was all . Oneself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap enough .  | He had paid his world the compliment of taking it seriously , of assuming a degree of conviction behind its pompous premises . He had believed that it believed in the validity of the independent soul . And where did he find himself ? An object of ridicule . Very well . He could n't fight them both , Knox and Ann . They barred his way ; they held out their hands imploringly and called him to come back . And could n't he even detect in the scarcely articulate bray of their appeal , a note of entreaty , a plea to him not to shake the foundations of their world , a hint that neither might really quite survive his refusal to admit that he had been crazy ? He laughed aloud , with a rather magnificent sneer , at this manifestation of the sand beneath their houses . He 'd like to hear either of them say just one word against Sherry Dale in the future . Just one word ! When Larry , whom he had made his sole confidant , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want to know something ? " he demanded . " Do you want to know how low a man can sink ? Well , look at me ! I 'm going to apologize ! I 'm going to eat crow . I 'm going to put on a hair shirt and stand outside Dale 's gate in the snow , like that German emperor at Canossa . Except it wo n't be snow . It 'll be mud . I 'm going to roll in mud ! " Larry 's round young eyes were wide , a dumb Horatio to a soliloquizing Hamlet . " And what 's more , you 're going with me ! " " Me ! " Larry protested . " Why do I have to apologize ? " " I do n't want you to apologize . I want you to be a witness . I want you to be able to tell your father-in-law that I groveled . I want him to know how literally I 've obeyed his orders ! " If he had asked Larry to be his best man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , Timmy . You can count on me , boy . " He paused and shook his head ruefully . " But he wo n't make it easy for you . Not Dale . " Timmy gave a little mocking snort . " That 's where you do n't know him . He 's going to make it all too easy . Easy as hell . We do n't even have to go to Emlen 's office . He 's coming over here ! "  | When Dale 's secretary called to say that Mr. Emlen had arrived , Timmy jumped up and hurried down to Dale 's office , followed by Larry . In line with his prediction , Dale did not keep them waiting even a minute . He rested back in his chair as they came in and looked from one to the other with a dry , quizzical little smile . George was leaning against the window sill , smoking a cigarette , with a bored , embarrassed look . Larry , standing behind Timmy , was as stiff as a cadet . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . " I 've brought Mr. Duane because I want him to be able to tell Mr. Knox . " Dale dipped his great head as he bit his pipe . He sucked at the flame carefully for a few moments and then rolled one eye up at Timmy . " I think apologies are better when seated , " he said in a level tone . " I suggest that you both sit down . And let 's be specific . What exactly is it that you wish to apologize for ? " Timmy felt his breath short as he sat down , his hands on his knees . " I want to apologize to Mr. Emlen for speaking as I did the other night , " he stated in clipped tones . " It was entirely inexcusable . I should quite understand if he never wanted me to work for him again . " Here he turned formally to George . " I can promise you , however , Mr. Emlen , that nothing like that will ever happen again . " George flushed and turned around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fella , " he muttered . " Forget it . Too much has been made of the damn thing already . " Dale snapped open his lighter and applied the flame once more to the stubborn ashes in his pipe . Yet Timmy had no feeling that it was a gesture in any , way connected with dramatic suspense . He might have done it , like anything else , in the same way alone . " If that 's a promise , it 's good enough for me , " he said , shutting up his lighter again . " The practice of law can be confusing to a young man , I know . A lot of things look mighty raw until you grow up and discover it 's a raw world . " " I appreciate that now , sir . "  | Dale shot him another of those penetrating glances , to be sure , perhaps , that he was sincere . " All right , " he grunted . " I think now we may excuse Mr. Duane . " " I 'll be running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily . " As far as I 'm concerned , the whole thing 's a dead duck . Next deal I get , I 'll ask for Timmy . Okay , boy ? " " Thank you , George , " Timmy said in the same flat voice . " That 's very handsome of you . " There was an awkward pause until George , with a brief wave of his arm and a nod , left the room , followed by Larry . Timmy was about to follow , but Dale called him back . " I want to ask you something , " he said and motioned him to close the door . " I want to know how 'd you feel , " he continued after hesitating for several rather ponderous moments , his hand on his jaw and his eyes fixed on Timmy , " about staying on and working in my department ? " " You mean you still want me in your department , sir ? " Timmy asked , in some surprise . " After what 's happened ? " Dale put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , folding his big hands on the blotter and giving him his level stare . " I 'll be frank with you . There 's a place for you with me . A big place . Of course , you 're going to be made a partner in the firm . You know that . " He held up his hand to silence any protests . " Obviously you know it , or you would n't have come here to apologize . But that 's not the point . The point is , what sort of a partner ? And the answer to that is where 's your biggest chance ? Let 's leave out litigation and real estate . You do n't want them . Now look at the number of partners who do corporate work and the number in my department . I have five to their ten , and who ? Amory who 's about to retire , Landon who was never worth the powder to blow him up with , Russell and Hyatt who are simply good , competent , average men . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have your experience . And think . We bring in forty per cent of the fees of the whole damn firm ! The despised estates and trusts that I built out of nothing ! One quarter of the partners and forty per cent of the income !  | Think that one over , Timothy Colt , before you go scampering back to Knox and his happy slaves . " Timmy was startled at the almost careless way that he spoke of the relative capabilities of his partners . " You 'd want me to do estates work ? " " I 'd want you to know how to do it , " Dale said with a shrug . " I do n't want to make a specialist of you . You 're too much that way already . No , my idea , Tim , is that you 'd be my right-hand man . Help me in everything . Help me with clients . Help me with policy . With planning . Do n't worry about trust accountings and all the paperwork in this field . Hell , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . They 'll probably be doing it when they die . I want a first-class man for the big stuff . And do n't worry . You 'll go places with me , boy . Further than you 'll ever go with old Knox . What does he do for the men who work for him , do you think , besides give them ulcers ? But I 'd give you clients . Clients of your own ! The minute you 're a member of the firm I 'd start turning them over to you . And they 'd be your clients , too , boy . Do n't fool yourself . Sherry Dale 's no Indian giver . The proof is that I 've got more than I can handle . " " It 's certainly an interesting proposition , sir . " " It 's more than interesting , " Dale retorted . " It 'll make you . And there 's another thing . Between you and me and the lamppost Mr. Sheffield is going on eighty-eight and Mr. Stevens is hardly compos . All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these days ? All right . Just think it over , my boy . Just think it over . " " Thank you , Mr. Dale , " Timmy answered , getting up . He was not so dazzled as to forget how to play his cards . With Knox one could n't lose by seeming overeager . With Dale it might be just the opposite . " I will certainly think it over . In the meanwhile , I take it , sir , you want me to finish up any loose ends on the Emlen deal ? " " Just as before , my boy . " Dale waved the hand holding the pipe in a genial arch . " It 's as if nothing at all had happened . " As Timmy retraced his steps down the corridor , he felt a  | conflict between excitement and anticlimax . Was this how it would come , the partnership for which he had waited so long ? Not with Henry Knox glancing at him over his spectacles and then rising to clasp his hand , wringing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear Timmy , you do n't know how pleased I am , " not with his slipping unobtrusively into the empty seat at the end of the table at the partners ' Monday lunch , awed and self-consciously quiet at the prospect of his inclusion in such a circle , not with returning to an almost hysterical Ann and going out to drink champagne and toast the future . No , none of that . Simply with Dale tossing it over to him as if it was nothing but a visa , a form to be filled out , mechanical , a touch boring perhaps , but something that was required of all who took the grand tour under the auspices of Sherry Dale . He paused as he passed Knox 's door , and a surge of bitterness swept over him . He found Knox alone , reading ; the latter looked up and gave him a rather weary smile . " Well , Timmy ? " Timmy walked up and stood before his desk . " I 've done your job , " he said shortly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you 're satisfied . " " I 'm proud of you , Tim , " Knox said gravely . " If that means anything to you now . Which I assume it does n't . " " Good ! I get a gold star ! " Timmy 's tone was bitter . " Except I should have got it long ago . Maybe I 'm stupid . On the other hand , maybe I was badly taught . " " In what ? " " In what the practice of law was meant to be . " His voice , faintly mocking , rose in pitch . " You taught me that we were the men who greased the wheels of finance and business . That our contribution to the general welfare was direct and creative . That it was our glory to have worked out the relationship between government and industry ! Oh , we were something ! " His voice rose to a sneer . " We were the architects of society ! " " All this I 've said , " Knox agreed . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his  | voice tense with emotion . " All during the war I never wavered in my desire to come back and work for you . It did n't matter to me that society was disintegrating so long as I was not on the side of the disintegrators . So long as 1 was constructive . For several years you gave me that sense . Of having my own little smithy in a crazy world . It was all I needed . " " No matter how crazy the world ? " " Well , it was n't that crazy , " Timmy replied . " Or at least I thought it was n't . " " I see , " Knox nodded . " Go on . " " And then you assigned me to the lower regions . The real world . " Timmy turned away to the window . " You watched my apprenticeship with equanimity . " " Yes . " " You wanted me to make my peace with the devil . Well , I 've made it ! You wo n't catch me making an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm staying with him ! " Knox thought of all the things that he could say that he had said before . The element of compromise , the impossibility , in any profession , of wholly dispensing with it . The danger , above all , of taking oneself too seriously in a complex world . But the words , limp and inert as his state of mind , refused to take articulate shape . For Timmy was as logical and consistent as he had wanted to make him , as logical and consistent as he had once wanted to make himself . Timmy had actually been the lawyer that he had visualized himself as being . The lawyer who did n't really exist . Because he could n't exist . Not in their firm . Or in their world . God only knew where and how far he would go now , but could he tell him that he was wrong ? " All right , Timmy , " he said at last . " I accept your rebuke . " Timmy stood at the window , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that all , sir ? " " You wanted a scene perhaps ? " Knox asked wearily . " You wo n't get one . You 're quite right , you know . I have led you astray . Oh , there are things I could say in my defense , yes . But how to make you see them ? " Timmy turned around , almost pleading . " See what , sir ? "  | " That you 're a damn fool , " Knox said with a shrug . " To look to me . Even to look to Dale . To give a hoot in hell what anyone thinks but yourself . But , well ? what 's the use ? We 'll talk about it another time . Maybe . If either of us should want to . " He shrugged and turned his chair away . " But leave me be now . Thanks , Tim . " Timmy paused , undecided . When Knox , however , failed to speak to him , he turned and left . It was later that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn , Knox 's elderly secretary , finally found him in a corner of the library . She wore a rather distracted look on her thin grey features . " Oh , Mr. Colt ! " she exclaimed . " There you are . I 've been trying to locate you for half an hour . He 's gone home . I 'm afraid he 's not well . " " Not well ? " Timmy stood up . " What 's the matter ? " " I 'm afraid it 's his heart again . " He could see that she was really concerned . Her eyes roamed from side to side . " I called Mrs. Knox , and she said to tell him to take a taxi . He promised me he would , but you know how he is . That 's why I tried to get you . To see that he did . He 's so proud , you know . And the men his age all cling to the subway . As if it was a proof of something ! " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a cab . Maybe it 's not as bad as you think . He seemed fine this morning . " " Oh , I do n't know , Mr. Colt , I do n't know . " There were tears in her eyes now , large , tremulous , anxious tears . " He looked so pale . And he 's so stubborn , you know . One ca n't make him do anything . Not him . I 'd have felt so much better if you 'd been with him ! " " We 'll call the house after a bit , " he reassured her . " I 'm sure he got there all right . Do n't fret , Miss Glenn . " She nodded gratefully , happy to have someone to take over , to share , even in the smallest way , her anxiety , and Timmy , watching her go , discovered with an unpleasant surprise that he was actually angry with Knox for having already stolen his little scene .  | HE SPENT an almost sleepless night after the day of his scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ann at supper , knowing in his heart that she would only think it worse than he did ; he had warded off her inquiries into his moodiness with monosyllabic rejections , letting her conclude , not unnaturally , that it was an after-effect of his apology to Dale . It was not until the early hours of the morning , as he lay beside her sleeping figure , staring up at the pale slant of refracted street light across the ceiling and thinking of his words to Knox , those bitter words , bumping gently against the plaster like foolish little red balloons , that his muscles relaxed , and he faced the simple fact that his state of mind was unbearable . He had been willing to pay dearly for his pride , but not a price like this . He would go to Knox in the morning and ask to be taken back to his old work . He would tell his story frankly and apologize frankly . And already he felt a glow in his chest at the prospect of hearing the half-checked rumbling cough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only idiots are consistent ? Good . I was just about to give you up . " They would be friends again , better friends , if anything , for the rift . It was idiotic , he told himself , not to realize how often clocks could be turned back . And he fell asleep at last , exhausted but resolved . When he woke up he had to think for a moment what day it was . Ann was not there . " Ann ! " he called . Walter appeared in the doorway . " What time is it ? "  | " Half past nine , Daddy . " " Past nine ! Holy cats , why did n't someone wake me ? " " Because it 's Saturday . Mummy said you were to sleep . " " Sleep ! " He hurried into the living room and sat down by the telephone . With one hand on the instrument and the other scratching his head , he slowly recalled the Knoxes ' number . Then he dialed it . The line was busy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of the day or night ; in fact , it was even reassuring , for hearing the sharp , insistently repeated tone , he knew they had not gone to the country . When he tried the number again , however , and then a third and fourth time , he began to fear it was out of order . It would seem about to ring , and then the busy signal would suddenly clash again in his ear , all the louder for his moment of anticipation . On a final try , however , the number answered immediately , as if someone was sitting right by the receiver . But it was not Mrs. Knox 's voice . It was like hers , but higher , dryer , melancholy . " Is this Mrs. Knox 's house ? " he asked . " Yes . This is her sister , Mrs. Herbert . " " Oh . Could I speak with her ? It 's Timothy Colt . " He would speak to her first , he decided , and find the opportune moment for his visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The voice was even sadder now , but ladylike , executive . " I 'm sure you 'll understand . Can I take the message ? " Timmy felt rebuffed and was about to say , no , there was no message , when a hideous fear suddenly broke in on him . " Has anything happened ? " " Oh , you had n't heard ? " The voice softened , prepared to discharge its message of sympathy . " My poor brother-in-law passed away last night . At home , just as he was sitting down to dinner . It was his heart , you know . Mercifully , it was all over very quickly . In a matter of minutes . " " Mr. Knox ! " " It 's been a terrible shock , I need n't say . But my sister is  | wonderful . The children are all here . I 'll give her your sympathy ? Mr. Colt , is it ? " " Yes , " Timmy murmured . " Yes , oh yes . Please do . " He dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further details , unable , in his sudden weakness , to feel that it was anything but an imposition to hold her on the line . He got up and walked blindly across the room , collapsing at his desk , striking at the blotter with his fist and repeating again and again to himself : " Here is only me and the blotter and the desk , and not Knox , not Knox or death . " Desperately , like a man trying to ward off a slashing blade , he dodged and turned in the dark cavity of his mind to escape the realization . But surging all around him , it engulfed him , and he could only wonder , dazed , how it was possible for anything to hurt so savagely that was only breath , communicated by a woman whom he did n't even know in a distant part of the city . He had n't seen him dead , had he ? And then slowly at first , soon faster , mocking his question , the pictures began to slide across his mind , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , large and light and oddly immobile , frozen vacation scenes and remembered attitudes : Knox after tennis , perspiring , calling loudly for a whiskey and water , Knox reading Leacock to his daughters by the lake in Vermont , Knox coming out of the Securities and Exchange Commission , a hand on Timmy 's shoulder , laughing his regret at not having taken his advice . And he knew the ugly one at the bottom of the box , the last to come , and knew he could n't stand it , must ward it off , that otherwise he would be sucked down forever in the mire of self-hate . Ann came out of the kitchen and put the coffeepot on the table . " Who were you talking to ? " When he failed to answer she turned around and took in his expression . " Timmy , what 's happened ? " " He 's dead . " " Who 's dead ? " He looked up at her blankly . " Knox , of course . " She gave a little cry . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . " He nodded . " His heart , you know . " And he suddenly felt his shoulders trembling helplessly and knew that he was sobbing . " Oh , my poor darling . I 'm so sorry . " She stood there , looking at him helplessly , miserably , and George and Walter appeared , very grave and curious , at the kitchen door to contemplate the phenomenon of a weeping father . It was Walter finally who went over and took him by the hand . " Please , Daddy . Please do n't . " And then George was crying , too . Timmy got up suddenly and walked towards his room . " I 'll get dressed , " he said in a muffled tone . " I 've got to go out . " " Timmy , have some coffee ! " " I do n't want to have anything , " he said curtly . " I 've got to be alone !

" He started and almost hurried off , but it was Larry . " Have you just been in ? She 's wonderful , is n't she ? " Larry was radiantly grave with a new black tie . " Yes . I mean no . I decided I would n't . There 'd be too many people . " " Oh , come on , Tim . " Larry put an arm around his shoulders . " You 're one of the family . Nobody 's going to miss him more than you .

" Mr. Dale wants to see you right away , " the receptionist told him . When he came into Dale 's office , the latter rose and walked over to him . He even put a hand on his shoulder . " I know what this must mean to you , Tim . " Timmy only stared at him . " Sit down , my boy . Sit down . You 've lost a great friend , and I 've lost a great colleague . Henry Knox saved this firm .

" " Dale ! What does he have to do with it ? " " He simply happens to be the senior partner now , " he said wearily . " A man like Knox does n't belong only to his family . He 's a public figure . " " You 're talking like Dale already ! " she cried . " Darling , do n't ! " " Please , Ann , " he said , rubbing his brow . " Ca n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timmy , what is it ? " She came over and sat beside him on the couch , putting a hand on his knee . " I 've never seen you quite this way . So ? so defeated . I know how you loved Mr. Knox , darling , but is n't there something else ? Had you quarreled ? What happened ? " He closed his eyes . " Ann , I beg of you . Leave me be . " " Darling , I ca n't ! " There was a note almost of panic in het voice . " You had a fight ? " " Yes ! " He jumped up to get away from her . " We had a fight ! " he almost shouted . " I said brutal things ! Horrible things ! Are you satisfied ? " She shook her head sadly , looking down at the spot where he had been sitting . " He did n't mind , of course . But you 'll never believe that . Not now . Never in a million years . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the work that Dale had given him with a nervous fury , obliterating himself in details . Meeting with Larry and the other sons-in-law he went over the long obituary column for the newspapers . They found nothing to change . From there they progressed to the seating at the church , the arrangement of cars to the cemetery , the notices for the service , the telegrams to the older clients . Everyone deferred to him ; almost embarrassingly , they acknowledged his special relationship . If he felt a fraud , if he heard Knox 's quizzical , mocking laugh in his ears , he could turn to the file on his desk and tear at papers . For Knox was dead . He had to learn that . Behind the muted bustle of the funeral . preparations he could sense already in the atmosphere of the firm the bewildered , shocked question : " Where do we go from here ? " Dale , long organized for this  | moment , had taken over the running of things without arousing a protest . Small wonder , Timmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted a muffled Mark Antony to bury Caesar . His worst moment was at the house with Mrs. Knox . It seemed full of her sisters , tall , large-boned women in black with misty eyes , rustlingly silent , being " wonderful . " Mrs. Knox , the calmest of all , stood with him in a corner of the living room . " He loved you , Timmy , " she said . " You know that , do n't you ? " He could only hang his head , unable to bear those still , clear eyes . " I hope everything is all right between you and Ann ? " " Oh , yes , " he muttered . " Quite all right . " " Because all she wants is your best good , " she continued , as if interceding . " You 'll try to remember that , wo n't you ? " He nodded . " You 've been such a help about the arrangements . I do n't think 1 'd have permitted a large funeral if you had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , Timmy . I wonder if we wo n't be harder people without Harry . " " Please , Mrs. Knox , " he murmured , and then someone else came up to speak to her . Preparations seemed to overwhelm him right up to the moment of the service itself , on Monday afternoon , when he stood in a mourning coat by the doors of the grey somber church on Madison Avenue , its dark-wooded , empty-pewed atmosphere almost garish with banks of flowers , to act as one of sixteen ushers . And suddenly he wanted to stand alone in a corner of the church and watch the casket from a distance ; he was suddenly anguished at the way his jumbled preoccupations had stood between him and the thoughts that he must think . But there was to be no pause even now ; through the open doors and under the canvas awning the people were coming in , and the ushers , detaching themselves suddenly like fighter planes swooping , moved off down the nave followed by slow huddling little groups of mourners . Timmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward mechanically to escort an old lady who murmured in his ear how great was their loss . Walking back up the aisle with the organ 's Bach thundering in his ears , past the black-veiled sisters of Mrs. Knox , with bent heads , past the rows of grey and bald heads of the Bar Association committees , the judges , the Orders and Societies , past the pews of awed young associates and their wives , past the family servants , the office elevator men , the aided of the Legal Aid , he wondered if the bitterness within him would not burst and release his aching soul to find his friend above the pungency of the flowers , above the peal of music , above the perfunctory sincerity of the hundreds of mournful eyes . Someone was at his elbow . " Mrs. Knox and the girls are coming in in a second . I 'm joining the partners in their pew now . I have n't seen Judge Lanahan , but if you spot him , for God 's sake see he goes up front . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him now , arranging his features for a hasty nod of sadness to old Miss Sheffield who was hanging on Larry Duane 's arm . Timmy turned abruptly off and went to the back of the church to stand by himself . He had to wait until his sudden tears had dried . Looking down over the back of all the heads at the coffin and its pall of red roses he wondered if in all his life he would ever get over the bitterness , the agonized bitterness of knowing what his last scene with Henry Knox had been . And burying his face suddenly in his hands he found himself trembling with a passionate anger that his guide and mentor should have so betrayed him , even by dying , so deserted him in his hour of need .  | ONE OF THE first acts of the reorganized firm of Sheffield , Dale &; Stevens was to make Timmy a partner . At the same time he was given a large new office immediately adjoining Dale 's and the best secretary from the stenographers ' pool , a Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale , as the new senior , was no longer in charge merely of estates and trusts ; he was master of the firm now and meant to assert his control in unmistakable fashion . The entire office , he announced to his partners at a Monday lunch , was to be reorganized , and Timmy was to be his first lieutenant in carrying out the task . " The trouble has always been that Henry Knox found administrative problems beneath him , " he confided to Timmy afterwards in his slow , emphatic way . " He despised all that sort of thing . He used to describe us as a group of gentlemen loosely associated by a common enthusiasm for the practice of law . ' Now that may have had an Old World charm , I concede , a flavor of Ephraim Tuft and the roll-top desk , but it just does n't work when you get up to eighty-six lawyers with an overhead of a million a year . Then , like it or not , you 're a big business , and you ought to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get across to the staff , Timmy . Cut out the waste . Every last penny of it . Squawks or no squawks . Do n't worry , I 'll back you up to the hilt ! " Timmy went at his new job with his customary dedication . He even retained a firm of business consultants to make a  | survey of the office to determine the exact amount of waste in each department . The outcry was immediate . Loud were the laments for the passing of the " great old days , " the easy informality of the former regime , so vital , it was claimed , to the truly professional point of view . Shrill were the prognostications that this new reign of machinelike efficiency would obliterate the last vestiges of individual aptitude and daring . But Timmy , wedded to his task , was ruthless . His test was efficiency , pure and simple . Was it necessary for the partners to receive so many hours of accountants ' time for their family affairs ? How many coffee breaks did a stenographer actually require ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch , should it not be cut to an hour ? He did it all well , too well , indeed , but the new severity of his manner reflected the paucity of his inward satisfaction . He had always , like Knox , regarded the office administrator as a goldsmith might have looked on a chimney sweep , and to find himself not only in the latter position but actually in charge of the goldsmiths , seemed curiously ironic , but , like so many other things in this new world of Dale 's , a fact to be accepted . The only thing that he would not do was even to try to persuade himself that he was doing work on the same level as before . On the contrary , he went out of his way to exaggerate the sorry light in which each aspect of his new existence might have appeared to the sorrowing eyes of his late chief . In his determination to face the facts , he lowered the blind on other prospects . The bitter resentment occasioned by the reorganization fell naturally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unwilling to share the odium of his program , elected to take a detached , amused point of view , treating Timmy as if he were engaged in a form of manual labor beneath them . The associates , on the other hand , regarded him with sullen hostility as a turncoat , and Timmy , once so popular , became known in a shockingly brief period as Dale 's hatchet man , a spy on idlers and a catcher of wasters . It was even rumored that he wanted every Lily cup to be used twice . Nor was the  | resentment confined to the lawyers . The older staff employees , once his staunchest friends , now faced his inroads into three decades of habit with angry protests tempered only by concern for their pensions . And Larry made matters worse . As Timmy 's principal assistant he carried out instructions with the devotion of a young hound , delighted to have power even at the cost of popularity , rushing about the office with a zealous efficiency that aroused muttered comparisons to a Hitler youth guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Knox son-in-law , and Larry 's future in the firm ; to the general surprise , was considered to have actually improved by the change of senior partners . Timmy observed with a rather detached curiosity the rapidly widening circle of antagonism around him . Was this the old Timmy , people seemed to be asking , who was always so sympathetic to the younger men and never failed to see that the credit was shared ? Was this the friend of Austin , the man who used to send flowers to the switchboard girls on their birthdays and always played in the spring baseball game with the office boys ? No , he would answer grimly to himself , it was not . That Timmy had lived in a small sunny world under his own control . However hounded by his obsession with duty he had still been free ; he could still brandish the finished product of his labors in the face of the gods and defy them to snatch away his liberty while his craftsmanship was what it was . But Knox had awakened him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't it ? It was better , anyway , to see it that way than to have to admit the searing doubts of what he might have done to Knox . God ! He would close his eyes and shake his head and pray , moving his lips desperately , for relief from the horror of that . Yes , better that Knox 's death should have clanged shut the rattling iron gate on any such speculations , that he should be left alone in the dark that he had asked for . He had little desire to share these new problems with Ann . She herself was too anxious ; he felt in their evenings alone the full brooding weight of her preoccupation .  | " I do n't see how Mr. Dale can put you on a job like this , " she told him . " What does it have to do with your experience ? With your real abilities ? " " He wants me to learn , that 's all , " he answered gruffly . " He wants me to be practical . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it licked he 's going to start me on his own clients . " " You mean rich old ladies and their wills ? " " Well , what if it is ? They pay , do n't they ? It 's all part of the practice . " " You never used to think so . " " There are a lot of things I never used to think . " " Evidently . " She turned away , shaking her head . " I was only a hack before , " he retorted . " A guy on a salary . Now I 'm part of the firm . And with Dale I can become a bigger part . Much bigger . " " Darling , forgive me if I say something , will you ? " He stirred irritably as she fixed her worried , questioning eyes on him . " Will you admit that you 're impressionable ? " " What do you mean ? " " Well , when Mr. Knox was alive , you did rather model yourself on him , did n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impatient at her constant need for admissions . " And you were like him , too , darling , that was the wonderful thing . But if you 're going to model yourself on Mr. Dale , are n't you running the risk of becoming like him ? " " And what 's wrong with Dale ? " " Oh , Timmy , if you 're not going to be serious , we ca n't talk , " she said with sudden sharpness , getting up and walking to the fireplace . " I 'm entirely serious . " " Maybe you are at that , " she said , staring into the grate . " Maybe you really are . But I do n't like it . I do n't like it a bit . I do n't seem to know what 's happening to you these days . What is it , Timmy ? Wo n't you tell me ? " " I 've got a lot on my mind , that 's all , " he said sullenly . " Must something always be happening to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a book and sat  | down by the fireplace . " I suppose not , " she said with an air of ending the discussion . " And I suppose George Emlen was n't so bad , after all . Maybe the trouble 's just in us . It 's a good thing to know , anyway . " He began to wonder if she might not be right . He had moments of a remarkable lethargy when he could hardly answer questions at the office . He would know , when he had the perfect opportunity to utter the encouraging word , that he was not going to utter it , when he wanted to stop for a chat in Austin 's office , that he was going to walk on , that in the evening when Ann was quietly knitting and waiting for him to tell her about his day , he was going to fix his eyes instead on a magazine that he would not be reading . Part of his existence took on a dreamlike quality , as if he were watching himself engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high cliff , unable either to stop or to stop watching himself , so that the unhappy twins , the taker of risks and the compulsive onlooker , seemed locked forever in a helpless union . And then he would try to console himself with the thought that he need not really worry , that the whole thing was a product of his own self-pity , that if worse came to worst he could always beg Ann to forgive him and persuade Austin that their friendship was as strong as ever and reconcile the chief file clerk by buying her an enormous box of candy , as big as the Christmas turkey that Scrooge had bought for the Cratchetts . But could he ? Could he still ? In the middle of the night when he woke up and blinked at the darkness , he would have seizures of near panic at the idea that something more drastic was happening to him , something more out of his own control , that he was simply turning outwardly into the creature he had always really been . Amid such uncertainties he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale had been good to his word and was already breaking him in with some of the choicest , starting with his own sister-in-law , Mrs. Emlen , mother of the very George to whom Timmy had so abjectly apologized.  | He had appointed Timmy as her co-trustee in one of the smaller Emlen trusts . Mrs. Emlen , with her husband 's textile stock , was a widow of some importance in the financial world . To a lesser degree she and her sister , Mrs. Dale , also figured in it as members of the Bertrand family , owners for three generations of a famous jewelry store on Fifth Avenue . She prided herself on her business acumen and liked to feel that she never delegated her powers , even when her co-trustee bought and sold for her . " There 's one basic tip I 'd like to give you , " Dale coached him . " You 'll have to give lip service to the widely spread fallacy that in this country it 's the women who run things . Of course it 's not . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , but they do n't . They may have the power , but it 's we men who use it , even when we make them think otherwise . Just the opposite from the way it is in France . That 's your job with Florence . Let her think she 's running the show . " And so his visits started , on Friday afternoons , to the brownstone house on Sixty-fifth Street which wound its discreet way in back through an L-shaped gallery to the " east wing " which was actually another , smaller brownstone facing on Lexington Avenue . It was Timmy 's first experience with the lack of ostentation of the very rich . He would never have suspected , behind that sober facade , the parquet floor of the exquisite Adam hall , the stifled luxuriant green of the small conservatory with its plopping fountain , the grey and gold paneled elegance of the French library . Neither did he suspect at first the sybarite behind the large , soft , rather crinkled whiteness of Mrs. Emlen , whose plump , pretty hands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She assumed , a bit comically , the executive pose ; she pursed her small lips ; she coughed ; she tried to elongate her rounded figure in the Louis XV armchair by the desk , seeking , he was quick to feel , his approval . He found that as well as a lawyer he was expected to be a secretary ; their conversation would veer from the trusts to her children , to infant grandchildren , to bills , to servants , to the summer place and , inevitably , to  | taxes . He was fascinated by the reverence of such a woman for the smallest principles of tax avoidance . " It 's a pity I ca n't give anything more to my daughter Anita this year , " she told him one afternoon with a sigh . " That husband of hers has been so improvident . My George used to say , Mr. Colt , that a beachcomber was really a bargain for a son-in-law . They cost so little . But one who has to be set up in business ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what does poor Anita get out of his wretched business ? Nothing , poor lamb ! " " But you could let her have something , " he suggested , thinking to be helpful . " You 'll have a surplus this year . You could give her some of that . " " But Sheridan says absolutely not ! " Her eyes were round and startled . " I 've used up my exemption for the year . I have to wait till January . Surely you know that ! " " Yes , I know , " Timmy conceded . " But you could still give her something over and above the exemption . There 'd be a small gift tax , but that does n't mean you ca n't make the gift . " " Oh , it 's quite out of the question ! " she cried , shocked . " Sheridan would never allow it ! " He learned not to protest . There were principles in her world , iron-clad , and he had to pick his way carefully at first . He also learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special dignity . One day when she had signed a paper that had to be notarized , he made the mistake of suggesting that she use the notary at her club or bank , or even one in the stationery store at the corner . " But are n't you forgetting that this is no ordinary paper , " she had reminded him , surprised . " This is a document . Had n't we better use a real notary ? One , say , from your office ? " Timmy knew enough now to suppress his smile and to bring up a notary from the firm the following day . When he told this to Ann , however , she did not laugh . " But , Timmy , you 're becoming an absolute sycophant ! " she exclaimed . " I would n't have thought it possible . And in so short a time ! " " I 'm only doing a job . "  | " I suppose I should have seen it , " she went on , shaking her head gloomily . " That same perfectionism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ! What will it do to you ? " Even when he felt uneasily that she might be right about his perfectionism , he still had his reservations about her own lack of curiosity . For was she not rather glorying in middleclass limitations ? Was it so wrong to be amused ? He was frankly fascinated by Mrs. Emlen and her younger , thinner , blonder sister , Mrs. Dale . He thought of them together because they were constantly together , the kind of women who found intimacy only in the easy sympathy , the unresented criticisms , the common presumptions of a sibling relationship . Their joint laps were complacently , indifferently available to the gifts of this world . That the witty should demonstrate their wit to them , the beautiful their beauty , the artist his most finished piece of work , they assumed with the unselfconscious complacency of Goya infantas . Yet this was not from any observed conceit . That anyone should have expected them to be amusing or beautiful or even artistic would have struck them as quite absurd . Nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ; Timmy could never make out that they saw any difference between the fortune that had been partly inherited by the late Mr. Emlen and the money earned by the self-made Dale . Such things were expected of men . It even occurred to him that they felt entitled to the world for the simple reason that they were women . If it was so , then Ann was just the opposite . She seemed to feel entitled to reject it for the same reason . i  | ANN WAS even more concerned about him than he thought . At first , she had supposed that his remoteness was only a mood that would pass away with time , but when she began to identify it with his new line of work at the office , she became more alarmed . Without Mr. Knox to lead him back , could he be led at all ? She even went so far as to discuss the problem with her mother-in-law ? for she could hardly burden Mrs. Knox with the problems that her husband 's death had brought to others ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's simply taking his place in the world , my dear , " she had told her blandly . " It happens to everyone when they move up a peg . High time , too . You 'll get used to it . As a matter of fact , you 've been rather spoiled , you know . Timmy 's never expected anything of you in his office life . Now it 's going to be different . We 'll all have to spruce up a bit . " Ann was perfectly willing , even anxious , to concede all this , but it seemed hardly a necessary part of their new picture that Timmy should be so distant . She would dress up if she had to , go to the opera or polish her French or whatever it was he wanted ; she would do anything in the world , God knew , if she could only feel they were doing it together . But this new abstracted Timmy , this silent , rather brooding Timmy , this Timmy who forgot a promise to take the boys to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their private conversations , that she actually cared about Mrs. Emlen 's taxes , this Timmy who was even beginning to be fussy about  | his clothes , seemed to have changed as suddenly as girls used to change in her school days when they would turn with the passage of a single vacation from the love of Byron to the love of fingernails . She had not known that adults could change so , and when she taxed him with it , for , obsessively , she could not stay off the topic , he would only retort dryly that one could n't stay in the baby 's crib forever . It was at the office Thanksgiving party that she first began to notice how different he was with other people . This was a cocktail affair for all the lawyers and their wives given by Mr. Sheffield in his old grey shabby Parisian house in the east fifties now surrounded by shops . In the atmosphere of rather tawdry splendor , amid faded tapestries and pale Nattier portraits , the young associates and their silent , clinging wives moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners . Timmy , on public view for the first time as one of the latter , was so self-consciously good mannered that she left him in disgust and went over to talk to Austin . " How does it feel to be a partner 's wife ? " " Well , I 'm beginning to feel it 's a position you do n't acquire simply by being a consort , " she confessed . " You have to do it on your own . Timmy 's made the grade , and it seems I have n't . " He smiled briefly . " You must put away childish things , Ann . " " That 's what Timmy says . " " Timmy evidently has found it less difficult . " " Is that what they say in the office ? " she asked , but he simply shrugged . " Is it , Austin ? " , " Well , you know how it is , Ann . With the boys who have n't made it . I would n't worry . Those grapes are apt to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin , " she insisted . " What do they say ? " He shrugged again . " Oh , simply that he has a very short memory . That 's all . " " You mean that it 's gone to his head ? " She paused to re-  | flect . " And yet it has n't , fundamentally . " She could read in Austin 's eyes his polite disagreement . But then Austin , she knew , for all his integrity , his decency , was devoid of subtlety . One had to be subtle , she thought unhappily , to understand these things . She turned from him now as she sensed a movement across the room and saw that Mrs. Knox , in heavy black , had just come in and that there was a respectful converging of older partners around the door . When Ann went over , Mrs. Knox drew her aside and kissed her . " I 'm so happy about Timmy , " she murmured . " I only wish that Harry could have seen him a member of the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to speak to her . Each had the same air of muted solicitude ; there were the same cautious inquiries , the same violent head shakings to signify accord with any response that the widow might make . Ann felt that it was awkward for Mrs. Knox to have to repeat herself so many times before the same witness , but she did not quite know how to break away or where to go if she should , and , besides , there was a certain defiance that made her want to show in public how strongly she still did and always would cling to this mourning symbol of the old regime . " You 're not meant to go to a party like that and sit like a bump on a log , " Timmy reproved her as they walked down the street afterwards . " The partners ' wives are meant to act as hostesses . " " I suppose I should have talked to your Mrs. Dale ! " she retorted angrily . " I suppose I should n't have wasted all that valuable cocktail time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You were n't wasting your time , " he pointed out dryly . " You were wasting hers . Presumably she does n't go out to her first party since her husband 's death in order to talk to you . " Ann was taken aback by this and said nothing . Reflecting on her conduct later she decided that he had been right , that  | she had betrayed only egotism in her behavior . She even went so far as to wonder hopefully if she might not have exaggerated the extent of Timmy 's change of heart , if it might not be her own prejudice against the Dales and Emlens that made her so quick to criticize his least tendency to admire them . She was only too happy to take the blame for their altercations and determined to be more co-operative when they went out in the future . It was unfortunate that the very next time should have been her first dinner party at Mrs. Emlen 's . Mrs. Emlen , it was true , was pleasant enough as she greeted her on the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black lacquered furniture , taking her by the arm , calling her " my dear " and introducing her with apparent solicitude to the people in her vicinity . Yet Ann had an immediate suspicion that this short , dumpy woman , so scarved and beaded , with restless , watery dark eyes , had no sense at all of her as a person , had not really seen her and was only seeking for a place , as if she were an awkward bundle , to set her down . When she had accomplished this , leaving her with her daughter , Mrs. Ferguson , a tall , angular , disagreeable-looking woman , she hurried away while the latter continued talking to her group about a decorator called " David " who was known , apparently , to everyone but Ann . " He 's shocked that I choose my pictures to go with my curtains , " she was saying in a high mocking tone . " Is n't that lovely ? Are n't you shocked , too , Mrs. Colt ? " She paused to give Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose my pictures according to my curtains ! Fancy it ! Does n't it shock you all ? " And she repeated her joke with an almost maniacal insistency , four or five times , exploding in little fits of gasping laughter . Ann was sure that it was best to say nothing , barely even to smile . It was to volunteer at such a juncture that made one look an ass . And happily the conversation went on as if she had not been there , nor was it even noticed when she got up and went over to where Timmy was standing . " You 'll see , " she told him . " They may not talk to me , but  | they 'll never let me talk to you . That 's the one thing they ca n't abide . " She was afraid that he might frown and be cold to her , but when he smiled faintly instead and touched her hand she could not repress an " Oh , Timmy , darling " though she knew he would resist the least show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both looked up as Mrs. Emlen bore down on them . " Good heavens , my dear , you ca n't talk to your husband . That will never do . " She saw the butler in the doorway and nodded . " Anyway , we 're going in now . " At dinner , as she had feared , Ann found herself next to George Emlen . It made it easier , however , when she realized , as she did after only a few minutes of conversation , that the issue of his conduct to Timmy which had fluttered like a dark banner between them simply did not exist for him . That he should have changed Timmy 's whole life and her own was evidently something that he had not even forgotten , that he had never quite realized . As she took this in , as she studied that dry eye , that half-turned plump cheek , that pouting , raised chin , she felt suddenly that it was good for her , good to know that Timmy 's problem had nothing basically to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for her and him alone . Down the table she could hear Timmy 's voice , talking to George 's mother . It pained her that it sounded forced , synthetic . " What a beautiful house this is , " she said to George , trying not to hear Timmy . George shrugged . " You do n't see the bills . I bet Mother 's spent twice what it cost Father to build it . " " But it 's amused her ? " " Amused her ? Maybe . That 's all she and Aunt Clarissa think of . Amusement . " " And that 's so wrong ? " " I think it 's wrong , " he said flatly . " I believe in the English system . Where the widow retires with a becoming dignity to the dower house . " " In India they had a custom called suttee , ' " she pointed  | out . " I understand that it disposed of the widow problem completely . " She was sorry as soon as she had said it , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was talking already to the lady on his other side . After dinner , when she heard the ominous talk of bridge , she managed to slip unnoticed into the empty library where she pulled out a huge illustrated volume of The Idylls of the King and allowed the hypnotic effect of the big , rich print to elbow her gently away from her apprehensions and set her on the dreamy road to Camelot . It must have been an hour later when she looked up with a start and saw Timmy watching her from the doorway . " I must congratulate myself , " he said . " With such a wife there 's no reason I should n't go to the very top of the social ladder ! " She shrugged impatiently and glanced about the room . " Is this where you and Mrs. Emlen work ? " He nodded . " All alone up here ? How she must love it , with you murmuring in her ear how clever she is ! " " She happens to be our hostess , " he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for walking out on the party . " " No thank you ! No more apologies to Emlens ! We 've seen what that leads to . Can we go home now ? " " There 's certainly very little point in our staying . " " Oh , Timmy , do n't be like that ! " she retorted , jumping up . " The world 's not going to come to an end because I 've been reading Tennyson in the library . Do you think we have to say good night or can we just slip away ? " " Of course we have to say good night ! " She brushed past him and went down the stairs to the drawing room and up to the table where George 's mother was playing bridge . " Good night , Mrs. Emlen , " she said firmly . " I 've had a lovely time . " " Oh , there you are , my dear , " her hostess murmured vaguely . " Well , I was so glad to have you . Dear me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalling now that she had not placed her at a table . " Where have you been all evening ? " " In the library , " Ann replied . " Reading your beautiful edition of Tennyson . And having such a good time . I hope you 'll let me come again and look at all those wonderful books ! " She had meant at first to let the sarcasm come out , but when she actually heard her own words and saw the gathering dismay in her hostess 's eyes , she remedied the situation instinctively by raising her tone to a pitch that was too high to be taken for anything but an eccentric sincerity . Mrs. Emlen gave her a weak little smile and turned back to her cards . " I 'm glad you liked them , my dear , " she said with an amiable indifference . " I 'm sure that we 'd all do better to read more . " Timmy said nothing until they were in a taxi , and then asked her , in a tense , dry tone , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Mrs. Emlen ? " " What way ? " But her conscience , for once , was bad . " Did you have to make fun of her ? ' " I was n't making fun of her . I did enjoy seeing those books ! " " You know perfectly well you made her feel she 'd neglected you . You wanted to rub it in . And , God , how you succeeded ! But it might have occurred to you , if you had n't been so dead set on making me pay for taking you there , that it 's just as much your fault as hers . It takes more than the hostess to ruin a party ! " " Then why do you make me go to the foolish things ? " she exclaimed angrily , truly stung at last . " Why ca n't I stay home ? They only want you , anyway . They made that plain enough ! Why do n't you tell them I 'm an invalid ? It would make you so romantic , too . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping out to have a moment 's consolation in the bright , gay world of the Emlens ! " " You 'd love that , would n't you ? " " I ? " She paused , surprised . " Love what ? " " If I went out without you . "  | " Well , just try it , why do n't you ? " she cried . " Just see if I do n't . Do ! " Which , of course , was exactly what he proceeded to do . Only two weeks later he told her at breakfast , with a studied casualness and without looking up from his paper : " Oh , by the way , I have to be out tonight . I 'm dining with Mrs. Emlen . She wanted you , of course , but I remembered our conversation and said you had a cold . " " I 'm sure she was heartbroken . " " As a matter of fact , she told me how sensible you were not to go out with a cold . " " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change her mind . " With this small , wry interchange their discussion ended , nor would Ann have resumed it or asked him a single question about the dinner party for anything in the world . An invitation from Mrs. Ferguson was handled in the same fashion , and Ann , glum but still stubborn , knew in her heart that something serious was now happening to her marriage . There could be arguments by the thousand and silences , bitter , throbbing silences , but to have Timmy leave her twice alone while he went to parties was as different from anything that had gone before as Dale was different from Knox , as the new office from the old . One coasted along with a sense of small continuous bumps until suddenly one , seemingly no bigger than the others , jolted one from the tracks . But how or why remained a mystery . Ann knew that her own stubbornness was a factor , but even in the sudden panic that now gripped her she had the capacity to wonder if it might not be only through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , who the real Timmy was . At the lowest level of disillusionment there was still a surprising space for her reckless curiosity .  | THERE WERE moments , of course , in the office when Timmy 's nostalgia for the old days of his corporate work was almost unbearably keen . If he passed a conference room and saw Austin Cochran with a shirt-sleeved group , intent on printed proofs , he would feel like a sissy , a boy in a Sunday suit who watches his companions on the baseball diamond . But one thing that made this easier as time passed was the number of resignations among associates of his age that followed his own elevation to partnership . There was nothing personal about this ; it was simply that he , of their class , had been selected . The others moved on . In less time than would have seemed possible only Austin was left of the old intimate circle who could still get through to hurt him . Timmy found himself almost wishing that Austin , too , had resigned ; it was obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they had finished discussing a new tax regulation , Austin hovered in the doorway . " When you send for me next , Timmy , " he said in an even tone , " you do n't have to do it through Miss Onderlin . You can call me yourself . You have n't been a partner that long . " Timmy looked up and tried to smile . " Sorry , Austin . It 's so easy , you know , with her right here . I forget . " Austin hesitated a moment and then came back to Timmy 's desk . His dark eyes had a look of sudden concern that somehow bloodened his air of paleness . " Timmy , we 've always been friends . Can I talk to you ? " " Sure . "  | " You and I used to laugh together at the way people behaved right after they 'd made partner . How for a while they were even friendlier to the boys who had n't . To show they were n't stuck-up . And then gradually , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of old cronies . They found they rather liked being sirred ' by the younger men . They became distant . Do you remember all that , Tim ? " " Naturally . " He was careful to sound just the least bit bored . Austin stared down at him with a quizzical coldness . " Well , you certainly have n't made that mistake , " he said with an emphatic snort . " Nobody could accuse you of hypocrisy . The day after you made the grade , you might have been a partner for ten years ! " " That was honest , was n't it ? Not to beat around the bush ? Not to do what you and I used to laugh at ? " " Was it honest , Tim ? " The concern came back into Austin 's eyes . " Was that the way you always really felt ? Could I have been that wrong about you ? " Timmy turned away uncomfortably . " Dale 's honest , too , " Austin continued in a drier tone . " If that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he said to Mr. Hillyers when he made partner ? " " No , " Timmy said impatiently . " And who the hell was Mr. Hillyers ? " " He was an old guy , a sort of retired special partner , who died before you and I came to work here . Apparently he was a sweet old gent , but garrulous , and used to come down to the office to open his mail and then buttonhole the younger men and bend their ears back with stories of the cases he 'd won . But everyone loved him and put up with it . Except , of course , your Mr. Dale . Miss Glenn told me what happened the day he made the grade . She heard it herself . When old Hillyers waddled up to tell one of his usual stories , Dale fixed him with those cold black eyes and said : I do n't have to listen to you now , Mr. Hillyers . I 'm a member of the firm . ' " " Well , why not ? " Timmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for telling it . " Bores can be tyrants . Everyone knows that . Even nice old bores . Hillyers was pulling rank , was n't he ? Why did n't he pick on the older men ? " " You do n't see anything wrong , then , in being mean to an old man like that ? " " Mean ? Dale 's not mean . He 's simply businesslike . " " Maybe you 're right , " Austin continued in a more frigid tone . " Maybe mean is the wrong word . Maybe he 's so warped that he really thinks we 're all like him ! That no one would ever stop for two minutes to listen to an old man unless he was a rung below him ! " " Is that warped ? I wonder if it is n't pretty much the way the world is . Those who can dish it out and those who have to take it . Even dull stories . Getting ahead is a transfer from one class to the other , that 's all . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , had n't you heard ? I do n't have to take it any more ! ' " There was a heavy pause before Austin said : " Meaning you do n't have to take it from me ? " " No , Austin , " Timmy replied evenly . " I do n't mean that . I hope you 're my friend . " " Oh , Dale allows friends , does he ? " " Do n't be an idiot . " " Tim , what 's happened to you ? " Austin demanded in a more heated tone . " Ca n't I help ? Why have you become such a sourball ? " It was still there , the old pull to go back , but it was easier now to slam doors . Indeed , it was becoming a habit . " I 'm not a sourball . I 'm busy , that 's all . " Austin ignored this . " Was it because of Knox 's death ? " Timmy felt a sudden tremor in his shoulders . " I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A job for Dale . It 's not exactly a crime , is it , to save a hundred grand a year in office maintenance ? " " Who said it was ? " " Well , a lot of people seem to think it 's that . Judging from  | the dirty looks I get . There 's no point my trying to be popular . I 've got a job to do , and I 'm going to do it . " Austin stared for a moment and then nodded . " All right , Tim , " he said softly as he turned to go . " Play it that way , if you like . I just wanted to help , that 's all . If help was needed . " The effect of this episode was only to tighten Timmy 's relations with Dale . Being identified with him he naturally sought to defend him , and defenses were not difficult to find . It was increasingly evident , for example , under the studies made , that the office had been extravagantly run in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hundred thousand was actually not unreasonable . And then , of course , the man was undeniably agreeable . He could be moody , casual , above all indifferent , in a shrugging , pipe-puffing way , but he never lost his temper . Nothing ever seemed to be quite worth that . He liked to take Timmy out to lunch and tell him stories of how he had handled such and such a great lady when everyone else had failed . It was beginning to seem that even he , the great collector of acquaintances , had need of at least one friend . One day when Timmy came into his office he signaled him to close the door . " I 'd like to put you in the way of making a little capital , Tim , " he began gravely . " Your percentage will be raised next year , but I know junior partners ca n't save a dime , and it 's a tragedy to miss this market . Now here 's a real tip , if you 'll keep it to yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " Meredith Products is acquiring the Schultze plants . The contract will be signed in a week . Schultze will covenant not to compete in New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania . There 'll be a stock split in Meredith , and you should make , an easy quarter of anything you put up now . " Timmy nodded slowly as he took it in . " A sure thing ? " " I got it from Stanley Field himself , " Dale said with a sudden grin . " And keep that under your hat , my boy . " Timmy 's lips formed in a silent whistle . Mr. Field was general counsel to Meredith . " But if I have n't anything to put up ? "  | " Which is what I want to talk about , " Dale said promptly . " I think you and I are beginning to understand each other . When a man has earned praise , I think he ought to be praised , and I do n't mind telling you , you 've been doing a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you may be head of this outfit . I wo n't live forever , do n't worry . " He smiled a rather hard smile . " Anyway I want you to live a little better , dress a little better . These things can be important , you know . And I 'm loaning you seventy-five hundred to start a market account . " Timmy accepted the money almost automatically . He was in the habit now of obedience . He invested the whole sum in Meredith which went up even more than Dale had predicted . When he suggested to the latter that he sell out and repay the loan , Dale shook his head roughly . " You can pay me back when you 've got fifty thousand in the kitty , " he snorted . " Not a penny before . " Timmy told Ann about his good fortune that night and suggested that they use the money to get an apartment uptown . Her reaction , however , was far from pleased . " But why did this man , Field , give Dale the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I tell ? And what business is it of mine , anyhow ? " " It seems to me it 's very much your business , " she retorted . " I 'd certainly make it my business if Dale were my partner ! If Field is handing out confidential information about his clients , must n't there be a reason for it ? A darned good reason ? " " Nonsense . That sort of thing goes on all the time . " " Without a reason ? " " Well , what would you suggest ? " he asked irritably . " I 'd suggest that Dale was handing out the same sort of information about his clients ! " This was certainly a sharp thrust , and Timmy was shaken . He had not thought she would be so astute . He had , of course , considered the possibility and had already rejected it on the  | theory that he had no grounds for so slanderous a speculation . But the rejection had not left him entirely satisfied . " I see no reason to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine that Mr. Field is simply a blabbermouth . There are enough of them downtown , Lord knows . " " Well , I think it 's terrible ! " she exclaimed , finishing , as she hardly ever did , her second drink . " Anyway , I do n't want Dale 's dirty money . And I certainly do n't want to live in an apartment bought with it ! " She reached for the whiskey bottle defiantly and poured herself a third . " You 're very particular about Dale all of a sudden . I can remember a time when you were less so . " " Oh , you mean that old apology , " she said disgustedly , throwing up her hands . " There 's no connection at all . Just because you apologize to a man does n't mean you have to take his miserable tips . " " It seems to me it 's one and the same thing . " " Timmy , have you gone entirely crazy ? " " You 've said that before . I may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then you can live in it by yourself ! " He watched with concern as she started on her third drink . " May I remind you that we 're going to the Dales ' tonight ? " She looked up sullenly . " Not this girl . " " Oh , Ann , " he protested in alarm , " you promised me ! This is n't like an Emlen affair . Mrs. Dale is expecting you . " " It 's not a dinner party , so I 'll never be missed . I 'm going to stay here and get drunk . " " Ann ! " " Well , suppose I go and fall on my face ? How would you like that ? " " I 'll have to risk it . " She got up suddenly and went over to him . Leaning down she pinned him against the back of his chair , a hand on each of his shoulders . " Timmy Colt , " she said , staring down at him , " do you know something ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the crazy part . You do n't even care if I fall down  | at the Dales ' . You might even like it ! It 's as if you wanted to ruin yourself ! Darling , you love me still , do n't you ? " For a moment he felt actually dizzy , as if the time for turning back had finally come . Then over her shoulder he suddenly saw the clock on the mantel . " For Pete 's sake , Ann , we 've got to dress ! " he cried , jumping up . " Of course I love you , but look at the time ! " She stood alone in the middle of the room , looking more dejected than he had ever seen her . " What does it matter about the time ? " " What does anything matter ? It matters as much as anything else . " " As anything else ? " she demanded . " Why not ? " " All right , " she said in a duller voice , reaching down to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . I 'm game . "  | NINE-O-ONE PARK AVENUE had been built in the middle twenties , that easy , spacious architectural era of high ceilings and wasted hall space . Sheridan Dale had bought into the building in 1934 at the bottom of the market collapse in co-operatives , which had given him a fitting abode to offer Mrs. Polhemus when she had consented to be his bride in the following year . It had worked out perfectly . Neither of them had the least interest in country life beyond weekend house parties , and the apartment , even with Dale 's increasing prosperity , continued to be their sole residence . The hall , the living room and the library , chambers of noble dimensions , were made for entertaining , and entertain they did , crowds of people , in great heterogeneous parties , invited by Sheridan , tolerated by Clarissa , members of the legal and banking worlds , journalists , artists , denizens of the exotic , lacquered universe of fashion and design . Dale 's secretary kept the lists at the office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always being regrouped , transferred from the cocktail list to the dinner or after-dinner list , dropped or added , but what the system was and which , if any , were the " good " parties , not even the keenest eye could make out . Dale , however , seemed content with it , for whatever purpose it may have served . He stood serene in the midst of the changing crowd with which he had filled his life , indefatigably introducing , never forgetting a name , taking elbow after elbow and propelling guests from noisy to would-be-noisier corners . Clarissa , who  | never remembered a face outside of her own small group of bridge and Canasta friends , blandly accepted her husband 's way of life and left the organization to him while she reigned over the card tables . Dale 's favorite arrangement was a more or less intimate dinner of twenty followed , at half past nine or ten , by a large reception . The new arrivals were fresh , he used to claim , and served to freshen up the dinner guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lull between the end of dinner and the arrival of the first of the later guests , that Clarissa 's daughter by her first marriage , Eileen Shallcross , sat playing backgammon with David Fairchild in a corner of the deserted living room . The men , from whom David had fled , were still in the library , the ladies in Clarissa 's sitting room . Both Eileen and David appreciated the novel quiet of the long high room that the latter had decorated . Like all his work , it was a mixture of periods with a prevailing Italian motif ; there were pale frescoes of robed women with urns on the two end walls and an enormous mirror , framed in gilt with antique panes above the great red sofa with the high back . Over the expanse of grey stone floor were eight brilliant Chinese rugs and little groups of carved wood chairs . " It really is n't bad at all , " David said complacently , looking about him as he rattled his dice , " now one can see it . What a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep cluttering it up with riffraff . " " But you could n't ask for better publicity , " Eileen pointed out , " if it were put up in a window in Sloane 's . I should think you 'd be grateful . " " You forget I 'm an artist . " " You forget it 's my home . " There was perfection about Eileen . Perfection in her slim , diminutive figure , in her pale , lineless , heart-shaped face , in her large , blue , clear eyes and dark hair . She was dressed in light blue , matching her eyes , with one bracelet of opaque sapphires . But if there was sophistication in her simplicity , it was still simplicity . Her repose was not assumed . David , on  | the other hand , was nervous . His looks , like the red vest and bow tie that he wore with his dinner jacket , struck it one when he entered a room ; he was a ballet dancer arriving on stage with a bound . Thick blond hair retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his broad green eyes , small aquiline nose and high cheekbones made up the outlines of a handsomeness that one felt sure had frequently been photographed in Vogue and Harper 's Bazaar . They were the looks , ideally , of a very young man , but David wore them well in his early thirties and would , one decided , wear them almost as well in his forties and even later until they suddenly wizened , perhaps in a single day , like dried skins cracking in the sun . " We work and work , we artists , " he continued , ignoring her last remark , " and who cares ? Does your mother even see this room ? Never . She takes it for granted , like everything else . " " I wonder if people ever enjoy the things they take for granted , " she said , concentrating on her next move . She could never beat David , except as now , when he was indignant . " They enjoy the appearance of them , " he answered with a shrug . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in a world of externals . A literal world . It 's difficult to imagine how things must look to Clarissa . Like those pictures , I suppose , of how the world looks to a bird . " Eileen 's throw was just the six and a two that she had hoped for . " I 'm sending them home , " she observed , picking up two of his men , " for making remarks about their hostess . Not to mention the fact that she happens to be my mother . " " You 'd never know it , for all the attention she pays you . " " She gives me a roof over my head , " she retorted . " You still cultivate the homely virtues , do n't you , Eileen ? " he asked , looking at her keenly as he threw his dice . " Good manners . Humility . Respectfulness . Perhaps it 's what gives you your style . " " Four , not three , " she corrected firmly , as he tried to bring a man out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put them on ? These manners ? "  | " On the contrary . True style must be sincere . " She shrugged , accepting his compliments as she did his strictures , without enthusiasm or reproach . She knew that what he said about her mother , however true , was mostly illuminating about himself . It was only natural that to envious eyes Clarissa should seem a monument of complacency . It was a fact that she had needed neither charm to gain husbands nor wit to win smiles ; the world from her youth had been a too available pap at which she perfunctorily sucked . " I suppose it 's something to be called stylish . Even today . " " It 's something your mother need n't worry about . " Eileen put down her cup . " Now you 're being abusive . And that 's never fun . " " But I 'm not , I 'm quite serious , " he protested , putting down his in turn . " She has no style . Where would she have acquired it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She got her money out of a jewelry store and looks it . And as for Lawyer Dale ? well , they 're a perfect match . What more t can I say ? " " You might say a lot less . " He threw up his hands . " Really , Eileen , it 's getting boring , this filial loyalty . What do they ever do for you , either of them , but beat their gums over your improvident marriage ? Or rather your improvident divorce ? And keep you strapped so you have to live here and help them with their ghastly parties ? " " What more should they do ? " she demanded . " They gave me money , and Craig lost it . They do n't owe me any more . " " Do n't kid yourself , " he retorted . " They owe you plenty . The only really snappy people who come to this house are your friends . Do you think it 's to watch Clarissa gamble or to hear your stepfather name-drop ? Not likely . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Polhemus charm . " She picked up her cup and shook the dice . " Hardly one of the qualities that Sheridan admires , " she pointed out . " If he 's even aware of it . Is that why you resent him ? " " I do n't resent him . That would flatter him . "  | " Oh , but you do , David , " she insisted . " You resent him terribly . You think he sneers at you . But that 's where you 're wrong . Sheridan admires any kind of success . " " Even a decorator 's ? " " The even ' is yours , David . Not mine . " It was his turn to throw , but he only sat and looked at her , with a small , suspicious smile . " Where do you get your tolerance from , Eileen ? " he demanded . " That cool , chilly tolerance ? You must n't ever tolerate me , you know . I wo n't stand to be tolerated . " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You look too far into me , " he answered with the same smile . " I guess I 'm not used to being looked that far into . " ' " Do n't you trust me ? " " I do n't say that . But I never have trusted anyone . " His tone was serious , but she shrugged . " I have no wish to intrude . " " I know . " He nodded . " Which is precisely the reason that you might be allowed to . " " But I 'm not curious , David . It 's simply that we 're friends . I like you . " His smile became twisted . " Like a brother ? " " No , David , " she answered in a level tone , returning his stare . " Like a human being . " He laughed almost pleasantly . " I never can trap you , can I ? " he exclaimed . " Not matter how I twist and turn . You always say the right thing . Maybe it 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasteboard world . " " Maybe it 's because I do n't fit into your preconception of what women are . " " They 're all spiders to me , are n't they , Miss Freud ? " he retorted , immediately irritated again . " Tarantulas or lobsters with giant claws ? Castrating claws ? " " Do you ever see them as disinterested ? " " What 's more castrating than that ! " he cried and then paused . " But you have a point , " he continued , rolling his dice and moving two men to the same point , his long fingers  | gliding deftly across the board . " You are disinterested . It 's why I could never have an affair with you . " " You out-David David tonight . Is that the ultimate com-pliment ? " " I wonder if it is n't , " he mused . " I 've had affairs with other women . You know that ? " " You 've told me . With a rather schoolboy pride . " " Well , you need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You might ruin my reputation . But the thing about those affairs was an excess of motivation . On the woman 's part curiosity , a sort of feminine glee at conquering so notorious a faggot . An apotheosis into Venus herself . And on mine the desire to revenge an earlier slight or else the need to show myself the equal of some stupid husband , some Sheridan Dale , who had my success in the world downtown . " As he paused and took in her expression of surprise , he suddenly burst out laughing . " Do n't worry , Eileen . I 'm not implying that your mother and I ? " " David ! " she said sharply . " You can go too far ! " " So can you , " he retorted with hauteur , " if such an idea ever so much as slipped through that agile mind of yours . Anyway . There are plenty of people who can enjoy affairs from motives . But I doubt if you 're one of them . With you it 's all or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . " With her next throw she closed his home board . " There , " she said . " Now I 've got you . You can sit and be quiet while I throw off . " She threw her dice rapidly several times in succession and moved her last men home as he gazed around the room . At the far end the ladies were just returning ; some of the men had come out of the library to join them . " Who 's that young couple ? " he asked . " Where ? " " In the hall . " Through the great doorway , turning , she could see into the hall where the first of the after-dinner couples had appeared . The wife , in a plain brown evening dress , entered the room with a hesitant air . Her husband , behind her , seemed  | more detached . He had a pale , aloof countenance , and longish black hair . Eileen noted the nervous way in which his wife nodded as she greeted Clarissa and how she ran one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the Colts , " she observed . " He 's a junior partner of Sheridan 's . Supposed to be brilliant . Clarissa told me to keep an eye on them . They wo n't know a soul . " " So like your dear mother . It 's a wonder she has n't put you in the coat room in a black dress and apron . But wait . That will come . " " Mrs. Colt is obviously miserable , " she continued , watching them . " I 'll have to do something . " David 's eye was appraising . " He 's rather cute , do n't you think ? " " I understand they 're idyllically happy , " she said dryly , " and have two nice little boys . " " Really , Eileen . Arc you warning me off ? " " I do n't want you to waste your time , dear . " " You mean you do n't want me to get in your path ? " " What an absolutely foul mind you have . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That nasty habit of saying what everyone else is thinking . " " Two people simply walk into a room and you immediately leap to obscene conclusions ! " " Now just a minute , " he retorted . " Let 's be fair . I only said he was cute . What did you say ? That he was brilliant and happily married . Who 's leaping to conclusions ? " " But you know nothing in the world about him ! " " I wonder if that 's quite true , " he said , stroking his chin as he paused to observe Timmy across the room . " I think I know something about his marriage already . And I wonder very much if it 's idyllically happy . " " That 's what you think about every marriage . " " And I 'm so often right . " " The next thing you 'll be saying is that he 's ? " " That he 's like me ! " he finished for her triumphantly . " All right . They so often are ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear . Listen to me for a minute and allow your prejudices to subside . Only temporarily , of course . I 'll give them back . We have agreed that Mr. Colt is handsome ? " " But what does that signify ? " " He is , would you not say , more than averagely attractive to women ? " He turned to make another appraisal of Timmy . " Oh , definitely more than averagely . " She shrugged . " I suppose . " " His wife , on the other hand , is an obvious frump . Can you deny it ? " " Certainly I can , " she said , turning back to examine Mrs. Colt . " She 's really quite pretty , if you 'll only look at her . Except now she is obviously ill at ease and not at her best . You live too much in a blue-haired world , David . " " We wo n't debate the point . You will admit , at any rate , that she is the less attractive of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Very well , " he concluded . " Tell me this . Why did he , a peacock , select for his mate this ill-at-ease brown hen ? And do n't tell me it was for her money or social position . My practiced eye can tell at a glance that she has neither . " " Maybe he loved her ! " she exclaimed , looking up at him . " Maybe he 's a man who looks for more in a woman than sophistication and poise ! " " A pretty opinion , " he retorted , " but only your own . I suggest the contrary . I suggest he 's a cake eater . " " A what ? " " One of those who practices the gentle art of possessing his cake while consuming it . I suggest that your stepfather 's brilliant young partner is only another inhibited invert who has sought a disguise of masculinity in a sexually unaggressive wife . " With her next throw of the dice she took off the last of her men . " You 're quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I 'm not going to be drawn into it . Anyway , I 've won the game . Now I 'm going to bring Mrs. Colt over , and  | you 're going to be absolutely charming to her . " He rolled his eyes to the ceiling . " I was right ! " he exclaimed . " You are a spider ! " " And this is one web you 're not going to get out of . " She went across the room to the Colts who had just been abandoned by Clarissa and were standing uneasily by themselves . " I 'm Eileen Shallcross , " she explained to Ann . " As the daughter in residence I 'm allowed to strong-arm people . I want to take you over and introduce you to an absolutely charming man . " She led her , bewildered , over to David who rose from the backgammon table and bowed as they approached . Then she returned to Timmy . " I 've heard so much about you from my stepfather , Mr. Colt , " she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " " You 're Mrs. Dale " s daughter ? " he asked in surprise . " Do n't we look alike ? " " Oh , no . Not at all , really . " " Well , we need n't go into whether or not that 's a compliment , " she said lightly . " Shall we sit ? " He took a drink that was passed , and they sat on two chairs by a small table . He examined the slowly filling room with care . " Is n't that old lady Mrs. Wardell ? " he asked . " The one talking to your stepfather ? " " If Sheridan is talking to her , " she said without turning her head , " I 'm sure it must be . " " Why do you say that ? " " Because she 's a very important person . And would make a heavenly client . Am I too crude ? Or do n't you and Sheridan work that way ? " " I 'm talking to you , are n't I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you forget . I trapped you into it . " He looked quizzically around the room again . " Do you know most of these people ? " " I have to earn my keep . Mother can never remember names , so it 's up to me . " " Your mother ca n't remember names ? " " Dear me , " she said , noting his concentrated expression .  | " You do take one up on things , do n't you ? No , I 'm afraid there 's no division in Mother 's mind between the different categories of people who come to her parties . They 're all just guests . Lovely guests . " " But to you it 's different , " he pursued . " You 've done your homework . That 's how you know about me . " She gazed at him for a moment , with the smallest sense of disappointment . She wondered , after all , if she was going to like him . A classifier , a simplifier . Perhaps just a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , nodding . " And I know about that nice old Mr. Sheffield who comes here sometimes . " He burst out laughing . " Have I said something wrong ? " " Oh , no , " he protested , " Not in the least . It 's just that I see how constricted a life I 've led . Perhaps that 's what I need , to hear Mrs. Dale 's daughter bracket me with Mr. Sheffield . " " You mean , I suppose , that I should n't have associated you with someone who 's so old ? And perhaps retired ? " " Oh , not that ! " he cried , laughing again . " It 's only that Mr. Sheffield is God and that I 'm not even a cherub ! And to walk into a party like this and hear a beautiful girl speak of us in the same breath ? well , it gives me a sense of new worlds ! " Eileen felt slightly embarrassed , not so much at the compliment as at her immediate sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks anyway for the beautiful ' , Mr. Colt , " she said in a more reserved tone . " My name is Timmy . " " And mine is Eileen . " " Oh , I did n't mean that , " he said , confused . " But are n't we members of the same office family ? " He seemed dubious . " Are we ? " " Well , how do I become one ? Who 's a member in good standing ? Not Mother , I suppose . " He laughed again , as if such things were taken for granted . " Oh , even less than you , " he replied . " I 'll tell you who is . Mrs. Knox . " " I do n't think I know her . " He threw his hands in the air . " Well , that really shows what  | different worlds we live in . When Mr. Knox was alive , and they used to give parties , probably half the guests were from the firm . Or clients . And whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took one of the younger couples , sometimes two . It was simply the way they lived . The firm was more like a club to the Knoxes . And they assumed everyone felt the way they did . That was the charm of it . " Eileen noted the evident sincerity in his tone as he said this . He seemed for the moment detached , almost as if he had forgotten her . There was , she supposed , an implied criticism of herself , or at least of her family , in what he said , but she had to smile at the gravity with which he spoke of " younger couples , " as though even the great could never be sufficiently reminded of the base on which the pyramid of a law firm rested . " And were they fun , Mrs. Knox 's parties ? " He looked at her in surprise . " Oh , I do n't suppose she ever thought of parties in those terms . " " Dear me , " she said . " That does give me rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Mother joined the office family so late . You 'll have to help me to catch up . " " Now you 're laughing at me . " " On the contrary , " she insisted . " I want to learn to be a good office stepchild . Is it too late , do you think ? Have I a chance ? " He laughed again suddenly , and his face cleared . The lawyer and the office man disappeared at once ; as he rubbed his forehead and pushed back his hair , he had the charm of the boy whose existence she had already suspected behind his rather heavily assumed manhood . It was disarming , very disarming , but she was cautious . She had learned a good deal about boys from her husband . " Why should you care about things like that ? " he asked . " I 'm the one who should be learning from you . You have all this . " He indicated the room with a sweeping gesture . " You had it before your mother even married Sherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers and office parties ? " The plainness of his sincerity , the speed with which he swept clear the whole shelf of his preconceptions , was unsettling.  | " But you must n't say that , " she protested . " After all , what could I teach you ? There is n't anything much to be learned at a party like this . Except maybe to be otherwise engaged when the Dales ask you again . " He looked about the room again with a rather devastating air of speculation and shook his head . " I disagree , " he said . " I 'm sure you could teach me a lot . " Eileen glanced involuntarily to where his wife was sitting with David . " Nonsense . Anyway , you have that sweet wife . " " Ann ? " He laughed , but not unkindly . " She 's a worse hick than I. " " Maybe you 're both doing all right the way you are . " " Yes , " he allowed , nodding , " there 's always that point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strongly . But what about you ? Which is Mr. Shallcross ? Is he here ? " " I 'm afraid not . We 're divorced . " " Oh . I 'm sorry . " There was an awkward pause . " My mistake . " " No , mine . " " I mean I 'm sorry I asked , " he said , now thoroughly confused . " Do n't be . Is n't it the sort of thing you expect of the nonoffice world ? " But she should have known already that he was not one to make light of things . " If you mean by that that I find you worldly or superficial , you 're wrong , " he said gravely . " I 'm sure that whatever happened , it was n't your fault . " She stared at him , her heart suddenly beating fast . She was almost inclined to say something sharp , to ask him if his drink was really that strong . " You sound like Sheridan , " she said . " Must there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned away from him and watched her mother cross the room towards the library where the card tables were . Clarissa , spotting her , gave her the quick backward nod that indicated : Carry on here , will you ? Eileen ignored it . " If there was any fault it was mine , " she said slowly . " Mother and Sheridan warned me against Craig . But why should I have  | listened to them ? I knew I should n't marry him . That was the important thing . " " And why did you ? " She was pleased now at his literalness . " Because I had to . Because I would n't have made any sense to myself if I had n't . Can you see that ? " " Yes . " She decided that he could . " And those are the mistakes you never regret . The ones you make with your eyes wide open . " " I think I know the kind of mistake you mean , " he said , with a slight frown . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe that 's the difference between us , " she said , formal again , and looked up as her stepfather came over . " I like your Mr. Colt , Sheridan . And I 'm sure he 's a good lawyer . You ca n't imagine how much he 's got out of me . " " I 've come to take him over to your Aunt Florence , " Dale said with his usual abruptness . " She wants to talk to him . " Eileen got up , but turned back to smile at Timmy . " So you know Aunt Florence ? " she asked . " Then you 're a bit of a fraud , are n't you ? What can we teach you ? We 're hicks compared to her ! " Timmy crossed the room with Dale to where Mrs. Emlen was sitting . " Your stepdaughter is charming , " he told Dale . " I like her approach to things . " Dale paused and turned to face him . When he had a philosophic reflection to make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Timmy , she 's the damndest girl I ever knew , " he said , gravely . " The good Lord gave her looks , intelligence , money , breeding , and what does she do ? Throw herself away on an oaf who could hardly sign his name . A member of one of those impoverished old Maryland families that prefer horses to men . And a brute , too , into the bargain . Never gave a damn about her . Went after her money and blew it all . " " Maybe she loved him . " Dale looked at him with the expression of one who wonders  | if he will ever come to an end of the irrational in his fellow beings . " Love ? " he demanded . " She could have had love . All the love in the world . It was n't as if her mother and I had been trying to force her to marry a man with money . We 'd have been tickled pink if she 'd married some young guy like yourself who could make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her ! Back at home , divorced and not a penny to her name . Who 's going to want to take that on , I 'd like to know ? You ca n't expect her mother to set her up again . She did that once , and what does she have to show for it ? " Timmy agreed that it was all very difficult . " But enough of that , " Dale said dryly . " I have n't got all evening . " He always had the trick , Timmy reflected , of making the other person feel that he had been doing all the talking and rather too much of it . " Florence has been shouting for you . You 've done a first-class job keeping the old girl happy . " Dale gripped his shoulder reassuringly . " Keep it up , boy . Keep it up . I meant what I said about turning things over to you . I ca n't run everything in the damn shop . Not forever , you know ! " To Timmy , walking across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder towards the broad , already smiling face of Mrs. Emlen who was now nodding to him , the air of the party seemed to tremble with the gold dust of his new future . As he passed Ann , talking to Fairchild , he glanced apprehensively at her drink and then looked resolutely away . He could only take up one thing at a time . David was surveying his companion with something less than enthusiasm . The after-dinner guests had now largely arrived , and it seemed hard , when he might have been securing the commission for old Mrs. Wardell 's new house in Jamaica with a few bold jokes and compliments , that he had to be tied down to an unimportant young lawyer 's wife who was noticeably intent on the darkest scotch and soda he had ever seen . Really , the things he did for Eileen ! " Do you live in the city ? " he asked with a rather exasperated politeness . " Yes , we do still . Do you ? "  | " Where else ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explained , still staring at her glass . " Particularly with little boys . " " I fail to see why , " he retorted . " I was brought up in the city when I was a little boy . " " But it was different then . Now everyone 's moving outside . " " And the husband is sacrificed to the early death of the commuter , " he observed , " that one child may pick a dandelion . But I guess it 's fair . The child grows up to do the same thing . " " You dislike the suburbs ? " " I do n't even recognize them . " " You dislike uniformity , I suppose , " she went on with a vague nod . " Yet , in a way , you owe it so much . " He stared . " I ? " " All the girls I know want their husbands to make more money so they can have a David Fairchild room . " He sat back and blinked . " Why , you 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , " she said . " Are n't you famous ? " David was much mollified . He even decided that Eileen was right , that Mrs. Colt was rather pretty . Good skin , anyway . Or was it simply that he liked compliments , compliments from anyone ? He smiled , remembering how Eileen had compared him to a trained seal catching fish . Any number went down before you knew it . " Are you much interested in decorating ? " She smiled briefly and took a sip of her drink . " No . But my husband wants me to get a new apartment . He 'll undoubtedly want you to do it . " David 's air became the least bit stiffer . He was used to young couples , met at parties , who wanted cut rates . " We 'll have to see , " he hedged . " I should be delighted , of course , but I do get a bit swamped . " " But you do n't understand ! " she protested , turning on him suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even if we could , we 're not ? well , we 're not that sort of people . " i  | David raised his eyebrows suspiciously . " What sort of people ? " " The kind of people who can afford David Fairchild . Or maybe I mean the kind of people who can appreciate David Fairchild . " " You mean that you and Mr. Colt are too earthy ? " he inquired coldly . " Too basic for my frills ? " He saw that she was confused and noted the subsequent sip of her drink . " Is that it ? " he pursued . " Why do you fence with me ? " she asked . " Ca n't you see what I mean ? I would n't mind if Timmy really wanted you to do an apartment . Or even if he went broke paying for it . I mind his wanting it because it 's the thing to want . Why , three months ago Timmy had never heard of you ! " " And was a purer man , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wo n't let you put me in a corner , Mr. Fairchild , " she said stubbornly . " You know what I mean . You 're too bright not to . " David was silenced . The prototype of philistia , the armed domestic female , had collapsed with the violence of her appeal into this poor creature . It was not agreeable to glimpse the egotism behind his own preconceptions of others . David felt ashamed , and immediately resented having been made to feel so . After all , was n't she making rather a scene over her husband 's small scrap of worldliness ? " I suppose you mean he wants to get ahead , " he said . " What 's so wrong with that ? The act of transition , I concede , is always unattractive , but once he gets to the top , he 'll settle down and care less . I 've seen too many of them . Take our host , for example . " " You take him . " He did not like the moody way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been her first of the party , but it was clearly not her first of the evening . " Maybe you have a point , " he said in a kinder tone . " But do n't worry . Your husband will never be like Dale . " She looked up defiantly . " Wo n't he ? How do you know that , Mr. Fairchild ? "  | " Well , in the first place he 's too good-looking . " This remark , intended to lighten the basis of their too serious discussion , had just the opposite effect . She seemed suddenly to crumple . " He is , is n't he ? " she said in what threatened to become a wail . " And you saw him with that lovely girl . Were n't they a graceful couple ? Did n't they seem made for each other ? Say it , Mr. Fairchild ! " " Please , Mrs. Colt ! " David exclaimed , now quite alarmed . " Do n't go on that way . This is meant to be a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fun ! " Her very soul seemed to have jumped into those large , bewildered brown eyes to repudiate the word . And as he watched her , not knowing what to do , she suddenly jumped up and hurried from the room . " I 'll look after her , never mind , " came a voice from behind him , and Eileen , ever watchful , had moved quickly after her . " Pretend nothing has happened ! " she murmured over her shoulder . In Clarissa 's room , sitting on the broad , pink-covered bed with the Venetian bedstead , she found poor Ann looking dolefully at the mess she had made . Right in the middle of the pillow . " Poor Mrs. Colt , " she said , closing the door behind her . " I hope you feel better . Is there anything I can get you ? " " Do n't be sorry for me , " Ann murmured sullenly . " Try not to be , anyway . I know I 'm a horror . I should n't have come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever been ? " Ann was looking at her defiantly now . " No . And , if you thought you were going to be , you 'd rather die than be seen . I know your type . I 've envied it too much not to know . " Eileen looked at her quizzically . " I 'll get your husband , " she said calmly . " You 'll probably want him to take you home . " Ann shook her head . " I 'm sorry about the bed . " " It does n't matter . " When Eileen , back in the living room , leaned down to whits-  | per to Timmy , he stood up immediately . He felt little enough surprise . It was as if he had known all along that he was getting beyond himself , as if there was almost kindness as well as inevitability in Ann 's plucking him back . It had been her decision , had it not , from the beginning ? He said nothing , however , when he went to Mrs. Dale 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would allow her to bring the drama to a close in her own manner . If she chose not to speak to him , to go glumly to the hall , barely pausing as he put a coat about her shoulders , if she chose further to ignore the clucking of Mrs. Dale roused from her Canasta by a reporting maid , if she wanted to ring down the curtain with a masterpiece of bad manners , it was enough for him to watch , impassive . She was lucky indeed , he thought with a tug in his heart of the old affection and pity , that he did not say , " I told you so ! " Eileen , returning to her mother 's room to be sure the bed was being changed , the guests ' coats removed , heard running steps behind her and turned to face an elated David . " Is it true what Clarissa told me ? " he cried . " All over her bed ! " " Do n't be disgusting , David . " " But is it ? Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " It 's poetry ! " he exclaimed . " I tell you she 's a great woman , that Mrs. Colt . Think how many hundreds , if not thousands , have been through these rooms , have attended these ghastly crushes . And , of them all , who besides that lonely , baffled creature has had the wisdom and the courage to express her soul by regurgitating in the very center , the neat , pink center of your mother 's bed ? I wonder if I 'm not in love with her ! " Eileen smiled faintly as she continued down the corridor , thinking how angry she could make him by saying that it had taken one miracle to produce another . She thought of Timmy Colt 's impassive paleness and wondered if he , like Craig , could be cruel .  | THE FOLLOWING morning Timmy got up without waking Ann and prepared breakfast for himself and the boys . He told them to be quiet because Mummy was not feeling well and when he had sent them off to school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting up now , staring despondently out the window . " Thank you , " she said in a toneless voice when he handed her the cup . " I thought you would n't want to get up . " " That 's right . " He paused , uncertain . " Timmy , " she said , as he turned to go , " would you mind sitting down ? I think we should discuss what happened last night , do n't you ? " " Not now , Ann . A lot of things are better left unsaid . Why hash it over ? " " That 's so like you , " she said in the same listless tone . " You can go for years without discussing things . But I ca n't . Timmy , we must have this out , once and for all . " " I only want to point out first , " he said firmly , sitting down on a chair by the bed , " that I have n't said a word of reproach . And that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she agreed , nodding . " You 've been entirely correct . You did n't say a word in the cab . And that was a very pretty apology you made to Mrs. Dale . " " Oh , you heard it ? "  | " Certainly , I heard it . I was n't that drunk . " " I suppose you 'll admit , " he said with a frown , " that an apology was in order ? " " No , I wo n't , Timmy , " she said , shaking her head . " Not fundamentally . I think the Dales owe me an apology for what they 've done to you . And for what they 've done to our life . " " Ann ! " " I mean it . And , furthermore , for what they 're turning you into . " " What is that ? " he demanded , his throat beginning to tighten with irritation . " We 've been over it all before , " she said wearily . " I see no point going into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congealed , Timmy . I did n't know how much until last night . Why , you might have been a stiff English governess taking home a naughty child ! " " What did you want me to do ? Fall down on my hands and knees and bless you for making us the most conspicuous couple at the party ? " " Yes ! " she cried , sitting up in sudden excitement . " That 's just what I wanted ! I 'm not going to be ashamed of saying what I want ! I wanted you to be on my side . I wanted everyone to know my husband was with me through thick and thin ! That we had something together that made their whole party as unimportant as ? well , as a mosquito ! " " Really , Ann , you 're out of your mind . " " Oh , I did n't want you to say anything , " she continued , sullen again . " Though I 'd have gone on my hands and knees and blessed you if you had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't important . What I 'd done . To us , anyway . I only wanted you not to sit like a ramrod in the cab all the way home , fretting about what I might have done to your career ! " " Well , if this is n't really and truly the limit ! " Timmy was on his feet now , pacing the room . " I 'm the one who should do the apologizing ! Because I behaved myself at the party ? Because I did n't get sick on Mrs. Dale 's bed ? "  | " Even Mr. Fairchild , whom I 'd only just met , was more considerate than you . " " And why not ? " he demanded , turning on her . " Were you his wife ? Were you making a fool of him ? I bet he enjoyed the whole show ! " " Oh , Timmy , you 're disgusting . " " And who made me disgusting ? " he cried , trembling now with anger . " Who made me swallow my pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand anything ? Do you really think you can sit here with a pile of books in a little vacuum of untarnished ideals and send me out to roll in the mud ? It 's where you 're wrong , then . We 're in this thing together . And it was your choice ! " " So that 's it , " she said in a lower tone . " You 're punishing me . Of course . " " I 'm not punishing anyone , " he retorted . " I 'm simply being consistent . I was perfectly happy living the way we were . You were the one who wanted to change . Well , now we 've changed , and we 're going to go right on changing . Right on till we 've reached the top ! For if you think I 'm going to be content to have sold my soul for a mere junior partnership , you 're crazy ! " " I see , " she said again , nodding slowly . " There 's a sort of desperate logic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it brings me back to the thing we 've got to discuss . " She paused . " We ca n't go on this way , Timmy . " His jaw dropped . " What ? " " It will never work out . You 'll be much better off without me . " You 're not serious ! " " Oh , but I am . " She closed her eyes for a moment . " I 've thought and thought about it . We do n't seem to be able to communicate any more . Everything I do and say aggravates you ? " " What about what I do and say ? " " All right , " she conceded , looking even paler . " If you want . That aggravates me , too . I do n't know if that 's the word , but never mind . The point is that something has snapped between  | us . Maybe we were never as close as we thought we were . Maybe these things never came out because I lived , as you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But whatever the reason , here we are . " Timmy felt the bitterness within him , like an icy tide , grip his whole being . He took in appraisingly her unjustified expression of reproach . " What is it that you propose ? " he asked coldly . " That we separate . For a while anyway . That you go to your mother 's or a hotel . Coming here , of course , to see me and the boys whenever you wish . Till you 've thought this through , Timmy . " Her eyes appealed to him in desperation . " Till I 've pulled myself together . Till we know where we are , darling , and where we 're going . " " And where are we going , Ann ? " he insisted in the same hard tone . " To Reno ? Is that your idea ? " " Oh , Timmy , please . " She suddenly dropped her head in her hands . " Do n't make a drama of it . You know how I love you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that at all . You pick a most unusual way to show it . " " Ca n't you see I 'm at the end of my rope ? " she cried suddenly . " Why do you think I did what I did last night ? Have I ever done anything like that before ? Ca n't you see that I want to save our marriage ? We 've got to know where we stand , Timmy ! Go to the Dales , go to your parties , they 'll be delighted to have an attractive extra man . See what it all means to you . You must , darling ! For there are things going on inside of you that I simply do n't understand . And I have this hellish fear that being with me only makes them worse ! " The sense of her suffering was too acute ; he had to look down to avoid her desperate eyes . Yet why , he still asked himself bitterly , clenching his fists , were they even having such a scene ? Had it been his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , turning away silently , weary suddenly of the very ambivalence in his feelings , " We 'll try it your way . I 'll go to the Stanford . The firm has rooms there now . How will you explain it to the boys ? "  | " I 'll tell them you have to work , " she said in a barely audible tone . " To work at night . That 's one thing , poor children , they 're sure to believe . " Timmy walked to the subway in a daze , but a daze that was still protecting him from what seemed the more real prospect of turning and hurrying back to tell her that she was crazy , that they loved each other , that a separation was impossible . This was the obvious thing to do , and the thing , it seemed to him , that , of course , he would do , to help his rather ordinary destiny achieve its rather ordinary end . But he was still able to observe , with a deep little tingling satisfaction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking him further from that obvious solution , that had-to-be-done thing . If he crossed the next street , he would say , he was lost ; no , if he passed the door of the corner drugstore , no , if he actually entered the subway . But as he hovered before the last he was shoved forward by a friendly grip on his shoulder and found himself descending the stairs with Larry . " When are you pulling out of this dump ? " Larry was asking . " When are you moving uptown where all good partners go ? " " I do n't know . I 'm not sure yet . " " I know a terrific real estate broker if you need one . " Larry was always helpful these days . Since his father-inlaw 's death and Timmy 's elevation to partnership , he had clung to the latter even more fiercely . But Timmy cared less for motives now ; he was hungrier for the uncritical forms of friendship . " Ann 's left me , " he said flatly , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wondered how it would sound , this thing he had been going to tell nobody . " Or rather she 's kicked me out . " " No kidding ? " " Would I kid about a thing like that ? " " You mean you 've really split up ? " " So she tells me . " " Good ! "  | Timmy turned in shocked amazement to face the defiant congratulation in Larry 's eyes . " What are you saying ? " " Only what I 've been wanting to tell you for a long time ! Only that it 's made me sick and tired to see what she 's been doing to you ! Who the hell does she think she is , I 'd like to know , dragging herself around with a face a mile long ? She 's jealous , that 's all ! Now that you 're beginning to hit the big league , she wants to suffocate you in a steam bath of neuroses ! " " Larry , please ! " " I 'm sorry , " Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just happen to be your friend , that 's all . You 'll probably hate me for telling you this . But I 've always picked you for a winner . Right from the very beginning , Timmy boy . I want to see you go to the top , and I 'm dead set against anyone who 's in your way ! Even if it 's Ann ! " The black train rattled along the platform , and Timmy got in without a word , standing beside Larry in the crowded center of the car . Glancing at the latter 's set , half-averted countenance , he noted curiously that it was still handsome , despite the long cheeks , the oval , moled jaw , with the handsomeness of blond youth . But what he also saw was that this impression would barely survive the passing of youth ; one could already make out the hardness , even the hint of brutality , in what the older man would be . Larry 's boyishness and rather whiny charm had concealed not only his selfishness ; they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suspected . Larry would see the practice of law in terms of people and how they could be handled ; he would fit in well in a world of Dales . And Timmy who wanted now to reject and repudiate him , who wanted to cry defiantly : " But no ! You could never understand my Ann ! Never in a million years ! " was silent , wondering if he was really man enough to stick to his chosen path .  | EILEEN SHALLCROSS had grown up in the one small niche of serenity that she had managed to carve out of the ordered turbulence of her mother 's life . Clarissa Dale and her sister , Florence Emlen , were always pursuing pleasure in noisy but organized forays ; if amid the stamping of hooves and the blowing of trumpets the elusive creature got away , its escape was unnoticed by the riders who had come , after some speculation as to what they were after , to confuse the hunt with the capture , the shouts with the emotion that engendered them . Eileen 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , of an honorable family on Brooklyn Heights , renowned , however , more for their stillness than for any sound or jarring note , had early been dropped from the picture . Only Eileen , it seemed , had really been conscious of his shedding , or rather of his return to the Heights ; to her he was a consoling but ineffective ally , and whenever Clarissa forgot that Wednesdays were reserved for her visits to him , Eileen , normally a child of the evenest disposition , could scream and stamp and carry on alarmingly . Such occasions , however , were rare . It was her father , consumptive and dying , who taught her to make her peace with the Bertrands , who opened her eyes , without malevolence , to the curious fact that whatever her mother 's family turned their hands to , they managed to do badly . He wanted her , like all parents but more particularly the moribund , to succeed where they had failed . He wanted her to do things well .  | And she did . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rode expertly and developed a real card sense . She had not only the knack but the charming quality of making little of it ; she would simply shrug off her talent and make the observer feel , whatever his modest endowments , that those , now those were something worth talking about . And in a literal world , at least in a Bertrand world , people were apt to take her at her own evaluation . Clarissa never for a moment suspected how exceptional a creature she had produced . Nor did Aunt Florence or her cousins , George or Anita . But other people did , and as a companion piece to their admiration , Eileen learned early to accept their resentment . She irritated them because she seemed so easy to pigeonhole , while in fact she would never fit . Seated at the bridge table it was tempting to classify her as a parlor lily with one small artificial aptitude . Then one saw her in a black riding habit , perfectly cut ? all right , she was a dude . And then one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly fair . Nor did it make things any better that Eileen seemed to sense their confusion and half to apologize for having proved them wrong . She would have been wiser to have tossed them a fault and let them pin it on her . People would have liked her more had they thought her conceited , cocksure . They would even have welcomed a charge of insincerity or deceit . Nothing is more detested than perfection . Eileen , however , was not perfect . She had one great vanity : the idea that nobody had a greater love to give . Such a love , of course , was not a commodity to be wasted , except for a few gentle drops here and there , on family or friends . It was a dripping beaker to be emptied , in one full flood , on the man of her choice , or rather , for Eileen was not a forward type , on the man who should choose her . It was not in her fantasies that he should have an equal or even a comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own progenitors , she was no doubt unworthy . It was only important that she should love and love completely , and it was thus that she became the handmaiden of Craig Shallcross .  | He was a tall , knobbly gentleman farmer from Maryland whose silent ways only partially concealed a bad disposition and whose love of animals could never quite cover his aversion to humans . But he had the talent to assess Eileen correctly when they first met on a weekend house party in Baltimore . He was not dazzled by her capabilities , but he recognized them , and he saw what others failed to see , their availability . It was a new experience for Eileen to find herself taken for granted , without either envy or admiration ; she promptly took his inability to be impressed for masculinity , his lack of imagination for strength . She gave herself over to the adoration of this new god because she had always told herself that she would ; neither her mother , whom he bored , nor her stepfather whom he irritated , nor any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on her . She married Craig a month after they had met , put her money in his hands and went blithely off to live on his Maryland farm . When she thought later of the drab years of her married life , it seemed as though she had sold her heritage for glimpses : his swinging shoulders as he walked to the barn , the careless wave if he returned from the hunt in a good mood , the lazy smile after four drinks . She had shared him with animals , with bottles , for the stingy moments of an athlete 's love ; for these she had given up everything that he could not share , her reading , her music , her old friends , even her cards . She had sought his level in everything , and she had finally come to be resented , as deep down she had suspected to be inevitable , for her very compliance with the stupidity of his way of life , for her own exhausting enthusiasm for everything in him that was least like the best in herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fate that had selected for her rival and successor a Baltimore girl of grotesque affectations who detested farm life and made no secret of it . " I should have seen it from the beginning , " she told Craig in her one moment of outspoken bitterness . " Every man wants a woman to be a bitch occasionally . Your mistake is that you 've picked one who 'll make it a full-time job . She 'll use the barn i  | for cocktail parties and have you hanging Japanese lanterns . And you 'll like it , that 's the killing part . You 'll like it for maybe a whole year . " She came back , empty-handed , to a mother who was pleased enough to have her back , however often she underscored the obligation . For Eileen was more than decorative ; she was soon almost indispensable . Clarissa could now spend all her time at the card table while her daughter was charming to Sheridan 's friends and clients . It was little enough to expect , was n't it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the years in Maryland , even her stepfather 's parties seemed glittering . She was , in fact , starved for everything that New York could offer , for music , pictures , friends . She was starved for elegance , even for artifice . And ever conscious of her inward wound , she now had a small , veiled defiance that she had not had before . She had loved and been rejected . Very well . Now she was on her own , with no further need of apology . If there were still people who were jealous of her blue eyes and her talents , that was simply too bad . They could envy themselves green , for all she cared . And it was just this attitude , of course , still perceptible behind the veil of her perfect manners , that gave her a new power over people , that made David Fairchild who had once found her " sticky " now delight in her company . It was no easy job for a single woman to carve out a place for herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eileen accomplished it . With her ability to blend with any group , her ease and yet deference with older people , she could pass from the personality dissection of the fashion world to the stately give and take of Newport , the castellated grandeur of Mrs. Edwin Wardell herself . Dale , more observant than his wife or sister-in-law , was quick to see that Eileen was moving into circles not yet available to him , for all his marriage and his downtown success , and , in the guise of a kindly stepfather , began to suggest that she ask some of her own friends to his parties . And Eileen , understanding , but amused , was quite willing , so long as he was not too obvious in his attentions to his  | new guests , to act for the time being as his social retriever . One thing , however , she had kept away from , and that was love . She associated it now with subjection , and Craig had given her enough of that to last her for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , and however disconcerting this may have been to the occasional bachelor who saw in so charming a divorcee the opportunity for an easy and unentangling affair , it could be as gratifying to older husbands , timid of temptation , as it was immediately endearing to their wives . All of which did not make , of course , a complete life , but it made a peaceful one , and anyone who had been through what she had been through could appreciate peace . It was consequently with very mixed emotions that she now contemplated her new preoccupation with Timmy Colt . She was startled by the bound of her heart , only three nights after the party , when her stepfather announced at dinner that his wife had left him . " Left him ! " Clarissa exclaimed . " I should have thought he 'd have left her . Perfectly revolting , the way she behaved . Do you know , I think there 's still an odor in my room . Or do you suppose that 's just imagination ? " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale continued , ignoring his wife . " Timmy 's too good for her . It 's the old story . The husband with the future and the wife who ca n't keep up . So she goes around feeling sorry for herself . Might as well chuck her now as later . The quicker it 's done , the less it hurts . " " Poor Mrs. Colt , " Eileen commented sadly . " Does she really have to be chucked ? Could n't there be a school for wives like that ? I 'm sure she could learn . " " She 's a lame duck , Eileen . Do n't go wasting your sympathy on lame ducks . They never learn . " ' " If she 'd just learn not to do what she does in her hostess 's bedroom , " Clarissa said severely , " it would be an excellent first step . " Eileen did not suggest that they ask him to dinner , now that he must be lonely . She was only too sure that they would do this ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her relationship with Timmy , that she could afford to wait .  | And it was accordingly a shock one night , coming home from dinner , to find him in the hall taking his leave of Sheridan . She had not really anticipated that she could miss him . " But you 're not going already ! " she exclaimed before she knew it . " Just as I 've arrived . It 's too mean . Sheridan , you should have told me he was coming ! " " I did n't know you were friends , " Dale said shortly , glancing from one to the other . Timmy , looking surprised but not unpleased , evidently did n't know it either . " Oh , but we had the longest , most searching talk , did n't we ? " she went on , taking refuge in her social manner . " Come on back and have a nightcap ! " " Look , Eileen , he 's a working man , " Dale said irritably . " He has to get up in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really should go , " Timmy said doubtfully . " Then come back to us , " she said with a determined smile . " Come back to us soon . " She worried about this the following day . She was afraid she had seemed tinny and social , that he would have thought of her not as nervous , but as simply silly . For the first time since Maryland she felt the upsurging of her old need to apologize . She even went so far as to contemplate calling him up to tell him . But this turned out not to be necessary . " I was sorry only to catch a glimpse of you the other night , " he said in rather a rush , when he telephoned . " I was wondering if you 'd like to have dinner with me . Tomorrow ? " And before she could answer he added awkwardly : " I do n't know how you say this , but Ann and I have separated . I guess I should have put that first . " " I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was so sorry . I hope it had nothing to do with what happened that night at the party . " " Oh , no . Well , not exactly . " " Maybe it can be worked out . In time . Do n't you think ? " " Maybe . " He sounded embarrassed . But what , under the circumstances , did she expect him to say ? She could have bitten her nervous tongue off . " I mean , I do n't know , " he con-  | tinued confusedly . " I rather doubt it . But what about tomorrow ? I guess it 's terribly short notice , and of course I do n't really know you very well . But when you said the other night ? " " It is not short notice at all , " she broke in firmly . " I 'm free as air . Would you like to pick me up here or shall we meet somewhere ? " " I 'll pick you up . At seven ? " Agreeing quickly , she hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Even the prospect of having to get out of her engagement with David to go to the opening of his brother 's night club , which he , of course , had decorated , seemed less than terrifying . " I 'm wondering what your excuse will be , " David said calmly in his shop when she told him that she could not go , his long , agile fingers wrapping a heavy piece of gold material . " You know how important tomorrow is to me . I 'm hoping you will have made up a story worthy of both of us . " It would never have occurred to her not to tell David the truth . His powers of perception were too uncanny . But she did not deceive herself that he would be nice about it . Supreme as he considered the excuse of sex to justify himself for breaking in and out of engagements , she knew that he would not extend it to her . IIc depended on her , more than she on him ; it was partial proof of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their being rivals in the pursuit of his own sex . It was as if he knew that her victory was preordained , that it behooved him , in protection of his kind , to keep her behind the chaste walls of his cynically constructed shrine . " I have a date with Timmy Colt . " He fixed his green eyes on her coldly . " Is that any reason for adopting his vulgar idioms ? " he demanded . " I 'm surprised at you , Eileen . " " All right , " she said meekly . " I have an engagement . " " That 's better . " He nodded . " A subsequent engagement , I take it ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " And this Timmy Colt . He is the lawyer with the wonderful  | wife who was sick on your mother 's bed ? " " They 've separated . " " Already ? " David raised his eyebrows . " You 're a fast worker , my dear . " " Oh , David , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You fancy him ? " She nodded . " I thought as much . " He shrugged his shoulders with an air of weariness . " I could see it starting that night . You ca n't fool old David , you know . " " Do I try ? " " No . Not yet anyway . But you 're a deep one . Well , run along and hold hands with your Timmy . I release you for tomorrow night . However , I question your taste . " " But you liked him yourself ! " she protested . " You said so ! " David held up his hands with a pained expression . " It always amazes me how even the subtlest of your sex , and you are that , my dear , lack taste in matters of the heart . That was a very crude remark . However , you may bring him to the opening if you wish . " Eileen , however , did not wish it . When Timmy called for her the following evening , looking brushed and scrubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she offered no demurrer to the expensive restaurant that he suggested . She had no wish to disconcert him even slightly with alternatives . He was a bit slow and careful with the ordering , but she had determined not to be bright and helpful , with the attendant danger of seeming condescending . She ordered what he had ordered , with two slight changes to indicate that she was not simply following him ( that , too , might have been condescension ) and urged him to have a second cocktail while declining one for herself . And then at last she began to relax ; however constrained he might be she had a whole evening to reassure him . " You must have been going through a very difficult time , " she told him . " I do n't wish to pry , but I do want you to know I sympathize . With both you and your wife . As I think I told you , I 've been through it myself . " " You 're not prying , " he assured her hastily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really seem to have anyone to talk about it with , except Mother . And she 's no help because she 's never  | really liked Ann . But I do n't want to bore you . " " You wo n't . Everyone 's interested in other people 's marriages . " So he told her . He told her about Mr. Knox and the Emlen deal and about Ann 's making him apologize to Sheridan . He told her about their old life and the one they had been leading more recently . He told her about Ann 's bitterness and her decision to leave him . Eileen was at first fascinated , then appalled . She had never conceived of her cousin , George , or of her stepfather as they might have appeared to people like the Colts ; not having been able to take her family quite seriously , she had never imagined their impact on dependents , employees . Now she found it shocking . " I thought everyone knew that George was a horror , " she said musingly . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand apologies ! Fantastic ! " " But that 's not the point , " he continued , arguing more warmly as he proceeded . " I 'm not worried about your cousin or whether or not he was justified . That 's simply the way people like him are . I 've made my peace with them . It 's Ann who ca n't . She 's so appallingly stubborn . She did n't like our old life , and she ca n't face the new . " " Is n't there some middle ground ? " she asked dubiously . " Well , you know how women are . " She looked at his large , grey indignant eyes and smiled . " Do I ? " " Oh , I do n't mean women like you , " he protested quickly . " That 's what struck me about you immediately . You 're different . You 're more accepting . More philosophic . " " Not always to my advantage . " She paused , reflecting how odd it seemed that two people could separate over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if he was not still in love with his wife . " I think that you and Ann are going to work this out , " she made herself say . " With time . " " I do n't know , " he said moodily . " I do n't know if I want it any more . You see , Eileen ? " He paused and then laughed . It was the same shy laugh that she had noticed at the party , the  | one that stripped his face of almost too many years . " I want to learn about things , now I 've started . All the things I 've been too busy to care about . Concerts . Theatres . Art galleries . Attractive people . " He laughed again . " I guess that sounds awfully hick . " She smiled . " Rather pleasantly hick . " " And here 's the thing , " he continued eagerly . " I thought maybe you 'd help me . " He looked down suddenly at the table , really embarrassed now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have missed me the other night at your mother 's . Or maybe that was just a bit of polish . Good manners . " " Oh , no . I meant it . " " Then maybe we could go to a couple of concerts together ? " he asked , his face brightening . " Or plays ? Maybe you 'd take me in hand for a bit ? " " I think it 's a charming idea , " she said , laughing quickly as if to spill some of the emotion out of her head . She felt quite giddy . " Except that I need your tutoring quite as much as you do mine . It 's a fifty-fifty proposition . " " What could I teach you ? " " Oh , so much ! " she exclaimed earnestly . " You 've taught me so much already . About my own family ! " She paused as the waiter put down the bill . " Shall we go ? " she asked , but seeing his face fall , added : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the front hall they met her stepfather standing in the doorway to his study in a red evening jacket , a pipe between his teeth , and she had the odd sense of being a girl again , coming home late to a father who had waited up . Except , of course , that Sheridan had never waited up . " Good evening , Sheridan ! " Timmy said , a bit boisterously . " We 've been out on the town ! " " Do n't see how you do it , " Dale answered with a grunt . " After a full day at the office , too . Of course , you 're not exactly my age . " " Has Mummy gone to bed ? " Eileen asked , trying still to retain her moment of nostalgia . " Like all sensible people . Where I 'm going . " He nodded  | good night and ambled on down the corridor to his bedroom , implying with a shrug of his shoulders a most matter-of-fact curiosity , an attitude of : I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're on your own , and do n't blame me . Timmy followed her into the great living room that seemed so strangely smaller as it showed its unwonted emptiness to the sudden light that she switched on . The Italian chairs , huddled in groups , were gauntly awake . She went over to open the black carved cabinet that was a bar and was placing ice in the glasses when he put his hand on her bare shoulders . " Eileen , " he murmured and kissed her on the cheek . When she made no movement to resist , he turned her around and kissed her on the lips . There was a stifled , smothered quality in his passion , a violence in his need that had to do too little with her and too much with his loneliness . Yet it might have been just this that so nearly overwhelmed her . She saw the black again after the candlelight years and with a sudden gasp pulled herself away from him . " You 're a nice boy , Timmy , " she said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing people . " " I do n't , " he retorted . " Since I married . " She finished mixing the drinks and put one in his hand . " Is that true ? " " I swear it . " " You do n't have to swear to me , " she said , going over to the sofa . " I 'm not entitled to it . But you knew you were going to kiss me tonight , did n't you ? " " Did n't you ? " He came over and sat opposite her . " I could see you thinking about it all during dinner , " she continued . " How you would do it . When you would do it . Obviously it was to be the symbol of something . Of your break with Ann , I suppose . Your new life . " " You 're very analytical . " " Am I very wrong ? " " No , I do n't suppose so . " He thought for a moment . " But analyzing things does n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you any less real , " she agreed , a bit dryly.  | " To me , anyway . That 's what you have n't considered . What you might be doing to me . You 've been full of yourself tonight , Timmy . " " I 'm sorry , " he said , taking a sip of his drink as he watched her . " It 's your fault , really . For listening so well . " " Which makes me a kind of accessory , does n't it ? " she mused . " After the fact , or whatever you call it . I 'm to help you prove something about yourself . " " Do n't grudge me that , Eileen . " " Should n't I ? " She became passive . " It is n't considered sportsmanlike , you know , to catch someone on quite such an obvious rebound . I should throw you back in the water . But I wonder if I can . I wonder who 's caught whom . " " Do n't underestimate yourself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I quite see my own rather conventional role in your picture . I do n't exist , really . Just a sympathetic ear . " " Much more , " he insisted . " You could n't be just that . " " But if I 'm anything more , I 'm a homebreaker ! " she cried . " Of a broken home ? " " Oh , it 's not broken , " she said bitterly . " It 's scratched , that 's all . " He looked gloomily into his glass . " I 'm not sure of that . " " And where does that leave me ? " she continued . " What can I do now ? " " Go back to where we were at the restaurant , " he said , looking up eagerly . " Back to the idea of your educating me . I 'll be good . I promise . " Looking at his anxious eyes she wondered if he might not mean it . Around her , in the dark corners of the great room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment in her heart . But if he really meant it , she said defiantly , half to herself and half to David 's shadow , was there any reason for not doing as he asked ? " Well , it 's a large and lonely city , " she said at last with a shrug , directed half angrily at her own skepticism . " I do n't really see why two people who want to be ca n't be friends .  | As a matter of fact , " she said , putting down her glass , " I do n't really see why we do n't start right now . Let 's get our coats . It 's not even midnight . I 'm taking you to a night club opening . Do n't worry , " she added with just a suggestion of sarcasm , " it 'll be part of the education . All the best people . Even Sheridan would approve ! "  | TIMMY was good to his word , and Eileen to hers . They were soon meeting twice , even three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged , she managed to make him feel that what she was doing was something terribly stupid . It was hard for him to tell if she meant this , for her manners were so uncannily good , but if manners were that good , he began to wonder , how much did sincerity matter ? He had never known anyone remotely like her . She seemed , at first blush , to stand for everything in the world that he lacked and hence distrusted : ease , poise , cultivation ; he did n't see , basically , that they had a single thing in common , yet it was impossible not to yield to those clear blue eyes when they appealed to him , whether the issue was a piece of modern sculpture or a salad dressing , as if his judgment must , of course , be superior to her own for the simple reason that he was a man . Lying awake at night in a truculent mood , he could even sneer at her cult of the external , call her mannered , meretricious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a seemingly unaffected pleasure as she spotted him in the lobby , the restaurant , wherever it was that they met , he faced anew the depth of his problem . For whatever Eileen was , she was not meretricious . His own life at this period would have been quite impossible without her . The loneliness of an office without Knox and a hotel room without his family would have driven him back to Ann on any terms . As it was , he had a sense of unreality , of  | time suspended , of a void slowly and hypnotically filled with the perfume of Eileen . He had never imagined that a person like himself could possess anything as lovely as her , and the fact that he still did not , however frustrating , did not strike him as basically unreasonable . It even intensified his sense of playing a romantic part against a handsome backdrop that smelled only gently of paint , a sense , too , that was compatible with the postponement of other decisions . If Eileen seemed to ask for nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been churlish to refuse ? Her tact was such that he did not mind her educating him , even though he had asked her to . Her attitude seemed to be that if he had so much of the " real " world , a measureless superiority in things " downtown " that truly counted , he should not begrudge her the opportunity of a few small hints in the science of beautiful things . For beauty , he saw , was everything to Eileen , beauty in her surroundings , in painting and music , beauty in the wearing of a scarf , a jewel , beauty even in the arrangement of a cocktail party . Sometimes it occurred to him that she might be confusing beauty with elegance , that she was preferring the atmosphere of beautiful things to the things themselves , but it was never as simple as that . He always came back to this , that Eileen was not simple . When he watched her at one of the Fifty-seventh Street galleries which they visited on Saturday afternoons , her face so intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal relation with an abstract painting , he had to concede that it was more than the faddism which he had suspected to underlie the world of modern art . And once looking himself at a strange crisscross of blue and grey lines called " Seaport , " he had a sudden sense of the East River gleaming under its dark , dirty bridges . It was literally the first reaction of his life to a painting ; he even wanted to buy it until she intervened . " But why not ? " he protested . " You 're always saying the first test is to like something . To relax and like it . All right , I have relaxed , and I do like it . " " I never said to buy everything you like . " " So there ! " he exclaimed . " It is snobbery , after all ! We can  | like what we like , but we buy what others do . Is that it ? " " Not at all , " she said , smiling at his indignation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change now . Wait for two weeks and then buy it if you still like it . " " But it may be gone ! " She glanced at the little canvas with an appraising eye . " I wonder . " And , of course , she had been right . Two weeks later the picture was still there and his enthusiasm was gone . She began to take him to the houses of her friends . It took him a little time to grasp that she moved in more than one world , that her friends were literary , even political , as well as what he rather slightingly called " social . " He had assumed that Eileen led the buzzing existence of a gilded insect at the top only of their vast cage ; it had been rather humiliating to have to concede that her life was broader than his own . She had a remarkable tolerance of people which extended even to their prejudices , however narrow and whether to the right or left . The only thing in the world that she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cruelty she judged by the amount of pain that it caused , never by the alleged motive for which it was inflicted . But if her friends were varied they had in common an aptitude for accepting him easily which he suspected might be more a tribute to Eileen than to himself . " That painter friend of yours , Max whatever-his-name-is , is certainly frank , " he told her one night on their way home from a studio party . " He congratulated me on our affair . " He glanced over to see her change of expression . " Oh , I suppose so , " she said quickly , caught , as she rarely was , by embarrassment . " He would , of course . Heaven only knows how many affairs he 's attributed to me since my divorce . " " But that 's just the point . He has n't . He thinks I 'm your first . " She gave him a brief , startled look and then shrugged again . " Oh , well , who cares ? " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should I ? "  | " Well , that 's a new one , " he confessed . " Most people do n't mind the idea as much as the talk . You 're just the opposite . " " I have no objection to ? well , to those things as such . " The subject was obviously distasteful to her . " But you and I , of course , have a special deal . " " Because of Ann ? " " I do n't say only because of Ann , " she said with a shadow of a smile . " You 're very self-confident , my friend . But we need n't go into it . Ann alone is a good and sufficient reason . " " Because you wo n't be the cause for my not going back ? " " Timmy , we 've been through all this . " " I know , " he said impatiently . " But do you think having an affair is the only way to keep a man from his wife ? " She became very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " she murmured . " There are millions of ways , " he said with sudden roughness , " and you know them all . But what I 'm trying to get you to realize is that they have no application here . You and Ann are two entirely different parts of me . Whatever happens between me and Ann will not be your doing . That I promise you . " " I 've heard that , " she said almost wistfully . " That men have watertight compartments in their hearts . It 's inconceivable to me , but that does n't mean it is n't so . " She paused , looking down at the evening bag in her lap . " I think I 'd like to believe it . " " Ask your friend David . " " Oh , David , " she said with a shrug . " What does he know about the heart ? " When David Fairchild went out to dinner with them , as he occasionally did , he never seemed in the least aware that his presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first was disturbed , disapproving . He did not know quite what to make of this paradoxical and opinionated young man . But he was afraid of seeming provincial in Eileen 's eyes by being put out of countenance by a homosexual , and this , combined with David 's unflagging good spirits and his seeming  | determination to make Timmy like him , produced in the end something like a friendship . Timmy had to admit that it was flattering for a downtown lawyer to be cultivated , even if Eileen was the motive , by a man so esteemed in the world for his wit and taste . It was true that whenever he admired the wrong things or confessed his total ignorance of such a field as ballet , David would mock him as a philistine , but as he always included Eileen in the same category , it made Timmy feel unexpectedly closer to her . One night when they had dropped her at the Dales ' , David went up to Timmy 's hotel room for a nightcap . He sat cross-legged on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter poured the drinks . " Do you always leave Eileen home like that ? " he demanded . " Do n't you ever take her here ? " " Does it offend you ? " " Gracious no . But poor girl , it must be terribly frustrating for her . " Timmy laughed , surprised at his own ability to make light of it . " It 's quite by her choice , I assure you . " " Is it ? Then I must have been building false hopes . I was thinking that deep down you might be in my boat . " Timmy noted the glitter in his eyes as he handed him a drink . David was quite serious now . A month before he would have thrown him out for such an insinuation ; now it was simply a part of his new world . " Deep down I may be in anyone 's boat , David , " he said easily . " But as long as it 's in the subconscious , it does n't do you much good , does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " David threw back his head and laughed . " I like you , Tim , " he said , apparently giving it up . " I 've heard the way you are downtown . Hard and ruthless . A machine of efficiency . That 's the way people ought to be . I ca n't stand slop . " " I do a job . That 's all . " " Do n't be modest . It bores me . I 'd like to be a lawyer and tell people what to do . And it 's the way into politics . I 'd adore to be in politics . " " Maybe you will be . "  | " A decorator ? " David sneered , looking about the room . " Fat chance . There 'd have to be a revolution in sexual mores before I got the vote . But in the meantime , " he continued with a shrug , " I suppose I can make myself useful . We must get you an apartment , and I 'll fix it up . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't afford it , David . I have a family to support . " But David raised a hand to quell opposition . " You ca n't go on in this rathole . That 's for sure . My services will be free , and the material a bargain . " " But I ca n't just accept that , David , I ? " " I will only be doing it half for you , my dear Timmy , " the other interrupted firmly . " The other half will be for Eileen . If you ever decide to put your relations with that poor child on a healthier basis , I want her to have an attractive place to go to . She cares so . " David was good to his word . In a week 's time he had turned up a garden apartment in a rent-controlled building which was only twice as expensive as Timmy 's hotel room . He and Eileen argued hotly about how to decorate it , without in the least consulting Timmy , but as she was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ideas generally prevailed , and David was forced to limit his plans to a black and gold screen and Empire brackets that Timmy regarded with the profoundest distrust . When he was settled , however , he had to concede the improvement over his former quarters and felt quite touched at all David had done . He was ashamed to admit to his helpful friends how expensive he had found the whole project . " He 's really a good guy , " he told Eileen . " It 's just that he 's afraid to show it . " " Too afraid , " she agreed . " That 's why I worry about David . If you play at being mean too long , can you really believe you 're not ? " He was learning to value her concern about whether or not people were mean . In fact , one of the most important parts of their relationship was the fact that she made him feel like  | a " nice " person again . It was hardly a feeling promoted by his weekly visits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their separation , would look at him with the same eyes of misty gloom that he attributed to the shade of Henry Knox . The boys , too , now fully aware of the situation between their parents , seemed to take their mother 's side without ever having been asked to ; they were less communicative with him and totally unconfiding . He assumed in his heart that he would ultimately go back to them ; anything else was inconceivable even in the strangeness of his present mood , but ultimately was not now . Ann , after all , had been the one to ask for it , and there was a perverse satisfaction in making out his life as gayer than it was , in underlining , before her lengthening face , the fact that he was still not through with it . He even went to the extreme of mentioning Eileen to her as a person who was " fun to do things with . " " I remember her , " Ann said in a flat voice . " She 's very beautiful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said in an easy tone . " She 's been able to hammer some modern art into my thick skull . And that takes something . " " I could have done that . But you never wanted to go to exhibitions . " " I guess I have more time now , " he said uncomfortably . " I see . I suppose you 're in love with her . " " Oh , it 's nothing like that . " He did all he could to keep his tone light . " That husband of hers gave her a terrible time . Eileen 's through with love . " " A sabbatical , no doubt , " she retorted . " Which can be interrupted at any time . Oh , Timmy , " she cried suddenly , " you do n't know anything about people like that ! You take them at face value ! " " I have n't got your social experience , in other words ? " " It 's not that , " she said , relapsing into flatness . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After this conversation he could not endure the prospect of an evening alone . Particularly as it had been followed by  | a day in the office again ringing with the shrill protests of the outraged chief file clerk over the Dale reorganization . He hurried uptown to find Eileen in the small French drawing room that her mother allotted to her , looking up from a book and murmuring : " Why , you poor thing , you look exhausted . Let 's not go out . Let 's stay here and listen to records . " And sitting with a drink while she put on Monteverdi and Bach , he told of his frenetic day and she of her more quiet one , and he felt the peace of it , the temporary , almost euphoric peace , as if he was in the bosom of a loving family with Eileen 's sympathy forever to be counted upon , as if Clarissa popping in and out , just conscious of his existence , and Dale , passing in the corridor with a cigar , an accepting nod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying at once to keep out of the way and still to know what was going on . If it was only a fantasy world , it was a surprisingly robust one .  | DAVID FAIRCHILD 'S " shop , " as he called it , consisted of the lower two stories of a brownstone on East Sixty-third Street , just off Madison . The old stoop had been removed , and a freshly painted red door with a huge knocker peered out from under a blue and white striped awning with the woven legend " David S. Fairchild , III . " In the back was a chaste white office with a black lacquer table where David went to be alone with his ideas . In the front was pandemonium . Coffee was served at all hours of the working day , and the ladies who came in periodically to perch on the edge of David 's chair were known as the best-informed ladies in the city . Anita Ferguson had pushed her way one morning into the privacy of David 's back study . This was typical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no sense of when she was n't wanted , of enough being enough . Her easily hurt , hostile , darting eyes seemed the only co-ordinating elements in her big , slope-shouldered , ungainly form . " The curtains have n't come for the dining room , " she began . " Neither has that blue rug . What 's happened , David ? " " You know perfectly well what 's happened , " he said coolly . " I was n't joking the other day . As a matter of fact , despite what people say , I never joke . " " But you know my credit is good ! " " I know you have n't paid a bill in six months . To me or anyone else . " " But I will . It 's just that Hank needs all he can get for his  | business . " Anita seemed honestly outraged . " Everyone knows they 'll get paid eventually ! " " You mean when your mother dies ? " he asked with a thin smile . " She 'll bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost every penny you 've given him . Do you think I do n't know that you 're living on an allowance from your mother right now ? " " You think you know everything , do n't you ? " she sneered . " But you do n't know that one of our trusts falls in when Lolita is thirty-five . Next month . Then I 'll pay . Ask your friend Timmy ! " David shrugged . " I will . And I 'll ask him at the same time what the chances arc of 1-lank getting his hot little hands on it before your creditors . " Anita was peering at herself in a looking glass , screwing her lips up to check on her make-up . David surveyed her with scorn . She preferred , however condescendingly , the company of homosexuals where she could feel rejected because of their tastes rather than her own plainness , where she could pretend that she was more than a poor creature who had been married for money that was already spent . " Are n't you taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lipstick and applying it to her lips . " I know you 're cock of the walk and all that , but Mama still counts for something around New York . " She turned to him suddenly . " Or did n't you know ? " " I think I can count on your mother in any showdown between us , Anita , " he retorted . " Children begin to lose some of their appeal when they get cross and middle-aged . " " I wonder how much you can count on Mama , " Anita suggested , thoroughly angry now . " When she finds that you 've been promoting an affair between her niece and her ducky boy lawyer ! " " She knows all about that . Obviously we could n't wait until she heard your version . And what 's more , she thoroughly approves . You 're jealous of Eileen , Anita . You always have been . Because she 's sweet and good-tempered and everyone loves her . "  | " I wonder if I 'm the one who 's really jealous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she 's got , that is . Was n't he rather your friend , her precious Timmy ? " " Really , Anita , you 're too cheap to be borne , " he said disgustedly . " Clear out , will you ? I 'm busy . " Anita left with a high , sneering laugh , and he sat quickly down at his desk , determined not to have his day ruined . He had won , had n't he ? She would never get those curtains now . Unless , of course , she paid . He closed his eyes and tried to visualize the foyer of the hotel in Cleveland that he was doing ; it rose suddenly in bold colors with a fresco that he had n't fully seen before . Quickly he made notes . It was at such moments between telephone calls and fantasies , with closed eyes , that his best ideas came . And relaxing , his thoughts shifted to Timmy and Eileen and his own obsession with their love . The door opened , and one of his girls came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David . " " Mrs. Colt ? " He went to the door and saw Ann . She was standing alone , gazing with a troubled air at the group of coffee drinkers in the corner . " Have you changed your mind ? " he asked , stepping up to her . " Have you decided on a David Fairchild room ? " She started . " Oh , Mr. Fairchild , could I see you alone ? Please . " He gazed at her quizzically , shrugged and led her back to his office . " I want you to tell me about Timmy and Mrs. Shallcross , " she began as soon as he had closed the door . " Why me ? " " Because I know you see them all the time . And because I liked you when I met you at Mrs. Dale 's , " she said anxiously . " I thought you were sympathetic . And nice . " Half touched , exasperated , he looked away from her worried stare . " I 'm not nice , " he said firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people today go about insisting that one is nice . " Bat no , David , he had to tell himself ; it was bad Oscar Wilde .  | " And besides , you 're the only person I know who can tell me . " " What is it precisely that you wish to know ? " " Well is he ? is he seeing a good deal of her ? " " You mean are they having an affair ? " She looked down dejectedly . " I do n't know . I do n't speak that language . All right , " she continued with an air of almost childish resolution , looking up at him . " Are they ? " The limpid misery in her eyes held him uncomfortably . " I assume so , " he said impatiently . " Is n't it rather a waste of time otherwise ? " " I see , " she said in a low voice . " You 'd be on her side , of course . " " But it 's not a question of sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a question of sex . Honestly , you married women are the limit ! You catch a handsome boy young and want to keep him in a box for the rest of his life . You have the home , the children , the respectability , the social approval , even the money , but no , it 's not enough . You must have undeviating fidelity as well . You think your world is coming to an end because Timmy sleeps with Eileen . You do n't know what trouble is ! " " But it 's not only me ! " she exclaimed , as worked up now as he . " It 's Timmy 's whole life I 'm worried about . You remember how we discussed it at the Dales ' ? " Remember ! My God , he thought , the egotism that lay behind humility ! How could he remember ? " I 'm afraid not . " " I told you how he was beginning to care about all the wrong things , " she continued breathlessly . " Appearances and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shallcross . Will she help that ? " " Eileen is one of the finest people I 've ever known , " he retorted stuffily . Ann 's features were vivid with disbelief . " But the world she lives in . It 's not good for him , is it ? " " My world ? " " Oh , but , Mr. Fairchild , you can handle it . You know all  | its tricks and turns . But my Timmy never will ! He 's so literal . So stubbornly consistent ! " " And what am I to do about that , pray ? " She faltered before his stare . " Could n't you sort of ? keep an eye on him ? " she begged . " Because I 'm nice ' ? " " Exactly ! " " Really , " he burst out , " it 's too much ! You come into my shop on a hectic business morning and make me behave like a complete heel , telling you a lot of nonsense about Timmy and Eileen . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my bad taste , you have the nerve to tell me I 'm nice . ' And the unkindness to believe it ! " " If I only knew someone was keeping an eye on him , " she protested , " someone I could occasionally see , it would make such a difference ! " Looking at her in perplexity for a long moment , he finally gave up . " I tell you what I 'll do , my dear . I 'll give you a tip . An invaluable tip . A tip that could save your marriage . " " Oh , Mr. Fairchild ! " He raised a hand to keep her quiet , a teacher lecturing to a child , the other behind his back as though hiding the rewarding candy . " The trouble with you wives is that you feel entitled to your husbands . And the moment you feel entitled to a thing , you ca n't be bothered to fight for it . You howl instead for justice . " " But I do n't feel entitled to Timmy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt good enough for him . " " Do n't give me that , " he warned her . " That mock humility . It 's only a smoke screen to fool yourself . It does n't fool anyone else . Right this minute you 're throbbing with the outrage of Timmy 's unfaithfulness . Not the pain of it , mind you . The outrage ! " " All right , " she murmured , faltering before his hard stare . " What should I do ? " " Be nice to him ! " he exclaimed . " Just as nice as you can be . It 's as simple as that . Oh , do n't be whimperingly nice . Do n't  | be slobbily , self-pityingly nice . Do n't affect sad airs and say : Go your way . I only want your happiness . ' Be a sport . Pull yourself together and be what you naturally are . The healthy , hearty type . " " But how can I compete with her ? " " Oh , she 's not so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen . I would n't be surprised if Timmy has n't started to already . " " But why ? " " Because she 's a goddess ! " he exclaimed . " And mortals do n't really like goddesses . With reason , too . Read your mythology . They always play it rough . Turning us into tree trunks and things . " " A goddess , " she said slowly . " You really are on her side , are n't you ? " " In my devious way , perhaps . But you can trust me . You see , I want to turn her into a tree trunk . A pretty Dresden tree trunk . " " So you can have her for yourself ? " " All right . If you will have your sentiment . So I can have her for myself . " " Thank you , Mr. Fairchild , " she said , picking up her purse . " I think you 've really tried to help me . And I 'm going to try the impossible . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit all that day . He thought about it through the afternoon and evening , and even that night , when he lay in bed , on the coverlet of squirrel furs that he had not bothered to remove , he thought of Ann 's brooding eyes and that foolish brown hat with the absurd feather . What business , really , did such a creature have to come barging into his life with her luminous reproach , making him feel the very throb of her wounds ? Was she a woman hurt as he had wanted women to be hurt and did he take the guilt of his wishes on himself ? Was that what a psychiatrist would say ? Or was he really , in some wild , perverted fashion , falling in love with her ? And then he sat up abruptly at the sudden picture that flooded his mind of Eileen , with her  | alabaster skin , lying inertly in Timmy 's arms , neither in the least aware of him , obliterating him in their act . Him maybe , he thought , trembling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to worry about , coached by himself ! And feverishly he pictured Eileen 's dumb misery and Ann 's subservient gratefulness ; he saw the latter coming into his shop to give him some humble , tasteless present , begging him to accept it as a token of her and her children 's feeling . Oh , you great , brave creature , he cried aloud in his disgust , falling back on the bed , you gaudy peacock with the heart of gold !  | TIMOTHY was gradually becoming used to his new life . It had a quality of unexpected serenity . As long as he continued to regard it , as Ann had authorized him to , as a recess in their marriage , a period of stock-taking , there was nothing that had to be done about it . If his marriage was eventually to be resumed , and he continued , however evasively , to take this for granted , it began to assume the aspect of a heavenly reward to a light believer , a solace , but only to be contemplated in moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less apt to work at night , of an evening planned by Eileen was more absorbing . Even his office life had improved . People were beginning to accept the reorganization . He had only been unpopular , in fact , for the contrast to his former self ; once that was forgotten , which took only a few months , there was nothing really for people to dislike . The downtown world , a masculine world , was notoriously easy to please . But best of all was the change in Ann . She had put away her expression of reproach and talked quite pleasantly now on his visits . The old nervousness , of course , was still there , underneath , and she did make him feel a bit like an elderly , formidable relative to whom she had been told to be polite , but it was better than the way she had been . The apartment , moreover , was astonishingly improved . The electric train had been removed , and the broken crystal on the mantelpiece clock changed . The books were all placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cleaned . It gave him a pang to see how light and worn it looked ; he was shocked at the degree to 9 It  | which Eileen had heightened his perceptions . " I 've never seen the old place looking so well , " he told Ann . " I guess I must have been the messy one . " " No , it was me all right , " she replied with a rather determined cheerfulness . " But people can change . How 's your place ? " " Oh , fine , " he said evasively . " And speaking of apartments , I really do n't want you and the boys to go on living down here . I can afford something better now . Something uptown . I think we ought to consider putting the boys in a private school , too , do n't you ? " To his surprise , she seemed to accept this . " All right . But do n't you want them to finish out the year where they are ? " " Oh , sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly . " That 'll give me plenty of time to look into schools . Mrs. Knox will help me , I 'm sure . " He felt obscurely deflated . " Well , that 's dandy , " he said after a pause . " I do n't know why , but I thought we 'd have a scene about it . I had an idea you 'd cling to the old place . " " Oh , now it 's only memories , " she said quickly . " I do n't have any real friends here except Sally Duane . And they 're moving uptown . I think it 's hard on you to have to pay for two apartments , but I 'll have time . I should be able to get a bargain . And there are some courses I want to take at Columbia . " He looked down at the rug , making out the slight shadow where the old inkstain had been . " Then the present arrangement ? I mean about you and me ? is all right ? For the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce ? Or a legal separation ? " " Oh , no ! " Glancing up , he saw that she had paled . " Why would 1 ? " " Well , about money , and things like that . " " Oh , but I know you 'll always take care of me and the boys , " she protested , and then hesitated . " But maybe you want a divorce ? " He looked at her sharply . " Why do you say that ? Because of Eileen ? "  | She nodded , avoiding his eyes . " There 's no reason you should n't see her . " " You do n't mind ? " " Of course I mind . " She looked back at him more boldly now . " But I have no right to mind , that 's the point . That 's what happens to wives who are foolish enough to leave their husbands . " " Oh ? You admit it was foolish ? " " I admit it was idiotic . " " And now you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " It was his turn to avoid her frank , searching stare . " There 's never been anyone but you for me and never will be . I 'm one of those girls . The sticky type . I just lost my head when I said we 'd separate . That 's all . But nonetheless I lost it . That 's what I have to face . Along with the possibility that you may never think it worth your while to come back . " He got up abruptly and started pacing the room . " Ann , you 've got to give me time . You 've got to give me time ! " " I do n't have to give it to you . It 's yours already . To do as you please with . " " I may not need much . I may only need a few weeks , months . I do n't know . But I ca n't come back yet . " He stopped pacing and turned on her almost passionately . " I ca n't come back yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you see that ? " There was a long pause . " Yes , Timmy , " she said calmly . " I can see it . " " You 're an extraordinary girl , " he said , again deflated . " The most extraordinary girl I 've ever known . " " Perhaps not quite , " she answered with a small smile , and he changed the subject abruptly . When he left her , after half an hour of constrained talk about the boys , his only thought was that he did n't want to think . That he could n't afford to . He decided in the taxi to go straight to a party that Eileen was giving . He was n't dressed , but they would have finished dinner , and , anyway , he was wearing a dark suit . Hell , he did n't care . He felt suddenly the need to defy Eileen .  | It was not at all , he could tell immediately , as he entered the big living room , with the exception of David , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a perfect blend , not to mix her groups . Too careful , he reflected a bit sourly as he looked around . Tonight there was none of the brittle chatter of the fashion magazine world ; in fact , there was no chatter at all . There was a respectful half-circle around Sheldon Pratt , a smooth , long , already greying gentleman not more than ten years older than himself , who had already been an assistant secretary of state and was now a partner in a law firm similar in size to Sheffield , Dale but of a more conservative tone , a firm , for example , where Dale himself would have been unthinkable . Pratt was politely if somewhat pedagogically answering questions as to the state of the world . It was a habit of Eileen 's , picked up from political hostesses , to feature one guest , and she could be very firm about it . She had just smiled to him when he came in ; now she was gazing at Mr. Pratt , one elbow on her knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheldon , " she asked , " if the government woke up tomorrow and found that Red China somehow had been recognized , that it was a fait accompli , in other words , deep down they might be just a bit relieved ? " " Oh , I think quite a bit , not just a bit , " Pratt answered easily , looking around the room . " I wo n't be quoted , will I ? The Republicans would have my scalp . All I mean is , the problem would be solved . " Timmy began to be irritated . It had never been his habit to think very deeply on international subjects ; his preoccupation with immediate legal problems had interfered . When he did , however , he was inclined to be isolationist , a right-ofcenter Republican , not a McCarthyite . He knew what this group was , Eileen 's favorite , a handful of highly tailored , highly mannered , highly serious but surprisingly young and good-looking women married to older , abler husbands of inherited means and Democratic persuasions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They gave him the benefit of too many doubts . It was taken for granted  | that any friend of Eileen 's would believe in all the " right " things , a strong military , high taxes and federal aid to almost everything . He glanced around at Dale , but the latter was impassive . Obviously , it was Eileen 's party , and there was to be no interference . Timmy got up and walked , not on tiptoe , into the dining room to pour himself a drink . " That was all I needed , an example , " he heard David 's voice behind him . " Why did n't I walk out ? " David poured a great deal of whiskey into a large glass . " When will that little group learn that liberalism is vieux jeu ? They 're so drearily nineteen-thirty . " " And Eileen swallows it all , " Timmy agreed . " That 's what gets me . She wears a liberal opinion as if it was a new hat . " " So you 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspiciously . " Found out what ? " " That to Eileen appearance is everything . Taste is God . That hers is the profoundest kind of superficiality . She must dress well , walk well , eat well , think well , pray well . Not to the eyes of others , but to her own . It makes for a wearing life . Because she 's an exacting judge . " " I suppose it 's all a substitute for something , " Timmy said uneasily . " Do n't be too sure ! You think she 'd give it all up for you ? Not on your life , man . If you were starving , she would n't let you make a thirteenth at table . " " Unless I was an assistant secretary of state , " Timmy retorted bitterly and went back into the living room . He saw Eileen turn her head to gaze at him quizzically for a moment . Then she looked again at Mr. Pratt . He felt a flicker of pride beneath his irritation that he was enough a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if I might ask you something , Mr. Pratt , " he said suddenly and felt the eyes of the halfcircle turn on him . " By all means . " " Well , I may be wrong , but I seem to detect a feeling in the room that we all have to be led by the nose by a few enlightened internationalists . As if we were children being persuaded to get our feet wet . Now is n't it possible , just possible , 1  | mind you , that the majority could sometimes be right ? This Red China issue , for example . Why should we recognize a bunch of bandits ? " Mr. Pratt became painfully polite . " Well , it seems to me , Mr. Colt , you 've really asked several questions in one . In the first place , let me say I quite agree about the bunch of bandits ? " And they were off , on a long and rather tangled discussion of relations with China , with others intermittently joining , the general temper growing gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrased , that he had no real point to make , only a prejudice and that by sticking argumentatively to it instead of really listening to Mr. Pratt , he was making a dismal impression on the room . Eileen for all her self-possession was manifestly uncomfortable ; she even tried to come to his rescue a couple of times with such remarks as : " I think what Timmy really means is ? " or , " I wonder if we 're not really all agreed that ? " But he would n't be helped . Stubborn , recalcitrant , he even managed to deepen the isolationism of his point of view before the evening was over . And when the Pratts finally rose to go , followed in quick succession by the rest of the party , he stayed on , sitting morosely with a drink before the yawning Dales and a rather ominously silent Eileen . " You 're quite an arguer , are n't you , Timmy ? " Clarissa asked . " I do n't think I 've ever heard you say half as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization that Mrs. Dale , of course , was the only person in the room that night who might have meant this as a compliment . " Rather too much , if you ask me , " Dale said dryly . " Not that I did n't agree with you , Tim . I did . I ca n't abide these pinko rich boys who dabble in appointive politics because they know they could n't get elected dogcatcher . But you let him put it all over you tonight . " " Oh , Sheridan , " Eileen protested warmly , " you ca n't call Sheldon Pratt a pinko ! " " I ca n't ? " Dale said , rising and winking at Timmy . " In my  | own house ? I 'd like to know why not . But anyway it 's too late to argue . I 'm going to bed . Will you turn out the lights , Eileen , if you 're going to sit up ? " " I think I 'll go , too , Sheridan . I 'm tired . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're coming out for a drink with me , Eileen . " All three stared at him . " Well , thank you , Timmy , " she said uncertainly . " But I 'm tired . " He suddenly had the feeling that his mood of rather childish pique had given him a new stature . The big room with its filled ashtrays and empty glasses had ceased to be formidable . Dale himself , yawning , was just another stout , tired lawyer and his wife , haggard under the eyes , under the foolish gloss of her golden hair , another weary hostess . " All right , " Eileen said quickly . " I 'll get my coat . " In the elevator she said nothing , only shaking her head when he started to speak , with the briefest glance at the elevator man 's back . Evidently she distrusted his mood . He wondered resentfully if there could be any grosser violation of her code than a betrayal of emotion to a subordinate . He , at least , he thanked Providence , had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at table because one 's maids were Catholic or money in the car unless the partition window was up . In his world anyone could hear anything . Why not ? " One drink , " she said as they came out of the building . " One drink and home . There 's that bar on Lexington . " He stopped a taxi and opened the door , placing a hand firmly under her elbow . " We 're not going to any crummy bar . We 're going to my place . " " Are n't we masterful tonight ? " she murmured , and got in . " I 've been led around by the nose long enough , " he said as they drove off . " The ring 's beginning to hurt . " " Who put it there ? Who came asking for lessons ? " " When I go to school , I still expect vacations . " " Why ? If attendance is voluntary ? " " Anyway , I think your friend Pratt 's an ass . "  | " Timmy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the driver 's back , and they finished the trip in silence . In his apalunent he went straight to the bar table while she seated herself on the small sofa , rather primly , he thought , spreading her red pleated skirt uninvitingly on either side . " You were ashamed of me tonight , were n't you ? " he demanded , turning to give her a glass . She looked at him calmly as she took it from him . " I 'm never ashamed of you , Timmy . I thought you were persistent , that 's all . " " And it 's vulgar to be persistent , is n't it ? Common ? " " They 're your labels . Not mine . " " Of course they 're yours , " he retorted angrily . " You may be too well bred to mention them , but you 're thinking them ! It 's in your whole demeanor . All you care about , Eileen , is what things look like ! " " I know that theory , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day I 'll be convinced of it . " " If you admitted it , you might be able to correct it . " " Do you want me to change , Timmy ? " she asked in a graver tone . " How would you like me to change ? " He sat leaning forward , his hands clasped between his knees , once more deflated . " Only to be less perfect , " he said mildly . " Maybe I 'd feel you were more accessible then . " " It seems to me I 've been fairly accessible . Let me tell you something now . Do n't believe everything David says . He 's very clever , but fundamentally he 's always wrong . He does n't really see people . He sees his bright little images of them . The images seem more exciting , but only temporarily . In the long run it 's the people themselves who count . " He looked up at her . " How do you know what he says about you ? " " I can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manger . He wants me all to himself . " " But he 's not interested , is he ? " he asked staring . " I mean , that way ? "  | " That 's just the reason . " He felt his heart beating faster as he watched her , so white , so extraordinarily still . " There 's one thing he 's not wrong about , " he blurted out . " And that is we 're kidding ourselves . " She looked up intently . " How ? " " About our being just friends . " " I 'm not kidding myself , " she said , glancing down again , " I have n't from the beginning . " " Then why do you keep me off ? " " Oh , you know , Timmy . You know ! " She suddenly closed her eyes and raised her hands to her cheeks . " You may think I 'm all glass and hard , but some things take effort . That took effort ! " He stood up suddenly , his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said roughly . " She has nothing to do with us . " Her eyes , open again , pleaded with him . " But that 's false , Timmy . It 's false ! " " Look . " He took a step nearer her . " I promised myself that if you came up here tonight ? well , that we 'd cease to be just friends . " There was a silence , and then she seemed suddenly to collapse . " Do n't you think I knew that ? " In a moment he was beside her on the sofa , his arms around her , his lips hard on hers . And she who had been so still , so seemingly passive , cane suddenly to life ; her fingers were in his hair , her body pressed against his . There was an urgency to her that took him by surprise ; it was as if to hide her from herself that he reached finally behind her to switch off the light . And he discovered in the hour that followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Eileen 's need for beauty was not confined to what she saw and heard . She was an artist in the act of giving herself .  | DALE DREW little squares on his office pad while he listened to George Emlen . They represented houses on a city street in his mind ; with a more sweeping motion of his pencil he now surrounded them with walls and more walls and then a moat . Then he started on another city . " Anita and Lolly want the readily marketable securities , " George was saying . He had been talking for several minutes about the distribution of one of the Emlen trusts , speaking in the rapid , rather excited tone that he used for such discussions . " It 's only natural . They want to sell them and give their husbands the money . Crazy , I grant you , but that 's their funeral . They do n't want the Fibre stock . It might take months , even years to get its true value in cash . So that 's my proposition . I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest . " " Have you had the stock appraised ? " " When Father died . It 's about sixty . But calling it sixty and getting sixty for it are two very different things . " " What do Anita and Lolly say to this ? " " Oh , they 're all for it . " " No doubt . " Dale finished the moat on the last town . " Women have a liking for ready cash . Very few of them know how to wait . For the larger rewards . " " Of course , I 'd be taking my chances , too , " George pointed out . " I ca n't be sure that Holcombe will want the Fibre stock . Obviously it 's not the kind of thing they can put in writing .  | But I 'm pretty sure they 'll come in with me in the dextron process ? " " I 'm not interested , " Dale interrupted roughly . " I 'm not in the least interested in your relations with Holcombe Textiles . Ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lolly and Anita are free , white and substantially over twenty-one . If you want to divide this trust among yourselves in some particular way that is mutually agreeable , all you have to do is tell me . I 'll see that it 's done . " " Sure , I know . " George did not seem in the least rebuffed by his tone . " I was only wondering about Timmy , that 's all . I never did quite approve of your putting him in as trustee after that scene at my club . He 's too volatile . " " Now , George , we 've been over this a dozen times before . Timmy is my responsibility . " " All right . All right . " George raised both hands to moderate his uncle 's irritation . " So long as you know what you 're doing , I 'm perfectly satisfied . So long as everything works out . And , by the way , I might just mention in passing that at the last board meeting at Holcombe I brought up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very favorably received . I think you could even shoot for a directorship . " " How you run on , George , " Dale said dryly , shaking his head . " How you do run on . " He continued to the end of the interview to treat George as a rather irrepressible child , but when he walked out to the reception hall with him afterwards he guided him slowly by the elbow in avuncular fashion . As every passing stenographer knew , few clients were similarly honored . Again in his office , Dale settled back in his chair with a cigar to contemplate the textile future . He was well satisfied with his interview with George . The only trouble had been in keeping him from saying too much . George had no delicacy ; like so many businessmen he had to underscore things . He had done well , it was true , with his inherited money ; his small ventures had made their mark in the textile world , but none knew better than his closely watching uncle how heavily  | trusts had considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be influenced in any such fashion as this . Now little George was going to have something that Holcombe wanted and wanted badly , and he would never have had it , either , if his uncle had n't pushed it under his very nose . It was all most satisfactory . After years of doing the bulk of Holcombe 's legal work while the main fees went to its sleepy and venerable general counsel in Boston , the situation would now be altered . Dale saw another puzzle solved , every piece in its place , the whole a shiny , seemingly indestructible solid . It was remarkable , he was even able to reflect , after the passage of so many years , with so many successes , how definite and heart filling the satisfaction still could be . After some moments of closer thought he rang the buzzer for Miss Schulze and dictated a memorandum to Timmy . I talked today with George Jr . about the Emlen No. 6 trust that falls in on Lolita 's thirty-fifth birthday . As you know , he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my understanding that the trust owns all the stock of Emlen Fibre , a family company that does a small but steady business in leasing textile patents . This stock , being closely held , is hard to value , but the Treasury accepted sixty for estate tax purposes in George 's father 's estate . George , being in the textile business himself and having some sentiment about family holdings , wants to keep the Fibre Company under his own control . The idea is that he will take all of its stock as his third , and the girls will divide the cash and marketable securities . This may give them a bulge over him on market values , but he does n't mind and will sign the necessary papers . The girls , of course , are delighted . 1 told him that you and his mother , as the trustees , would make the final decision , but that I was sure you would go along with the idea . Basically , as I see it , it 's the property of the Emlen children to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Textiles . George had succeeded his late father to Holcombe 's board , and the Emlen  | Timmy found this memorandum on his desk on a Friday evening as he was about to leave the office . When he called Dale he found that the latter had already left for Andover where his son , Eileen 's half-brother and the only child of Dale 's marriage to Clarissa , was playing in a football game . He studied the memorandum again thoughtfully . It troubled him . This particular trust was his first , and although it was not one of the big Emlen trusts , he had worked hard to justify the confidence reposed in so youthful a fiduciary . He had planned to make an even split in each holding , so that neither George nor his sisters could ever complain of unequal treatment . Now Dale was proposing that he do just the opposite . Even if he was covered , as he would be , by the family 's releases , he still did not like it . Why did George want the Fibre Company ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was certainly not true that he entertained any " sentiment " for family holdings . George had sentiment about nothing . After a restless hour alone , he called Larry and asked him to come in the following day for a piece of file research . " I 'm sorry , " he told his rather grumpy junior . " It 's probably a lot of nonsense , but I just do n't feel right about the thing . I 'll tell you about it in the morning . " That night he canceled his engagement with Eileen and went to a movie alone . He concentrated , however , very little on the screen ; it served only as the backdrop that he had meant it to be for his analysis of Emlcn facts . Taking as his basic premise that someone had to be unfairly benefited by the transfer of the Fibre stock , who was it ? The girls ? Clearly not . Their relations with their uncle were largely of a business nature ; Timmy had heard Dale 's complaints on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale was involved , he would not have lent himself to any plan that favored them . George , on the other hand , was close to his uncle ; they had worked together with mutual sympathy on many deals . George , if anyone , was obviously the person to be benefited , which could only mean that the Fibre stock was more of an asset than the girls , now so ready to give it  | up , possibly conceived . Yet how ? He knew the company , as controlling trustee , backwards and forwards ; it had not paid a dividend in two years and he had retained it only because a satisfactory price had not been available . Its benefit to George , if benefit there was , had to stem from some peculiarity in George 's business position , some hidden need or opportunity . And what was his position ? Well , of course , he was involved in many things , but the textile business was certainly the common denominator , and surely the biggest feather in George 's cap was his directorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was always remodeling and replanning , that everyone in the textile world admired for its philosophy of incessant modernization . The Holcombe that swallowed small , tired family companies . Did Holcombe want Emlen Fibre ? " It 's a question of putting ourselves in George Emlen 's shoes , " he explained to Larry the following morning when they met in the file room . " This is really detective work . I think it 's safe to assume that he knows or should know any information that we have in our files . The Fibre Company 's in his family , and he 's on the board of Holcombe . " All that day they worked on a systematic search through the files . It was dreary and unrewarding work , and Larry was obviously discouraged . He kept muttering under his breath about needles in haystacks . They thumbed through months of correspondence and glanced over contracts ; they even scanned decrees in litigations and arbitration settlements . Timmy concentrated on Holcombe 's last registration statement , a mine of information , comparing it carefully with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least illumination . Towards evening he was beginning to think that he had been unjustly suspicious when Larry , who had been in another corner of the room checking the unfiled correspondence , came hurrying over to his desk waving a memorandum . " Get a load of this ! " he cried . " Holcombe 's memo of new business ! "  | " Where did you find it ? " " I was going through the unfiled confidential . On the off chance . " Timmy scanned the brief memorandum . It dealt with a proposed increase in the production of a new kind of washable summer suit . Turning the last page he came to a list of patents to be acquired for the process , with penciled check marks by those whose acquisition was in negotiation . With the elation of one who sees to the end of his puzzle and disdains to fill in the final squares , he tossed it back to Larry . " How many on that list are owned by Emlen Fibre ? " Larry cross-checked the list with the one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are they marked ? " " No . " " So there we are . " He sat back wearily in his chair . " Georgic really has something , after all . Or will have . When the trustees have turned it over to him . " " I bet he really sticks Holcombe for those patents ! " " Oh , no . " Timmy shook his head judiciously . " He 's much too smart for that . If he was paid too well , the girls might find out and start screeching . He 'll turn over the patents to Holcombe for a reasonable sum . And then you 'll find that Holcombe will suddenly become a very good customer of George 's mill in South Carolina . Oh , there are ways and means , Larry . The possibilities are limitless . What I 'm wondering is , does Dale know ? " Larry stared at him , open-mouthed . " Are you kidding ? " " No . Why should he know ? George would n't have to tell him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're two of a kind . I 'm just wondering what Dale 's cut is . " Timmy almost laughed at Larry 's expression of worldly wisdom . His assistant varied between hero worship and cynicism , pirouetting between the enticing extremes of total loyalty and total contempt . " Well , I 'll see him on Monday . Perhaps we 'll find out . "  | " Be sensible now , Tim . Do n't expect him to come right out with it . Steal up on him . " Timmy made a little bow . " I shall be ruled by you in all things . " " You laugh at me , " Larry said , hurt . " But you 'll see . " Timmy found Dale in a rather beaming mood when he went to his office the following Monday . His son 's team had won the game , and with a paternal pride that he rarely displayed , he showed Timmy a picture of " Junior , " a squat , heavy boy with rather slanting eyes . Timmy had some difficulty introducing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the weekend about the Emlen trust , " he managed to get in at last . " Frankly , I do n't like it . I 'd rather make a distribution across the board , one third of each holding to each . Why should I ask Mrs. Emlen to take the risk that the Fibre stock is worth a third of the trust ? " " You do n't have to ask her . I 've told you what she wants . " Dale 's tone was a touch dry . He was always very careful not to treat Timmy like a dummy trustee , but the care was discernible . " It 's the children 's money ; that 's the way I look at it . Why not let them divvy up as they choose ? " " Why ca n't they divvy up later ? " Timmy returned . " After I 've made an even split ? " Dale puffed at his pipe for a moment in silence . Timmy knew that this was his method of controlling his temper . " Because that involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said with a touch of asperity . " Which is not the way I like to do business . And , furthermore , it might get them into a serious gift tax problem . People in their bracket ca n't just go around swapping securities , you know . " " But supposing we had reason to believe that one of these good clients was putting something over on the others ? " Dale looked up immediately . His eyes were stern . " Which one ? " " George . " i  | " Do we know this , or are we just supposing ? " " We know it . " " Explain yourself . " Timmy told him in as few words as possible about the memorandum of new business and the list of patents . Dale stared down at his blotter , carefully moving his silver paper cutter from one side of the desk to the other . His reaction , however , when Timmy had finished , was unexpected . He uttered a long , low whistle . " Well , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clever little bugger , is n't he ? Cleverer than I thought . " Timmy stared down at him . " Of course , the deal 's off now , " he said brusquely . " As a trustee I 'm on notice . " " Now let 's just wait a second , " Dale cautioned him in an easier tone , settling back in his chair . " Just a second . You go snooping about on your own , like a good little Sherlock Holmes , investigating a deal that fundamentally does n't concern you . I say fundamentally , because even though you 're a trustee , this is a matter between three adults who are willing to give you a complete release . " Dale waved his hand grandly in the air to indicate the totality of Timmy 's exoneration . " But the release is n't enough for you . You want to dig deeper . And so , in your diggings , you stumble upon the fact that one of the three may ? and I repeat , may ? have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright boy and is willing to take a long gamble , while his sisters are shrieking for ready cash . I wonder if it 's entirely fair , by anybody 's standards , for the trustee to step in , like a solemn governess , and mess up his little game ? " " But if the trustee 's on notice , Sheridan ! " Timmy cried . " I 'll do anything the family wants . After I 've told the girls . " Dale dropped his speculative , almost storytelling tone . " Is it your opinion that this changes the book value of the Fibre stock ? " " To Holcombe it does . Vitally . " " I 'm talking about book value , " Dale retorted . " Has Holcombe made any offer for the patents ? " " Why should it ? If it gets them for nothing ? "  | " But it has n't . Let 's stick to the facts . Has anyone else made an offer ? " " No . " " There 's no secret about the patents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a command . " Ca n't anyone who 's interested find out what Emlen Fibre has ? " " Yes . But their true value is only in connection with what Holcombe proposes ! " Timmy became so excited that he almost forgot that Dale , of course , might know . " Do n't you see , Sheridan ? They 'll never have to pay George for the patents . I mean , pay him more than book value . There 'll be other ways of helping him . " " And that 's so undesirable ? You 're against George ? " Timmy stared . " I guess Anita might think it undesirable ! " he exclaimed . " And Lolita . If they find their brother 's getting stock which they could sell to Holcombe for three times the value of what they 're getting ! " " Wait a minute ! " Dale held up his hand abruptly . His face seemed even rounder and darker ; it had a more stonelike appearance than Timmy had ever seen . " How do you know that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them ? How do you know that Holcombe would buy them from anyone ? " " I do n't . But it stands to reason , does n't it , that Holcombe ? " " It does not stand to reason ! " Dale exclaimed sharply . " I thought I had broken you of that habit of irrelevant speculation . Has it ever occurred to you , Timmy , that you have an actual prejudice against clients ? Against George anyway ? How do you know that Anita and her sister have n't got inside information about some of the securities that they 're getting ? Something that 'll make George look green when he hears about it ? " " I do n't know , of course . " " Well , more power to them if they have , I say ! " Dale continued triumphantly . " You have n't heard Anita complaining about the deal , have you ? " " Quite the reverse . But then she does n't know . "  | " Does n't know ! " Dale mimicked him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . And nobody knows what Holcombe wants to do about the Fibre patents ! And I say it 's none of our damn business ! " " None of yours , maybe , " Timmy said in a low , stubborn tone . " But you 're not the trustee . " Dale sat back in his chair again with a look of weary patience and turned to the window . His lips were shaped as if he were about to whistle again , but no sound emerged . " That 's true , " he said , suddenly indifferent . " I 'm not the trustee , am I ? " He leaned forward and reached in a concluding manner for a letter on his blotter . " And the trustee , obviously , must make the decision . " Timmy stood uncertainly while Dale appeared to be absorbed in his correspondence . " That 's all the advice you have to give me ? " " It 's all the advice I can give you , Tim , " Dale said in a detached tone , looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to go chasing after gossamer moral issues every time you find yourself up against a simple , matter-of-fact problem . It makes me wonder about your future . It honestly does . I do n't mind telling you that I had hoped to make you number two on the L-Iolcombe account . With the idea that you 'd eventually take over the client . I ca n't run everything around here , you know . But , frankly , Timmy , if you 're not going to live in this world , if you 're going to leap about from cloud to cloud ? " " Tell me , Sheridan , " Tim interrupted in a muffled tone . " Do you think I should n't tell Anita about the patents ? Do you say that ? " " I do n't say anything , my dear boy , " Dale returned blandly , ringing the buzzer for his secretary . " I do n't say a blessed thing . As you point out , you 're the trustee . You must do as you see fit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " I must do as I see fit . " Back in his office Timmy sat perfectly still , staring at the  | closed door . The telephone rang , but he made no move to answer it . " This is it , Tim , " a voice kept repeating over and over in his brain . " This is the world . Your world ! " It was as if Dale 's proposition was the challenge that he had known all along must be lurking , the dark hirsute thing behind the green leaves of his new prosperity . Rapidly , mechanically , he reviewed his expenses , that of his new apartment and of the one he was getting for Ann , the private schools for Walter and George , the whole business of amusing himself and Eileen . He thought of collecting pictures and of driving long , low , noisy foreign cars , of out-Daviding David . And yet in all his oddly perfunctory cataloguing what really held him so tensely still was a curious bleak awareness that he was gathering motives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was seeking the concocted excuses of Ann 's needs or of Eileen 's imagined extravagance , of pictures and cars that he had never had , to explain the quixoticism of his deepening involvement with Dale . Oh , true , he had his pressures , plenty of them ; he wanted money and promotion , but did he want them that much ? In fact , now that he made himself think of it , did he really want them at all ? Was n't it rather that he was sitting alone in a darkened projection room , watching the unreeling of his own life , inextricably bound up in its logic ? For it was because of this logic , because of this only consistency , that he oddly enough felt himself bound to sacrifice everything . He had made decisions , had he not , crossed Rubicons ? Was it seemly now , even feasible , to turn his steed and go galloping back pell-mell before astonished spectators on the road he had so defiantly taken the day before ? The door opened , and Larry entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he ? " Timmy stared . " Did he what ? " " Did he know ? " Timmy realized with a sudden shock what it was he was asking . He had quite forgot that Larry knew . " He did n't know a thing , " he snapped . " We were barking up a wrong tree . Forget it . "  | Larry stood in front of him , smiling now . " Oh , I see , " he said softly . " We 're going to play it that way , are we ? He did n't know a thing . Well , fine ! " " Have n't you any work to do , Larry ? " " Sure , sure . " Larry was still smiling . " Do n't get huffy . I can be smart . I know when the party line changes . " " Oh , go soak your head . " As Larry left , the telephone rang again , and this time he answered it . It was Eileen . " I know you hate to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said apologetically . " Can you or ca n't you ? I do have to know . " " Tonight ? " He reflected irritably how she cared about such things . Her stepfather , at least , cared about Mrs. Wardell because she was the widow of New York 's largest owner of railroad securities . But Eileen cared because she was old , because she was a remnant of a vanishing era , because her house was eighteenth century , because she was a collector 's item . " All right , why not ? " he said rather brusquely . " I 'll pick you up for dinner first . At eight ? " He would have time first , he reflected quickly , to call on Mrs. Emlen , and hanging up , he immediately dialed her number .  | FLORENCE EMLEN waited at the desk in the library for the visit from her young co-trustee . She wanted him to surprise her at her work and was wearing over an expanse of floating grey hair her " think bonnet , " a loose velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eighteenth century lady at home to her friends of learning . There was a whiskey decanter on a silver tray if Mr. Colt cared for a drink , but no tea . Tea was not for working hours . Tea would never have gone with the paraphernalia of business set out so neatly on the broad surface of the desk : the seal , the sealing wax , the great steel stapler , the wheel for stamps , for scotch tape , the penholder , the clean , crisp yellow pad and the daily dozen of long , sharpened pencils . Only in an atmosphere of order and organization could she hope properly to orient her thoughts on the great affairs to which she had daily to give her attention . Mr. Colt was really a great find . She had to concede that her brother-in-law had a way of finding people . The young man was serious , yet always lucid , and his manners were charming . Of course , there was that unfortunate story about what he had said to George at the club , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother how provoking George could be . It was also true that she had thought him a bit young to be trustee of even one of the smaller trusts , but then she had to admit that he was learning as fast as Sherry had predicted . Of course , he did not have her experience . How could he ? It had not been his fate to be left a widow and crushed with unsought respon-  | sibilities . And a widow , too , whose natural bent had been for the arts , who had asked nothing better out of life than the chance to paint flowers and poke around the galleries in Fifty-seventh Street and who instead ? with what an agony of discipline ! ? had had to run a veritable little empire of stocks and bonds and mortgages , of bits and pieces of businesses , of demanding charities and huge demanding summer cottages , to preside , a brave little queen-mother , the inspiration of a handful of loyal servitors , over her and the children 's domain . And she had known better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks from those children . How dry and sharp they were ; how like Emlens ! Ah , to be dry , she thought , to lack imagination , not to feel things as she did , that was the way to get through the life . She did allow herself to hope , however , that George would not prove too dry to marry . She had not quite forsaken the naughty little vision of having her house to herself , free of that critical , economizing presence as oppressive as his late father 's . Had he not bored her half to death with lectures when he discovered the tiny Renoir that dear David had made her get for the drawing room ? And what on earth would he do when he found that she was planning a whole new house on Long Island , a " folie " as David so delightfully called it ! But she did n't have to cross that bridge till she came to it . After all , as David always reminded her , whose money was it ? The door opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Mr. Colt . Looking even paler and more serious in a blue suit that she had n't seen him in before . " Oh , Mr. Colt , how nice ! " she exclaimed . Should she call him Timmy , she wondered . He was younger , after all , than her own children . " Thank heavens we 're going to get rid of that old children 's trust at last . Every time one of them falls in , I feel that much weight off my shoulders . And it 's been a heavy weight , Mr. Colt . For a heavy number of years , I do n't mind telling you . " But for some reason Mr. Colt did not seem disposed to listen to her with his usual respectful attention that afternoon .  | He sat rather broodingly staring at the papers on the desk . " Have you given any thought to the Fibre Company ? " " You mean the one George wants ? " She was rather taken aback by his abruptness . " Certainly I have . I always give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I ask what you 've decided ? " " Well , I suppose he should have it , " she said a bit uncertainly .

" " What about your daughters ? " " But you know what they 're like , Mr. Colt ! They simply sell anything that they can lay their hands on . For those husbands of theirs . " She wondered if she should tell him frankly how low an opinion she had of Anita 's husband . Both her daughters , she thought with a little quiver of distaste , were not only richer but bigger than their husbands , yet still afraid of them . " They 're always looking to me for more money . Queen Lear , ' I call myself ! " " What they 'd do with the company is not really our concern , I suppose . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . We should only consider what they 're entitled to . " " But a trustee is n't meant to be completely blind ! Surely we 're meant to use some common sense ? " " That 's rather a moot point , is n't it ? " " Do you mean to sit there and tell me , Mr. Colt , " she demanded indignantly , " that in dividing up property in my husband 's trust ? his property , mind you , of which he made me trustee ? I am not to consider what is in the best interests of each child ? " " But I do tell you so , " he insisted stubbornly . " I must . As a lawyer . You and I are not Santa Clauses handing out presents , Mrs. Emlen . We 're trustees ! " Florence drew herself up . She had never thought she would have this kind of trouble with Mr. Colt . He was even  | verging on the impertinent . She remembered the story of his rudeness to George and wondered if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been a trustee for a good many more years than you , Mr. Colt , " she said crushingly . " I learned the nature of my duties from Mr. Sheffield himself . I think you might not be making too great an error to consider my views in the matter . " " But I am considering your views , Mrs. Emlen , " he protested . " I 'm simply pointing out that the trust instrument instructs us , on your younger daughter 's thirty-fifth birthday , to divide the principal equally among your children . The word equally ' means just that . Even in the law . " She blinked , uncomprehending . " But we are going to divide it equally . " He threw up his hands . " Then , of course , there 's no problem . " " It 's simply that George gets the company for his share . Which he wants and which he knows about ? " " Do we know about it ? " " Well , after all , Mr. Colt , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Exactly . " " What do you mean , exactly ? " " How do we know that the company is n't worth more than his third ? " " But it 's not ! " she exclaimed . " We know what it 's worth .

He says that he may actually be getting a worse deal than Anita or Lolly . " " He says . " " What are you implying , Mr. Colt ? " " Well , he 's the one who 's getting the stock , is n't he ? I 'm sorry , Mrs. Emlen , but trustees are bound to be suspicious . " Florence stared at him in sudden fascination and fear . One lived surrounded by the dark , dry wall of masculinity , of counselors , lawyers , trustees . One heard and tried to make  | sense of their incessant financial chatter . They criticized one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good and worse times in bad . They despised and threatened a gentle butterfly like David and made as if to drag him from one 's very feet as if they were Scottish barons and he , poor dear , a Rizzio . But that they were honest , that they were on one 's side was never in doubt . Was n't it the keystone , actually , of one 's world ? It was too bad of her one new friend to challenge principles as fixed and immutable as the tides , to talk about what one should do , as if he would recklessly tear down the enveloping wall and let in a whole blaring hell of personal decision . She put her hands to her ears . " Suspicious ? " she gasped . " Of George ? " " Of everyone ! " " But do you mean that George might not have been telling me the truth ? " " He could have made a mistake , could n't he ? People can . Particularly when it 's in their interest to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very well , then . " He nodded grimly . " We 've eliminated the element of mistake . " A faint muffled beat reverberated in Florence 's mind as she continued to stare at him . It was like a drum , or the suggestion , anyway , of something martial , the phrasing of a nebulous but imperious question , the shaping of the dim concept , terrifying but even strangely fascinating , that instead of the seals , the staplers , the paper clips , instead of the pretty , rounded signature so impressive at the end of blue-backed documents , instead of the form and the flattery , the endless reassurance , there might even be the reality of Florence Emlen . " You think George could really do such a thing ? " she faltered . There was a footfall on the stairs outside . " That may be he now ! " she cried in sudden , desperate relief and hurried from her chair as he entered . " Oh , George , I 'm so glad you 're here , dear ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been upsetting me so ! He 's full of the wildest ideas ! That you might have something to gain out of the Fibre Company  | and have n't been telling me everything ! Tell him it 's all right , will you , dear ? " George turned to Timmy with an ominous blankness of countenance . " What 's the idea , Colt ? " Timmy had had time to reflect , in the brief moments between the sound of George 's step in the corridor and his now blunt question , that his little game was up . There was to be no more evasion , no further chance of skirting his problem by the too simple expedient of frightening Mrs. Emlen with vague insinuations . If he was still to defeat George 's scheme , it could only be now by showing all his cards , by exposing him to his mother and sisters , and the price of this , in terms of his own future , was not in doubt . " I was just being a boring trustee , George , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be . I was n't speaking personally , of course . " " But women take things personally . I do n't want you to confuse Mother . " " Confuse me ! " Mrs. Emlen protested . " Really , George ! I 'll thank you to remember I 'm your trustee ! " George still ignored her . " I 'll thank you to remember , " he continued severely to Timmy , " that I 've gone to a lot of trouble to make the whole trust picture clear to Mother . It 's very well for you to he a conscientious trustee . I know all about your conscientiousness . I 've had to deal with it in the past , God knows . You may remember what I had to say about your habit of flying into the wild blue yonder . But you do n't have to upset the whole apple cart , do you ? Just for conscientiousness ? If Anita and Lolly and I are happy about what 's being done , what business is it of yours ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , I was just being a boring trustee . " " Well , do n't be too boring , fella , " George said , looking at him fixedly . " Do n't be too boring , that 's all I ask . " When Timmy left them , he wondered grimly if he might not end by slipping between two stools , detested by everybody including himself . For what had he accomplished but  | to antagonize Mrs. Emlen as well as her son ? Later that night , sitting with Eileen at their customary restaurant , his mood was biting . He wanted to feel committed by his talk with the Emlens , to feel the decision behind him , to make the wretched distribution . Sullen , he saw everything as tawdry , the Toulouse-Lautrec reproductions , the bad French of the Hungarian waiters , the huge purple handwriting of the menus . " Now I suppose they 'll come over , " he snapped , as Eileen nodded to a couple across the room . " You know how I feel about table hoppers . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anybody ? If there is such a place . " Her blue eyes gazed at him mildly . " They wo n't come over . And if they did , it would be only for a minute . " " A minute ! " he retorted . " But our life is made up of these minutes ! Sometimes I think you believe we only exist to waste time gracefully . " Her gaze was still on him . " What 's wrong , darling ? A bad day at the office ? " " No , no . " He stared at the menu . " It 's just that I sometimes think you 're too urban , Eileen . " " You forget I lived on a farm with animals . For five years . " " Yes , and I bet you even did that elegantly . " He knew from the uncomfortable silence that followed that he had gone too far . " Are you implying that 's how I lost him ? " " Lost whom ? " " Craig . " " Good God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " If you think my life is stupid and trivial , Timmy , I wish you 'd say so . " " You do n't understand , " he protested , twisting now to get out of it . " It 's not that at all . It 's just that I take things more in my stride than you do . Probably because I 'm coarser . " " What sort of things ? " " Things that coarse people do n't mind . Crassness . Bad taste . Vulgarity . Things that you and David fight away from , but which you really know very little about . Why , I bet you  | even look upon Sheridan as a boor . Yet he 's a man of cultivation to most people . " " Not to anyone he has n't fooled . " " But he does n't have to fool them . He 's one of them , do n't you see ? He 's not a special person , like you . " " Why am I so special ? " " I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of course you wo n't see it . I think of you as rare . Do you know that you 've never met my mother ? " he demanded suddenly . " And do you know why ? " She looked startled . " I assumed she disapproved of you and me . " On the contrary . She 'd be tickled silly to meet you . I 'm the one who 's prevented it . And why ? Because I 'm ashamed of her ! That 's the long and short of it . I 'm ashamed to have you meet her ! " She was embarrassed by his violence and glanced quickly towards the table on her right . " It does n't have to be the end of the world , you know . Plenty of people are ashamed of their mothers . As a matter of fact , I 'm rather ashamed of mine . " " But that 's different , " he said stubbornly . " You 're ashamed of your mother because you think she 's silly , and she is silly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreary and lower middle class . And that 's contemptible ! " " Oh , Timmy . " " It is , Eileen ! After all , I 'm just like her . I 'm all thumbs at the parties you take me to . And I 'm tickled pink when some old woman like Mrs. Wardell makes a fuss over me . Or when David wants to be friends . And , you , oh , most of all , you ! I 've been terrified of your finding out what a crumb I was . " " A crumb ? You , Timmy ? " " Me , Timmy ! " There was no stopping him now in the catalogue of his crimes . " All the art you 've shown me , all the music you 've taken me to : do you think I 've really liked it ? No . I 've liked having you as a guide . But fundamentally , I do n't really trust art . I have n't any need of it . "  | " Of course you do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said emphatically . " You have to be surrounded by beautiful things . And you should be . They ca n't damn you . " " What a funny thing to say , " she observed softly . " Can they damn you ? " " Perhaps . " " You 're not being dramatic ? " " I 'm always being asked that ! " " Not by me . " " No , dear . " He took her hand apologetically . " Not by you . But we met too late to have shared all our moments of crisis . " " I was n't being jealous , I was being factual . How can they damn you ? " He looked at her for several moments before deciding to tell . When he did so it was because he could no longer bear to have her on so different a plane ; he was too alone with his guiltiness . Slowly , painstakingly , with a spoon to represent each of the Emlen trusts , he explained . She followed intently , without comment , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked , after a pause . " Or have I missed something ? It seems to me that George should have the company . " He felt suddenly ashamed . It was so greedy to take her out to dinner and bore her with legal details stacked in his favor , to gain a release from her lips that had no validity even in the court of his own depreciated conscience . It was cowardly not to risk her disapproval , to rig facts before an unqualified judge . " Maybe . Maybe you 're right . Oh , look , your friends are coming over . " He turned with relief to the couple who were approaching , glad to drop the subject while she was still reassuring . Yet he noticed , when they had gone , that she did not revert to it . It might , of course , have slipped her mind . It might . But it was also possible , was it not , that she , too , wished to avoid  | a subject which , explored too deeply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to many houses with Eileen , but never to one like Mrs. Wardell 's . It was like a great London eighteenth century house , with a high , bare marble stairway with niches for classical sculptures and an oblong Georgian parlor with tall , dark dusty portraits by Lely and Kneller . He knew almost no one at the party , but the very size of the room gave him a rather restful feeling of anonymity as he stood silently by Eileen while she greeted people . He could tell now when she really loved a house , and she really loved this one . She was even quieter than usual , smiling less frequently , and he caught her eyes almost surreptitiously taking in the great crystal chandelier , the scarlet and green of the mammoth Turkish rug . " I suppose they 're not really good , " he murmured to her . " The pictures , I mean . Are n't they anybody 's ancestors from any English home ? " She looked a bit surprised , as if she had to concentrate a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen . Even when he thought she was farthest away , she had a quality of coming back to him . " Oh , but , of course they 're bad , " she agreed . " They should be , to have style . Pictures in the eighteenth century were things you inherited . Things you had . Is n't there something rather vulgar about little jewels of masterpieces with tiny spotlights beamed from the ceiling ? " He laughed , giving it up . Eileen was devoid of preconceptions . She gave herself to each new atmosphere with a completeness that might have alarmed him , had it not mildly irritated . She had quite put out of her mind the penthouse they had seen the week before with the Chinese screens and the Gauguins , which had excited her so . There were seven whole days of impressions between her and it . " Well , well ! If you two do n't look as bored as a married couple ! " They both turned to face Eileen 's cousin , Anita Ferguson , alert and bright-eyed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else . Nothing , however , could quite conceal her ungainliness , quite confer grace upon her nervous motions . She seemed helplessly aware , too , of her own compulsion to say the wrong thing ; she had drawn her head back like a bird , and her round startled eyes seemed to chirp , at once defiantly and apologetically : There ! I suppose I 've done it again ! " As bored as you and Hank ? " Eileen asked gently . And it was gently , Timmy reflected with admiration . It was another of the annihilating things about Eileen that she could retort kindly and almost mean it kindly . " How is my trustee ? " Anita had turned abruptly to him . " Not busting his head about my silly accounts tonight , I see . " " You think I should be ? " " Oh , do n't be so literal ! " she cried and faced Eileen again . " You know , dear , I 'm really suspicious of your Timmy . He 's closeted all the time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers . I 'm sure I shall be totally disinherited . " " Oh , I think my ' Timmy is harmless enough , " Eileen said , smiling . " He would n't think of the things you and I might think of , Anita . You see , he has to earn his living . " " Well ! " Anita 's mouth fell open . " I never know what you mean , Eileen . And I know better than to ask . But if you could hear Mama go on about him , I think even you might be jealous . " " I should n't dream of competing with Auntie Flo , " Eileen said turning to go off . " I 'd be sure to lose . " Timmy was about to follow her when Anita grabbed his arm . " I want to speak to you , " she said . " Wait . " It was the tone of the woman of property . Anita , defeated in her efforts to be witty , to be charming , even to be kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of advantage . " Certainly , " he said , inclining his head . " When are we going to get our money from that trust ? " she demanded . " What 's holding it up ? " Her tone became  | sharper with the sense that even she had of the total inappropriateness of time and place . " Is George going to welsh on taking the Fibre Company ? " He controlled his surprise . " Not that I 've heard of . " " Because if he is , " she continued heatedly , " there are one or two things you should know . It 's only fair that he take that stock . What does he need cash for ? He 's a selfish old bachelor without a care in the world , living off Mother . Why , she even pays his laundry bills ! " " But these are hardly considerations that should affect a trustee . " " Well , I do n't see why not , " she retorted . " A trustee should n't be a complete ostrich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an extra trust for him over what he did for us girls ? And that he got two parts of Grandma Emlen 's estate when we each got one ! " " Well , if he 's rolling , " he pointed out as lightly as he could , coughing to cover the slight tremor in his tone , " is n't it all the more reason that you and your sister should get your full due ? " " Exactly ! Exactly what I mean ! " " And should n't your trustees take extra pains to be sure that you 're not missing out by taking the securities instead of your share of the Fibre Company ? " " But that 's all been settled ! " she exclaimed . " Is that what 's holding it up ? " He hesitated for just a second . Then he nodded . " Well , I think that 's taking too much on yourself ! " she cried angrily . " Hank has looked into the Fibre Company , and so has Lolly 's husband , and we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we do with our own ! " " I 'd hate to see anyone gypped , " he murmured . " Well , I think you might let us handle that . We 're not children , you know . Hank and I want that money , and we want it now . I could give you my reasons , but I do n't see that you 're entitled to them . " Timmy wondered if a sharp face and cross eyes had ever  | seemed lovely to him before . Through the great open doors he heard the strain of a waltz , and he felt his heart leap . Was he not now exonerated ? Suddenly he wanted to dance with Eileen . " There 's no reason you should give me your reasons , Anita , " he assured her . " And I do n't see why we should n't wind up distribution of the trust next week . " " Oh , " she said , taken aback . " Well , that 's very nice . " She paused . " Perhaps I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope ? " " I did n't mind in the least . " She took in the obvious sincerity of his smile . " Well , you 're rather good-natured , I must say , " she said with a shrug . " I do n't know what it is about me . I get excited , and then I say the wrong thing . It 's very trying . " " You should relax , Anita . We all should relax ! " As he walked away from her to the ballroom , he felt the beauty in everything , the portraits , the great dusky mirrors , even in Anita 's gold dress . Was this , he asked himself happily , why Eileen came to parties ? Because she always felt this way ? He went over to the long table where the champagne was being served . " I feel sardonic tonight , " he heard David 's voice in his ear . " It comes from dancing with rich , elderly women and reflecting on the inequitable distribution of goods in our society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be . Like a young hero in Balzac out of the provinces to watch the splendors of Paris . And ending up harder than the hardest . " " Except I 'm not from the provinces , " Timmy pointed out . " I 'm probably one of the few native New Yorkers in this room . " " How true , " David conceded with a shrug . " Things are quite the reverse in this town . Odd as it may seem , our hostess is the provincial , though no one remembers that now . One can see it , of course , in this house . " " Do you think so ? To me it has a rather easy , aristocratic air . " " Oh , does Eileen say that ? Of course , she would . But you  | have to watch Eileen . She sees things through the haze of a rather perfervid imagination . She sees this house , I 'm sure , as it ought to be and Mrs. Wardell as a sort of Gainsborough duchess . She wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The excess of glass in the chandelier . " " And should she ? " " Well , that 's a question , is n't it ? " David held out his empty glass to the elderly waiter . " Is it better to live in one 's imagination if one 's imagination is a finer , cleaner place ? I suppose if anyone should do it , Eileen should . It gives her the capacity to move through a rather vulgar world without the least contamination . But make no mistake , Timmy . It 's a singular gift . Not everyone can do it . " " Are you warning me ? " David 's eyes had still their mocking expression , but his tone was serious . " You might call it that , " he said , shrugging . " Do you feel you need a warning ? " " Not in the least . Even if I 'm an ass to say it . " Leaving David abruptly , he made his way to the dance floor and cut in on Eileen before the brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy again , " he whispered desperately in her ear . " I like everything now ! I 'm sorry I was such a stick . " " What changed you ? " " There 's nothing like a little talk with Anita to buck a man up . " " Have n't I always said , " she asked , smiling up at him , " that Anita was not a woman to be underestimated ? " " You know , I still do n't quite believe in you , Eileen . What have I done to deserve you ? Why'should you happen to me ? " " Oh , I 've happened ' to quite a few people , " she assured him . " Or tried to , anyway . I 'm not such an uncommon event . " " Can we really go on like this , dancing in fantastic ballrooms ? Laughing at friends of yours in whose existence I do n't really believe ? " He felt her grip tighten on his shoulder . " Please , darling , " she murmured , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She made no objection when he suggested that they leave and go to his apartment . The ease with which she blended into the atmosphere of the party , her very relevance to such surroundings made it all the more necessary for him to possess her in a place that was more his own . It was as if only thus could he preserve any part of the mean little ego which he insisted , however arbitrarily , that she threatened , as if otherwise , a conquered Peter Ibbetson , he might be lost altogether in the spacious elegance of her dreams . Yet she had been everything to him that he had asked her to be ; she had been open and generous with her life . Deep down he was uneasily aware that what he was trying to do was to brand her generosity as possessiveness . To have faced it frankly would have involved facing as well the stinginess with which he held back the one thing she wanted . And what was that but his love ?  | EILEEN , as it happened , was neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Timmy might have hoped . It was quite true that , even more than most women , she had a tendency to minimize the moral aspects of what men did " downtown " ; shrewdness and aggression seemed merely other aspects of their masculinity , and the border line between this and dishonesty was a shadow land where a woman 's mind had little need to penetrate . But her intelligence was very clear , and when it focused on such a problem as Timmy had focused it , it took in the final subtleties . Even so she might not , under normal circumstances , have been too much concerned . Hers was the gift of living in the moment ; she saw no sense in having a pleasure spoiled by the long , meddlesome , dirty fingers of the future . But people , she had been made to recognize , could never let one be , could never endure the idea of a futureless pleasure . The moment they spotted content on a face or satisfaction in a general air , they came rushing and whooping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nets , to catch the butterfly of happiness and nail it to the cardboard of their senseless classifications . Who cared if the butterfly was killed in the process ? And recently , it seemed , everyone around her had taken upon themselves , unurged , the obligation of discussing her future with Timmy . Even her mother . Clarissa had summoned her to her bedroom to discuss it . She was about to take the train for Andover to watch young  | Sheridan play in another football game , one of the few maternal duties that Dale insisted on , and she was unusually sour . " I 'm not one to interfere , you know , " she began , seated at a long dressing table and tugging with a comb at her crisply set golden hair . " It 's just that I like to make my plans . One wants to know a little ahead of time . " Eileen , puffing a cigarette on the chaise longue , looked pensively at her exhaled smoke . " What sort of plans do you have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather large apartment , " her mother retorted , " in which you occupy three rooms . If you 're thinking of leaving , it would be convenient to know . " " Are you thinking of asking me to ? " " Oh , Eileen , do n't be tiresome ! " Clarissa turned on her irritably , comb in hand . " Is n't it perfectly natural for a mother to be interested when her daughter is seeing as much of somebody as you are of Timmy ? " " Natural , yes . " " Well , are you going to marry him or are n't you ? " " Oh , I thought you knew . He 's already married . " " I did n't ask you in here to make fun of me , " Clarissa said tartly . " Of course , I know that . But he 's left her , has n't he ? " " Yes . For the moment . " " For the moment ! Well , I should hope so ! And I 'll thank you to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started after his separation . You 're entirely too casual , Eileen . I know you travel with a very smart set , but you 'd better remember that there are still people who do n't relish girls who break up homes . " " Is there any difference between keeping a man away from his home and taking him away ? I do n't want to persuade people I 'm anything I 'm not . " " There 's all the difference in the world ! " Clarissa cried . " Really , child , you are impossible . I 've made a point of telling all my friends that Timmy had to leave his wife because she was alcoholic . Before he met you . " " What ! " Eileen exclaimed , sitting up . " Mummy , you ca n't  | have done such a thing ! It 's monstrous ! " " Monstrous ! When she was sick all over this very bedroom ! Maybe that does n't count for anything in your world , but let me tell you , my girl , it counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaise longue , suddenly faint . She could imagine only too vividly how Timmy would react to this . " Please , Mummy , " she murmured . " Must you say such things ? " " Oh , I know , " Clarissa continued sulkily . " It 's poor taste of me even to mention that she was sick . You 've always had a horror of ugly facts , Eileen . But occasionally we do have to face them . I 'm assuming your Timmy , if he as any sense in that handsome head of his , wo n't let that woman ruin his career . Divorce is the only answer . Even Sheridan thinks so . " Eileen opened her eyes . " Does he ? " " Well , yes . " Clarissa appeared to reflect , for even she was a bit hesitant about misquoting a man as definite as her husband . " I think he 's torn between his desire to have Timmy for a son-in-law and his fear that you 'll spoil him . " " Spoil him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back to her mirror . " Take him to too many of your silly parties . " " And what about Sheridan 's parties ? They 're not silly , I suppose ? " Clarissa turned to give her daughter a quick look , one of their rare women 's moments of communication . " Of course not . They 're business . Anyway , I have to catch that damn train . Darling , do you remember who little Sherry 's team is playing ? The things I 'm expected to know ! " " Exeter . " Eileen got up to leave . Clarissa , anyway , was safely distracted . Really , she thought later , as she went out to her shopping , could one never be allowed even the illusion of a carefree moment ? It was what was wrong with the world , really , its inability to accept bounty . Or at least to watch others accept it . But she still knew , catching a glimpse of her own eyes , evasive , preoccupied , in the mirror at her hairdresser 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what  | was really happening to Timmy . For it did seem to her , in that sudden grim moment , hiding from her own image behind a copy of Harper 's Bazaar , that it was a shabby thing that he was doing to Anita and Lolly . She did not think the less of him , for she never judged him as a lawyer or trustee . Such things had no relevance to herself or to their relationship . But she did face the fact of her own involvement ; she had to know if she was contributing , however subtly , to the moral disintegration of the man who seemed to be becoming her whole life . Action would then be required , and action was distasteful , but if one 's airy castle was bound in any event to be leveled by the envious , was n't it better to emerge over the drawbridge in full armor than to perish in the smoke of the citadel ? At least it seemed so . If everything was lost , she thought hopelessly , picking up the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the becoming gesture . " It 's about tonight , " she said when Timmy came on the wire . " Are you coming ? To Aunt Florence 's ? " He would never know , she reflected , what skill it took to hold such invitations open for him as long as she managed to . " Oh , I 'm sorry , I should have called you earlier . I ca n't Eileen . I 've got to work . Is it terribly inconvenient ? " " Of course not . I just had to know , that 's all . " " You do n't mind ? Really ? " " Really . " And she did n't . It was as if she had been given a reprieve . Going to a dinner party in a new dress and thinking of Timmy while she was there could , under the circumstances , be almost preferable to having him with her . Decisions , actions were for the time in abeyance ; people could be counted on , in theory anyway , to talk nicely about nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , when David came up smiling , to hand her a cocktail , she wondered why so much store was placed on sincerity . " You do n't think you 're giving Timmy rather a dose of it ? " She looked up as if he had struck her . " A dose of what ? " " Oh , you know . " He shrugged . " Your life . "  | " I suppose you think , like Sheridan , that I 'll corrupt him . I never knew before , David , that you and Sheridan were so alike . " His eyes widened with mock reproach . " Dear me , are n't we snappish tonight ? " " It 's only that I 'm beginning to wonder if it is n't my patience with people that gets me into jams . " " All right , all right . " He raised his hands as if to keep her away from him . " I only wanted to drop a gentle warning . He has n't exactly your background , you know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about is background . As if we were figures in a landscape . Does it require so very much imagination to see that we 're all basically the same ? " " But we 're not . Anyway , I 'm not . " " That 's true , " she said , turning away from him . " You 're God 's own snob . " She avoided David and the subject of Timmy during dinner , but afterwards , among the ladies , while she was sitting alone in a love seat her cousin Anita came up to break into her solitude . " What luck to catch you alone , Eileen ! " Anita settled herself , with many nervous tugs and pulls at her dress , glancing about for an ashtray , a place to put her drink , in the other half of the love seat . " You know , I simply ca n't understand why Mother should ask David to the house when I 'm here . Can you ? Everyone 's talking about our row . Would n't you think she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us . " Anita had the Bertrand " crossness " to the point of seeming a parody of her mother and aunt . Yet being an Emlen , with at least the reputation of money , was enough to make people who searched , often sincerely , for an excuse for having taken her up find eccentricity in her bad manners and novelty in her humorlessness . " I do n't suppose David minds . " " I do n't suppose he does , " Anita retorted . " He 's too brash . As a matter of fact , I think it 's rather disloyal of you to be so  | chummy with him after the way he 's treated me . " Eileen laughed aloud . " But I ca n't cut everyone you cut , Anita ! " she protested . " I should have no friends at all . " " I ca n't imagine why you should want to be friends with him , anyway , " Anita continued with a sniff . " It does n't do a girl any good to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people begin to say she 's queer herself . " " I note that did n't stop you before you quarreled with him ! " Eileen exclaimed . But Anita was not worthy of her fire ; Anita was too pathetic . And feeling suddenly warmly towards her cousin , she wondered why she too should n't be serious at parties . " Why are you hostile to me , Anita ? " she asked in a different tone . " Why do you grudge me my friendship with David ? I 've always cared for you . " Anita , staring , seemed paralyzed . Then the corners of her small mouth turned down , and Eileen thought for an awkward moment that she was going to cry . " I 'm not hostile to you , " she said in a low wail . " I 've always thought you were wonderful , really . You had all the things I wanted . Even when you were only ten or eleven , and I was practically coming out , Mummy used to tell me to behave like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Then you 've never stopped to consider our respective situations , " Eileen said firmly . " It 's rather egocentric of you , really . You have a husband and two lovely children and plenty of money , even if you do find yourself strapped now and then . And I , what have I got ? " Anita looked at her dubiously . " You have lots of friends . " " Well , I do n't make them by antagonizing people . " Anita gave another little wail . " Have I antagonized you , too , Eileen ? " " Well , of course not ! " Eileen felt almost cheerful . So this was action ! This was coming out of the shell and talking back ! " Anyway , we 're family . One ca n't antagonize family . I can prove I 've nothing against you , Anita . " " Prove it ? How ? " By giving you a little tip . But you must first promise you 'll  | never let anyone know I told you . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita 's air of bafflement . Her heart was beating fast , but she thought she saw her way . How could Timmy do anything wrong if there was nothing wrong to do ? And as for the future , well , she would handle the future . " I wo n't tell you a thing , " she warned , " unless you promise ! " " I promise . " " On your honest-to-goodness word of honor ? " " On my honest-to-goodness word of honor . " " Very well . " Eileen paused to choose her words . " There 's some sort of a Fibre Company in one of your trusts , is n't there ? That George is going to get ? " Anita 's eyes immediately narrowed . " Go on . " " Well , take your share . You and Lolly . Do n't let him get it all . " There was a pause while Anita , motionless , continued to stare at her , and Eileen had a sudden sensation of panic . " Why do you say that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is the company worth more than they let on ? Who told you ? " " A little bird . " " A little bird called Timmy Colt ? Or Uncle Sherry ? " " That 's not your affair . Just be quiet about it , as you promised , and take your third . " " But I ca n't ! " Anita almost shouted . " The distribution 's been made . George got all his shares this morning ! " Eileen felt the rush of black panic to her head . She raised her hands to her temples . " Then forget all about it , will you ? It was only a joke , anyway ! " " A joke ! " Anita laughed harshly . " You do n't joke about things like that . If you wo n't tell me who told you , I 'll make it my business to find out ! " " But , Anita , " Eileen gasped in horror , " you promised ! " " Promised ! " Anita seemed outraged at the very suggestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it was about money ! " Aunt Florence was already standing over them with instruc-  | tions to join the gentlemen . Eileen , dazed , followed the others into the living room and felt only gratitude when David joined her . " Are you in a better mood ? " he asked . " I 'm in no mood at all , " she answered bleakly . " I thought I was good at evasive tactics , but now I 'm beginning to doubt myself . What do you do when there 's something too painful to be thought about ? " " Well , there 's liquor , of course . But you 're not really the type . And besides , your aunt is surprisingly stuffy about that . I would suggest playing cards for rather more than you can afford . It 's distracting , whether you win or lose . " " That 's it . " She nodded slowly . " Can you make up a table of bridge ? " " With pleasure . " He bowed his head . " But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | SHERIDAN DALE sat humped in his chair , staring at the grey spotless blotter before him . He could feel , like distant thunder , the rumblings of his incipient wrath ; he could sense , too , the sudden white flicker of his panic . But there was no time for anger or fear . They were luxuries ; they impeded thought , and thought was more essential than ever , with the soft , insinuating Georgia drawl of Hank Ferguson still echoing in his ear . It was little help , in his desperate search for clarity , that he had detested Ferguson , more acutely than he usually allowed himself to detest people , from the very beginning of their relationship . Hank had always managed to insinuate at family gatherings , with a sly wink or even a shove , that he and " Uncle Sherree " were united , not so much by the bond of having married into the same family as of having married into it for the same reason . It had been all Dale could do to keep his temper every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was trustee , with a frank , smiling skepticism , would glance first at any others present and then at him , before saying : " Now Ah 'm sure no one's:goin ' to mind if Ah just ask Uncle Sherree here a couple of rooteen questions . " Dale suddenly struck the surface of his desk with his full heavy palm at the idea that this wretched man 's suspicions might even threaten his own directorship at Holcombe ! It was intolerable , indecent , lewd ? but no . He forced himself to take a deep breath . This had to be thought through . Hank had to be bluffed . And then maybe settled with .  | " Mr. Emlen , sir , " he heard his secretary 's voice , and George came in , the door closing behind him . " Sit down , George , " he said gruffly . " We can talk in the cab , but I 'd like to find out a few things first . " " Where are we going ? " " To my apartment . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me , have you still got those patents ? " George 's long oval jaw dropped . " Of course not ! I transferred them to Holcombe last week . The purchase was authorized by the board . " " I see . " Dale 's face reflected nothing . " I thought I had suggested that you wait a while . " " But what was the point ? " George had ceased immediately to be the nephew ; his dry , sharp tone was already that of the dissatisfied client . " Everything was arranged . What I want to find out is who tipped off that poor white trash of a brotherin-law of mine . I figure it came from this office . Have you asked Timmy ? " " He 's uptown today . I ca n't reach him . " " You will remember I was never sure of him , " George said dryly . " I never really trusted him after that time he insulted me at the club . This is on your head , Sheridan . " Dale 's impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be shared . " I 'll vouch for Timmy . Do n't you worry . My only concern is how to settle the damn thing . Of course , if you had the patents we could rescind the whole deal . This way it 's tougher . You may have to pay something , George . Something rather stiff . " " Well , if it turns out that Timmy was responsible , " George said in an even dryer tone , " I shall expect to be compensated by free legal services . To the full extent of that something rather stiff . " " We 'll see , " Dale said noncommittally as he rose from his desk . " We may be worrying unduly . Let 's go uptown . And remember , George . I do the talking . " When they walked into Dale 's study in his apartment half  | an hour later they found Mrs. Emlen and the Fergusons already waiting . The former had a reproachful , afflicted look ; she gazed out the window , occasionally raising a handkerchief to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ; this is my thanks . She had no understanding of what Hank and Anita were complaining about ; it was enough for her that she was a trustee and that they were , in fact , complaining . Anita was tense and fidgety ; her husband , who looked deceptively young with his bad complexion and long messy blond hair , smiled tolerantly at everyone . " Ah 'm sorry to bring you gentlemen uptown , " he began . " But Ah knew we all would n't wish to make Mrs. Emlen go down . " He paused to look around the room complacently . " Well , Ah suppose Ah may as well start the ball rollin ' . It 's like what Ah said to you on the phone , Uncle Sherree . Mah spies tell me that old George here has been transferrin ' patents as fast as his hot little hands can move ' em . " Dale remained impassive . " Well ? " " A pretty quick turnover , would n't you call it ? " " Do you imply that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished ? " " Oh , no . " Hank 's smile broadened . " They were his , all right . Old George saw to that . " " Anything that slipped by your snout must have been invisible , " George retorted . " Just about , George , " Hank replied amiably . " Just about invisible . That 's mah point . " " You imply then , " Dale continued , " that these patents were of greater value than was represented to your wife ? " " That 's sort of what Ah 'm implyin ' . Ah wo n't deny it , suh . " " Then George , I presume , received a great price for them ? " " Oh , Ah do n't say yes to that . " Hank put his head to one side and smiled at him foxily . " Ah do n't say for sure he received a great price . They 's more ways than one to skin a cat . " " There are all sorts of ways a big company like that can pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Hank . The way  | you told me ! About all the business they could steer George 's way ! " " Honey , will ya let me tell it mah own way ? " Hank asked softly . " Will ya please ? " " What 's all this about , Sheridan ? " Mrs. Emlen demanded suddenly , turning indignantly to her brother-in-law . " What 's Anita saying ? Why is it that everyone keeps interfering with my business things ? " She turned resentfully on her daughter . " I do n't know what makes you think , Anita , that you 're qualified to speak on matters in which your uncle and I are so much more experienced . " " I may not be an expert in textiles , " Anita retorted , " but if George is , honey ? " Hank repeated , more ominously now . " Please ? " " George is n't doing anyone out of anything , " Dale broke in with an angry rumble . " And I 'm afraid we 're not going to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well for Anita to let you handle her business affairs if she wants . That 's her own choice , whatever the family may think of it . But when it comes to accusing her own relatives of improper conduct , I think she 'll have to speak for herself . " " Not if she wants me to speak for her ! " Hank exclaimed . Dale did not even deign to look at him . " If I ca n't talk to my wife 's niece in my own home , I shall conclude this interview , " he said sternly . " How about it , Anita ? " " There , Anita ! " her mother cried . " Listen to him ! " " Hank thought something might be wrong , " Anita said , faltering as she glanced at her husband . " He said his lawyer thought it looked funny , too . " " What ? " Dale 's voice became a sudden bark . " What do you mean , his lawyer ! We 've never had other lawyers on family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no need of his counsel . We can handle this thing in the family . " " I 'll do no such thing ! " " That 's it , honey . Tell ' em ! "  | " Anita ! " her mother exclaimed . " What does he think Hank 's lawyers will find out ? " Anita demanded , reckless now . " Something about his precious Timmy ? " " You 're being ridiculous , Anita , " Dale said in a calmer , condescending tone . " I 'm not in the least concerned about Timmy or any vicious slander that you may care to spread about him or me . We can survive that . What I am concerned about is the spectacle of your mother 's name being dragged through courts and newspapers . You seem to forget that she 's also a trustee . " " Well , of course ! " Mrs. Emlen exploded , turning wrathfully on her daughter . " Now will you see ? Or do you want to treat the public to a sordid family row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shocked , " no one will think you did anything . All you do is sign things . " " Sign things ! " Mrs. Emlen drew herself up . " Is that all you think I do for you children ? Poring over papers and statistics and documents , afternoon after afternoon . And you say I just sign things ! " " Really , Anita , " Dale said sternly , " I think you might do your mother the favor of not chasing lawyers after her . " Anita wavered , looking from her mother 's powdered anxiety to her uncle 's dark reproach . It was a moment , actually , of supreme crisis in her life . For Anita 's mind had always been a tumult of imagined slights . If a friend failed to speak to her on the street or to send her a Christmas card , if a bank teller asked proof of her identity or a store clerk checked on her charge account , it was always another manifestation of the human conspiracy to humiliate Anita Ferguson . In her universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , for natural bungling ; everything was smoothly and efficiently organized in a fabric of malicious planning against which she had no defense save her own alertness and bad temper . Yet no such fantasy could be quite complete . Even Anita had her momentary suspicions that coincidence was still a fact , that indifference could be as prevalent as malice and that  | on occasion her batteries might be opened up on persons who did n't even know of her existence . Even she could not live entirely in the spontaneous combustion of her anger . Her crisis now was that this suspicion had suddenly become a desperate hope ; she actually wanted her uncle and Timmy to have been honest with her . It might be almost too terrifying , might n't it , to find that one had all along been right ? That there was , in fact , a conspiracy ? " Very well ! " she cried , jumping up . " But on one condition ! If Timmy will come in here and tell me that everything 's on the up and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell me on his word of honor that I 've gotten all I 'm entitled to ! Will he do that , Uncle Sheridan ? " " Of course Timmy will do that , " Dale said dryly . " Then let him ! " " As soon as I can get hold of him . He was out of the office this afternoon . " " But he 's right here ! " Anita cried , her eyes popping with renewed suspicion . " Right in your own living room , having a drink with Eileen ! I saw them ! " Dale hesitated , but he did not flinch . A series of ugly possibilities flashed through his mind , but he would have to risk them . " Will you get him , please , George ? " When Timmy , following George into the study , saw who were assembled there , he felt , even with the quickening of his pulse , a sensation of curious relief . So this was it . Ever since the final distribution of the trusts he had lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his pleasures with a purely mechanical skill , unable to participate because he was unable any longer to identify sympathetically with the central character of his own drama . Those two weeks had been like a film when the sound track was broken ; now , even with the sudden jar of the resumed noise , it was not altogether misery to know that his story was again moving forward . Recognizing the tension in the room , he greeted nobody , waiting for the question to be put . " Anita has something she wants to ask you , Tim , " Dale said  | gravely . " The reassurance that she 's looking for is rather peculiar . However , I trust you 'll make allowances . She wants to know ? " " I 'll ask it , Uncle Sheridan ! " Anita cried suddenly . " I want to know , Timmy , when you turned over our trusts , if you had any idea that George 's share was worth more than Lolita 's and mine ! " Timmy stared , fascinated , at those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was speechless . He only knew what he could not do ; he could not break the sound track again . " Mrs. Ferguson , " he said in a distant tone , " I can not see that I 'm under any obligation to answer that . And what is more , I can not see what good an answer would do you . There 's no point having any discussion with a trustee whom you do n't trust . If you 're not satisfied with me , I must advise you to retain your own counsel . " Anita 's eyes moved nervously from side to side . She glanced at Dale . " Are n't you being a little hasty , Tim ? " Dale asked , smiling , in a tone of labored good nature . " We do n't have to be too lawyeresque with Anita . I know her question 's out of order , and I 've told her so . She has no business asking it at all . But you know how it is . Women hear all kinds of things at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have n't our training . Now I tell you what . You tell Anita that everything 's on the up and up , as you and I know it is , and I 'll see that she apologizes to you . Is that fair ? " " But you see that 's exactly what I wo n't do , " Timmy answered sharply . " She 's asking me to deny that I 've been dishonest . Such a denial would be worthless to her and degrading to me . Get a lawyer , Mrs. Ferguson , " he continued , turning back to Anita . " It 's the only way . " " Look , Timmy , " Anita exclaimed , going over to him and shaking her finger . " There 's something you do n't understand . My information came from a source that I could n't possibly ignore . No woman would have . You 're a partner of Uncle Sheridan 's and Mummy 's lawyer . Do n't you think you owe me a denial ? "  | " I 've given you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Eileen who told me ! " For a moment he was too stunned to speak . Then everything fitted . " All the more reason that you should get a lawyer , " he said quietly and turning on his heel , walked out of the room . " I will ! " she cried after him , in a raucous tone . " You 'll see I will ! " " Fact is , we already have one , " he heard Hank 's voice , and then the door slammed . But there were heavy footsteps behind him . " Timmy ! " Dale 's hand on his shoulder stopped him . " Come in here . " He felt himself propelled into the dining room and heard another door closed . " What the devil do you think you 're up to ? " " Why should I put up with her impertinence ? " Dale 's breath sounded heavily in the dark room . " She 's a bitch , of course , " he said with a rough wave of his hand towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell ? She can make trouble . Plenty of trouble . " " I 'll handle it , Sheridan . Do n't worry . After all , I 'm the trustee . " " But she 'll go to court , man ! " " Let her . What can she prove ? " " Damn the proof ! " Dale cried . " What about the publicity ? " " I do n't care about the publicity . " There was a pause in which Dale 's breathing sounded even louder . " You do n't care , in other words , " he said in a lower , sterner tone , " that Mrs. Emlen may be dragged into court to answer baseless charges ? You do n't stop to think how happy the press will be ? You do n't bother to consider Mrs. Emlen either as a client or an elderly , proud woman ? Why , a thing like this could kill her ! " " Oh , I fancy she 'll survive it , " Timmy said with a shrug . " Better , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dale exclaimed . " What harm can it possibly do you ? You will simply take the position that you had no knowledge of any deal between George and Holcombe ! "
