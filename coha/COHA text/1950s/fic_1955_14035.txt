Cook-house of Sam Pieters ' farm in the northern reaches of Brooklyn in September , 1776 . The cut-away of the cook-house is C. stage with a back drop of a wooded hill behind it . It is a small dingy log cabin with the Paul Revere Lamp hanging from a rafter already lit . It is early evening . There is a crude home-made table C. with three-legged stools R. and above it . Along the U. L. wall are 4 shelves with assorted pewter bowls and cups . Below the shelves are a wooden bench and a small empty keg . On the wall U. R. are a row of wooden pegs and a piece of broken mirror . There are two doors , the Dutch half door R. leads to the road , and the door L. leads to Sam Pieters ' farmhouse . Outside this L. door is an open primitive fire-place with a rig made of logs , from which hangs a large pot with stew steaming inside . As the lights dim up , we see two British Army officers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with a belt and canteen . A spy glass is on one of the shelves U. L. Several maps on a batten are on the table with ruler , dividers , and a pencil . Seated above the table is Major Clove , a veteran who wears a patch over one eye . He is a heavy , stolid , dogged professional British soldier who does n't much care who the enemy is or what the war is about . The other is a handsome , engaging , young dandy , a lieutenant named Lord Frederick Beckenham . Clove is paying strict attention to his work . Fredrick is not . He is standing behind Clove with one foot on the bench . The Orderly stands guard R. ; the Sentry L. Frederick looks about the cook-house sniffing with distaste . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( L. of Clove . ) I say , Major  --  this place stinks . p. 3 MAJOR CLOVE ( Brusquely . ) All billets stink . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM But precisely what species of stink is this one ? MAJOR CLOVE It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pot out there for the General 's dinner . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses L. to pot . ) Pemmican ? What , in God 's name , is that ? MAJOR CLOVE Drief beef , they say . I say it 's horsemeat  --  or , at best , goat . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses R. to Clove . ) Is that all they have in the way of food in this barbarous country ? MAJOR CLOVE Oh , they have cows and sheep and pigs . But when the word spreads through the countryside that we are about to arrive , they bury all the sides of beef or smoked hams or legs of mutton and subsist on  --  pemmican  --  until we have departed . You 'll find it 's the same in all wars  --  the natives are uncooperative . And now , Lord Frederick , if you will have the goodness to concentrate on these maps . The General has ordered us to provide him with a plan . ( He points to a map . ) We are presently here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the river is Kip 's Bay , on the island of Manhattan . p. 4 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Paying no attention as he crosses R. of Clove . ) I do n't understand it . MAJOR CLOVE You do n't understand what ? Did n't they teach you at Aldershot how to read maps ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I mean , they 're Englishmen , are n't they ? MAJOR CLOVE Who are ? What are you talking about ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM These people we 're supposed to be fighting . MAJOR CLOVE Some of them are English  --  some of them Dutch  --  Irish  --  French  --   --  But they 're all the same  --  they 're all Americans . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Why are they so blatantly antagonistic to us  --  not to say , downright discourteous ? Have n't they ever heard of hospitality ? ( Clove laughs , sourly as Frederick crosses to door L. ) Oh , I know , they 're resentful about something  --  taxes , or some such nuisance  --  and when the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities , in the good old British way . But  --  it 's one thing to have a whack at an officer of the law , and quite another thing to serve him such muck as this when he 's a guest in your house . p. 5 MAJOR CLOVE ( Wearily . ) Please sit down , Lieutenant , and attend to the business in hand . ( He looks at the map . Frederick sits on R. stool and tries to concentrate . ) Now , as I said , here is Kip 's Bay , and here , near the center of the island , are the Heights of Inklen-berg , now held by General Putnam and the remnants of his force . If we move with sufficient celerity , we shall cut him off from any hope of effecting juncture with General Washington , who is up here , at the northern end of the island , on Harlem Heights . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM How do we know that General Putnam is here and General Washington is there ? MAJOR CLOVE ( Testily . ) We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how do we know that our Intelligence is any less thick-witted than usual ? ( Sam Pieters comes in from L. , carrying logs . He is a grim-visaged Brooklyn farmer . ) MAJOR CLOVE ( Rises , crosses to door L. ) And what do you want ? SAM PIETERS ( At fireplace . ) Pardon me , my lord , but I came to feed the fire and stir the pot . p. 6 MAJOR CLOVE Then feed it , and stir it , and be damned to you . SAM PIETERS Thank you , sir . ( He lifts the pot and slowly throws some logs onto the fire below . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Seated on R. stool . ) You know , Clove  --  I have no confidence in maps . I mean , I learned that inches here turn out to be miles when you have to cover them on foot . How far is it , actually , from Kip 's Bay to  --  what 's its name ? MAJOR CLOVE ( Watching Pieters . ) Two hours march , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think I can just about make it , if there 's not too much equipment to carry . MAJOR CLOVE ( Undertone to Frederick . ) Be quiet ! ( Sam is now stirring the stew . Clove , at door L. , barks at Sam . ) It makes no difference how much you stir that mess  --  it will still taste as awful . Be off with you ! SAM PIETERS Thank you , sir . ( He goes out L. ) MAJOR CLOVE ( Crosses to table . ) You ca n't trust the loyalty of any of these wretched colonials . ( He sits on stool and returns to the map . ) Inklenberg Heights  --  Putnam 's Headquarters . I say we should detach only a small force to handle Putnam , while General Howe with the main army moves north to chase Washington up to Spuyten Duyvil. p. 7 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM To where ? MAJOR CLOVE ( Pointing to the map . ) Spuyten Duyvil  --  here it is  --  here , on the Harlem River . The Navy will blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the river , we can destroy him . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Spuyten Duyvil ! Why do we have to contend with such outlandish names ? the Heights of Inklenberg  --  Spuyten Duyvil  --  Canarsie ! ? MAJOR CLOVE Now , really , my boy ! ( He studies the map . ) My god , it is ! LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Rises and crosses out of L. door . ) My God , what a dreary country ! Why did Drake and Frobisher and all those chaps have to go pushing their noses into new continents ? MAJOR CLOVE The maps , Lord Frederick ! LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Comes back into cook-house . ) Why do n't we give these silly people their independence , if that 's what they 're shouting for ? Why ca n't we all go home and leave them to their  --  their  --  what 's it called  --   --  ? ( He gestures toward the stew. ) p. 8 MAJOR CLOVE Pemmican . ( An Orderly comes in from R. ) ORDERLY Gentlemen ! General Sir William Howe ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket . The Orderly quickly goes to his station R. outside of the cook-house and falls in line at attention with Corporal Mullet and Sergeant Galway who have entered from R. They present arms as General Sir William Howe enters , followed by his batman Hawley . Howe , the younger son of a Viscount , had dutifully gone into the army and displayed such brilliance and bravery , particularly in the battle of the plains of Abraham at Quebec , that he became a general at the age of 33 . He was a warm friend of Benjamin Franklin in London in the pre-revolution years and he shared Franklin 's political views in respect to the need for conciliating the American colonies . In addition to his military career he was also , for a time , a member of Parliament . As Howe enters the cook-house with Hawley , Galway and Mullet exit R. and the Orderly resumes his sentry duty . ) MAJOR CLOVE ( L. of table . ) General , sir . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Above table . ) Sir William . GENERAL SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( He sniffs. ) p. 9 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM It is something called pemmican , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I am acquainted with pemmican . ( He takes his lace hand-kerchief from his L. sleeve and extends it to Hawley who is R. of him . Hawley takes bottle of scent from his pouch and sprinkles some on the handkerchief . Howe looks around the cook-house . ) Damn it all , Clove  --  is this the best we can do in the way of quarters ? MAJOR CLOVE I 'm afraid so , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE When I was riding past Brooklyn village I saw two or three rather decent looking houses . MAJOR CLOVE I know , sir . They 've been commandeered by the Navy . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Naturally ! The Navy got here first . Oh , well  --  ( He sits on stool above table . Hawley removes his boots and puts on slippers . Frederick crosses R. ) one must accept the rigors of a soldier 's life , and the degrading inconveniences , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you plod your way through your dreary career . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Smiles . ) Yes , sir . p. 10 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Heard from your father ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Not yet , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE No doubt you will , when the grouse shooting ends . ( Hawley finishes Howe 's boots . Howe hands him his sword , gloves and hat . ) Thank you , Hawley . ( He looks at the map . ) Kip 's Bay  --  the Heights of Inklenberg  --   --  ( Hawley goes off R. with Howe 's gear , leaving boots outside the cook-house . ) MAJOR CLOVE ( L. of table , pointing to the map . ) It is my appraisal of the situation that General Putnam has established his headquarters about here  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I know where Putnam is . ( Clove shuts up . Howe studies the map closely . ) Hmmm  --   --  ( He talks to himself . ) General Washington will be under point blank fire from three ships of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits outside cook-house , polishing Howe 's boots . ) Harlem River narrow  --  but swift current here  --  awkward for small boats . ( The Orderly comes in R. ) p. 11 ORDERLY General , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Still studying the map . ) What is it ? ORDERLY The Hessians , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Calmly . ) Troop them in . ( The Orderly goes . Howe appears annoyed . To Frederick . ) When you write home , Freddie I 'll thank you not to underscore the fact that we are using German mercenaries , employed by His Teutonic Majesty to shoot down Englishmen . Your father 's hunting friends in Leicestershire might not consider this quite sporting . ( A Hessian enters R. , comes into cook-house . He is rigid , faceless . ) HESSIAN ( Clicks heels . ) General Graf von Donop ! ( He moves D. R. of door and Howe rises as von Donop strides in . Donop is older than Howe , more powerful physically , and considerably less attractive . He speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hessian is always at attention , mimicking every salute and heel click of von Donop . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE My dear General Graf von Donop . Do sit down . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Bowing slightly , stiffly . ) General Sir William Howe . ( Sits on R. stool. ) p. 12 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( To Frederick . ) Lieutenant  --  will you have the kindness to ask Hawley to fetch a bottle of Madeira ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Yes , sir . ( He goes off R. and speaks to Hawley . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE It 's rather good Madeira , General . My father laid it down in 1738 . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I have not come to discuss wine , General Howe , or to drink it ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Oh ? Too had . ( Sits on stool above table . ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP My troops are ready to cross this river and capture this city , whatever it is called . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Pointing to the map . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference  --   --  ( Frederick and Hawley exit R. ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Obviously not . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP We will take it . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You will ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Shrugs . ) It is a task for children But  --  are we provided with boats sufficient for coming across the river ? p. 13 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I believe we have transport adequate for all of our forces , including even the English troops , as well as your valiant Hessians . I shall soon have confirmation of this . But , General von Donop , in the meantime  --   --  GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Vehemently . ) There is no " meantime ! " If there are boats too few for your English , we Germans will go and attack ! We will crush this Putnam force and then  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Irked . ) I do n't doubt you can do it , my dear Graf von Donop . The Putnam " force , " as you most flatteringly describe it , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of Brooklyn Heights , the American casualties amounted to some 1,400 men . We captured two of their generals . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP But that was yesterday . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Today we outnumber them by a margin of at least six to one . In firepower , the margin is even greater in view of the number of cannon they had to leave behind on Long Island . What possible excuse is there for alarm ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP There is no excuse also for dawdling , luxuriating  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Did you hear that , Clove ? Luxuriating ! ( He laughs and von Donop rises , indignantly . Howe also rises . ) Forgive me , von Donop  --  my mirth was not at you , but rather at the quaintness of my surroundings . Look about you . p. 14 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Smiles , reluctantly . ) I withdraw the luxury . But  --  dawdling ? Yes ! While Putnam joins Washington and they reform their army . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Putnam is five miles apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own scattered command . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP You know this ? ( Hawley enters R. ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE There are many so-called Americans who have not forgotten they are Englishmen . They keep us informed . ( Hawley comes in with a bottle of Madeira and some pewter cups on a tray . Crosses L. of Howe and pours one cup . ) Ah ! Here is at least one drop of civilized sustenance in a barren land . I recommend it , von Donop , in the strongest terms . You will find that it induces an illusion of relaxation . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I thank you , no . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE As you wish . ( He takes the glass Hawley had filled for Donop . Hawley puts tray on keg U. L. , exits cook-house and resumes polishing boots . ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Rising . ) So  --  you will provide the boats immediately ? p. 15 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Drinks . ) I shall provide the boats at the precise moment when I consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Not before then , General . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Angrily . ) You will allow the Americans to escape , and that can lose for you the war . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE There are more ways than one to lose a war . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Yes  --  and you English know all of them ! MAJOR CLOVE Really , sir  --  ! I feel that I must resent these excessive demands on your good nature GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Smiles . ) Never mind it , Clove ! General the Graf von Donop is a professional soldier , as you are , and as , I hope , am I. Whatever our rank , when we have strong feelings about the conduct or misconduct of a campaign , it is our duty to express our views with candor and , of course , with seemly discretion . General von Donop has expressed his views with candor . And I have taken due note of them . ( Frederick returns , crosses below table U. L. near Clove . ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . I had no intention to insult your British patriotism . For me  --  patriotism is  --  ( He gropes for the word , and turns to Howe. ) what is it that your servants throw out ? p. 16 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Garbage ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP No  --  not garbage . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Rubbish ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Rubbish ! That is it ! Exactly ! Patriotism should have no place in the conduct of war . And no more does your English conception of what you call " sportsmanship . " You say you are a professional , General . I concede that . ( He bows slightly , so do Howe and the Hessian . ) But you also never forget that you are a gentleman . That is a mistake . I am sure you will comprehend my meaning ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Fully . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I am a member of the nobility . I am well educated , as you may see . But I am fortunately not a gentleman , except in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and it is a matter of professional pride that I want that side to win . ( Donop crosses L. below table during above , and goes around to Frederick who backs away R. until he bumps Hessian officer . Frederick crosses L. to Clove . Von Donop is R. of Howe . ) I give you example  --  I have fought on the side of the Prussian King Frederick der Grosse in one war  --  and , in another war , I have fought against him . I suppose you English gentlemen consider that contemptible ? p. 17 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Not at all . I think it 's a splendid thing to keep an open mind . But  --  if you 'll allow me  --  I had remarked that there are more ways than one to lose a war . ( Donop looks at him . ) And one of them is by headstrong impetuosity . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Angry . ) Not when pursuing a beaten enemy . ( Crosses D. R. ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Have you studied the habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Hawley exits off R. ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I have looked at it . The current seems sluggish . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE And does it always flow in the same direction ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP All rivers flow in one direction ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Not this one  --  because it is not a river  --  it is an estuary  --  subject to the massive movement of the tides . You see , my dear von Donop , you Germans are shrewd tacticians and dogged fighters when you have plenty of land  --  the whole continent of Europe  --  on which to manoeuver . We English are perhaps more at home where we confront a body of water . So I beg you to accept my judgment as to the most propitious moment for embarking our large force . ( He has risen . Robert Murray has entered R. and stands talking to Orderly. ) p. 18 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Reluctantly . ) I am under your orders . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Lightly . ) Then we are agreed ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a very good evening , and do please feed your troops as best you may . I recommend this pemmican . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Thank you . Good evening , General Sir William Howe . ( He and Hessian officer click heels , salute , turn together and exit R. Howe laughs and sits down on edge of table . Frederick crosses R. ) MAJOR CLOVE Permit me to ask , sir  --  is there no limit to your patience ? How could you sit there and accept such insulting talk from an insubordinate  --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Amused . ) Spare your righteous indignation , Clove . Being a mercenary , hired by the King , von Donop is to an extent independent of the normal chain of command . And his views are quite sound , militarily . After all , he could hardly be expected to understand the political implications . MAJOR CLOVE Sir ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Clove , imagine yourself the average man in the street in England . How would you feel if you heard that British Colonials in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice had been defeated and subdued by mercenary soldiers from Germany ? Of course , we all realize that General von Donop would like to settle this war singlehanded . That added glory would put up the price of the Hessians in the next war , when we might be bidding for their services against the French . ( The Orderly comes in R. ) p. 19 ORDERLY There 's a civilian here , sir  --  by name of Murray . Says he has an appointment . MAJOR CLOVE Shall I dispose of him ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE No ! He 's one of our friends . He 's in the shipping trade and has done good work in moving our supplies . Bring him in , Orderly . ( The Orderly goes out R. Howe sits on stool and drinks the wine . ) My God , this Madeira is good . How it stands the rigors of an Atlantic crossing , I do not know  --   --  Ah , good evening , Mr. Murray . ( He rises as Robert Murray comes in R. Murray is a Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his accent . ) ROBERT MURRAY General Howe , good evening to you . ( He shakes hands with the other two officers , whom Howe does n't bother to introduce . ) Gentlemen . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Sit down , Mr. Murray . Will you have a glass of wine ? ROBERT MURRAY ( Sits on R. stool . ) No , thank you , General . I shall not take up your time . I have nothing but good to report . The boats are laid on . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Sits on edge of table . ) I know . I have inspected them  --  and counted them . ( Frederick and Clove exit L. with spyglass and stand looking out L. ) p. 20 ROBERT MURRAY And  --  I have received word that two packets , the Termagant and the Pleiades , have passed Sandy Hook and are proceeding to Whitehall Slip on Manhattan Island where their cargoes will be unloaded . They carry guns and gunpowder and all manner of supplies for the replenishment of your army . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those ships are vital , and urgently needed in our coming campaign . ROBERT MURRAY And , incidentally , the Pleiades carries a large supply of the best wine for your own stock , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Rises . ) That is good news , Mr. Murray . I congratulate you on your enterprise . My wine is all but exhausted . I was afraid I might have to resort to your native product , which , if you do n't mind my saying so , is ROBERT MURRAY ( Smiles and rises . ) I know what you mean , sir . ( They shake hands . ) When you reach Manhattan Island , which I take it , will be shortly , pray feel free to use my house as your own personal headquarters . I promise you the warmest of welcomes . ( Frederick and Clove return to cook-house and stand L. of table . He points to the map . ) My house is here , on the Heights of Inklenberg . I 'm afraid we can not provide you with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have game and we have a few wines of France that I am prepared to back against the best . And Mrs. Murray and I would be proud to prove to you , and to His Majesty , that this colony of New York is not rebellious and not entirely uncivilized . And now , sir , by your leave ( He extends his hand. ) p. 21 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Shaking hands . ) Thank you , Mr. Murray . I shall not forget your most courteous invitation . And my compliments to your wife . ROBERT MURRAY Good night to you , General Howe  --  gentlemen  --  ( He shakes hands with both officers and starts to leave R. , then turns. ) and , may I say , " God Save the King ! " ( At those words Howe , who had turned back to his maps , turns and gestures with his right hand , only to find it grasped again by Murray who shakes it once more . They all watch him exit R. and shake hands with the Sentry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust this man , sir ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Above table . ) I am satisfied that he is a patriot . MAJOR CLOVE But on our side  --  or on theirs ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE There you have it , Clove . You may prove to be brighter than I have previously suspected . MAJOR CLOVE Thank you , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Turns to Frederick . ) What is your impression , Freddie ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( U. R. of table near R. door . Pompously . ) I am inclined , sir , to agree with my colleague , Major Clove . To the extent , sir , that I should be hesitant to partake of his hospitality  --  I mean , sir , the meat , the game , the French wine , and all that . I should be fearful , sir , that any or all of them might be poisoned . p. 22 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You doubt his loyalty ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I consider it my duty to do so , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doubt the loyalty of all of these Americans . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You are quite right . They are a dangerous lot , with inherited criminal instincts and an undeniable gift for homicide . And  --  worse  --  they are fuzzy-minded idealists . They believe in things . Have you read their Declaration of Independence , which they proclaimed in July ? MAJOR CLOVE I 've heard of it , sir , but I have n't bothered to look at the seditious document . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You should have a look at it . It might give you a clearer idea of what we have to contend with . They hold certain truths to be self-evident . Truths ! What is truth ? " To thine own self be true . " But what is thine own self , Clove ? ( Turns to Frederick . ) Or what is thine own self , Frederick ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I am not sure , General Howe . I have only just joined the army . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Laughs . ) That is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dew of St. James 's Park . ( He looks at the map and sits on stool . ) We shall start the embarkation at 11 , ante meridian . That will coincide with the planned naval operations . Our main landings are here , and here , and here . I shall establish my head-quarters on the Heights of Inklenberg after noon . p. 23 MAJOR CLOVE ( Pleased . ) Shall I convey the orders , sir ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE No ! I shall convey the orders myself after I have put something into this shrunken stomach . Tell the farmer , our host , that he may serve that slop to us now . MAJOR CLOVE Yes , sir . ( He goes out L. ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Looking at map. ) the Heights of Inklenberg You know , Freddie , I should be very much surprised if Mr. Murray attempted to poison us . ( He looks at Frederick . ) Of course , you will taste everything first . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( A bit nervous . ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need n't worry . Mr. Murray 's highest loyalty is to the Bank of England , and we are the defenders of that . It might be quite an agreeable interlude on this island . I 'm told that his wife is quite a bit younger than he . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Really ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE So perhaps there may be some entertainment for you , ( Clove comes in with Sam Pieters , who starts ladling the stew into pewter bowls at the fire . Clove moves the bench down to L. of table . Frederick clears the table of maps , taking them to U. L. shelves . ) Sit down , gentlemen . ( They sit , Clove on bench , Frederick on L. stool . Pieters puts the bowls on the table . Looking at the stew . ) I know that at this point I am expected to say Grace  --  but I do n't think I could mutter it with sufficiently reverent conviction .

( He seems about to continue , but Mary silences him with a gesture . ) MARY MURRAY Wait outside ! ( He goes outside and proceeds to the front gate area . Mary opens the door of Mr. Murray 's study , looks in and then quickly makes her way to the waiting Messenger . ) What is the message ? ( The Messenger reaches into his tunic and takes out a long , narrow folded piece of rice paper sealed with wax . Mary breaks the seal and reads the message . She refolds the paper and looks at the Messenger squarely . ) Thank you . THE MESSENGER Is that all ? MARY MURRAY Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The supply lines are cut off ; and if the British cross the East River , in time , our whole army will be broken in two . We wo n't be able to move north to Harlem to join up with General Washington . p. 27 MARY MURRAY So the present prospect is none too bright ? THE MESSENGER I 'm afraid it is n't  --  if they move fast enough , as they did before . MARY MURRAY Tell General Putnam that you have delivered the message to Mrs. Murray . THE MESSENGER Yes , ma'am . ( He salutes her and starts off . She touches his arm . He stops and looks at her . Mary takes his hand . ) MARY MURRAY God be with you . ( The Messenger runs off . Mary returns to the living room , goes to her desk and standing there , reads the message again . Suddenly the study door is opened and Mr. Murray appears carrying a travelling bag . Mary turns swiftly . The message is still in her hands , she glances at it , folds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dress . ) ROBERT MURRAY ( Puts bag on table above sofa , opens it and arranges papers . ) I 've ordered the carriage . MARY MURRAY ( Sits on desk stool . ) Where are you off to now ? ROBERT MURRAY I 'm driving down to the Battery and then I 'm going across to Staten Island . ( Crosses D. R. to Mary . ) Last night I talked with General Howe on Long Island . p. 28 MARY MURRAY I suppose he 's happy about his victory . ROBERT MURRAY If you ask me , Mary , he 's not happy enough . There 's a certain lack of enthusiasm in that man that I find somehow disturbing . ( Daisy , a saucy , tiny Negro maid , who has come from cook-house , enters C. with packet of food , crosses D. L. below sofa and gives it to Murray . ) Thank you , Daisy . ( Daisy curtsies and exits C. and crosses L. back to cook-house . ) However , he 's the commander-in-chief  --   --  and he needs supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he gets them . And , by the way , we may be having General Howe and his staff as our guests when he crosses to Manhattan . MARY MURRAY ( Looking up . ) And when will that be ? ROBERT MURRAY Soon , I trust . ( Crosses L. , sits on sofa . ) If they do n't stir their stumps , Putnam will escape them . MARY MURRAY Will they have to stay in the house ? ROBERT MURRAY Oh  --  they wo n't be here for more than a meal , at most , while Howe 's army is disposing of Putnam . Then they 'll march north to catch Washington . But  --  I must caution you , Mary , not a word of this to the servants  --  or to anyone else  --  even your sister . ( He seems genuinely distressed . ) We ca n't be sure where anyone 's sympathies may lie . So  --  we have to mistrust everyone  --  even the members of our own family . ( Rises , crosses R. ) We have to look with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rises , crosses to Murray . ) Must I look with suspicion on you , Robert  --  and you on me ? ROBERT MURRAY That is the tragic part of it , Mary . ( He smiles . ) But  --  I 'm not unduly concerned about you , my dear . That is not among the reasons for my loss of sleep these days . I know you are the most loyal as you are the most faithful of wives . ( She gives him a look in which there is a suspicion of resentment . Crosses to desk , sits on stool . ) And , thank God , it wo n't be for long . ( He sits on sofa . Susan Lindley enters L. from garden , crosses U. R. to house . She is a lovely young girl , about twenty-two years old . ) If General Howe moves fast enough against Washington 's army  --  he 'll destroy the Yankee rebels  --  and this sorry revolution will be ended , and we can all resume our normal status as loyal , God-fearing subjects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sofa . ) Good morning , Susan . SUSAN LINDLEY Good morning , Robert . ROBERT MURRAY ( Looking at her , closely . ) What 's the matter with you , my girl ? You 're red-eyed . Have you been crying ? ( She is silent . Murray rises , crosses to R. of Susan . ) Why , you have been trying ! What 's wrong with you ? p. 30 SUSAN LINDLEY ( Crosses L. below sofa to L. window . ) We should all be crying  --  with the war all about us . ROBERT MURRAY It will soon be over , my dear . ( Crosses to Mary . ) Good-bye , Mary . ( She rises and he kisses her cheek . ) MARY MURRAY When will you be back ? ROBERT MURRAY This evening , I expect . Good-bye , Susan . All of this is not nearly so serious as it seems . ( He exits C. and goes out front gate . ) MARY MURRAY ( Above sofa . To Susan . ) What is it ? SUSAN LINDLEY Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY MURRAY ( Crosses to desk . ) Of course . ( She looks sharply at Susan . ) SUSAN LINDLEY ( Crosses R. ) Is your husband a traitor ? MARY MURRAY A traitor to what ? ( Sits on desk stool . ) SUSAN LINDLEY To our country ! ( She speaks with ferocity . ) The servants are whispering that he 's dealing with the English  --  that he 's conspiring against the Continental Army . Is he loyal  --  or disloyal ? I have to know the truth about this . p. 31 MARY MURRAY Mr. Murray is a practical man . SUSAN LINDLEY And you ? MARY MURRAY  --  a practical woman , like most women . My husband and I hold separate  --  and private  --  views on many subjects . He , for example , is a firm believer in the superiority of the male sex and yet  --  ( Shots are heard  --  not many of them  --  from a distance . Daisy rushes in U. C. from cook-house . Susan goes to L. window . ) DAISY Mrs. Murray !  --  Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? DAISY John , the gardener  --  John says  --  MARY MURRAY What does John say ? DAISY The red-coats are here ! They crossed the East River this morning and they 're still crossing and they 're shooting out there . MARY MURRAY Are there many of them  --  the red-coats ? DAISY Hundreds , thousands  --  that 's what John says . MARY MURRAY ( Calmly , at the window . ) Tell the cook that we may have to prepare for guests . p. 32 SUSAN LINDLEY ( Turns , crosses C. ) Guests ? ! MARY MURRAY And  --  for heaven 's sake , Daisy  --  calm down ! DAISY ( Far from calm . ) Yes , ma'am . ( She exits C. Mary sits at her desk . ) SUSAN LINDLEY ( Crosses to Mary . ) What guests ? ( Mary writes , finishing off her letter . ) Would you receive the hateful British in this house ? MARY MURRAY ( She writes on . ) If General Howe wants to stop in for a glass of Hollands gin , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name with a flourish , and looks about the desk . ) Where is that sealing wax ? ( Susan goes L. to the window . The shouts have stopped . ) I suppose that , as usual , Mr. Murray has it all hoarded in his study . ( She stands up , crosses U. L. above sofa . ) There are certain ancient laws of hospitality , Susan , that apply even in the senseless chaos of war . There are also certain primitive laws of self-protection , and if you keep your senses open , little sister , you may observe that cannon and muskets and gun powder are not the only weapons of war . ( She exits into the study . Susan looks out the window . From the U. R. corner of the house Daisy appears , frightened , she runs down around the house looking off R. At the same time Galway appears at the U. L. corner of the house . He carries his musket at the alert . As he crosses down to C. followed by Frederick , he backs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cook-house . On the face to face encounter , Galway gasps , startled . Galway and Frederick continue around to the porch . Susan , who has seen their approach through the L. window , crosses to the R. window . Frederick salutes her. ) p. 33 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Through the window . ) Forgive me , ma'am , but is this the house of Mr. Robert Murray ? SUSAN LINDLEY It is . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Do I have the honor of addressing Mr. Murray 's wife , or perhaps his daughter ? SUSAN LINDLEY I am Mrs. Murray 's sister . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Looking past Susan into the room . ) If I may say so , it is an unutterable joy to look again into a civilized house . It is like an echo of home . SUSAN LINDLEY What do you want ? If you are searching for American soldiers , there are none here . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Looks at her , admiringly . ) I am not searching for soldiers . God forbid ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan turns away from him . ) Mr. Murray invited General Howe to be his guest ( Susan accepts that as confirmation of her suspicions . ) Is Mr. Murray at home ? SUSAN LINDLEY He is not ! LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Looks at her , smiles . ) I 'm afraid I detect a certain note of hostility . But that is quite understandable , under the unfortunate circumstances . May I come in ? ( Susan goes quickly to the door to the study. ) p. 34 SUSAN LINDLEY Mary ! Mary ! SERGEANT GALWAY ( To Frederick . ) We do n't have to ask , sir . We just walk in . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Certainly not , Orderly . We are in the presence of the gentry . ( Mary comes out of the study to the R. window . ) MARY MURRAY Ah , good morning ! We were expecting you ! Are you General Howe ? ( Galway laughs . Frederick looks at him sternly . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Hardly , madam . I am an humble subaltern  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do come in . You 'll find the front door right there . ( To Susan . ) Susan ! Open the door for the gentlemen . ( Susan gives Mary an angry look , which Mary ignores . Susan goes out into the hall to open the door . Frederick comes in from the hall , followed by Galway , with his musket still at the alert , and then Susan . Mary R. of C. door . ) I am Mrs. Murray . How do you do ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( The soul of affability . ) Moderately well , thank you , ma'am  --  although I can hardly claim to be enjoying these events in which we are presently engaged . I am Lieutenant the Lord Frederick Beckenham , which sounds formidable , but I can not help it , as I was born with the encumbrance . I am instructed to present to you the compliments of General Sir William Howe and to say that , having landed at Kip 's Bay this morning , he would impose briefly upon your hospitality if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Lieutenant . Mr. Murray and I consider it an honor . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Thank you , ma'am . ( He turns to Galway who is holding his gun so that it points at Susan . ) Do you have to carry that musket always at the alert ? It 's insulting . SERGEANT GALWAY ( Grounding the musket . ) Sorry , sir . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( To Mary . ) Then , madam , you would not be averse to receiving a call from the Commander in Chief of His Majesty 's forces ? MARY MURRAY ( Smiles . ) I should welcome the intrusion . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( To Galway . ) Convey the message to the General that he will find most courteous reception at Mr. Murray 's house . SERGEANT GALWAY Right , sir . ( He exits C. and out front door and round house L. ) MARY MURRAY Do sit down , Lieutenant . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Thank you . ( Mary crosses D. and sits at the desk . Frederick crosses D. R. and waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is about to sit , Frederick sits at L. end of the sofa . Susan , however , moves to U. L. armchair and sits. ) p. 36 MARY MURRAY You must be tired after your long journey from the Brooklyn shore . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I thought I was in rather good physical condition , but a few days of soldiering persuades one that one is an old crock . ( He laughs , looks at D. L. armchair for Susan , finally sees her U. L. Her expression never changes during the rest of the scene . She just looks at him . ) MARY MURRAY You 've had only a few days of it ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( To Mary . ) Yes . I 'm afraid I arrived out here only last Thursday . I landed on Staten Island . Then we crossed to Long Island , where we fought a battle which , for some reason that I could n't possibly explain , we managed to win . I believe something was said about an " encircling movement . " ( Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , we came over here , to Manhattan Island . ( He laughs . ) I must confess , I 've begun to wonder  --  is n't there such a thing as a mainland on this continent ? MARY MURRAY ( Laughs . ) Oh , yes  --  if you keep going far enough . You can really go on and on indefinitely . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I find that a depressing thought . ( He and Mary laugh . He looks at Susan , in the background , she is grim. ) p. 37 MARY MURRAY How many of you are there , Lieutenant  --  I mean , how many for lunch ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Oh  --  only the General and his personal aides , Major Clove and your humble servant . MARY MURRAY Perhaps I had better give orders . Susan  --  you will keep the Lieutenant amused . ( She gives Susan an admonishing look and goes out C. and off to cook-house . Susan rises and advances slowly to do her duty . Frederick has stood up again . ) SUSAN LINDLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pray , be seated first ? ( Susan sits in D. L. armchair . Frederick sits on sofa . After an awkward pause . ) It 's a lovely day  --  but I find it quite warm . Is it always as warm as this in America ? SUSAN LINDLEY ( She rises and so does Frederick . She crosses R. ) It varies . Sometimes it is extremely hot  --  sometimes extremely cold . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I see . ( He glances at her . ) Are you a native ? ( He regrets that word . ) I mean , were you born here ? p. 38 SUSAN LINDLEY I was born in Connecticut  --  Salisbury , Connecticut . ( She sits on desk stool . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( He sits on sofa . ) Ah ! Salisbury ! There 's a name one can cope with . Does your family still live there ? SUSAN LINDLEY ( She rises , he does too . ) Really , sir  --  could n't such questioning of a chance acquaintance  --  might it not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might . ( He crosses around the sofa to R. end of sofa as he speaks . ) But  --  I 'm a rude , blunt fellow  --  a younger son , denied adequate training in the graces and amenities . You see  --  the trouble is  --  I 'm keenly interested in people , particularly if they 're young and female and delightful to behold . I want to know them  --  I want to treasure them in the storehouse of my memories . But if I have been rude  --  Miss  --  is it Miss Murray ? SUSAN LINDLEY My name is Miss Lindley . ( She sits on desk stool . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Miss Susan Lindley . I believe your sister addressed you as Susan ? p. 39 SUSAN LINDLEY She did . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( R. of sofa . ) Susan Lindley . A charming name . It sounds like the heroine of a novel by Samuel Richardson . Are you familiar with the writings of Samuel Richardson ? SUSAN LINDLEY Tolerably . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses L. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . My governess tried to browbeat me into reading his books , but I found them slobbery  --  namby pamby  --  niminy piminy  --   --  SUSAN LINDLEY And I remind you of them ? ( She smiles , slightly , maliciously , in spite of herself . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses to her . Nobly . ) I did not say that ! I meant only to say that your name suggests a certain old-world  --  er  --  fragrance  --  and  --  and good breeding . Dash it all , Miss Lindley  --  I meant it as a compliment ! SUSAN LINDLEY ( Laughs . ) I 'm sure you did , Lieutenant . And I 'm sure you 're making a valiant attempt to keep up a conversation . But it is n't really necessary . p. 40 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses U. R. back to sofa . ) I realize it has n't been completely successful , up to now . SUSAN LINDLEY ( Seeking information . ) I know that you wish to show every respect for my brother-in-law . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( L. end of sofa . ) Quite naturally . I believe he has been of service to us . SUSAN LINDLEY ( Seated on stool . ) No doubt . But you do n't have to bother with me . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses below sofa to her . ) But I have every wish to bother with you ! You 'll forgive me , Miss Lindley , if I seem to be pressing . But I 've been a long time at sea on the voyage out . And then  --  Staten Island  --  Long Island  --  Manhattan Island  --  confusing hostilities . The sight of a young lady is refreshing , to the point of intoxication . SUSAN LINDLEY Pray , sir , do n't mistake me for a young lady . I mean  --  the species of young lady you have always known . I am a poor relation  --  a wretched orphan , if you please  --   --  p. 41 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( He laughs . ) You sound more and more like a novel by Samuel Richardson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounces up as she rises and crosses to him . ) SUSAN LINDLEY ( Annoyed . ) And  --  you may as well know the truth , Lieutenant  --  I think your King George the Third is brutal and heartless and tyrannical and  --  and detestable . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Laughs . ) Oh , come now  --  you should make allowances for our revered King , remembering that he 's a bit touched in the head . ( Indicating his temple with his finger . ) SUSAN LINDLEY Then why do you come all these thousands of miles to fight for him ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Turns , crosses L. ) Now you 're asking embarrassing questions . But  --  I 'll answer you , Miss Lindley . ( Turns to her at L. end of sofa . ) I 've come here because I was jolly well told to do so . SUSAN LINDLEY You have no rebellious spirit in you ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM None whatsoever  --  except on the rare occasions when I am crossed by a woman . Please bear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 SUSAN LINDLEY What is that ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM The General is approaching . SUSAN LINDLEY I shall tell Mrs. Murray . ( She starts U. C. ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Stops her at doors . ) One moment ! I may have no further opportunity to talk to you . We 'll be moving on soon , I 'm afraid . You have taken a rather antagonistic attitude toward me , and I want you to know that I am not incapable of resentment . ( She looks at him , levelly . ) But  --  when this war is over , in a week or so , I shall return to this house and call on you for the purpose of showing you my true nature  --  the nature of a vengeful , ravenous beast ! ( As Frederick is speaking , General Howe and his party appear at the U. L. corner of the house . The party consists of the Orderly , Sentry , Howe , Hawley , Galway and Mullett . Cora and a Boy precede the column mimicking their walk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they reach the porch , the soldiers form a line , also the children , Howe sees Frederick in the house . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Through the window . ) Well , Lord Frederick  --  you appear to have reconnoitered. p. 43 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Turning , startled . ) Oh  --  General , sir  --  I 'll let you in . ( He goes out to the hall . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE That will be good of you . ( Susan runs out , upper L. Howe goes around , through the front door , and comes in , followed by Frederick . Susan curtsies and exits c. to the cook-house . The soldiers disperse to sentry duty U. R. , U. L. , D. R. , D. L. of house where they remain rest of act . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( At door c . ) Is there any news yet , sir ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Hands hat , sword and gloves to Frederick who puts them on U. L. chair . ) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about across . Then the boats go back for the horses and wagons . We have Putnam cut off . We 've definitely stolen a march . But  --  God , I 'm weary . I suppose it 's permissible to sit down ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses to L. end of sofa . ) Of course , sir . Here , sir . ( He indicates sofa . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Thoroughly at home , are n't you ? You 've evidently moved in . Pretty girl , that . p. 44 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Most agreeable , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Are these people trustworthy ? ( Sits on sofa . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses R. below sofa . ) Oh , entirely , I should say . Although I 'm afraid the young lady does not particularly like us English . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Who does ? She makes no bones about it ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM None , unfortunately . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Then we need not fret about her . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Picks up Voltaire book . ) I sent him to mollify von Donop , who is having one of his tantrums because I kept the Hessians back until the last wave over . Have you met Mrs. Murray ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( R. end of sofa . ) Yes , sir . She seems most hospitable and most civilized . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Is it true she 's younger than he is ? p. 45 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Oh , yes  --  quite definitely , I should say . In fact  --  one wonders  --  but perhaps I should n't say it . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Amused . ) Why not ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Oh , well  --  you know how it is , sir . Sometimes one meets a married woman and one wonders  --  well  --  how did this happen ? ( Howe laughs . Mary and Susan enter from cook-house L. , and cross to house . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Is Murray here ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landings of those ships . ( Mary comes in C. , followed slowly by Susan . Frederick crosses U. R. ) Ah , Mrs. Murray  --  may I present General Howe MARY MURRAY ( Crosses D. R. , below sofa . ) You do honor to our house , General . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Rises , bows . ) My humble duties to you , ma'am . MARY MURRAY ( To ' Howe , seeing him for the first time . ) I deeply regret that my husband could not be here . He was called away on business . p. 46 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Looking at her , admiringly . ) What a shame ! MARY MURRAY General  --  this is my sister , Miss Lindley . ( Susan , above sofa , curtsies coolly . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Bows . ) Your servant , Miss Lindley . ( He turns to Mary . ) A rare beauty runs in your family . MARY MURRAY Well , now  --  really , General , you should know that extravagance is sinful . GENERAL SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not dissemble . MARY MURRAY ( Laughs . ) An old soldier , perhaps  --  but , also , a young cavalier . ( Howe bows . Daisy comes in C. with a tray on which are thick glasses , containing some kind of gin drink , and a glass pitcher with more of the same . She serves Frederick . Mary and Howe , puts tray on sofa table and exists C. ) I 'm sorry . General  --  I can offer you no Madeira or Port wine . Our supplies are short at the moment . It 's the blockade , you know . But perhaps this concoction of iced Holland 's Gin with a dash of sack might amuse you . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I 'm sure I shall find it hilarious ! p. 47 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses L. below sofa . ) Forgive me , sir . But permit me to taste that first . ( He attempts to whisper this but Mary overhears him and laughs . ) MARY MURRAY Oh , you need n't be alarmed , Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary crosses to Howe . ) Here , General  --  we shall swap glasses to prove there is no jiggery-pokery afoot . ( She tries to take his glass and to give him hers . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE We shall do nothing of the kind . ( He drinks and thought-fully considers the taste . ) I 'll say this for it  --  it bears no resemblance to anything I 've ever tasted before . Come on , Freddie , my boy  --  drink up ! To prove that the sturdy old British stomach is ready for anything ! ( He drinks again . ) MARY MURRAY ( L. of desk . Raising her glass . ) I drink to the notable victory you have won on Long Island , and to your continued health . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( L. end of sofa . ) Hear , hear ! ( Susan scowls . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Near D. L. , armchair . ) Why , that is most kind of you , Mrs. Murray . And let that be a lesson to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Madam  --  my most abject apologies . I was trying to perform a distasteful duty . MARY MURRAY ( Smiles at him . ) But an essential one . You can never be too careful among strangers . ( To Howe . ) Do you like it , sir ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Dubious . ) I do n't think I could form mature judgment on such short acquaintance . What is it called ? MARY MURRAY A stone-fence . It 's a form of aperitif . The idea is that if you can get over that stone fence you can eat a horse . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE A horse ! Good God , I 've been eating nothing else for weeks . ( He has another drink  --  considers it . ) Stone fence , eh ! It 's interesting . It has something to say for itself . Just what , I do n't know yet . MARY MURRAY Perhaps it says : " Beware !

Open the front door , Susan . ( Susan exit C. ) I regret , Sir William , that we 're rather short-handed as to staff Our servants drift away in wartime . The men go off for military service , on one side or the other , and the girls go off after the men . ( Susan and Clove come in C. ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE We are imposing on you , grievously . Well , Clove  --  what is it ? ( Clove crosses D. L. to Howe and looks nervously at the two ladies . ) MAJOR CLOVE Well , sir  --  I  --  my report might be considered of a confidential nature . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Confidential nonsense ! We 're among friends . And , in any case , what difference does it make ? MARY MURRAY If you wish us to withdraw  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE No ! Speak up , Major . MAJOR CLOVE General von Donop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM HOWE Has he selected a route ? MAJOR CLOVE He wants to advance westward along the northern slopes of the Heights of Inklenberg . He requests his orders to do so . p. 50 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE He requests , does he ? And what about Clinton ? MAJOR CLOVE General Clinton appears to be concerned only with establishing the integrity of the supply lines . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Pleased . ) Good old Clinton ! ( To Mary . ) Good old British deliberateness ! Leave nothing to chance  --  except at the races . ( He turns back to Clove . ) Assure General Clinton that in my view it would be prudent to remain in position until the contents of the Termagant and Pleiades reach us . Meanwhile , you will take Hawley and fetch me a dozen bottles of the 1738 . MAJOR CLOVE Yes sir . And what about von Donop ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Tell him that his men may forage  --  anywhere but on Mr. Murray 's property . Any depredations on this land will be subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  no attack  --  until I give orders in writing or in person .

GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Even so , Major Clove . You will fetch the Madeira . p. 51 MAJOR CLOVE Very good , sir . ( He exits , goes around house . Howe looks at Mary and smiles . ) MARY MURRAY ( Crosses U. to sofa table and brings pitcher of gin to Howe . Meekly . ) If that poor man wants to attack , I should think you could allow him to do so . ( She pours him another stone fence and crosses above sofa to refill Frederick 's glass . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE And let von Donop fall into a Yankee ambush ? Not that I should go into mourning if he did . Thank you . But I 'm responsible for the lives of my men  --  even the Hessians . ( He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't you find something to do ?

He 's the younger son of a Marquess . I , too , am a younger son . ( Crosses to L. end of sofa . ) Freddie and I , in our separate years , both entered upon life with no fortune , no future , no choice of career save in the clergy , the House of Commons , or the military .

The poor boy is desperately lonely , and any young girl  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses R. below sofa . ) I , too , am desperately lonely , Mrs. Murray . MARY MURRAY ( Smiles . ) That I doubt very much . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Oh , you do , do you ! ( Sits on sofa . ) Because you have no idea how long it has been since I could sit down , at ease , and chat with a beautiful , intelligent woman . MARY MURRAY ( A bit flustered . Rises , crosses U. L. to bell cord . ) Would you care for a cup of coffee , General Howe ? I 'm sorry I can not offer you tea . The tax , you know . But Amelie makes excellent coffee . She comes from French Martinique . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Turns to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a rather graceful compliment . MARY MURRAY ( Above sofa L. ) I know you did . It was so graceful , and so subtle , that I felt I should change the subject . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Please do n't . I am in a mood to forget the more materialistic things  --  such as food , and war . ( Rises , crosses to L. window . ) This afternoon , when I rode up to the summit of this gentle hill , I paused to contemplate the view to the westward . I looked across the fields and the orchards and the forests  --  the green forests , turning red and yellow . I looked across to the majestic Hudson , now converted into a ribbon of gold by the descending sun . And beyond the river  --  the Palisades of New Jersey , standing like the creased walls of some vast medieval town , albeit on the wrong side of the moat  --  and as  --   --  p. 54 MARY MURRAY ( Crosses to him . ) Why , General  --  you 're positively poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked out at the superb view , I thought that if I lived in such a God-blessed place , I should want to defend it to the death  --  against any enemy who sought to invade it . Including myself . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses R. below sofa . ) Those are noble sentiments , sir , and I 'm sure all New Yorkers would be deeply stirred by them . And I should like to think we shall never suffer an invader more disruptive than you . But  --  there is one enemy that I 'm afraid can never be resisted . ( Points out R. window to view of city . ) Commerce ! It will destroy all the natural beauties that you have so graciously admired . Soon there will be not a patch of green between here and the Harlem River . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Looking out L. window . ) I shall be visiting the Harlem River tomorrow . MARY MURRAY You will be fighting Washington on Harlem Heights ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I shall be finishing Washington . I hope he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the honor of taking him prisoner . I hear he is a most courtly gentleman , who served the British Army with distinction in the Indian Wars . I trust he will not be foolhardy . p. 55 MARY MURRAY ( Sits on desk stool . ) And after you have finished Washington  --  what then ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I shall cross those handsome Palisades and march through New Jersey to Philadelphia , for the dispersal of the Continental Congress . MARY MURRAY ( Rises , crosses U. L. ) And that will be the end of the war , wo n't it ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Of course it will , and none too soon . And when I 'm in Philadelphia , I hope to have the pleasure of renewing acquaintance with my old friend , Ben Franklin . ( Crosses to sofa . ) I look forward to that . Ben and I were fellow conspirators in London before this war started . ( He laughs . Sits on sofa . ) I could tell you a tale or two about Ben and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. end of sofa . ) I have not had the pleasure . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE If they had only listened to him  --  and by " they " I mean His Majesty 's Government  --  if they had only been able to see things through his wise old eyes  --  ( Rises , crosses L. ) well , it 's idle to speculate  --  but I 'm sure that if common sense had prevailed , I should not be here , enforcing His Majesty 's will at the point of a bayonet . ( Turns to her . ) But reason did not prevail . They chose to make a war of it , risking the loss of our richest colonies , all for the sake of a few pence here and there in taxes on tea . p. 56 MARY MURRAY You secretly agree with Dr. Franklin ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( He crosses to her . ) There is no secret about it , I assure you . I have stated so , publicly and loudly . That is why they sent me on this mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known sympathies , I might delude the Colonists into submission . But , when it is all over , Ben and I will remain friends . He will invite me to his house for a steaming hot bath with the toilet water that is supplied him by Marie Antoinette , and then he will feed me the finest dinner that Pennsylvania can provide , served by the comely young doxies that he always has about him . ( As Howe says all this he appears vaguely unhappy , uneasy , restless  --  which Mary does not fail to notice . ) MARY MURRAY ( At R. end of sofa . ) General Howe  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses to sofa . ) Yes , Mrs. Murray ? MARY MURRAY I  --  I 'm afraid that I 'm being painfully indiscreet GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses to her . ) Then  --  by all means  --  get on with it . p. 57 MARY MURRAY My husband said , only today , that he suspects you do not have your heart in this war . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder your husband is such a success in the world of trade . He is very perceptive . MARY MURRAY You do not think this is a good war ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE My dear lady  --  no war is a good war  --  because no war is necessary . This one , especially , is tragic folly . However  --  I am here  --  I hold the responsibility  --  and I shall fight as hard , and as bitterly , and as brutally as I know how . MARY MURRAY And as triumphantly . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses to sofa , sits . ) No overconfidence , please . The gods will determine the final outcome . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses , sits on desk stool . ) It is obvious now that you can not fail to win complete and glorious victory . You will be pelted with flowers by cheering throngs in the streets of London . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I rather suspect that all I shall be pelted with is derision  --  that is , if anyone bothers to inform my countrymen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men armed with nothing but valor , and fed with rations consisting of little but faith in the highly untenable doctrine that all men are created equal . ( He looks at her and rises . ) If I 'm to believe Ben Franklin  --  which I do  --  then I take it that the leaders of this Revolution are gentlemen of scholarship and substance . Do they really believe that all men are created equal ? p. 58 MARY MURRAY I do n't know the gentlemen in question . They do n't come to this house  --  Mr. Murray wishes to have no truck with them , nor their radical ideas . But their convictions must be real , however misguided . Otherwise , they would hardly have pledged their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses L. ) Your husband is actively antagonistic toward these exalted principles ? MARY MURRAY ( Seated on desk stool . ) Of course he is ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Smiles . ) And where do you stand , Mrs. Murray ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather large question ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses R. to her . ) It is . But I  --  I have been eager to meet an American  --  not a politician  --  who can explain these larger things to me . MARY MURRAY What things , General Howe ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses L. to U. L. of sofa . ) Oh  --  all this addiction to these nebulous concepts of liberty  --  and independence  --  and the rights of man . Granted that our people have treated your people abominably ; stupidly  --  is it worth it to endure starvation , hardship , leading to violent death  --  to redress wrongs which time itself could remedy ? p. 59 MARY MURRAY ( Smiles . ) I judge that you have led a sheltered life , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Me ? MARY MURRAY Yes  --  on the upper echelons . You have n't had much chance to learn how men , as opposed to soldiers , may think and act . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses to her . ) Do you suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MURRAY Yes ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Good God , what an insult ! ( He laughs . ) Do you think I might ever stop being a general ? MARY MURRAY Oh  --  I most ardently hope so . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Why do you hope so ? MARY MURRAY Because I should like to see you in the character of yourself , with a remarkable sense of appreciation  --  I should love to see you at case , relaxed  --  amused and amusing  --  with no thought of battles , no thought of directives from Downing Street , no thought of Hessians on your mind . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses to L. end of sofa . ) That is a provocative suggestion , I freely admit . But it is inopportune . I am a condemned soldier . ( He looks at her . ) I can contemplate , at a distance , the infinite , exquisite surcease that grace and beauty can bring . But when I try to grope my way toward that transcendent objective , the dream turns into a nightmare , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Attack ! Attack ! " p. 60 MARY MURRAY I 'm sorry , General , I can not help you to better understanding of these heavy matters . I am simply not competent . If I had my choice , I 'd never have a thought that was above the trivial  --  never an experience that was other than sublimely frivolous . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Picks up Voltaire . ) And yet you read " Voltaire " ? MARY MURRAY ( Smiles . ) For the spice  --  not the philosophy . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Joins the smile . ) It is my impression , on slight acquaintance , that you have absorbed quite a bit of both . ( Crosses to her . ) I hope I shall get to know you better , Mrs. Murray . But  --  at the moment , I am not able to appreciate this rare opportunity for entertainment . I am not at ease . ( He sits down wearily on sofa . ) I feel tired , and dirty  --  and disgusted with this whole discreditable business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are tired . May I make a suggestion , sir ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Anything ! If it 's another of those stone fences , I 'd be delighted . MARY MURRAY Oh  --  forgive me . ( She goes above sofa and refills his glass from the pitcher . ) It occurred to me that you need not wait until Philadelphia for a steaming hot bath . I can provide you one now  --  with toilet water , although not from Marie Antoinette  --  and , I 'm sorry to say , no doxies . ( She goes to the bell cord and pulls it briskly . A bell is heard tinkling sweetly off-stage. ) p. 61 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Smiles . ) Mrs. Murray  --  are you trying to lead me down the garden path into the illusion of that unattainable dream ? Gentle and considerate as you are , you can not drown out those guttural voices . MARY MURRAY ( L. end of sofa . Laughs . ) I 'm merely trying to be intensely practical , as my husband would wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look out the upstairs window and see if there are any , signs of activity by Putnam 's army . If he were attempting to break out , we should hear shots and bugles , and that kind of thing , should n't we ? ( Daisy appears C. , crosses D. R. ) Daisy  --  put the washtub in the West Room and tell John to fetch up hot water at once . And Cora can bring up the towels and toilet water . And do n't delay  --  the General is in a hurry ! DAISY Yes , ma'am . ( She curtsies and goes out rapidly to cook-house . Howe laughs . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE The General is in a great hurry ! But  --  it seems that the General is trapped . MARY MURRAY Now , please , sir  --  that sounds as if I were presuming to be a bare-faced seductress . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Never mind how it sounds . ( Puts his drink on R. end table . Rises , goes to the window and calls out . ) Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a south-country soldier named Mullett , a corporal . He is framed in the window as Howe addresses him . ) If anyone inquires after me , I shall be upstairs , having a bath . p. 62 CORPORAL MULLETT Very good , General , sir . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses U. C. ) If you will allow me to show you to your room ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( R. end of sofa . ) I shall allow you , my dear fair hostess , fully conscious of the fact that I may be making a grave mistake . ( He looks at Mary , picks up his glass and offers it in a toast which she acknowledges with a nod and exits U. C. going off L. Howe finishes his drink and follows her . Mullet has been watching . As Howe exits , Mullett runs D. C. and motions to Galway who is D. L. As they meet C. , Mullett whispers into Galway 's ear and they both look up at the upstairs window . At this point Daisy leads off the procession between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornate wash tub , John has two kettles of steaming water , the Boy carries a sponge , a large bar of soap , and a back brush , Amelie has a pile of towels , and Cora carries a tray of perfumes and scents . Meanwhile , Galway has passed the word to the Sentry U. L. , who has crossed behind the house and told the Orderly U. R. He runs D. C. and tries to give the news to Mullett who pushes him away . Mullett and Galway are watching the upstairs window as Mary appears and draws the curtains . Galway starts rubbing Mullett 's back for a moment until Galway pushes him away and they return to their posts. ) @x It is late afternoon . The sun-rays are slanting from the window L. Mary is at her desk going over the menu book with Amelie who is behind the sofa table arranging fruit and flowers in three large bowls . The Sentry and the Orderly stand guard D. R. and D. L. Mrs. Jorpen , Abigail Jorpen , and a Girl appear U. R. from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . The Sentry speaks to them and examines their parcels , Abigail tries to linger and flirt but Mrs. Jorpen hurries her across and they all exit into the cook-house . MARY MURRAY Steamer clams ! Is that all we can get from the fishmonger ? AMELIE That is all . No oysters , no mackerel , no sturgeon . The British Navy she will not permit fishmen to fish . But he get steamers from Turtle Bay and he gone send me one whole barrel . MARY MURRAY I do n't believe these Englishmen will like them . They wo n't even know how to eat them . ( Samuel Judah enters R. and is stopped by Sentry . ) AMELIE Oh  --  I make sure about that . I talk to the Sergeant . MARY MURRAY That was very diplomatic of you , Amelie. p. 64 AMELIE ( Puts bowl of fruit on R. end table . ) I ask him if Monsieur le General know the steamed clam . The Sergeant say oh , yes , the General know the steamed clam . He can eat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. and exits to garden . ) MARY MURRAY I hope the Sergeant is right . We 'll have a fragile Moselle with the clams . ( She looks at the menu . ) Roman pie  --  steak and kidney pudding  --  pheasant  --  casserole of venison  --  but be sure to use a claret in the sauce , not a Burgundy . AMELIE I am doing the cooking , Madame . MARY MURRAY Yes  --  you are doing the cooking , Amelie  --  thank heaven . Is the Hewbley boy here yet ? AMELIE ( Puts bowl on L. end table . ) Yes . And Mrs. Torpen and that little cocotte daughter , they will be here to help . MARY MURRAY Keep the daughter in the kitchen , out of touch of those sentries . ( The Sentry , Frederick and Susan enter D. L. and cross to Judah . Susan vouches for him and he goes to front door and knocks . Susan and Frederick exit U. R. The Sentry resumes his guard duty . She looks again at the menu . ) Salad  --  lemon souffl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the savoury ? ( Daisy appears from L. in the hallway and crosses R. to front door. ) p. 65 AMELIE ( Above sofa table . ) I have not yet decide . MARY MURRAY The English like their savouries very salty , to induce further thirst  --  gizzards wrapped in anchovies  --  or something equally loathsome . ( Daisy enters C. and crosses to Mary . ) What is it , Daisy ? DAISY Mr. Judah is here , ma'am . MARY MURRAY Show him in . ( Daisy curtsies and exits C. Mary rises , crosses U. C. and bands the menu back to Amelie . ) I 'll leave it all to you , Amelie  --  as always . But , you understand , I like to go through the ritual of keeping house . ( Samuel Judah comes in C. He is a thin , elderly , scholarly looking , plainly dressed gentleman . ) AMELIE ( Faint smile . ) Yes , Madame . I understand . SAMUEL JUDAH ( U. C. ) Good afternoon , Amelie . AMELIE ( L. C. ) Bon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. and L. to cook house . ) SAMUEL JUDAH I know that I should not covet my neighbor 's house , Mary , nor even my neighbor 's wife  --  but I am frank to say that I do covet my neighbor 's cook  --  and if anything dreadful should happen to you and Robert , I merely beg that you will remember me in your will , and leave me Amelie. p. 66 MARY MURRAY I shall do that , dear Samuel . Do sit down . Did you come to see Robert ? ( She sits on desk stool . ) SAMUEL JUDAH I hoped to find him , but Daisy tells me he has left for Staten Island . ( He sits on sofa . ) It 's most unfortunate . I wanted to buy something from him . ( He looks at her . ) The contents of those two ships that are arriving from Portsmouth . Cannon , muskets , gunpowder  --  ( Mary rises and closes R. window. ) supplies of all kinds , of utmost military value . I hoped that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Closes C. doors . ) And with what purpose in view ? SAMUEL JUDAH To convey those cargoes to General Washington rather than to our enemies . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses D. L. to sofa . ) Are you aware that General Howe is in this house at this moment ? ( Offers fruit to him . He takes apple and she gives him plate , napkin and fruit-knife from sofa table . ) SAMUEL JUDAH ( Peeling apple . ) Oh , yes  --  I am fully aware of that distressing circumstance . The house is surrounded by a cordon of red-coated sentries . p. 67 MARY MURRAY One of them might have shot you . SAMUEL JUDAH That would have been disconcerting . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses R. below sofa . ) Did you think there was a chance that you might have persuaded him to bargain with you for the contents of those ships ? SAMUEL JUDAH Your husband is a good man of business . He as a merchant and I as a banker have had many dealings with one another , mutually profitable , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonistic to a reasonable offer . MARY MURRAY ( R. end of sofa . ) And if you had bought these cargoes from him , would you have sold them to General Washington for a profit ? SAMUEL JUDAH ( He puts napkin and plate on L. end table and eats apple . Smiles . ) I should have dumped them into the Hudson River , if only to keep them from aiding our enemies . But if I could have delivered them to General Washington , and sold them , I and my associates would have had to pay the bill for them ourselves , for nobody else here in New York is now financing the Continental Army . MARY MURRAY Why ? SAMUEL JUDAH Do you mean why is nobody else ? p. 68 MARY MURRAY No . I mean , why are you doing it ? SAMUEL JUDAH ( Smiles . ) I should have known I could count on you to ask a direct question . ( Abigail enters from cook-house , sits on bench D. L. and peels pan of potatoes . Orderly crosses to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk stool . ) Well , I have asked it , and I should be grateful for an answer . SAMUEL JUDAH ( Rises , crosses D. L. ) I 'm afraid the answer must be rather sordid . I 'm gambling on the future . And so is your husband . I know he has been supporting the British cause , because he sincerely believes it is good , sound business to do so , ( Crosses U. R. around sofa . ) And please do n't think that I am indulging in any sneering when I say that . I am sure that , in his present partisanship , he is honestly impelled by the conviction that the economic interests of these American colonies will be best served if they remain within the British Empire . It is on that point that I , another businessman , disagree with him . ( Crosses D. R. to her . ) And I am not talking on idealistic or altruistic grounds like Tom Jefferson , believe me. p. 69 MARY MURRAY ( Rises , crosses to R. window . Smiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SAMUEL JUDAH ( Crosses to her . ) Why , Mary ! You should know that I am a conspicuously artless person , most of the time . Look ! You can see my heart worn here on my sleeve . ( Crosses L. below sofa , puts knife on plate . ) MARY MURRAY ( At R. window . ) Samuel  --  is there any hope for George Washington and the Continental Army ? SAMUEL JUDAH ( Turns to her . ) Of course there is hope  --  if the forces opposed to him are not too resolute and swift in decision . MARY MURRAY And if they are lacking in supplies to execute their design . SAMUEL JUDAH Mary  --  you 've become a soldier MARY MURRAY ( Crosses D. L. to D. L. stool . ) Samuel , if you had an opportunity to set fire to those ships SAMUEL JUDAH ( He looks R. toward window . ) That is a possible thought a bit beyond commerce It can not surprise you , Mary , that the lamentable aspects of commerce and the business of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , She sits on D. L. stool . ) It seems to me that if you dig into the roots of all the wars  --  or at least , most of them  --  that have afflicted mankind , all of your channels of research will lead you back to one word : greed . Even the sacred Crusades . The Saracens and the Mauretanians and the Turks had treasures , they had military and industrial secrets imported from the mysterious Orient  --  and the Crusaders were much more interested in gaining possession of these commercial assets than in any remnants of the true Cross , or in occupation of the holy shrines in Jerusalem . Thus , when I devote such fortune as I possess to the support of Washington 's Army , I am not primarily concerned with the promotion of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness  --  admirable and desirable as those objectives may be . I am looking forward to a country which , if it can go ahead on its own  --  its own momentum  --  could prosper to a fabulous extent , an unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a refuge , a haven , and  --  sanctuary ! ( Frederick has entered U. R. of house carrying a rose . He crosses D. to steps . As be goes up on porch Mary sees him through R. window , and interrupts Judah . She crosses and opens doors C. Judah rises and crosses U. L. ) Even  --  I seem to have delivered an oration to the Continental Congress . And now I must n't interfere any further with your manifold duties as hostess to the Supreme Commander . I know that you MARY . ( In a sharp undertone . ) Be careful . I want to thank you , my dear Samuel , for honoring my overdraft . I know no other banker who would be so long suffering with my unpardonable negligence . And I shall thank you again not to tell my husband about it . ( Frederick comes in C. doors. ) p. 70 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Oh  --  I beg your pardon . MARY MURRAY Come in , Lord Frederick . This is my old friend , Mr. Samuel Judah  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mary . ( to Frederick . ) My compliments , sir . ( He goes out C. through front door and off R. ) MARY MURRAY Ah , Lord Frederick , I see you 've been back to the garden ! LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Puts hat and sword on U. L. chair . ) Oh , I did ! Those moss roses  --  they made me feel rather homesick . That might sound a bit tactless  --  but you know I meant it well . MARY MURRAY ( Sits on sofa . ) Of course you did . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses , sits in D. L. armchair . ) My old lady  --  that 's my mother  --  rather prides herself on her moss roses  --   --  ( Clove has entered D. L. from garden . He goes around to front door and now bursts into room . ) MAJOR CLOVE Excuse me , Mrs. Murray . ( Crosses to Frederick who rises and puts rose behind his back . ) Is the General available as yet ? p. 71 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all ! Again I beg your pardon , ma'am . But that offensive aide of von Donop 's keeps hammering at me with his Hessian insistence demanding the orders to attack  --  asking in the most insolent terms when a General staff conference will be held . What can I tell him ? And even General Clinton , now that he is assured of supplies , is growing impatient , and I 'm dashed if I blame him . Can I tell any of them that General Howe has had a hot bath , an excellent luncheon and is now enjoying a nap ? Can I explain that the war has paused for a ruddy siesta ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I should n't if I were you . ( Gestures with the rose which he quickly puts behind his back again . ) Tell them he 's working on a master plan of grand strategy . ( Susan comes in with a tray on which are a bottle of Madeira and some glasses , which she puts on sofa table . ) MAJOR CLOVE Oh , do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work . ( To Mary . ) Forgive me , ma'am , but the situation is growing ugly . ( He exits out front door and L. to garden . Abigail has finished potatoes and exits to cook-house. ) p. 72 MARY MURRAY ( Rises , crosses U. R. ) If only I could invite all of those Generals to dinner . But there simply is n't enough . ( She looks at the tray . ) Do n't tell me it 's General Howe 's Madeira ? SUSAN LINDLEY ( Crosses to desk and sits . ) Yes . I told Daisy I 'd bring is in . Amelie has her dressing the Roman pie . MARY MURRAY ( Inspecting the Madeira . ) My husband will scold me for accepting such a handsome gift . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crossing R. , looking at Susan . ) It 's some that the old man , Lord Howe , laid down in 1738 . Not bad . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses D. L. ) Why  --  that 's awfully kind of the General . When he comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Startled . ) Dinner ? MARY MURRAY ( Crosses U. C. to door . ) Why not ? The General has to dine somewhere , does n't he ? Do you happen to know if it 's true that he likes steamed clams ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I really could n't say , Mrs. Murray  --  never having heard of such objects . p. 73 MARY MURRAY ( Starts out C. ) Well , it 's too late now in any case . I must go to the cellar to see about some fragile Moselle . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses U. R. to her . ) Are we staying for dinner ? MARY MURRAY Of course . ( She goes out C. and L. to cook-house . Frederick and Susan look at each other . She turns from him and sits stiffly . Until the end of the scene a steady flow of servants and children carry food from the cook-house , each making several trips . Amelie , John , Cora , Mrs. Torpen , Abigail , a Boy and a Girl . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despise me , do n't you ? SUSAN LINDLEY Have I said that I do ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses L. ) Not in iambic pentameters  --  nor in letters to the editor  --  but you 've made it evident , all too . Why do you despise me ? Is it merely because I 'm an Englishman , or are there more personal reasons ? Do you realize what you 've done to me today ? SUSAN LINDLEY ( Rises , crosses U. L. to door . ) I can promise you , Lord Frederick , I have made no attempt to exert any effect on you whatsoever . ( She exits out front door . He follows and catches her D. R. near gate. ) p. 74 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM No  --  I 'll freely concede you have not tried to be ingratiating . You have walked me in the garden , because your sister asked you to . ( Sentry salutes . He returns it , still with rose in his hand . ) You 've dutifully introduced me to the horses and the dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turkeys . ( Susan crosses L. to bench , he follows . ) Many 's the similar stroll that I have taken with many 's the young lady  --  and we have exchanged the usual pleasantries as we scratched the ears of a sheep dog . And I have not been churned up by this feminine contact  --  or , perhaps , I 'd better say , this proximity . But  --  I take the same walk with you , under conditions that are far from romantic . And what is the result ? ( Orderly salutes and Frederick shoos him U. L. ) The result is , to put it bluntly  --  I have fallen in love  --  I mean , with you . Are n't you going to offer any comment ? Do I have to carry on this conversation single-handed ? SUSAN LINDLEY ( Sits on bench . ) You are a soldier , far away from home . You have been in battles .

LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( He follows , Sentry salutes him again as he passes by , be returns it . ) Why not ! Are you afraid I might revert suddenly to Attila the Hun ? ( She has entered room and goes to D. L. stool and sits . He crosses down to her . ) Damn it all  --  you Americans talk a lot , in a rather sententious manner , about your sacred rights . Very well  --  let 's be fair about it . I have some sacred rights , too . And one of them is to fall in love with whomever , whenever , however and how deeply the old spirit moves me . You think it 's illogical ? SUSAN LINDLEY ( Rises , crosses and sits on desk stool . ) Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. doors , crosses D. and sits on D.

I came out here to America thinking that I should be called upon to subjugate some riff-raff  --  ( Rises , goes U. L. around sofa. ) the spewings of New-gate Prison . That 's what I was told  --  that the population of these colonies consisted of the dregs of our jails  --  together with some dreary Dutch and some sanctimonious and highly unattractive Puritans who derive their sexual satisfaction from the burning of witches . That 's what I was led to expect in the way of jolly company on these shores . ( Crosses D. to her . ) And I arrived here and what have I encountered ? You ! Oh dear !

My sister  --   --  ( She runs out L. to cook-house . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'm afraid I lost my  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( At fireplace . ) You can omit the apologies , my dear boy . And when I use that word " boy , " if your young ears are sensitive enough , you will detect certain undertones of envy . I should like to be caught in that posture . I am not censuring you . Far from it ! I always welcome new proof that Old England is Old England still  --  ever young  --  ever avid . ( Crosses to Frederick . ) And I am sometimes annoyed by the pretensions of our American friends . They seem to think that they invented the sexual urge . So  --  ( Puts rose in Frederick 's tunic. ) have at it , Frederick  --  and may St. George ride with you . ( Crosses L. to fireplace ) p. 77 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses L. ) I do not want you to conclude , sir , that this is any idle dalliance . Miss Lindley is as unassailably virtuous as she is beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to young British manhood , accept that as a challenge , on both counts . Ah ! There 's the Madeira . You might pour me a glass , Freddie . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Yes , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE And have one yourself . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Thank you , sir . ( He starts to pour , nervously . Howe looks at him and smiles . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE When I happened in here , inadvertently , just now  --  and found you in the act of embrace  --  ( With somewhat shaking hand , Frederick gives the glass to Howe. ) the young lady did not appear to be struggling . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses D. R. with drink . ) Perhaps not , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You have your unfortunate points , Freddie  --  like most Beckenhams  --  mostly in the area to the north of the eyebrows . But  --  I should judge , speaking as an amateur in these matters , that you are not entirely repulsive to young ladies . ( Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under present circumstances , for you to keep a firm check-rein on your charm . p. 78 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I have to tell you , General Howe , that I am in love with this young lady . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE In love ? In the space of a few hours ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I believe it has happened before , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Raises glass in toast . ) I drink to your continued good health and survival . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Thank you very much , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses to sofa . ) Are the horses ready ? ( Hewbley boy crosses out of cook-house and sits eating apple . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( R. end of sofa . ) No doubt , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You have n't inspected to make sure ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM No , sir . I had n't thought there was any great rush . In fact , there was some talk of staying for dinner . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BECKENHAM From Mrs. Murray . p. 79 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Ah ! ( Sits on sofa . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM She seems to expect us . As she expressed it  --  " The General has to dine somewhere  --  why not here ? " It seemed to me she had a point there . ( Howe is amused . Frederick crosses U. behind sofa and pours himself another drink . ) Great preparations are afoot in the cook-house . As I passed it , recently , I could not overlook the delicate scent of steak and kidney pudding . And Mrs. Murray asked me for your views on the subject of something called steamed clams . I was unable to enlighten her GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Steamed clams ! They 're the American caviare  --   --  ( At this moment the Hessian , von Donop and Clove , who have entered U. L. , pass the L. window on their way around the house . The Hewbley boy rises and falls behind them , imitating their goose-step . Clove chases him away and he exits to cook-house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks out L. window . ) General von Donop , I 'm afraid , sir . I 'll let them in . ( He goes quickly out C. and to front door . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Good God ! ( He finishes his drink , rises and goes to the sofa table to pour another . The procession enters the front door . The Hessian enters stamping and clicking his heels. ) p. 80 HESSIAN General Graf von Donop ! ( Von Donop enters U. C. and crosses D. L. below the sofa , clicks his heels , Hessian echoes . Clove and Frederick enter and cross D. R. of sofa . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE A spot of Madeira , General ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Yes  --  I will ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Pours glass . ) Good man ! You 've obviously relaxed since I saw you last . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I have not relaxed . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses around sofa , gives glass to von Donop . ) Then the Madeira is quite in order . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass , clicks his heels , and takes a tremendous gulp . He puts his glass down emphatically on sofa table . ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP And now , Sir William , if we may descend to vulgar matters of urgent business ( He looks toward the door . ) Can we be overheard ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE There is no one here interested in eavesdropping . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( To the Hessian . ) Mach die tur zu und steh wache ! ( Close that door and remain on guard ! ) p. 81 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Thinking von Donop is talking to him . ) I beg your pardon , sir ? ( Crosses to fireplace . The Hessian closes the door , remaining outside in the hall . Howe is plainly annoyed by this . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses , sits on desk stool . ) Now that we are secure , von Donop , will you be kind enough to descend quickly to those vulgar matters ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP With pleasure ! We have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped us ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP No , but  --   --  ( Amelie enters from cook-house and looks in L. window , listening . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You do n't need the " but . " No is a sufficient answer . Are there any evidences whatsoever that he is about to move his army ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP None that your sentries have observed . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE There are Hessian sentries also on post , are there not ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I have seen to that . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE And they have sharp eyes , and many of them possess spyglasses . The weather is clear , the visibility excellent . Hardly a platoon could have crawled across those fields to the northwest of us without being observed . p. 82 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Below sofa . ) But there are thick forests beyond those fields , and thicker forests over by the river Hudson . And there is not much more time of the sunlight . When it is dark night , our men could be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits U. L. to house . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE It will be just as dark for them as for us . ( Rises , crosses to sofa . ) A few minutes ago I looked out through an upstairs window and did some observing on my own . I counted perhaps a hundred campfires in the sparsely wooded region held by Putnam . They appear to be cooking supper and settling down where they are for the night as best they may . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Then now is the time for attack . Or does your family feeling for these Yankees make you hesitate to spill any more of their precious Anglo-Saxon blood ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Sits on R. end of sofa . Controlling his exasperation . ) What are your views , Clove ? MAJOR CLOVE ( Crosses D. R. ) You will recall , sir , that I have expressed my resentment of General von Donop 's tendencies toward insubordination. p. 83 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP What is that ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Please continue , Major Clove  --  state your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me , sir , that it was the General 's duty to speak out his mind if he felt that mistakes are being made . Presumably , my duty is the same . I have to say that I agree with him  --  that we should attack now , in full force , before the darkness sets in . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Sits on L. end of sofa . ) There you are , General Sir William ! I do not know this Major , but he speaks as a sound tactician . Your province is properly grand strategy , planning the campaigns of the future . But we are now on the field of battle  --  and tactics are the province of the man who fights . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Tactics be damned ! ( Rises , crosses R. above sofa . ) May this whole bloody war be damned and blasted to hell ! I can not become unduly exercised about General Putnam . We had an opportunity to appraise him on that hill near Boston . We again took his measure at the Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , as we landed on this island , his despairing men fled in panic . We suffered not a casualty . Putnam is a brave man , but limited  --  ( Crosses D. R. to Clove. ) he 's an indecisive fritterer who would never have the imagination to venture his army into the forests in the dark . What are you staring at me like that for , Clove ? Do you suspect I have taken leave of my senses ? I can reassure you that all of my faculties are adequately deployed . ( Crosses L. below sofa . ) I am not worried about General Israel Putnam . But I am concerned about something of considerably greater importance . Destiny ! Do you know what that is ? " Hanging and wiving goes by Destiny . " And so do wars and revolutions and the realization of peace on earth . ( Crosses R. to R. end of sofa . ) Destiny is the will of God , and you and I are the children of God , and therefore obedient to that will . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is decreed from on High that we must engage Putnam 's forces at seven o'clock on the evening of September the fifteenth , in the year of Grace , 1776  --  and that if we do not enter upon this skirmish , we shall be defeated by Washington 's meager , disrupted little army  --  and the British Empire will have to struggle along into the future without the thirteen American colonies to pay tribute to her  --  to give her aid and sustenance in time of peril ? Can you give me that guarantee , General  --  on behalf of Destiny  --  can you speak as the accredited representative of Divine Providence ? p. 84 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Scornful . ) I can say that I well understand the English language  --  but I have no notion of what you are trying to talk about . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE That is precisely why I expressed myself in those terms . I realize , von Donop , that I am a poor vessel  --  possibly a leaky one . But I have been placed here to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Majesty King George the Third  --  the same Sovereign who hired you . ( Crosses D. R. ) If my decisions are wrong then I shall be replaced , disgraced , consigned to the Tower to carve my initials alongside those of the Earl of Essex , and other conspicuous failures who have contributed so much of lively interest to our island 's history . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP General Howe  --  I may not be able to bring accusations against you of cowardice  --  but I can and I will bring accusations of ( There is a knocking at the U. C. doors . The Hessian officer enters hastily . ) HESSIAN Entschuldigen Herr General , eine Dame wnscht Heron General Howe Zuaprechen . ( Mr. General  --  excuse me , there is a lady who wants to talk to General Howe. ) p. 85 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Rises , crosses D. L. ) Zum donnerwetter nicht nochmal ! Ich hab'dir dummen Essel doch gesagt aufzupassen das wir nicht gestort werden ! ( Goddammit ! Did n't I tell you stupid donkey to take care that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing doors . ) Jawohl , Herr General ! ( Yes , indeed , Herr General ! ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( To Frederick . ) See what that is , Lieutenant . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Yes , sir . ( Frederick goes up to the doors and exits . Howe turns to Donop . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Sits on sofa . ) Of course you are quite free to make such accusations as you please to your employer , and I shall instruct Major Clove that he is absolved of all obligations of loyalty to me in bearing witness to the accuracy of your report . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Enters U. C. ) It 's Mrs. Murray , sir . She would like a word with you . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Rises , crosses D. R. ) She may have a word with me. p. 86 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Pray come in , ma'am  --   --  ( Mary comes in U. C. , a defiant flash in her eyes . Frederick closes the doors behind her and crosses to fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , General Howe , but when my husband told me that he had invited you here , I thought you were to be my guests . I had not expected that this house would be used for conferences in which gentlemen raised their voices . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Do you allow this American woman to interrupt ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Yes , I do ! ( Crosses U. C. to her . To Mary . ) Go on , Mrs. Murray . MARY MURRAY If this house has been requisitioned by the military , perhaps you had better tell me so  --  and my sister and I shall go elsewhere . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Privately amused . ) There is no thought of that , I assure you . MARY MURRAY Then I must ask you to continue these talks outside this house . You will find ample room in the stables . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE The conference is ended . p. 87 MARY MURRAY In that case , I beg to advise you that dinner is ready . ( Howe opens doors and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are staying for dinner ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses D. R. to sofa . ) Why not ? As Mrs. Murray her-self has put it , one must dine somewhere . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Then you will accord to Putnam the cover of darkness ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE For all the good it may do him  --  yes . Good evening , General von Donop . ( Donop looks at him and shakes his head in utter bewilderment . ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( Facing Howe . ) When they sent me here , to America , they told me I have the privilege of serving with a brilliant soldier  --  the youngest Major General in the English Army . On Long Island , when you executed that enveloping movement on Washington 's left flank , I thought , I have been told correctly . Brilliant ! I even thought that Frederick der Grosse himself would applaud this . But now  --  I say I am sorry  --  and with sincerity , believe me  --  I am sorry to be witness to the end of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donop goes U. c . His Aide hands him his hat . There is much clicking of heels . Finally they both click their heels , salute , about face , click heels , and Howe clicks with them as they exit , going ' out front door and below house and exit U. L. Howe crosses to L. window and watches till they pass . He laughs as he crosses R. to sofa. ) p. 88 MAJOR CLOVE You 're serious about this , sir ? Or were you merely having him on ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I 'm not only serious  --  I am extremely hungry . ( Sits on sofa . ) And , what is more , I may decide to stay here the night . ( Clove is startled and Frederick titters at this pronouncement . ) After all , one must also sleep somewhere . The bed in the West Room is very comfortable . I tested it this afternoon and was off in a wink . MAJOR CLOVE General Howe ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Yes ? MAJOR CLOVE I am afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAJOR CLOVE That you are playing too dangerous a game , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Rises , crosses to D. R. stool . ) Nonsense , my dear Clove . Putnam is beaten . So is Washington . We can dispose of them both at our leisure . In the meantime , why not  --   --  ? MAJOR CLOVE ( Crosses D. to Howe . ) I am not thinking , sir , of the military situation . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Then what the devil are you thinking of ? p. 89 MAJOR CLOVE The lady 's husband , sir  --  Mr. Murray . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE And what about him ? MAJOR CLOVE He might come home at any time . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Oh  --  that ! The Military Manual should provide even for such a contingency . ( Crosses L. to Frederick at fireplace and gives him a knowing glance . ) We can always issue instructions to the sentries to admit nobody . Come on to dinner . ( He goes out U. C. Frederick smiles . Clove glowers at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and runs to the Sentry . He explains in pantomime that no one is to enter . He runs to Orderly D. L. and tells him same thing . As he starts back to the house the show drop comes in showing Washington 's army still on Harlem Heights , and Putnam 's army moving north on the Bloomingdale Road ( now Broadway ) . The British are concentrated around the Heights of Inklenberg and Kip 's Bay . ) CURTAIN p. 90 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT II : SCENE 2 Two or three hours later . It is now night and the candles are lit . The doors to the hall are closed . From off L. can be heard the sounds of a clavicord . As before the Sentry is posted D. R. and the Orderly D. L. John the Gardener is seated on bench D. L. whittling a piece of wood . Mary and Howe are alone . She is refilling his brandy glass from a long-necked decanter . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Seated D. L. armchair with his feet on the D. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brandy is superb . Quite the best I 've tasted since we captured the stores of General Montcalm at Quebec . MARY MURRAY ( Returns decanter to sofa table . ) I shall tell my husband you approve . He always says that the ultimate measurement of a gentleman is in his cellar . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Your husband must be overburdened with causes for pride . ( Mary glances at him , sees that he is staring hard at her . She sits down on the sofa . He listens to the music . ) What is that ? MARY MURRAY Susan , in the music room  --  playing the clavichord for Lord Frederick . p. 91 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE He 's in the music room , is he ? The young nincompoop ought to be outside , on post , ready to advise me of every report that comes in from the sentries . ( He starts to rise . ) MARY MURRAY ( Laughs . ) Let him have his moment , Sir William . If the sentries have anything of the slightest interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Relaxing in his chair . ) Do you think he 's wise to fall in love with your sister ? MARY MURRAY That engaging young man will fall in love with every girl he happens to encounter  --  until he settles down with some second-best choice . And then he will resume the process . You need n't worry about my sister , Sir William . Tomorrow you will defeat General Washington , and then you will cross the Palisades and march to Philadelphia where , I hear , there are also girls . Lord Frederick will play them all , like so many trout . And you  --  I do n't doubt that you will be amply entertained in Philadelphia by your disreputable friend , Dr. Franklin , and his doxies . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Smiles . ) You call that distinguished philosopher disreputable ? p. 92 MARY MURRAY Mr. Murray considers him a typical decadent as well as subversive . A representative " Intellectual . " GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE All husbands of beautiful women disapprove of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after my brief visit at your house , I am not so much interested in further exploration of this country . I 'd prefer to remain right here . MARY MURRAY ( Rises , crosses R. ) There 's no reason why you should n't . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE That , I am afraid , is a most hospitable mis-statement . ( He listens to the music . ) Damn it all , I must tell Freddie to alert himself for a change . ( Starts to rise again . Mary hurries to the bell cord and pulls it . ) MARY MURRAY Do n't bother . Daisy will fetch him , ( She crosses D. R. ) Are you really so concerned about the poor , feeble Continental Army ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE In my unfortunate position , I must be concerned with the wildest improbabilities . At that engagement near Boston  --  Bunker Hill , it was called  --  Gage was in command of our forces . We overcame Putnam and drove him from the hill . I was then in the position of von Donop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit ( Daisy appears U. C. ) p. 93 MARY MURRAY Tell Lord Frederick please to step in here . DAISY Yes , ma'am . ( She goes into study . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE However , I had another look at Putnam 's camp after dinner . They are still feeding the campfire . And  --  speaking of dinner  --  have I given you any adequate indication of how deeply I relished it ? ( The music stops . ) MARY MURRAY ( R. of sofa . Laughs . ) You have dwelt on it at some length . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Those steamed clams  --  that pheasant  --  the lemon souffl  --  your cook was inspired ! ( John , seated on D. L. bench , picks up his banjo and softly plays and hums the rest of the scene . Frederick appears from study . ) Damn it all , Freddie ! Why are you lolling about , listening to the clavichord ? You should be on post . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Above sofa . Bewildered . ) Where , sir ? No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ! We 're on the verge of battle , my boy . It may start at any moment . Clove is in constant contact with the outposts , and I want you to be in constant contact with Clove  --  so that you can advise me in a matter of seconds of any developments . Now  --  be off with you . p. 94 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Very good , sir . ( He puts on hat and sword from U. L. chair  --  exits front door and off R. , after reprimanding Sentry who has dozed off . Mary crosses to pick up brandy decanter . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE There you are , Mistress Mary . Did you notice the look of utter befuddlement on his honest , Etonian face when I mentioned that we 're on the verge of battle ? He had forgotten entirely there 's a war on . If we stayed here much longer , you would succeed in corrupting the entire General Staff . My aides must behave as rough , rugged soldiers , or reasonable counterfeits thereof  --  and soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest levels . MARY MURRAY ( Refilling his brandy glass . ) You permit your men and yourself no leisure ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Oh  --  in the intervals between wars  --  we can all do a bit of huntin '  --  shootin '  --  fishin ' . I myself mess about occasionally in politics , if only to find out how the other half lives . MARY MURRAY ( Returns decanter to sofa table . Laughs . ) Do you ever read French novels , General ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Seated in D. L. armchair . ) Oh , I suppose I did as a boy . These days , I read nothing but orders from Whitehall . Not much spice in them , I can promise you . But now that the war is slackening up , I think a French novel might be the very ticket for a bit of relaxation . Have you anything particularly naughty to recommend ? p. 95 MARY MURRAY ( Crosses to sofa and sits . ) There 's one by Marivaux I 've read lately . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM HOWE What 's it about ? MARY MURRAY Well  --  I suppose you would say  --  it 's about the metaphysics of love-making . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I 'm sure I should say no such thing . I had never been advised that there are metaphysics in that agreeable exercise . MARY MURRAY The point is  --  the characters tell not only what they are thinking about love , but what they secretly wish they were thinking . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE It sounds rather difficult . But I should like to read this book . MARY MURRAY ( Smiles . ) May I be permitted to present it to you ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Rises , crosses to her . ) I shall carry it in my kit as if you had tossed me your garter from the battlements . MARY MURRAY ( Rises , crosses L. to desk . ) Really , Sir William ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Yes , really , Mary Murray ! p. 96 MARY MURRAY Is n't our little chat bordering on the indiscreet ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the cardinal sin is indiscretion ? ( Howe looks at her for a moment , closely . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I seldom burden myself with such discouraging thoughts . Do you mean that it is n't so much what you do that matters , so much as what you say about it ? MARY MURRAY ( Crosses to R. window . ) You 're a very perceptive man , General . That 's precisely what I mean . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses to her . ) In that case , Mistress Mary  --   --  ( They are standing close together and seem about to kiss  --  the U. C. doors open and Frederick bounds into the room . Mary and Howe spring apart as Frederick rushes out , then returns and salutes , covered with confusion , Howe , sharply . ) What is it ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Still in saluting position . ) Forgive me , Major Clove , I bear an urgent message from General Howe , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE What ? ! p. 97 LIEUTENANT LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other way about , sir . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Get out . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Yes , sir . ( He goes out U. C. Howe watches him , then turns to Mary with a slight bow . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Forgive me . ( He follows Frederick out and calls to him from the portico . ) Freddie ! ( Frederick stops at R. gate . Howe approaches him . ) Carry on , Lieutenant ! LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM General von Donop requests permission to order a reconnaissance in depth . ( Mary is at the R. window listening carefully . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Is that all ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM No , sir . General Clinton begs you to reconsider your decision against a general staff conference at once . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Inform both Generals that the Commander-in-Chief has taken their requests under advisement . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Yes , sir . ( He starts off , but returns. )  --  and , sir , about the  --  about my  --  ( He indicates the room. ) may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You may not ! LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Saluting . ) Thank you , sir . ( He goes . Howe returns to the room . Mary has crossed to fireplace . ) MARY MURRAY Is all well ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Who knows ? Who can ever know ? MARY MURRAY What a burden you carry . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Above sofa . ) My staff is impatient . But I can not blame them entirely . We are all overwrought these days . If only decision were as easily achieved as its wayward brother , indecision . ( Closes C. doors . ) MARY MURRAY ( Crosses below sofa to R. window . ) What you say is quite true , Sir William , we are overwrought these days . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Even you , Mistress Mary ? MARY MURRAY Especially me . Too much awareness has been imposed upon me too suddenly . You , General , have opened my eyes . ( She closes shutters on R. window . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the war is all tragic folly , but that you must fight it as hard and as bitterly and as brutally as you know how . ( He looks at the decanter . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE With your permission , ma'am ? MARY MURRAY Of course . ( As he refills his glass he laughs lightly . Mary looks at him . Abigail comes out of cook-house and flirts with Orderly D. L. ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Above sofa . ) It has just occurred to me that during my absence from this room it would have been entirely possible for you to have inserted a deadly poison into this brandy . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses to R. end of sofa . Shocked . ) Sir William ! Now you are romanticizing ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Why should n't you have seized the opportunity ? It 's obvious that , if you did me in , your American zealots would hail you for having struck a stalwart blow for liberty ! Which , I 'll grant , is a rather conceited thing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) You think me capable of such Florentine villainy ? p. 100 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Amiably . ) Quite capable ! ( He raises his glass to her , then takes a copious drink , be is watching him , questioningly , Abigail crosses behind house and flirts with Sentry D. R. At fires-place . ) In fact , I have the dark suspicion that there has been deadly poison in all the good things with which you have plied me this day . ( He has another sip of wine . ) MARY MURRAY Are you suffering , internally ? ( She is still wondering , nervously , what he is getting at . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Oh , yes  --  ( He looks into the wine . ) You know , Mary , I 've always found that a good meal stimulates the narcotic juices that lull one into a reflective mood  --  as opposed to the more aggravating acids that impel one to immoderate action . And , since dinner , I have been reflecting , deeply . I have realized , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my admired adversary , General Washington  --  or had you been devoted to his cause by your own concepts of loyalty  --  ( Crosses R. above sofa to Mary. ) you could not have done a more adroit job of delaying me and hampering the pursuit . ( After a moment , she speaks , in a rather thin voice : ) p. 101 MARY MURRAY ( Crosses , sits on sofa . ) In that case , General  --  pray do not permit me to delay you an instant longer . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Smiles . ) You want me to get on with the war ? MARY MURRAY Yes ! Denounce me as an enemy agent ! Deliver me to your firing squad ! Purge yourself of that poison before the effects become fatal ! GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses D. R. ) That dismissal seems a bit brusque . Have you forgotten that you are the perfect hostess ? ( He turns to look at her . ) Are n't you going to invite me to stay the night ? MARY MURRAY ( In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even if I request it ? Not even if I request it , humbly ? ( Crosses up above sofa to L. end of sofa . ) Mary  --  if you really want me to go now  --  if you want me to leave these premises , and take my miserable rest on some sack of straw on some windswept hilltop , then of course I have no choice in the matter . I must defer to your wishes . But  --  before I do  --  I should like to be completely sure in my own heart that that is what you really want . ( Mary , who is seated on L. end of sofa , turns and faces him . Her face is radiant. ) p. 102 MARY MURRAY And could you ever be sure that I am not seeking to deceive you , and betray you , and bring you down to disgrace as a soldier of the King ? Could you ever be sure that I am not in the employ of General Washington ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Soberly . ) No , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . ( Puts glass on sofa table . ) Nor have I any great desire to be . ( He bends toward her . ) But if it 's true that he has assigned you to this degraded task , then I can only assume that he damned well deserves to win . ( He takes her in his arms and kisses her , gently . As they kiss , the Sentry and Abigail follow suit . The Show Drop indicates the British in the same position . Putnam 's forces are joining Washington on Harlem Heights . ) CURTAIN p. 103 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT II : SCENE 3 It is hours later but still night . Dawn is about to break and will continue until , by the end of the scene , it is broad daylight . The guards are the same . U.

They 'll not soon be put out . CORPORAL MULLETT Any sign of anybody here waking up ? SERGEANT GALWAY NO . CORPORAL MULLETT ( Sits in D. L. armchair with glass in hand and feet on stool . ) Where 's Clove ? SERGEANT GALWAY Asleep on the floor in the music room . p. 104 CORPORAL MULLETT Too good for him . And Lord Frederick ? SERGEANT GALWAY Outside  --  on post . ( Crosses D. L. to Mullett . ) He has orders if Mr. Murray returns , he 's to detain him for routine questioning , at the same time passing the word along to me , and I 'm to make a rumpus upstairs . CORPORAL MULLETT Ah ! I see ! So that the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double ? SERGEANT GALWAY Are n't we getting a bit beyond ourselves , Corporal ? And did anybody tell you you could sit down in Mrs. Murray 's drawing room ? CORPORAL MULLETT I did n't hear nobody forbid me , neither . SERGEANT GALWAY On your feet , you impudent bumpkin ! If Major Clove came in here and caught you dirtying up the Chippendale , he 'd CORPORAL MULLETT ( Rising . ) I know the bastard . ( He takes out a clay pipe and tobacco box and crosses R. C. ) So the General does n't want Mr. Murray to come in too sudden-like . ( He snickers . ) So that 's the way the wind blows and the sheets rustle . SERGEANT GALWAY Stow that pipe , Corporal . And stow that talk about the General . p. 105 CORPORAL MULLETT ( Putting the pipe back in his pocket . ) It 's no concern of mine if he 's upstairs having a do in the feathers . ( He gestures upward with his thumb . Galway has returned to the window R. to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city looks to be growing worse . Seems to be explosions . CORPORAL MULLETT ( Crosses to Galway . ) It would n't bother me if the whole place went up in flames . New York City ! They call it a city  --  these bloody colonials . ( Susan enters C. with a tray on which two cups of hot coffee are already poured . ) SUSAN LINDLEY I 've brought you gentlemen some coffee . SERGEANT GALWAY Why , ma'am  --  that is most remarkably kind of you . ( Susan goes to each of them and offers a cup . ) SUSAN LINDLEY I hope you gentlemen caught a bit of sleep . SERGEANT GALWAY Thank you , miss  --  but we did n't . CORPORAL MULLETT On duty , you know . SUSAN LINDLEY It 's a nasty business , is n't it  --  all this trouble  --  and going without your sleep , and killing people ? p. 106 CORPORAL MULLETT It 's nasty , Miss Lindley  --  and , what 's worse , it 's tiresome . SUSAN LINDLEY I 'm sure  --  well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home and then we 'll all be happy . ( She smiles prettily and goes out C. ) CORPORAL MULLETT That 's a very appealing piece of goods , that young Miss Lindley . If I were only a bit higher in rank SERGEANT GALWAY Well , Corporal  --  you are not a bit higher rank  --  and , if I have anything to say about it , you never will be . ( Samuel Judah enters R. and is stopped by Sentry . ) CORPORAL MULLETT ( Laughs . ) You may live to regret that remark , Sergeant . ( Galway goes back to the R. window and looks out . ) SERGEANT GALWAY What do you suppose  --  there 's a man out there with Lord Frederick  --  CORPORAL MULLETT Mr. Murray ? SERGEANT GALWAY Go to the door ! I 've got to make a rumpus ! ( Mullett hurries out . Galway hastily gulps the rest of his coffee , then goes to the hall and makes as much noise as possible . Frederick comes in with Mr. Judah from front door. ) p. 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Murray that Mr. Judah is here . ( Mullett goes off C. Frederick speaks off-stage R. to Galway . ) Stay on post outside the door , Sergeant Galway . SERGEANT GALWAY Right , sir . ( goes out on front porch . ) SAMUEL JUDAH ( Crosses D. R. ) Well , Lieutenant  --  there appears to be promise of another beautiful day . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( L. of sofa . ) A bit cooler , I trust . SAMUEL JUDAH Oh , I 'm sure of it . There 's a definite September snap in the air just now . I should predict you 'll find this perfect weather for a battle . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM You think we 'll have to fight one ? SAMUEL JUDAH ( Indicates out L. window . ) Not much of one , I imagine . I note that poor Putnam 's campfires are still burning . He remains at your mercy . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM May I ask , Mr. Judah  --   --  ? SAMUEL JUDAH ( Sits on sofa . ) Do , please . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an American ? SAMUEL JUDAH I am neither  --  I am a Jewish banker  --  which makes me international , on two counts . ( He looks at Frederick 's expression and laughs . ) You are looking at me as if I had confided to you that I am a sabre-toothed carnivore . ( Mary appears , now wearing a night dress , peignoir and night cap . She seems radiant . Judah rises . ) Ah , Mary  --  I hope you 'll forgive me for appearing at this ungodly hour . MARY MURRAY There is nothing ungodly about the breaking of dawn , Samuel . ( To Frederick . ) Will you kindly excuse us , Lord Frederick ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Of course , ma'am . ( He goes out C. , tactfully closing the doors behind him . ) MARY MURRAY ( Crosses to him . Anxiously . ) What is it , Samuel ? Is the news bad ? SAMUEL JUDAH ( Crosses L. below sofa . ) Quite the reverse . I shall not burden you with details , as you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word with you before Robert returns home . MARY MURRAY You 've seen him ? p. 109 SAMUEL JUDAH ( Crosses to R. window . ) No . But there has been an unfortunate mishap down in the city  --  a rather serious conflagration at Whitehall Slip . Robert will be particularly concerned about it . ( Turns to Mary . ) And I have come to ask you please not to mention to him that I had made reference to any negotiations involving those ships , the Termagant and the Pleiades . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses D. L. ) I had forgotten that you did . There have been so many other  --  developments  --  since yesterday . ( She seems a bit distracted . ) SAMUEL JUDAH ( Ignoring any possible implications . ) Please sustain that forgetfulness . MARY MURRAY Will this mishap  --  whatever it is  --  will this reflect on General Howe ? ( There is a knock at the doors C. Frederick opens the doors and enters . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I beg your pardon , ma'am  --  but I 'm advised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to C. doors . ) Good-bye , Mary  --  and thank you . p. 110 MARY MURRAY ( Follows him . ) Use the back way , Samuel . ( Mary and Judah exit U. C. Frederick goes into the study . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Clove ! Clove ! ( Frederick re-enters and crosses to L. window and sees general von Donop and Hessian have just passed the window  --  they have entered from U. L. Frederick runs to the R. window and sees them coming up the porch steps . He goes to the front door Cordially . ) Good morning , General von Donop . ( The Hessian enters U. C. , stamping and clicking . ) HESSIAN General Graf von Don  --   --  ( He realizes that his announcement has been made in an empty room . Donop and Frederick enter U. C. Cora comes out front door and starts sweeping the porch . ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Where is General Howe ? ( Hands helmet to officer . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Upstairs in his room , sir . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him ! LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( R. C. ) I 'm afraid I have not the authority to disturb the General . p. 111 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Then I will go upstairs ! Show me his room . ( Clove comes in from study , his hair rumpled , he is buttoning his coat , Donop wheels on him . ) Have you authority to arouse General Howe ? MAJOR CLOVE ( Crosses to Frederick . ) He gave strict orders , sir , that we are not to GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP If this were Prussia , you would both be shot without further delay . MAJOR CLOVE ( Relieved . ) Here is the General , sir . ( Howe appears U. C. , looking immaculate and well rested . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses D. R. below sofa . ) Ah , von Donop , good morning . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP ( L. of sofa . ) Have you been informed of the situation ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I had a look over the terrain to the westward . GENERAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM HOWE As good a view as any . I noted that Putnam 's campfires are still burning merrily. p. 112 GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Merrily ! Indeed ! Because they are laughing at us , at you ! ( Howe looks at him sharply . ) Yes ! The outposts kept vigilant watch on Putnam 's camp through the night . No sign of anything suspicious . But with the first dawn ray , I went up on this hill with my spyglass . I did n't like what I saw  --  or , more , should I say , what I did not see . The visibility was excellent . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Blast the visibility ! Get on with it , von Donop . What did n't you see ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Not one evidence of any military personnel . Civilians  --  yes  --  but no  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE These Americans know how to take cover . They learned that from their Indian fighting . ( He sits on sofa . ) GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP Wait , please ! What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ordered reconnaissance in depth . I sent expendables to test Putnam 's defenses . There were no defenses . There was not an armed man to be seen . The campfires were being tended by old men , women and children . Putnam and his army are gone  --  they have decamped . I estimated the position with total accuracy ! ( Donop makes no attempt to disguise his gratification. ) p. 113 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE You ordered a military evolution  --  you designated certain troops as " expendable "  --  with no authority for doing so . GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I did , General Sir William . And I learned what you could not have learned in a bedroom upstairs in the mansion of an American , Mr. Murray . I doubt very seriously that you will be inclined to bring charges against me . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE I shall give that matter due consideration , General von Donop . In the meantime , you will return to your headquarters and await further orders , which will be conveyed through General Clinton . GENERAL GRAF VON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) One more piece of intelligence , General . There has been a fire at the landing called Whitehall Slip . Two ships were burned to the water-line all cargoes destroyed . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE The Termagant and the Pleiades ? GENERAL GRAF VON DONOP I believe those were the names . I shall be pleased to await your orders . ( Puts on helmet , clicks heels , salutes , Hessian echoes his movements and they exit smiling , around house L. ) MAJOR CLOVE ( Crosses to Howe . ) This is serious , sir . There 'll be questions in the House of Commons  --  there 'll be charges of gross incompetence  --  even of barratry. p. 114 LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses L. above sofa . ) What the devil is barratry ? It sounds rather  --   --  GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Never mind what it sounds like ! ( To Clove . ) Go to General Clinton . I assume he is ready to move on the moment . Tell him I shall be with him shortly . MAJOR CLOVE ( Crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWE And brush your hair . MAJOR CLOVE Yes , sir . ( He goes out to study . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE And you , Freddie  --  see to the horses  --  and orders for the guards to move . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( L. of sofa . ) Very good , sir . ( But he lingers . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Why are you hesitating ? LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Sir  --  I  --  are we leaving now , wondered , sir  --  if I might have a brief opportunity to  --  well , sir  --  p. 115 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Gently . ) I know , Freddie  --  but we have no time for purple , passionate farewells . Perhaps we can make arrangements at some later time . Report back to me when all is ready . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM Yes , sir . ( Frederick goes out C. through the front door to the gate as Mr. Murray enters R. The Sentry stops him and Frederick stalls him in conversation after signalling Galway to inform Howe . Howe rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) SERGEANT GALWAY General ! Mr. Murray is here . Lord Frederick is talking to him . Shall we admit him ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Into his own house ? Of course . And see to it that Mrs. Murray is informed . ( Galway goes out and signals to Frederick who lets Murray enter . Frederick and Galway exit R. Howe , in effect , braces himself  --  Mr. Murray comes in . He is very agitated . He crosses to Howe and they shake hands . ) Good morning , sir . I can not ever find words to express my gratitude for the hospitality shown me under your roof . ROBERT MURRAY I am terribly distressed , General Howe . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Distressed ? Why ? p. 116 ROBERT MURRAY That you might think it was my fault . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE What was ? ROBERT MURRAY Those packets . You have heard about them ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Oh , yes . They were burned , were n't they ? ROBERT MURRAY They were lashed together at the pier . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day . She looks at Howe and he at her , but Murray is too engrossed in his account of the disaster to notice her at first . Murray crosses to R. window . ) I was there to superintend the unloading . Suddenly the Termagant burst into flames  --  she was nearer the pier . The wind was in the northeast , off-shore . Soon the Pleiades was also aflame . The crews had to jump for their lives . ( Turns , sees Mary , crosses U. C. to her , gives her kiss on cheek . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE A most unfortunate accident . But there will be other ships along . ROBERT MURRAY ( Crosses to Howe at fireplace . ) It was no accident , sir . It was deliberate , willful destruction . I had the fire department summoned , in the hope that something of the cargoes might be saved . ( Crosses below sofa to R. window . ) But when they arrived , and saw that these were ships of His Majesty 's merchant fleet , they refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department  --  Americans !  --  Democrats !  --  all they did was stand and laugh at the villainous spectacle . ( Crosses C. ) I promise you , sir , that I did all that was humanly possible to p. 117 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Crosses L. to window . ) And I promise you , Mr. Murray , that the authorities in London will overlook this minor episode in their concentration upon my major delinquencies . MARY MURRAY ( Crosses D. L. ) Your delinquencies , Sir William ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( Turns to her . ) Yes . I should n't wonder that my name will be heaped with infamy in the pages of British history  --  if it appears at all . MARY MURRAY ( Greatly concerned . ) Why ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE It seems that I permitted Putnam and his army to escape . ( Pause  --  she turns slowly and crosses R. below sofa to desk . ) ROBERT MURRAY ( Above sofa . ) They got away while you were here  --  in my house ? GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could never thank you enough  --  and I can add to that  --  I shall never regret it . ( This last , of course , is intended for Mary . ) ROBERT MURRAY ( greatly disturbed . ) And what will happen now ? Surely you will be able to overpower them  --  p. 118 GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE ( To Mary . ) Oh , we shall pursue them , and engage them , vigorously . I doubt this will have any effect on the outcome of the war . But it may well raise the morale of Washington and his tired men and impel them to fight on and on for their hopeless cause , thereby prolonging the bloody nuisance . MARY MURRAY Will the blame  --  if there is blame in England  --  will it be on you ? ROBERT MURRAY ( Angrily , to Mary . ) Of course it will ! And perhaps on you and me , as well . It may even be suspected that you and I connived in the delay . ( Mary sits on desk stool . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Nonsense , my dear sir . Was I subjected to force here in your house ? No  --  I came here of my own free will , and I remained here of my own even freer will . I found here a spiritual , and intellectual , and stimulating oasis in the bleak desert of war . ( This last is said directly to Mary , Murray is plainly and uncomfortably puzzled . Howe is R. of sofa . ) Let me tell you a highly irrelevant story from my past : I was once on a fox-hunt . The chase had been going on for some time , when the hounds lost the scent and went off at a tangent . I came to a particularly high hedge . Other horsemen took it , but I thought to myself : " Why should I risk breaking one or more of my horse 's legs  --  as well as my own neck ? " I knew there was a gate at the other edge of the field , and I made for that , and through it , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was panting so painfully , running so slowly , that I could overtake him easily . I could have reached down and whacked him with my crop . I could have given the view halloo and brought the hunt into that broad field to finish off the miserable creature . But  --  as I watched him , close at hand  --  I could almost see his little heart thumping , his exhausted lungs bursting with the final agony of endurance . And I let him go , into the copse at the other end , where he could find cover . ( Crosses L. ) I told you that was highly irrelevant , but I think I shall bear it in mind when I have to face a military board of enquiry in Whitehall  --  and now , Mr. Murray , Mrs. Murray , I must bid you fond and grateful adieux. p. 119 MARY MURRAY Before I forget it , General ( She rises and picks up book from desk . ) That Marivaux novel  --  " La Vie de Marianne . " ( She crosses to Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go off to the field of honor , I toss this from the battlements . ( She smiles broadly , so does Howe . Murray frowns , as one who is left out of a secret that the others share . ) GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE Thank you , ma'am , I shall read it with reminiscent pleasure . ( He crosses to L. window and sees Frederick with Galway , Mullett , Sentry and Orderly ready to march . Frederick salutes and Howe nods . He turns to Murray . ) And I , for my part , propose a highly inadequate gesture of appreciation . From now on , on my ordnance maps , these Heights of Inklenberg  --  which , by the way , is a hideous name for so fair a spot  --  from now on this gentle eminence on Manhattan Island shall be designated as Murray Hill . ROBERT MURRAY I am sure , sir , that my family will always be deeply sensitive to this honor . GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE It 's small recompense , Mr. Murray . Good-bye , sir  --  good-bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to Mary , kisses her hand and exits U. C. He is joined by Hawley who hands him his hat , sword and gloves , and follows Howe . As Howe goes down the steps of the front porch be sees Mary watching at the R. window . He stops and salutes her . Howe and Hawley exit U. L. , passing the Soldiers and Frederick at Present Arms . The Soldiers then follow Frederick off U. L. Murray seems at a complete loss to understand this baffling situation . He casts about the room , as if looking for a clue  --  then be finds it : the bottle of Madeira on the grog tray . He goes over , lifts if up and inspects it . Mary has crossed to L. window , looking out. ) p. 120 ROBERT MURRAY Where did this Madeira come from ? We had none . MARY MURRAY ( Turns to him . ) One of the English orderlies brought it . The General likes his Madeira . ROBERT MURRAY ( Putting down the bottle . ) Did he stay here the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY MURRAY In the West Room , of course . ROBERT MURRAY He had a good , sound sleep , I hope ? MARY MURRAY I hope so . He seemed to appear refreshed this morning . ROBERT MURRAY Yes  --  I noticed that . You should n't have let him stay here , you know . MARY MURRAY Could I have asked him to leave ? You told me to show him all possible hospitality . ROBERT MURRAY I did . But I had no conception he 'd be so weak as to be diverted from his duty by airy talk and victuals . Calling my house an oasis ! ( Mary is about to protest but checks herself . ) Whatever he says , we 'll be involved in his disgrace . They 'll be hinting that we lured him into this trap . There may even be evil , snickering rumors that you  --  p. 121 MARY MURRAY ( Crosses R. ) Are we to be undone by hints and rumors ? ROBERT MURRAY And that French novel you gave him ? What was the purpose of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crosses D. R. to Mary . ) SUSAN LINDLEY Mary ! They 've gone ! ( She sees Murray . ) Oh  --  good morning , Robert . ROBERT MURRAY Good morning , Susan . I have been on my feet suffering the whole night through and slept not a wink  --  a good night to you both . ( He goes out C. ) MARY MURRAY Yes , my dear  --  they 've gone . ( She goes to Susan and kisses her . ) SUSAN LINDLEY Do you suppose they 'll ever come back ? MARY MURRAY ( Grosses to sit on R. window seat . ) How can anyone know , But  --  I do n't doubt that they will try . SUSAN LINDLEY ( Crosses to L. window . ) It 's a dreadful thing , to have someone suddenly swept into your life , by forces that you ca n't understand , and then , after a few moments , swept out again . p. 122 MARY MURRAY I know , Susan . They may win the war , and come back in triumph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chains . But there 's one thing we can be sure of : if , by a miracle , the Continental Army should beat them , our English friends will be awfully good losers . ( Frederick comes running from U. L. , passes L. window . ) SUSAN LINDLEY Mary ! Look ! ( Susan runs to the front door . Mary crosses L. Frederick comes on U. c . He is carrying a sword , in its scabbard , in both hands . ) LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Crosses D. R. below sofa . ) The General asked me to ride back to express his regrets that , in the haste of his departure , he neglected one important obligation : he forgot to surrender you his sword . ( He kneels and proffers it . ) MARY MURRAY But  --  I could n't possibly accept this  --  LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM I 'm sorry , ma'am , but the General insists . He asked me to assure you that he has plenty more of them . MARY MURRAY I am sure he has . But  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , Mrs. Murray . And I shall be the one to pay for it if I fail in my mission . ( He hands her the sword . She takes it , in both hands . He rises and salutes . ) And now , by your leave , I must make an unceremonious departure . The army is on the move . ( He goes out C. and is joined by Susan . They go D. R. by gate and they kiss . He starts off L. around house . Susan goes back into house . Mary looks at the sword , crosses to fireplace and puts it on mantel . She goes to L. window as Frederick passes. ) p. 123 MARY MURRAY Lord Frederick ! Tell General Howe that I hope he may find it convenient , when the time comes , to retreat by way of Murray Hill . LIEUTENANT LORD FREDERICK BECKENHAM ( Salutes . ) Yes , ma'am . ( He starts away and returns . ) What ? ( They both laugh . The show drop closes in showing a projection of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " )
