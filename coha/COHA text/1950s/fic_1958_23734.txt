Gentlemen 's Game A Story by II . E. F. Donohue Drawings by Peggy Lloyd NT OW I know it is a sin not to believe your mother , but when she said I 'd have to stay on the parlor sofa so she would not hurt her heart going up and down stairs I laughed at her , which made her sore . She 's a strong woman and I told her so . I said If I stay down here I 'll hear the old man yelling all the time . A lie . When my Dad gets going good you can hear him all the way down the pike . What I wanted was not to watch him as he shouted or even talked . No you wo n't my mother said , I 'll take him into the kitchen , for you stay down here . And I did . My Dad and Eddie , my second brother , moved the sofa with me on it away from the fake fireplace over to the front window so I could sit in the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so I could be kept awake by the big trucks that go by on U. S. I between New York and Philly in the middle of the night . Maybe that 's not fair to say that . Nobody knows I could n't sleep . That 's one of the things nobody knows . I broke my right leg on the first day of school playing football six months ago . That started it all . It was the sin of Pride got me this time , which is a new one on me , because we had just moved onto the street and I was the new guy with this game going in the lot next door and May God Forgive Me I wanted to show them I was tough enough even with the glasses . They said Sure but find another guy and there was one standing there . A guy from each side did one-potato for us and the guy that won picked the other one . You 're too small for the line , the guy on my team said when we were lined up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other team came right through where I was , the guy with the ball and a big blocker coming straight at me , I ran into the blocker from the side so hard he fell over and knocked down his own guy who was running with the ball . The next play the two of them came through the same way with the big blocker looking for me , so I let him go by to one side like I saw the crazy runts do with bulls in a movie once . Then I tackled the hall-carrier hard enough for him to drop the ball to me . In our huddle one of our guys said Give it to the runt , meaning me , They wo n't look for him to carry it . So 1 got the ball . Who cares ? I got the ball and I went around the end so fast I was ahead of my blocker and there was the big guy I 'd pushed over and sidestepped , squatting there waiting for me as if he was happy about everything in the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle . Because of the sin of Pride I kept on going , dragging him , when two others hit me and I heard the sound breaking . It is an awful sound . Some people say it sounds like a dry stick breaking . It does not . It sounds like a live bone . Well , instead of staying at the hospital two weeks , I stayed six because the guys picked me up and put me into a car so my foot turned as I waited for the bones to pop out below the knee , which they did n't , while my mother stood on our front porch with her hand on the side of her face looking at a wall , but they had to set the thing three times and the last time they had me under for three hours where I had a dream I ca n't tell about , to put wires in it , and the whole Goddam thing scared Hell out of me . ( I tried that to see how it looks . I do n't curse because I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) That was last September . Everybody 's always telling me something , so everybody told me I 'd be in a cast for only six weeks able to walk with it right away . Something happened I guess . I was in four different casts with the wires sticking out of where my ankle and knee should be in the first three . I was in four casts for the last six months . They just took the last one off and I am supposed to walk with a cane , but who wants to ? For five of those six months I sat on that sofa , downstairs at home on the parlor sofa , the first time our parlor or that sofa has been used that much since my brother Kevin died ten years ago , and I could not get away from my father as I had done since I can remember , a very long way back , back before Kevin died even , when I was four . I gut mad at my mother about it , imagine that . I got mad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being in the hospital because be only came to see me once and during those six weeks I had a funny kind of wonderful time . My mother would come of course and put her head on my bed and cry or say Christ Preserve Us that hurricane wiped away Watch Hill . Why she worried about a place too rich for us to even look at on vacation trips I 'll not know . Besides , all the nurses were so nice to me . They even made good jokes about my fourteenth birthday party being in the children 's ward where I stayed because it was cheaper , even if my mother did say I was moved there to have more company . Some company . But the nurses , the nurses . I still remember one of them so much I have to make sure not to have impure thoughts about her , like kissing her . But I remember her . I remember how I use to hide my birthday radio under the covers when somebody was singing and move my mouth to fit the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a voice she told another nurse , and that may be but I think it is changing . Last Easter when I was going to our Catholic school  --  you see we ca n't afford the Catholic High so I 'm going to the public one and that 's where I was the first day of ninth grade when I cracked the leg  --  last Easter I sang alto to Jim O'Brien 's Irish tenor in " One Hour with Thee , 0 Dearest Jesus " on Holy Thursday . A beautiful song . Singing it makes me want to cry sometimes , but I do n't . Maybe I should have stayed singing because when the choir Sister , fat old Sister Mary Bebe , came to visit she was no help . Did it hurt she asked , and because she had been wounded in the world war twenty years ago with a mustard gas scar on her thumb I said No , feeling proud , and she said Of course it hurts and now you 're lying and why are n't you going to Catholic High where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same day my Dad came . MAGAZINE He hates hospitals . I 've never seen him so quiet except some Sundays when he stays in bed reading all the newspapers . He even seemed scared . But that 's silly . And he was sober . He stared around at the other kids . He made a face when I told him about the little quiet girl , the one who tipped over the boiling water . He kept brushing off his spats when I explained why the boy next to me could n't run anymore because of rheumatism , which 1 thought only old people got . Then he suddenly got up and went away . He did n't come back again . So I did n't see him again until they brought me home , driving carefully in the snow in the afternoon and carried me up the front steps and carefully through the door so the wires would n't hit , onto the sofa . Then I knew I would be seeing a lot of him , so much , much more than I had ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home , when he came I home about on time , with a little jag on , yapping in a phony cheerful way about how I was living the life of Riley and why did n't I get off my ass and work as he had worked at my age , even earlier , picking the bugs off of potato plants . Then he would read the paper in the kitchen two rooms away talking to it , about everything in it , about every Republican is a sonofabitch , which nobody should call anybody because it means you are saying somebody 's mother is a dirty dog . Or else they arc shoemakers . He calls people shoemakers because he is a tool-and-die maker . Precision he yells . Precision . Within the tolerance of one-thousandth of an inch he yells , that 's what I work with . But he 's not tolerant about anything . Then he listens to Lowell Thomas on the radio in the dining-room one room away and I 'd have to listen to him listening to Thomas and yelling at Thomas , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was when he was feeling good . When he was n't , when he came home late anywhere from seven to eleven at night , banging around , us quiet , having been quiet since six when we knew he would be late , he would get mean and scream about running the house and paying the bills bringing in the money and how my mother was always checking him . I do n't care , he 'd scream , I do n't care how many business colleges you went to , he 'd yell at my mother , You are not going to check up on me like other women do because , my friend , my business college friend , I am not like other men , I am Stephen A. Gahagan do you hear ? My mother did try . She would get him into the kitchen with the swinging door shut saying I had to sleep but I would n't . I 'd listen . I heard all their talking about what they thought about the street and people and money and clothes and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest brother doing , trying to be an actor ? he 'd yell . Is he so smart he can quit college ? And he did . And Mary , my oldest sister , would she ever get married walking around in flat heels like a practical nurse ? Eddie , Eddie , Eddie , Eddie . He is too Goddam quiet , that 's what . My kid sister Grace they worried about too . Was she over that Goddam mastoid operation ? Oh , yes . Oh , yes ? Then why does she mope around like she had a galloping fever , always almost crying ? And my mother can never tell him . Now they would talk about me . That one , he called me , thinking I was asleep , That one . Will the Goddam leg be shorter forever ? That was the first I heard about it . No my mother would say , you see they would have many of the same talks over and over again , No , the doctors say no . That is why the three operations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Dad would say . The money , money , money , money . Holy Christ ! Time , my mother would say , time , he needs time , a long quiet time with no noise , no noise at the very all . She could do that and I am not calling her a liar . I am only saying she can take something and add to it . Like the time she talked about my suffering in the hospital ; which I did n't much , except for the terrible dream , for the vomiting after the operations , for the times they stretched my leg on the wires since it got shorter in the twisting when they picked me up and put me in the car . But she did n't talk about any of that because she didn't. know about it . She talked about the pain around the broken bone . She talked about it so much one night , she would talk long and soft to him with him shouting at the beginning and her feeding him bits of news real or added so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? Whose suffering ? And she would softly say Oh Michael 's , and he would say I did n't know and she would say Oh sure . Then he would listen and she would add to it softly as he hummed like Ohhhh , Hmamn , Ahhh , and I did n't know , I did n't know , What else then ? and she talked so much about my pain one night that he came over to the sofa and looked down at me while I acted asleep . Then he went back to the kitchen where my mother went on talking about something else , maybe about why we should n't buy a new used car , while he said nothing until he told her to leave him for a while . So she came and sat in his Morris chair by me saying nothing while he sat in the kitchen talking to himself softly . I fell asleep listening to it . A NOTHER night I woke up to the laughter of our church janitor who had come by for beer with my Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone on his vacation without packing any roman collars . Golf shoes ? the janitor said , yes . Sport shirts ? Ah , to be sure . But I stake the value of my everlasting soul there was not one priestly collar among all them traveling doodads . The whole sinful thing pleased my father because he could say There , there , loud like and happy . There I told you and the heathen Buddhists would not do such terrible things . The Buddhists , think of it . Now and then he would talk about the crazy Buddhists . He had been sent to China and Japan before I was born to set up silk-making factories , or so I was told , and there he had learned of the pagan religions , which every good Catholic knows are only God 's confusion on people since the Tower of Babble . Then after the janitor left my Dad said The world has come to a pretty pass when I have to drink with the likes of him . , But we did not have much company come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grownups did come came during the day , all happy women glad they can be sad , to check with my mother who would say Aa-yah , Aa-yah or Holy Mother , we all have our cross to bear ! Then she would get them out before he came home so she could be working hard when he walked through the door . Sometimes we 'd have visitors on Sundays when he 'd stay in bed while we went to Mass , and while we had dinner at two o'clock , he 'd stay in bed reading . Nobody comes other times because they all say he 's a drunk , which he must be but he never misses work , he 's up every morning at seven , he never staggers , and he can drive . One night he even drove home with a broken ankle after two guys ran him down after a fight in a bar . That time my dad came crawling up the front steps screaming for my mother to wrap his foot so he could go find the guys . We were living- in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them , and they came to talk for hours with him , asking him not to do it because it might happen in the city where they could n't help him and what about his position as township committeeman for the worthwhile Democratic party ? Everybody always says nobody likes my father and that may he but those two cops stopped him by begging him not to . The other thing was that he had to go to work the next day wrapped ankle and all . I was six then but I remember it . I remember sitting on the stairs with my kid sister Grace feeling two things . / felt shame that the old man was yelling his head off in front of the cops and I was worried he might have hurt himself bad . You figure that out . All I can do is remember it . My oldest sister Mary who goes to Rutgers nights says I have a fabulous memory , fabulous she says , so I learned the word . Maybe . Except worry is what I remember . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high chair eating warmed-over spaghetti , I remember my mother worried about my Dad , Because of the worry , I guess , we left him once . What a mob scattering . That was soon after my brother Kevin died . I W A S almost five when we all ran away in the year everybody keeps talking about as if it was somebody like my Dad , crazy old ' 29 . But I remember it and I remember coming back . I remember how our house did not look like a house anymore even though all the lights were on in every room . Two empty beer bottles , not our own small ones we filled in the kitchen from a barrel , but two big empty ones were on the round dining-room table under a bare bulb where the stain-glass shade with tassels should have been . He seemed too glad to see us , acting like we had been gone for years but we were gone from him only one winter . What a strange time that was . He was very quiet and acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job and the shouting started up again . Sure I remember it . But what good does remembering do if you do n't understand what you remember ? I do n't understand even what I want to remember this time because I am not getting to it , at it . I 'm letting other things move in here when all I want to talk about is the changes that happened because I was laid-up downstairs . The changes started about a month after I 'd been home when my Dad saw me playing chess with the Wig , whose real name is Ludwig Strauss but we call him the Wig because he has so much hair and because of his name . He is a good guy even if he is a Jew and I 'm not sure why all Iews are bad even if they did kill Christ . Ludwig did n't . And he is my friend and he is smart . That 's one of the things wrong with me . You arc only supposed to like people who are good . Things like that get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about it . You do n't criticize your family outside of it , but at home I have been told to shut my smart mouth too often to open it when I wonder about things , which I do . I can honor my father and mother as well as the next Catholic , but I must be better at it than most others since I 'm going to he a priest , a Dominican , because they fought the Arabs and teach and have a pool table in the rumpus room of their seminary near Jersey City . Another thing is that the Wig is smart but not all Jew boys are . Moe Levine is a dope . Even the Wig says so . And the Wig thinks I 'm smart , smart enough to learn chess anyway , and if I 'm as smart as a smart Jew what does that make me ? What I want to say is that when my Dad came home early that day and saw me and the Wig playing chess I was afraid he was going to get terribly sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends seeing him phony gay either , or drunk . They either got frightened or thought he was some card . This time he had the cheerful act on . Only he shut up very much when he saw the Wig and when he came over to the couch and saw us playing the game . The Wig who still acts a little formal even for our house , being raised in Germany , being an American only a couple of years , stood up and bowed and said he did not want to intrude was the word he used . But my Dad only looked at the board and nobody said anything . Then my Dad said in a funny voice You should finish the game , and he went into the kitchen and closed the door . We did n't hear a peep out of him as we finished , the Wig winning , saying if I had to lose either a bishop or a knight early in the game I should lose the bishop and I should not let my pawns crowd up in front of my pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for kids visiting me from the ninth grade . So I waited for my Dad to come in from the kitchen and tell me everybody can tell a Jew a mile off ( I ca n't , so after Ludwig started visiting me and told me , I thought to Hell with it and he kept coining ) and what the living hell was a kike doing in his parlor ? Even though my mother had muffed it I was sure he 'd yell about it . I put the Wig 's board and pieces away and spun down the piano stool we had used for a table , waiting for him to come in and shout at me or laugh at me or say something mean about the Wig , my friend . But he did n't . He sat in the kitchen with the door closed for a long time , so long that my mother went in and started talking to him sweetly and smoothly to make him laugh about what she had done or seen or heard . He told her to get the hell out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in a chair , not his Morris chair , with her head back looking at the ceiling . My kid sister heat it upstairs every night . I got worried with him being so quiet . There was no sound of the paper pages turning and he was not talking to it . No one else was home and I was worried thinking he had a grouch on and was letting it cook a while before he started in yelling or throwing things , slamming doors or chasing my mother and me not able to move with the wires sticking out . Through my window I could see that it was dark now and there was nobody at all outside , Finally he opened the door . He came through the dining-room looking funny and I do n't mean humorous . When he got to the parlor he pulled up a small chair , came over to the couch , spun up the piano stool , and said Get out the pieces . Which I did . Set them up he said , you can have white . S 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess together almost every night for the last five months and we still play and I guess we 're going to go on playing as long as we 're both alive . I asked him about it that night of course . I said I did n't know you played chess and he said There 's one hell of a lot you do n't know . Check . And we played and he beat me then and the story came out . It was an old Scottish gentleman taught him , he said , on the old Ventura down Australia way . I knew he had been there and to Japan and China , but nobody talked about it not even when he got moody drunk . Once , when he was not home , we brought out the torn kimonos and wooden ink stamps and a couple of old fans , nothing interesting , and once I saw a picture of him looking young in a crew cut and kimono carrying a parasol . He must have been drunk when he got the picture because he wrote on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date . He had gone to set up silk machines there the story went , way back in 1921 , but nobody talked about it . A few years ago I watched him listening to a Jap talking and talking on the radio for about half an hour and I asked my Dad what he was saying and my Dad said He says its cold . Now and then he might say being picked to go to the other side of the world was not had for a tool-and-die maker with no education . But that 's all . Nobody talked about it after they moved to Trenton and he did n't go anywhere but to another factory to work like everybody but the rich . During the Depression nobody talked about anything but work . He was the only man on our street who did n't sit on the front porch rocking away , I remember , and I remember one of us asking our mother what we were going to do when he would be laid off , as happened , and she said He 'll find another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool-and-die man . He did n't talk about the trips that night we played chess for the first time either , but he did talk about the old man who taught him . An old Scottish gentleman , he said , had noticed him alone , him the kid from Pittsfield , Mass. , walking around first-class on his way to Australia and gone . Young man , this old gentleman said , I wish to play a fine gentlemen 's game but not with any of these stuffed shirts . Sir , my father said he said , I 'm glad to oblige , thinking maybe pinochle instead of stud , What is the game ? Why chess , young man , said the old Scottish gentleman on the Ventura out of San Fran for Sidney down under , A fine gentlemen 's game . How sorry I am Sir , my Dad said , But that is a scholar 's pastime and I was not permitted to finish the eighth grade . Hah , said the old man , laughing for the first time , You act like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed shirts without some kind of brains . I do not know what to say , my Dad said . Why , the old gentleman said , Say it would be an honor , a deep honor , for me to teach you of course . So that , my father told me , is exactly what did say and he taught me and your lady is in danger , After I moved my queen I asked him why he warned the other guy 's queen as well as his king . He looked at me sharp to see if I was kidding then he said I was sure as Christ made little apples a large ninny . Did n't I know , he said , that without the queen there is no true game ? Did n't I know that the well-played game was the most important thing about chess ? No , he said , you do n't know . There was one hell of a lot everybody and his brother does n't know . I shut up then and tried to beat him that night , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually got at least one rook out early . We finished so late he went right upstairs with no fuss , absolutely , at all . The next day my mother went out and bought one of those card tables with a chessboard in the middle , the kind advertised with four men standing on one , and by the time my father got home , home on time for a change two nights in a row , she had the table up and pieces all out bunched together in front of me on the couch , his Morris chair moved across from me on the other side of the table , it took her a good half-hour to lug that rocking Morris chair across the room , saying Hush , now , Hush , when I asked her what she was doing . Then she got his bowl of onions and vinegar , his paper and beer , and put them all on the other side of the table . Before he came she told me to shut up , that 1 would play again that night and everytime he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to I was to ask him to play , and if I wanted peace in our house I would say that gentlemen do not shout while playing the gentlemen 's game . Hoo , Lord , she said , Gentlemen now each one . My , she said , sitting down so she would n't hurt her heart laughing . Which I did when he came home , surprised at first then sitting down as if he had sat there all of his life instead of in the kitchen . Only I did n't tell him . I asked him . And he took it . He laughed a good way and said there might be hope for me yet and , no , gentlemen do not shout while playing the game . It did not end all of the shouting . But there is not as much of it . I still hate it . But I am not afraid of it now , or not as afraid . Now I am getting upset with my mother , which I know is a sin . I get upset when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was on the couch I woke up early every morning so for the first lime in my life I saw how they are in the morning . He 's a different man . He 'd come downstairs and over to my couch to see how I was doing . Was it a good night he 'd ask , his face not red like when he was drinking . Then not another word as he 'd get the paper from the porch to read in the kitchen with his breakfast and my mother , who was not cheerful in the morning . She is only cheerful at night when she tries to kid him out of sending mean MAGAZINE telegrams to Lowell Thomas and the Republican party . Then my father puts on his coat very fast and goes to work with his lunch bucket saying in a quiet voice at the door , Be good . But my mother makes him ask twice for money to play the horses . When she does that I kind of get scared because I know we 'll hear about it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a grand night when he wins now and then . He comes home saying What the hell , What the hell , throwing a five at my mother saying Go get a Goddam bright new hat so you may stop looking like a poor gypsy . But she never does . He gives us money which we give to her so she can give it to him other mornings . But Oh my , Oh my , that is not the real big bother . It even is n't that now he thinks I am on his side . Before he never cared . Before he acted like the whole world was against him and he could get along alone . Now sometimes when he 's feeling cheerful smoking a good cigar , griping about nothing more maybe than his new bifocals . Fifty years old he says , and I am going blind , blind I tell you . Those times when he joshes my mother he will act as if I am on his side saying Here , here , ask gimpy here , ask Michael J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I not when I say it 's not asking too much by a tinker 's dam that beer be cold and coffee hot and food nut too much of either ? What can I say ? He is right , right , right , right . Not about everything . The Jew thing he gets onto cursing all of them , and the wogs and the polacks and the niggers and the English , the English who have been killing people in the old country for seven hundred years by making them run around trees until they are dead , dead , dead . I call him on some things , afraid every time I try , but I have to do it each time , why I do n't know . Now I go to school with all kinds of people . The two months I 've been to school I 've met wops and they are not greasy . I 've even talked to a nigger , a guy who 's always clowning around laughing , but he knows the answers in math class . And the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems to like it sometimes when I talk back to him . If I catch hint on something that does n't make sense he laughs and says You 'll make out , you 'll make out . When I 'm wrong he only says In ten years you 'll know more . I called him on the Jew thing with the Wig . One night he said What a fine boy that is who taught you low to play this game so well . I said It 's too bad he 's a ' Jew . He jerked his head back as if I had swung at him and yelled What the hell difference . He did n't finish it . Then he said Do n't get funny with me . He said I 'll knock your smart block off if you start poking fun with me . He said Move , smart guy . That worked . Now the Wig comes around all the time . Once he brought his violin and played it and went home and my mother walked around saying What a gift , What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Beautiful , Beautiful . But I have to be careful . And the big bother is not that I can beat him at the game all the time now , even when he cheats while I go to the toilet , and we play for money , a dollar a game which I always win and give to my mother . One night I was tired and lost three of her dollars to him and she looked at me as if I was on his side . How she loves to have him lose . How he loves to win . How he loves to talk when he seems sure I 'm listening to him , when he 's only a little drunk and wants to tell me something , why I do n't know . but he talks as if he 's talking to himself , as if I am him and he 's talking to himself , not me or anyone else . He tells me things I do n't think he 's told my mother because she sits reading most of the time we play except when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or she did until he noticed het listening and yelled What the hell are you staring at , madam , you mind your own Goddam p 's and q 's . So now she does not put down the paper but I have hunches when she is listening to him . She listens when he sounds like a different person , not a stranger , but somebody else . He talks a lot about his training as a machinist , what he calls his apprenticeship . When Dad 's not talking about his apprenticeship , and I guess he talks a lot about that because he started it when he was my age , he talks about how big the world is in Asia , so many more people than over here and not Christian let alone Catholic . Add Africa to that , he says , and who the hell do we think we are ? It 's so big over there , he says , you ca n't think of it all at once , you have to travel it . Then he talks sometime about when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about money , money , money , money . He starts getting sore about money and how there 's not enough of it and him with so many kids . And I hear so much about the factory where he works I feel I know the guys and they sound awful dumb and dirty-minded . Which is part of the big bother . Sometimes , you see , he seems to be talking about all those things together , and his mother and father , and good whiskey and gambling , learning and health , all of them and more together and I do not understand . 1 try to but I 'm not sure I want to . As the Sisters used to say do n't try to understand too much like the doctor did who drank the chemicals and brought the Devil in him out . I 'm not afraid of the Devil if I understand all of my Dad , but I want to stay away from it . Why I do n't know . T H E big trouble , the bother , you see is maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not want to talk about it . He said my Dad was in trouble because he 's stopped his Easter Duty . 1 know he 's in trouble but there is more to it than that . It was something my father , my Dad , said you see . It was that first night we played the game . As be started to go up the stairs to bed , to sleep , I asked him a question . I said Who have you played with since the old Scottish gentleman ? He turned on the stairs and looked at me like I was in some dark room . But all the lights were on . My mother only stood and yawned . Then when he saw I was n't joking he turned around and started up the steps answering me as he went up alone . He said Who the hell did I ever meet after that , going where I went , doing what I do , who knows the splendid game ? So I am bothered by such a silly thing as the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could play chess , a fine smart grand game . And what else do n't we know about him ? All this has made we wonder now if my Dad who is wrong about many things is as wrong about everything as everybody says he is and if he is n't then I 'm in trouble because a lot of other people and things are . I do n't know . All I know is everybody has to talk secretly to somebody else even if that somebody is yourself . Which is what I am doing . But I 'm scared .
