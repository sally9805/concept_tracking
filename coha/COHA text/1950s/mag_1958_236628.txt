IN the worldwide alarm over Soviet long-range missiles , scant attention was paid to the U.S. Army 's warning that Russia has made startling progress in the development and production of conventional weapons . Last week , with its Explorer triumphantly orbiting , the Army found a readier audience for its down-to-earth worries . The Army 's argument : if it is to meet the Soviet challenge on the ground , it needs more and newer hardware . <P> Films of new Soviet weapons paraded in Moscow last November shook a cherished tenet of Western military men : that what the West 's forces lacked in quantity , they made up in quality of weaponry . Army Chief of Staff General Maxwell D. Taylor warned in early winter that the Soviet army is equipped with tactical rockets and missiles " to which we have no response . " While the U.S. has much first-rate equipment under development , Russia has it in the field . Declared U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Donald A. Quarles : " Let us concede them the Soviets general superiority in their present ground-force equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence reports come these minimum estimates of Russian equipment : <P> Tanks : The Soviets have equipped all major combat units with the diesel-powered , 53-ton T-54 , which has a range of 250 miles , cruises at 30 m.p.h. , carries a 100-mm. gun . U.S. officials concede that the T-54 is superior to its closest U.S. equivalent-the M48 Patton ( 49 tons , range 90 miles , high-velocity 90-mm. gun ) - but they believe the T-54 may prove too heavy for effective use . are themselves looking for a fast new 30-ton tank . In the Moscow parade the Soviets also showed an antiaircraft tank , as big and mobile as the T-54 , mounting twin 57-mm. flak guns . The U.S. has no antiaircraft tanks . <P> Troop Carriers : The Soviets have an amphibious , caterpillar-tracked vehicle that is or soon will be in mass production . The U.S. has only a few such armored troop carriers , its allies virtually none . <P> Artillery : A new Soviet 203-mm. gun-howitzer can be emplaced for firing within minutes ( compared to 36 hours for the World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 miles . The U.S. 8-in. howitzer is comparable but less mobile . The Russians boast a 240-mm. breech-loading mortar that doubles as an infantry and short-range artillery weapon . While its value in modern warfare is questionable , the U.S. has no counterpart . <P> Short-Range Missiles : Soviet short-range missiles are solid-fueled , therefore can be fired more quickly than such liquid-fueled missiles as the U.S. Corporal . The Russians have mounted rocket launchers on vehicles with caterpillar tracks . In Red Square they showed a launcher for rockets 12 in. in diameter , mounted on a tanklike chassis . U.S. ground-support missiles are carried on wheeled trucks . <P> Transport : The Soviets are producing a large twin-rotor helicopter called " The Horse , " which can lift 40 soldiers or 10,000 Ibs. at a speed of 110 m.p.h . Ready for production is the gas-turbine MI-6 ( " The Hook " ) , which will carry twice the load of The Horse . U.S. Army experts say they have nothing to match either of these Soviet choppers.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
