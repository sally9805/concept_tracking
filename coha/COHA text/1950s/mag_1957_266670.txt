A Railway Express truck pulled up at a big yellow brick house on Chicago 's North Drake Avenue one morning last week , and as the deliveryman handed over a package , he said knowingly , " Here 's another one for the doc . " Dr. Meyer A. Perlstein took the package out to the garage , set it on his workbench and stripped the wrappings . With a screwdriver , the doctor pried the top off a shiny new quart can . In it , well preserved by wrappings of formaldehyde-soaked gauze , was a human brain . <P> Like half a dozen others that had recently arrived , this brain came from a child who had just died with cerebral palsy . It gave Dr. Perlstein , pediatrician at both Cook County and Michael Reese Hospitals , one more chance to learn additional details about the grim affliction which is not directly fatal but is severely handicapping , sometimes shortens life by lowering resistance . The specimen was listed in the brain registry of the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy ( which Dr. Perlstein helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman Josephy at Chicago State Hospital . Dr. Josephy may take as long as three months , slicing up to 200 paper-thin sections from the brain , mounting and photographing them , before reporting back to Perlstein on where and how the brain was damaged . <P> Matched Histories . Cerebral palsy afflicts one child out of 215 born in the U.S. But it is a catchall label for a wide variety of symptoms , and it may have an equal variety of causes . Symptoms range from spasticity ( generalized rigidity of the muscles ) , chorea ( sudden and jerky purposeless movements ) , athetosis ( slower and more writhing movements ) , grimacing and lack of balance . <P> <P> For both treatment and prevention of palsy , doctors need to know the precise cause of each type of case . One school of medical opinion has held that birth injury ( usually from high forceps ) is the commonest cause ; also , that the nature of symptoms depends on just which part of the brain was damaged . Dr. Perlstein long ago became convinced that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the only way possible : study the living patients in detail , keeping a minute record of symptoms , then examine their brains after death to see which symptoms go with what type of brain damage . Parents of palsied children who have been studied in this way are asked to permit an autopsy , during which the brain is removed . Either the brain alone or the detailed history alone is useless ; doctors must have both for matching . <P> Tentative Conclusions . From the specimens examined in Chicago and similar registries in Washington and Los Angeles , Dr. Perlstein has already drawn correlations that will require revision of some long-held ideas . Forceps deliveries , he believes , account for less than 3% of cerebral palsy , although a total of 60% of all cases can be traced to some kind of damage at birth-notably brain hemorrhage and contusions during a difficult delivery , and oxygen starvation ( which in its turn may have a multiplicity of causes ) . About 30% of cerebral palsy is caused , Dr. Perlstein believes , by the mother 's illnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diabetes ) and Rh incompatibility-though this last cause has fallen in frequency from 10% to less than 3% , now that doctors are paying closer attention to pregnant women 's blood groups . Finally , 10% of cases result from injuries in childhood .
