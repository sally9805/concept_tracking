From THE REPUBLIC <P> " Then in general , the classes of things concerned with the care of the body have less of truth and real being than the classes of things concerned with the care of the soul ? " <P> " Much less . " <P> " . . . Then those who have no experience of wisdom and virtue , who are always at their feastings and so forth , are being carried downwards , as it seems , and back again to the middle region , and there they wander about all their lives ; as to passing above this limit , they have never even cast a look to the true upwards and never been there , never been filled with what really is or had a taste of pure and abiding pleasure . Like brute beasts , they look ever downwards , and feed stooping over the ground and poking their noses into their tables , cropping and coupling ; and to get more and more of these things they kick and butt with iron horns and hooves and kill one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy with real things the real part of themselves , or to fill up that vessel , their body . " <P> <P> " . . . Clever and unjust men behave like racers who make a good run of it from the start , and collapse on the way from the turn ; they . . . end up by being laughed at like a lot of fools , and run away uncrowned with their ears down on their shoulders , but real racers keep on to the finish , and win the prizes and the crown . " <P> <P> " . . . We , my dear Glaucon , must take most care that each one of us shall disregard all studies , except this one study ... to see if he shall be able to learn and discover in any place one who shall give him the ability and intelligence to know a good life from a bad , and to choose always and everywhere the best that the conditions allow ; . . . one who shall teach him how thus to know what beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of soul , will work evil or good ; what will be the effect of high birth or low birth , private station or governing station , strength or weakness , cleverness or dullness in learning , and all such qualities of the soul natural or acquired-what effects they will have when commingled together ; so that it will be possible for him , by taking account of all these things , to make his choice : keeping his gaze fixed all the while on the nature of the soul , and considering both the worse and the better life , calling it worse if it so leads the soul that it becomes more unjust , and better if it leads the soul to become more just . All else he will leave alone , for we have seen that this is the best choice , both for living and for dying . " <P> <P> From THE DEFENSE OF SOCRATES <P> " . . . Now therefore , gentlemen , so far from pleading for my own sake , as one might expect , I plead for your sakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by condemning me . For if you put me to death , you will not easily find such another , really like something stuck on the state by the god , though it is rather laughable to say so ; for the state is like a big thoroughbred horse , so big that he is a bit slow and heavy , and wants a gadfly to wake him up . I think the god put me on the state something like that , to wake you up and persuade you and reproach you every one . " <P>
