Creswell is a grimy Derbyshire coal-mining town , but the folk of nearby villages called it " happy Creswell . " It boasts a model village housing development , a crack shooting team , a brass band famed for miles around . Its mine , reputed to be one of Britain 's safest , is equipped with up-to-date conveyor and ventilation systems . Output per man-shift is two tons , nearly double the national average of 1.05 . <P> In Creswell 's mine at 4 a.m. one day last week a fire broke out 1,000 ft. below ground on one of the newly installed rubber conveyor belts . Of 99 miners in the area , 19 crawled to safety , 80 were trapped . Said one who got out : " The men in our party who lagged behind , crawling on their hands and knees , were dragged along by others . " <P> For hours shivering miners ' wives , their scarves tightly knotted beneath blue pinched faces , stood round the pithead in stunned misery , while Salvation Army officers served tea and prayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Meanwhile , grim-faced union and government officials sat in conference . At midday they issued a statement . <P> Shaft wheels halted , children stood silently in empty coal trucks and villagers tensely closed in on a pit official as he read aloud from a pink slip of paper : " There is no possibility of any of the men remaining in the district affected being alive . . . It was then unanimously decided that no course remained except to seal off the affected part of the pit . This work is now taking place . " <P> Some women fainted , others knelt in prayer . The shaft wheels turned again , this time lowering sand bags to seal off the area where the 80 men had died .
