txt 26o History of England like in kind to those of the preceding century to require no additional description . In copiousness they increased so enormously , however , that only a small portion of them has yet been utilized adequately . Our knowledge of the fourteenth century must be held subject to much revision in the light of fuller evidence . CHAPTER XV LANCASTER AND YORK THE rule of Henry IV ( 1399-1413 ) was dominated by his ambition to make his tenure of the throne secure . Made king by parliament , without hereditary right , he could hope for security only when he had convinced the nation that his rule would be good . It was no easy task . To placate the clergy he legislated against heretics and to win popular approval he made concessions to parliament . Nevertheless , opposition , which became rebellion , arose in many quarters . Rebellion was favored during the early years of his reign by a variety of circumstances . ( i ) The internal disorder was so great that a friend reported to the king : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poor , quarrels and contentions . " These conditions not only bred desperadoes ready to take part in any venture , but they also caused the people " to grouch against King Harry " for the lack of governance which per-mitted such evils to endure . ' ( 2 ) Insurrections nourished in this friendly atmosphere could always focus upon the person of one whose hereditary claim to the throne was better than Henry 's . The deposed Richard , after a few months in prison , met his death , probably at Henry 's command ; but an impostor appeared at the hostile court of Scotland , where he could always be invoked to arouse popular sym-pathy for an armed demonstration in favor of Richard II by any Eng-lish faction momentarily dissatisfied with Henry . Plotters who found this ficti:cn too transparent bid for popular favor in the name of the young Ed , - fund Mortimer , earl of March . His descent from Lionel , the third scn of Edward III , gave him a better hereditary title than that of Henry . ' ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Wales , where there existed varying degrees of hos-tility toward the new dynasty . The French king , whose daughter was the wife of Richard II , refused to acknowledge Henry and held the long truce arranged with his predecessor to be nullified . Internal dissensions among the French prevented the organization of formidable attacks upon England , but disaffection was encouraged in Gascony , the English coasts were raided sporadically , and French cooperation with Henry 's enemies was always 261 // a possibility . In the north the Scots were raiding the border and threat-ening more serious invasion . Wales soon broke into open rebellion . Owen Glendower , a Welsh gentleman who deemed himself wronged by a lord of the march , extended the scope of his private quarrel to embrace a national rebellion designed to secure Welsh independence . Surrounded by these dangers , the new king was forced to tax his physi-cal energy and his political ability to the utmost to keep the scepter in his grasp . Rebellion began when Henry celebrated his first yuletide . The lords who had been the abettors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle of Windsor and assassinate the king and his sons in their sleep . So well was the conspiracy laid that they gained admis-sion to the castle , but their victim , warned at the eleventh hour , escaped . During the next two years war had to be waged against Scotland and Wales . The latter , carried on by the king in person and by his eldest son , was notably unsuccessful . At home disaffection caused several local disturbances , and open talk of rebellion reached proportions that led to executions . At the end of 1402 , Sir Edmund Mortimer , uncle of the earl of March , espoused the cause of Owen Glendower , and proclaimed his nephew lawful king . A few months later the Percies , father and son , cast their lot with Mortimer and Glendower . The elder Percy , who was earl of Northumberland , and his son , Harry Hotspur , controlled vast resources in the north of England . Their support had been an influen-tial factor in Henry 's acquisition of the throne , and they had since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern border against the Scots , winning in 1402 a considerable victory . A dispute between them and the king over custody of the prisoners , who were valuable for purposes of ransom , accentuated a rift already begur over other financial claims of the Percies . It ended in their rebellion it 1403 . The king , who was taken unawares , rushed to the west an army which he was assembling for a Scottish campaign . Hotspur was on the march to join Glendower , who now controlled the greater part of Wales . Their junction might well have been fatal . Henry intercepted Hotspur at Shrewsbury and won a victory by a close decision . Hotspur fell on the field . Northumberland , who took no part in the battle , was deprived of some of his power and pardoned . The victory freed the king from the most pressing of his dangers , but the Welsh revolt was further complicated by French aid , while disorder and petty conspiracies con-tinued at home . In 1405 rebellion again openly reared its head in England . Northum-berland raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurrection . Prompt action overcame the rebels before they were thoroughly organized . This time Henry showed no mercy to the leaders , but Northumberland escaped the block by timely flight to Scotland . This triumph proved to be the turning point in Henry 's for-tunes . Thereafter internal discontent gradually subsided . Three years later , when Northumberland unfurled the standard of revolt for the third time , so few rallied to his cause that the local levy sufficed to stay his course and end his career . After 1405 , too , Henry 's eldest son , Henry , began to make headway against Owen Glendower . Scotland was rendered harmless by a stroke of fortune . In 1406 English pirates accidentally captured James Stuart , heir to the throne of Scotland , and delivered him to the English king . Though James shortly became king , Henry kept him in captivity as hostage for the good behavior of the northern kingdom . In the next year the French , who were now rent by the rivalries of noble factions , made a truce with Henry . This de-prived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1409 Sir Ed-mund Mortimer died . By that time the English had reconquered the castles captured by Glendower , and only the dying embers of the Welsh rebellion were left alive . In England sedition was extinct . For the remainder of his reign Henry enjoyed the political quiet which he had earned at the cost of a physical breakdown . " Henry IV , striving lawfully , had made his own house strong ; Henry V , leading the forces with which his father had striven , made England the first power in Europe . " 3 When Henry V came to the throne in 1413 he was only twenty-five , but for more than a decade he had been commanding soldiers in the field . His thoughts naturally turned to feats of arms . He soon made manifest his ambition to restore the military grandeur which England had enjoyed in the days of Edward III and to win glory as the conqueror of France . His project was favored by conditions both at home and abroad . Henry V , thanks to his father , had behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently prosperous to bear the cost of foreign war . In France , on the other hand , all was discord . Charles VI , who had been king since 1380 , had ruled weakly . A long minority had given rise to feuds among the nobles who strove to secure control of the government . Thereafter the king displayed signs of a mental weakness which ended in insanity , and the factious rivalries continued . The principal contest came to be between a party led by the count of Armagnac and another led by the duke of Burgundy . The bitter rivalry of Burgundians and // Armagnacs gradually forced the French nobles to espouse one side or the other . Eventually the spirit spread downward throughout the nation , until the French were divided into two hostile camps . No national interest or no real principle was at stake , but in 1411 the strife broke into civil war , which was only nominally ended by a peace patched up in 1414 . Henry V took advantage of the situation to ally himself with Burgundy , and in 1415 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town by siege , and started to march thence to Calais . Near Agincourt he was intercepted by a French force greatly superior in numbers . The French forgot the lessons of du Guesclin , resorted to the old feudal tactics of Crecy and Poitiers , and suffered an overwhelming defeat . In 1417 Henry renewed the attack , making a war of sieges . By the beginning of 1419 he had captured the principal Norman towns and strongholds and was in practical possession of Normandy . Meanwhile the Burgundian duke wavered in his support . His assassination by the Armagnacs in 1419 caused his son to seek revenge with the aid of the English . The alliance that followed gave Henry such an advantage as he could never have hoped to win by military campaigns . The result was the Treaty of Troyes in 1420 . By its terms Henry agreed to marry Katharine , the daughter of Charles VI , and was acknowledged as regent of France and successor to Charles . The son of the French king was disinherited . The treaty gave Henry control of the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France south of Paris remained loyal to the son of Charles VI and refused to abide by the Treaty of Troyes . After the treaty Henry began the conquest of Armagnac territory . In 1422 , while engaged in this task , he died of dysentery contracted during the campaign . Henry 's heir , of the same name , was only a few months old . Both in England and in France the royal business had to be conducted by advisers . The inevitable factional disputes which followed were more disastrous than usual . Not only did they weaken the English position in France , but eventually they grew into a civil war at home . Before his death Henry V designated his brother John , duke of Bedford , to take charge of affairs in France and his brother Humphrey , duke of Glouces-ter , to manage affairs in England . The latter , who had been acting as regent during the absence of Henry V in France , had already created many enemies among the councilors with whom he had worked . They secured from parliament an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was strongly opposed . The leadership of the opposition was taken by the Beauforts , his half-uncles , who were sons of John of Gaunt , born out of wedlock , but legitimated by act of // parliament . Throughout the period of the regency the quarrels of the factions of Gloucester and Beaufort weakened the government of Eng-land and handicapped the conduct of the war in France . The duke of Bedford , in decided contrast to his brother Humphrey , ruled and commanded with hardly less ability than his deceased brother , Henry V. Under his direction the war in France was continued sue-cessfully . Before the close of 1422 Charles VI also closed his life , making the infant , Henry VI of England , the king of France . The son of Charles VI refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Troyes , claimed the throne as Charles VII , and with the aid of the Armagnacs kept up a resistance to English arms . He was at this time a weak leader , influ-enced by selfish and unwise counselors . His defense steadily crumbled before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed the Armagnacs back of the Loire and were besieging Orleans , the key to the country still held by Charles , when the tide of war was turned by the appearance on the scene of one of the most dramatic figures in history , Joan of Arc . She was a young peasant girl , inspired by the belief that she had received a mission from God to save France . She came to the court of Charles VII , pierced his torpor with her en-thusiasm , and was allowed to lead troops to the relief of Orleans . Among the soldiers Joan created a patriotic fervor which knew no bounds . She led them successfully in assaults on English redoubts which had been regarded as well-nigh impregnable . Within a short time the English were forced to raise the siege of Orleans and withdraw . Subse-quently the maid inspired the French in several successful battles against the English , but in 1431 she was captured by the Burgundians , who turned her over to the English . The English soldiers had come to look upon her as a witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope that the morale of his soldiers might be re-stored , Bedford had her tried by a French ecclesiastical commission , which condemned her as a heretic . Thereupon she was burned at the stake . Though Joan 's career was brief , she accomplished her mission . When she first appeared , the spirit of French patriotism was nearly extinct . For years the country had been split by internal rivalries which Charles VII seemed too weak to heal . The English had been so steadily victori-ous that even those Frenchmen who still supported Charles VII were beginning to feel it impossible to stem the tide . The French national spirit was obscured in a fog of apathetic gloom . Joan swept away this indifference of despair and kindled anew the spirit of French nation-ality . Her ideal lived after her death and continued to stir the French // people . Henceforth Bedford could do no more than retard the French advance ; he could not stop it . In 1435 Burgundy deserted Henry VI for Charles VII . In the same year Bedford died , and none could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sufficiently influential to allay , still rent the council . In 1437 Henry VI was declared of age , but he was too weak to command the situation . The council retained practical control of the government , and the quarrels of fac-tions continued unabated . Under these conditions the English cause was hopeless . In 1436 Paris was lost . In 1444 the earl of Suffolk , an ally of the Beauforts , who had finally deprived Gloucester of influ-ence and won control of the council , secured a trice of two years in return for a marriage between Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou , whose aunt was the queen of Charles VII . The marriage was followed by the cession of Maine to France . In 1449 and 1450 Normandy was regained by the French . In 1451 the last English stronghold in Gas-cony was captured . When an English expedition sent to recover Gascony was disastrously defeated in 1453 , the Hundred Years ' War came to an end . England was stripped of all her possessions in France except the single city of Calais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English , but it was in reality beneficial to England as well as to France . In the fifteenth century the consciousness of nationality had become so strong among the French that England could no longer hope to hold blocks of French territory , as she had done in the Middle Ages . The attempt had produced only a useless waste of men and money , and the stoppage of the drain was a positive advantage . The close of the Hundred Years ' War saw England on the verge of civil war . The strife of factions had long been preparing the ground for the conflict . The quarrels of the nobles rendered the government inefficient and promoted disorder in the realm . Livery and maintenance , fostered by the renewed wars and encouraged by the lack of gov-ernance , throve mightily in the time of Henry VI . Powerful nobles not only had their own tenants and retainers , but they could also command the adherence of the smaller landowners for miles around . In whole districts people went in fear of their lives and property . Rob-beries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prac-ticed with impunity . ' In such districts it was generally useless and often dangerous to seek justice . In some instances the justices of the peace and the sheriffs were the henchmen of the powerful offenders ; in others they were bribed or intimidated . Injured parties often refrained from a Fortescuc , Governance of England , ed. by Plummer , p. 24. // bringing before a court the retainer of a great lord for fear of placing their lives in jeopardy . Private wars between nobles were of common occurrence . During the minority remedy was hopeless , since some of the worst offenders were among the lords of the council . They also controlled the house of lords , and by means of their retainers they often dictated the election of knights of the shire and through their nominees dominated the house of commons as well . A strong king who could repress the factions among the nobles and compel them to keep the peace seemed to be the one possible remedy ; but Henry VI , when he came of age , proved to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of intentions and most generous of impulses , promoted the evils of a situation which he abhorred . On one occasion two nobles waged a private war to secure possession of an office which the king with his accustomed generosity and forgetfulness had granted to both of them . In a land where violence was the order of the day and the magnates , who strove for control of the government , possessed large bands of armed followers , it was easy for their feuds to develop into a civil war . The story of their bickerings is a dreary chronicle of self-seeking which it would be profitless to relate further than is necessary to explain the background of the war . In the days of the minority , when the quarrel was between Humphrey , duke of Gloucester , and Henry Beau-fort , bishop of Winchester , such right as there was appeared to be on the side of the latter . However selfish the bishop may have been , he had political ability , which Gloucester lacked . In the main Beaufort was successful . Except for brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained sufficient power to force upon the bishop quarrels which made the work of government difficult . After the king was declared of age in 1437 , the balance swung more decidedly in favor of the Beauforts . They succeeded in making the king their pup-pet , acquiring such ascendency that they were able to eclipse Gloucester . The victory of the Beauforts made possible the promotion of some of the younger members of the house . Within a few years Edmund Beau-fort , the duke of Somerset , and his close friend and ally , the earl of Suffolk , were the most influential men in the government . After the king 's marriage , which was arranged by Suffolk , Margaret of Anjou dominated the king , and she worked hand and glove with Somerset and Suffolk . Neither duke nor earl had the ability to wield wisely the power they had acquired , and their failures soon rendered them unpopular . In 1447 they arrested the discredited Gloucester on the charge of treason , and five days later he died in confinement . Rightly or wrongly , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion began to turn against them . Soon afterward the terms of the truce with France became generally known , and they aroused widespread criticism . The prolonged losses of English arms had caused profound discontent which was ready to vent itself on anyone whom popular fancy should deem responsible . The cession of territory still occupied by English troops for what was generally esteemed no adequate return was commonly at-tributed to Suffolk and was regarded as little better than treason . When the English in Normandy , commanded by Somerset , were conquered so suddenly and so completely in 1449 and 1450 , the nation could find no adequate explanation except treason . Thereupon the popular indig-nation boiled over . The first result was the impeachment of Suffolk in the parliament of 1450 . Henry VI , who could see no wrong in his friends , would not allow the earl to be tried , and banished him from the realm for five years . The people , however , refused to let him go . The ship on which he had embarked for the continent was intercepted and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed almost immediately by Cade 's rebellion , a popular outbreak in Kent and Sussex , called after its leader . The rebellion was not a peasants ' revolt but a political protest . It was joined by many small landholders and men of substance , and its immediate occasion was the news of the final defeat in Nor-mandy . The demands of the rebels were mainly political in character . They complained of the maladministration of justice , the packing of parliament by means of armed retainers , the failure of the government to protect the possessions of landholders against powerful neighbors , the treachery which had lost Normandy , and the murder of Gloucester . Lack of governance was the burden of their refrain . What they wanted was a change of ministries and reform of the government . The rebels were well organized and observed military discipline . The army raised by the lords of the council to meet . them mutinied , the king fled from London , and the rebels entered without opposition . For a time they kept order , while they wreaked vengeance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands upon . When they began to pillage , the citizens expelled them from London . Subsequently they were easily dispersed . Thus in 1450 the ground was thoroughly prepared for civil war . The government was weak and popularly discredited , the king was a figure-head , parliament had failed to maintain order , resort to armed force was of almost daily occurrence , and strife among noble factions con-tending for political power had become traditional . It required only a // spark to fire the explosion of this loose powder and to cause the contest of factions to develop into a civil war . This was supplied by the claim of Richard , duke of York , to the throne . On his father 's side Richard was descended from the sixth son of Edward III , but his mother was the sister of Edmund , earl of March , the heir of Lionel , the third son of Edward III . When Edmund died in 1425 , Richard inherited his title to the throne . For many years he said nothing of his claim . Meanwhile he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gloucester 's faction in the council , becoming its leader after Gloucester 's death . The removal of Gloucester also made him the natural heir to the throne so long as Henry VI remained childless . Content with this position , he did not assert his claim . As leader of the opposition to the Beauforts , however , he came into conflict with Suffolk and Somerset . In 1450 , taking advantage of Suffolk 's downfall , he collected retainers from his estates , marched to London , and practically forced the king to admit him to his council . His avowed purpose was to reform the gov-ernment . When his endeavor to oust Somerset failed , he resorted to armed force . In 1452 his army met the king 's , but the impending battle was avoided by the king 's concession of York 's request . If Henry prom-ised to dismiss Somerset , as York was led to believe , he belied himself ; but , on the other hand , he did not punish York , as he was urged to do by Somerset . Shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Somerset was imprisoned . At the end of 1454 the recovery of the king again reversed the situation . York lost his office and Somerset was restored to power . On this occasion the queen gave evidence of her intention to be rid of the Yorkists . Meanwhile the birth of a son to Henry had deprived York of his position as the natural successor to the throne . He still made no claim to supplant Henry . He raised the standard of rebellion ostensibly to defend the Yorkists from the anticipated attack of Somerset and the queen . But the dynastic question was by now in the background of all political thought , and eventually it became the principal issue in the contest . The wars that followed came to be known later as the Wars of the Roses because of the tradition that the white rose was the badge of York , and the red that of Lancaster . ' No great principles were at stake . When the main object of strife came to be dynastic , the people at large had little direct interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobles , supported by their tenants and retainers . They were rather an expansion of the earlier factional fights of the reign than a // manifestation of popular feeling . In 1455 York won the battle of St. Albans , where Somerset was slain . For two years thereafter York controlled the government , and during part of the time was regent while the king was again temporarily insane . In 1456 , however , the king 's recovery enabled the queen to resume the ascendency . Three years later , when she felt her position sufficiently strong , she began to assemble troops . York immediately armed , but his followers were outnumbered , and he was compelled to flee . In 146o , however , his followers defeated the king at Northampton , and thereafter he claimed the crown . Because many of his own supporters were unwilling to accept his claim , it was finally compromised by an agreement that he should inherit the throne after the death of Henry VI . Meanwhile Queen Margaret , who had no thought of allowing her son to be disinherited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year the duke of York met them in battle at Wakefield , where he was defeated and lost his life . The queen then marched to the south and defeated the Yorkists in the second battle of St. Albans , where King Henry was released from his Yorkist captors . The Lancastrians , however , were not strong enough to take London and turned north . Edward , son of Richard of York , pursued , and at Towton , near York , inflicted upon them a decisive defeat . Henry VI and Margaret were compelled to seek safety in Scotland , while Edward returned to London to be crowned king and to begin the rule of the house of York . Though the Lancastrian period ended in civil strife , it witnessed a remarkable expansion of the power of parliament . Henry IV could hardly do otherwise than seek the advice of parliament . His very accession by parliamentary action was an acknowledgment of his dependence upon parliament , the insecurity of his hold upon the crown made the retention of parliamentary support essential , and the constant warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial aid . Parliament soon discovered the advantages of the situation and began to demand privileges and powers . Henry IV felt constrained to concede one petition after another , until parliament acquired such power and influence as it had never wielded before . The renewal of the Hundred Years ' War made Henry V financially dependent on that body , and those responsible for the administration during his long absences necessarily sought parliamentary support . The long minority of Henry VI , his weakness and lack of decision after he became of age , and the continuance of the war produced similar conditions during the greater part of his long reign . With the outbreak of disorder and civil war in 1450 , the government nearly ceased to // function , and parliament became hardly more than the agent of the faction temporarily in control . Until that time , however , the power ac-quired by parliament in the reign of Henry IV was not only main-tained but was even further defined and expanded . The legislation of the period continued to emanate principally from the commons , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important particulars by the king before they became statutes . The commons also kept their control of the grant of taxation , and used it effectively to secure the legislation and the royal concessions which they desired . Once Henry IV threatened their control by obtaining the consent of the lords to a proposed tax before consulting them , but their prompt protest became a precedent for the establishment of the custom that grants of money should originate with the commons . In their attempts to influence the king through his council and min-isters the Lancastrian parliaments were highly successful . In 1404 , when internal disorder was at its height and disaffection was still rampant , parliament freely attacked the king 's government . It complained of mismanagement of the king 's household , and secured the dismissal of several officials , and the promise that others should be appointed in parliament . The members of the council were also named in parlia-ment . The lords appointed were not sufficiently regular in their attend-ance to constrain the king greatly in his action , but the commons evi-dently expected that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament in some measure . In 1405 the commons voted taxes " not only by fear of God and love for the king , " but also " by the great confidence which they had in the lords elected and ordained to be of the continual council . " ' When the events of 1405 convinced them that their confidence had been misplaced , they secured the appointment of a new council and a provision that all the important documents issued by the king should be approved by the council and no significant royal action taken without its advice . " The demands of the commons and the concessions of the king almost amounted to a supersession of the royal authority . " ' They were not literally enforced , but they were maintained with sufficient rigor to limit the royal discretion during the greater part of the remaining years of the reign . With the accession of Henry V parliament lost much of its control over the council , but the council necessarily remained powerful in the // absence of the king . Henry V kept it filled with lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority of Henry VI an autocratic council wielded the whole royal executive power . It was named originally by the lords of parliament . Subsequently the lords of the council dominated parliament and kept the two bodies in har-mony . When the king 's minority ended , no substantial change in the situation occurred . The weak king was practically ruled by the council until Suffolk acquired the ascendency in the decade of the forties . The earl disregarded the council and through the favor of the king generally managed affairs alone . It was largely this which lost him the confidence of parliament and led to his impeachment . Subsequent attempts to revive the council had only temporary results . Confidence was gone , the lords generally ceased to attend , the council lost its power , and parliament lost its control . ' So ended a premature constitutional development . It was a striking display of parliamentary power while it lasted . Under Henry IV it went so far that it seemed to foreshadow the modern system of govern-ment by a cabinet responsible to parliament ; but the elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet was beyond the ken of the Lancastrian politicians . The relation-ship established between parliament and council in the time of Henry IV fell into desuetude in the last years of the Lancastrian period and lost all significance as an institutional precedent . During the reign of Henry IV the commons established precedents which helped them eventually to secure the privileges of freedom of speech and freedom from arrest . The former , when it was finally established , gave to the members of the house of commons immunity outside of parliament for utterances made in the transaction of par-liamentary business . Without it the commons could not act indepen-dently as the representatives of the rights of the nation , because speeches displeasing to the king might subject their author to penalties . Tlx : principle was involved in the case of Thomas Haxey in 1397 s Though he was not , a member of the commons , he was condemned as the author of a petition which the commons had accepted and presented to the king as their own . In 1399 the commons vindicated their right to express their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V a reversal of the judgment against Haxey . Henry IV also acknowl-edged the right of the commons to reach their decisions free from royal pressure . The privilege of freedom from arrest in civil actions // while attending parliament was useful to protect members against the king or other powerful persons whose wishes they might oppose . This privilege had existed for a long time , its original purpose having been to prevent interference with those who consulted upon the king 's business ; but it was of importance to have Henry IV confirm the privi-lege when it was becoming an aid to the commons in maintaining their independence of the royal influence . These privileges constituted a bul-wark behind which the commons could safely voice the sentiments of the nation , however displeasing these might be to the king . In the fifteenth century , however , the limits of these privileges were vaguely defined , and they did not pass unchallenged . In 1453 the duke of York , who was in power , secured the arrest of Thorpe , the speaker of the commons , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to obtain his release on the ground of privilege . In later reigns also parliament was not able always to maintain its privileges in practice , but the later claim that such privileges existed probably goes hack to the precedents of the reign of Henry IV . As parliament increased its influence in the government , represen-tation came to be more highly valued , and the commons began to demand its regulation . One of the first manifestations of this attitude was the resentment evoked by the interference at elections , by means of which packed parliaments w , ue obtained frequently after 1376 . Early in the reign of Henry IV remedy was sought by laws requiring that the sheriffs ' reports of elections should be certified by some of the voters , and imposing heavy fines on sheriffs who made false returns . In 1430 interference was further guarded against by a statute which restricted the right to vote for knights of the shire to those who pos-sessed freehold estates yielding a profit of forty shillings a year . Pre-viously the elections had taken place at public sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend . In the fifteenth century the nobles were using their retainers to secure the election of their henchmen at the county court . The statute excluded these and other undesirables from the franchise , since the possessor of land which yielded forty shillings clear yearly value in the fifteenth century was a man of moderate wealth . This statute governed the franchise in the counties until 1832 . While the elections in the counties were thus being regulated , the boroughs were left free to settle their own electoral pro-cedure . Much variation resulted in the burghal franchise . In one group of boroughs practically all owners of real estate could vote , 10 in another // all payers of local taxes , in a third freemen , who in the fifteenth century were mainly the members of the gilds , and in a fourth only members of the governing bodies of the towns . But the lack of central control of the right to vote in the boroughs did not mean that the townsmen were notably slower than the rural landowners to recognize the value of participation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth century unrepresented boroughs began to petition the king for the privilege of representation . After 1445 eight boroughs were enfranchised by Henry VI , and more were added in later reigns . The Lancastrian period as a whole was one in which parliament made much progress . It did not acquire many wholly new powers , but it secured from the Lancastrian kings definite recognition of powers already claimed in the fourteenth century . It was a period of the fixa-tion of the powers of parliament . At the same time the experiment proved that parliament was not yet prepared to assume too much re-sponsibility . The evils of the later part of the reign of Henry VI were due mainly to the inability of the government to repress social and political disorders . A powerful parliament could not yet maintain order without the aid of a strong king . Largely for this reason the people acquiesced in the assumption of the crown by the Yorkist dynasty in 1461 . They were ready to pay any price for the peace and order that would enable them to resume the prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could restrain the warring factions of the nobles , maintain order , and give an adequate administration of justice . These things Edward IV attempted to provide with only partial success in the early years of his reign . Such widespread plundering as had marked the recent years of the war was ended , but maintenance and liveries with their attendant evils continued unabated ; plots , riots and disturbances of various sorts were frequent ; justice was still difficult to obtain , though the king attempted to secure its better administration ; and in the north the Lancastrians maintained war until they were decisively defeated in 1464 . Even this victory failed to end the disturbances , for new troubles arose from the estrangement by the king of the earl of Warwick . The latter was the cousin of the king and the wealthiest and the most in-fluential noble of the realm . His initiative and leadership had won the victories which made it possible for Richard of York to claim the throne in 146o , his help had enabled Edward IV to mount the throne , and until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rift between the friends began with the king 's marriage , which took place early in // 1464 . The bride was Lady Elizabeth Grey , a widow with two children . Her father , Richard Woodville , Lord Rivers , was a peer of recent Lan-castrian creation , and her whole connection was Lancastrian . Politically and socially the marriage was so indiscreet that the king kept it secret until the tentative negotiations of Warwick with the king of France for the disposal of Edward 's hand forced him to announce it . The earl was chagrined to find that . he had been allowed to discuss alliances based on the king 's marriage when the king was already married . ' The marriage soon touched him more closely . The new queen had eleven brothers and sisters , whose interests the king promoted . Many of them were married into the families of great nobles , much to Warwick 's displeasure , and the earl soon found that his influence with the king was being lost to the Woodvilles , whom he regarded not only as polit-ical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be-tween the king and the earl was brought to a crisis by a difference of opinion on foreign policy . Burgundy and France were both bidding for England 's alliance . The duke of Burgundy , who controlled the Low Countries and other territories as well as Burgundy , was richer and more powerful than many contemporary kings . To Louis XI , the astute and wily king of France , he appeared to be a menace to France , and the rivalry between the two was becoming intense . At the beginning of Edward 's reign Louis XI had given open support to the cause of his kinswoman , Mar-garet of Anjou . He soon discovered that he had supported the losing side , and after 1464 he sought the alliance of Edward IV . Warwick , who saw in the alliance security from the danger of Lancastrian attacks and the general advantage of Edward IV and England , advocated it warmly . The traditional spirit of hostility toward France was still alive in England , however , and England 's principal trade was still with Flanders , now controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentful of Warwick 's tutelage . In 1467 he accepted the offer of an alliance to be cemented by the marriage of his sister Margaret to Charles the Bold , duke of Burgundy , and to result in a joint attack on France by Burgundy and England . To Warwick this was the last straw . On receipt of the news he left court and retired to his estates , where he began to nurse plans for the recovery of his power . During 1468 Edward IV was kept busy with the repression of Lancastrian plots , stirred up largely by Louis XI , and Warwick was left free to mature his project . In 1469 his followers rose in rebellion . Edward IV was taken completely by surprise . A large group of his supporters was defeated , some of the Woodvilles were // executed , and he was captured . Warwick was actuated only by the de-sire to recover his lost influence over the king . He had no dealings with the Lancastrians , but , to the contrary , repressed a Lancastrian uprising which took place contemporaneously with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to release the king , who began at once to plot the overthrow of the earl . Edward found that Warwick was not supported by all of the York-ists , and he soon gathered a sufficient force to proclaim the earl a traitor and to put him to flight . Warwick then allied himself with Margaret of Anjou , secured the support of Louis XI , and started a Lancastrian rebellion which forced Edward IV to seek safety in Bur-gundy . Again Warwick had made a king . For a few months in 1470 and 1471 Henry VI reigned while Warwick ruled . His tenure of power was brief . Edward obtained the help of Burgundy , and he was secretly assured of the support of many Yorkists who nominally followed War-wick . Most important of these was the king 's own brother , the duke of Clarence , who , having deserted Edward for Warwick , was now ready to betray the earl . The issue was decided at Barnet , where Ed-ward won a complete victory and the king-maker lost his life . In a later battle the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured . Shortly afterward Henry died in the Tower of London . The line of Lancaster was ended , the male line of the Beauforts was also extinct , and the only surviving representative of the Lancastrian claim was Henry Tudor , earl of Richmond , a boy of fourteen , whose mother was a Beaufort . His title was too remote to be a menace . Edward IV was thus freed not only from the domination of Warwick but also from the danger of Lancastrian revolt . The remaining years of Edward 's reign were comparatively peace-ful . In 1475 he transported a large army to France , intending to make war upon Louis XI . Finding his ally , the duke of Burgundy , too fully engaged with warfare on the German side of his dominions to render any efficient aid on the French side , he accepted the offer of Louis XI to pay a lump sum and an annual pension for peace . Later a short war with Scotland conducted by his brother , the duke of Gloucester , netted the recovery of Berwick . These expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which followed a quieter course than at any time since 1450 . Edward 's security upon the throne , the popu-larity won for him by his geniality , and the general desire for peace and order gave him the opportunity to wield great power . His rule was strong by contrast with what had gone before , though it was not tyran-nical . He indulged in occasional high-handed acts , as when he secured // 1romn parliament the attainder of his brother Clarence , who perished in the Tower , men knew not how , though tradition soon had it that he was drowned in a butt of malmsey . But " false , fleeting , perjur 'd Clar-ence " deserved no better fate , and Edward 's few despotic acts generally bad no significant effect upon the interests of the mass of his subjects . To them his rule was a boon . Though he did not suppress disorder and violence entirely , he fostered the commercial interests of his people and maintained a better administration of justice than had been known for years . The extent of the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an examination of his relations with the council and with parlia-inent . Under Edward IV the council ceased to be the master of the king and became his servant . Parliament had no control whatever over its composition . Few great lords , other than those who held offices of state , were appointed to it , and the number of the members of lesser estate was increased . The official element dominated the council , and the king dominated his officials . The council did not cease to be an advisory body , but the king consulted it less and was less bound by its decisions when he asked for them . As an administrative and a judi-cial organ , on the other hand , it become more active ; but here also it became more dependent upon the king , acting primarily as an instrument to secure the better execution of the royal will . During the course of the fifteenth century the jurisdiction of the council was more clearly defined in custom and practice . Throughout much of the century parliament continued to display jealousy of the judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the at-tempts to limit its vague field of jurisdiction were ineffective . In the reign of Henry VI , moreover , parliament gave up the effort to deal with all the petitions of individuals , and at the close of each session turned over the unanswered petitions to the council . This tended to bring the greater part of the residual jurisdiction of first instance to the council . Although parliament did not cease entirely to hear civil suits in first instance , its jurisdiction in practice became mainly appellate , ex-cept impeachments and the trial of peers . By this time , however , the petitions were more than the council could handle . It in turn gave over its unanswered petitions to the court of chancery . This court , which exercised a wide field of jurisdiction in equity , had become practically independent of the council . Nearly all of the petitions presented to the council which involved judicial procedure on the civil side were transferred to it , unless they were referred to the courts of common law . The council , in other words , allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of chancery . Original cases on the criminal side , which for some reason the courts of common law could not handle , occupied most of the time which the council devoted to judicial business . Since the council ordinarily sat in a chamber of the palace which had a starred ceiling , the council , when it exercised this jurisdiction , came to be called commonly the court of star chamber . With the growing disorder of the fifteenth century such cases became increasingly frequent . The breakdown of the system of trial by jury caused many petitions to the council for justice which could not be had in ? the courts of common law . The growth of anarchy forced parliament to recognize the need of some such jurisdiction , and in 1453 it gave its sanction to the exercise by the council of this jurisdiction in cases of riot and other crimes of violence typical of the disorder of the period . By this time , however , the council was experiencing the inertia common to the other branches of the government , and it failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judicial power of the council gradually revived . After 1468 cases of riot and violence were brought before it in steadily increasing numbers . But the council hesitated to inflict adequate penalties on the great lords brought before it . The council in star chamber was still a defective instrument for the suppression of maintenance and livery with their attendant evils . Of parliament Edward IV rendered himself more independent than the Lancastrian kings had been . In some instances he influenced the elections and secured houses of commons which were favorably disposed toward him , and the commons during his reign exercised much less influence upon legislation than formerly . His greater freedom from parliamentary control , however , depended mainly upon the infrequency with which parliament met . Only six parliaments assembled during his reign , and with one exception their sessions were short . He was able to do without frequent parliaments because he secured revenues from other sources than parliamentary grant . His first parliament provided for the resumption of royal lands which Lancastrian kings had alienated and for the forfeiture of the lands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poundage " and other customs revenues for life . Only four of his parliaments granted him direct taxation . Edward IV used forced loans to some extent , as Henry // VI had done , but he generally paid his debts . His most important non-parliamentary revenue came from forced gifts called benevolences . These Edward IV sought from his wealthier subjects with great success . A foreign observer thus described his methods : " I have frequently seen our neighbours here who were summoned before the king , and when they went they looked as if they were going to the gallows ; when they returned they were joyful , saying that they had spoken to the king and he had spoken to them so benignly that they did not regret the money they had paid . From what I have heard , the king adopted this method : when anyone went before him he gave him a welcome as if he had known him always ; after some time he asked him what he could pay of his free will towards this expedition ; if the man offered something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the name and the amount ; if the king thought otherwise , he told him such a one who is poorer than you , has paid so much ; you , who are richer , can easily pay more , ' and thus by fair words he brought him up to the mark . ' But behind the affability of the king lurked the unspoken threat of the royal displeasure , which few cared to incur . Edward de-rived much profit from the courts by using them to extract heavy fines for small breaches of the law . He also became a trader , employing many ships and deriving considerable profit from his mercantile ventures . During the later years of his reign the pension which he received from the king of France was an important item of revenue . From these sources he accumulated so large a fortune that with the practice of thrift he was able not only to run the government for many years of peace without parliamentary grant , but also , what was still more re-markable , to pay the wages of an army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which rested the power of parliament to limit the king , was badly impaired in the days of Edward IV . With the king it was probably a mere policy of financial expediency . But while no conscious institutional change may have been intended , the balance of constitutional power shifted decisively in favor of the king . Edward IV left as his heir a boy of twelve named Edward . The reign of the young king opened with a struggle for the regency be-tween the queen-mother representing the Woodville faction , and Richard of Gloucester , the brother of Edward IV . The latter had been named protector by the deceased king , but the Woodvilles , who had the young king in their keeping , seem to have plotted to get control of the government . By treachery Richard seized and imprisoned the ma28o History of England ternal relatives of Edward V who had the boy in their charge , obtained possession of the king 's person , and secured acknowledgment as pro-tector . Not satisfied with that position , he began to conspire with the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having won the support of the more unscrupulous , he secured the execution or imprisonment of his chief opponents . He then advanced the absurd claim that the children of Edward IV were illegitimate , and secured acknowledgment as king from an irregularly constituted parliament filled with his supporters . Shocking as these deeds were , they might possibly have passed muster in that age of bloodshed and violence if he had not proceeded to extinguish the male line of Edward IV by having Edward V and his brother smothered in the Tower . Even the callousness produced by the Wars of the Roses could not view that deed with apathy . Many of the Yorkists found themselves united with the Lancastrians in secret opposition to Richard III . If the tyrant was to be overthrown , someone had to be put in his place . The opposition quickly focused upon Henry Tudor . His claims to the throne were remote , but he was nevertheless the nearest male representative of the Lancastrian line . His leadership was made acceptable to the discon-tented Yorkists by his projected marriage to Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis came , Henry Tudor was living in Brittany , where he had found refuge for many years . Before he could be notified and given time to mature his plans , a rebellion which broke out prema-turely in 1484 was quelled by Richard III . Subsequently Henry secured troops and money from the king of France , and , when he finally crossed the Channel in 1485 , his followers in England were better prepared for the occasion . The two armies met on Bosworth Field , where Rich-ard III was slain and Henry won a complete victory . He promptly secured parliamentary ratification of his occupation of the throne , and the rule of the house of Tudor was begun . CHAPTER XVI THE BEGINNINGS OF THE MODERN ERA WITH the reign of Henry VII ( 1485-1509 ) we approach the modern era . The medieval epoch in English history is generally said to end at 1485 . From an historical point of view this division is purely arbitrary . The continuous decay of old institutions and formation of new ones render it impossible to fix a date when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . In 1485 many medieval institutions and conceptions were already dead , but many others survived . This year is chosen because it marks the beginning of the rule of the Tudors under whom the transition from medieval to modern was accomplished . When Henry VII ascended the throne , much in England was medieval and little was modern ; when Elizabeth ended the line of Tudor in 1603 the proportion had been reversed . The events of the reign of Elizabeth are more easily translated into terms readily comprehended in the twentieth century than are those of the reign of Henry VII . Yet the transition was sufficiently well under way in the time of Henry VII to make his reign the convenient pivot on which to hinge the story of the transition . The position of Henry VII on the throne was similar in many ways to that occupied by Henry IV . After his victory at Bosworth Henry Tudor summoned parliament and placed before it a claim to the throne based on the rights of conquest and heredity . Parliament granted him the crown , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , did not exist . Henry 's claim descended through his mother from John of Gaunt , and if it was admitted that the title to the throne descended through a woman , several descendants of Lionel , the third son of Edward III , had a better claim than Henry Tudor . His title rested solely on parliamentary grant and the decision of war . Because his position on the throne was so insecure , it became his ruling ambition , as it had been that of Henry IV , to place his dynasty upon a firm foundation . Nearly all of his significant policies may be traced back to that motive . Popular support was essential . To win it he recognized , as Henry IV had done , that he must give the English people what they wanted . But their desires in 1485 were different from what they had been in 1399 . They now needed an end of the dynastic 282 // quarrels that had disturbed the peace of England since the middle of the fifteenth century , fostering care and protection for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder . These things Henry VII endeavored to provide . As a further prop to his position he sought to win recognition of his house from foreign rulers , who were by now generally disposed to fish in the troubled sea of England 's dynastic waters . To end the dynastic troubles Henry 's first step was to marry Eliza-beth , the eldest daughter of Edward IV , who was the most direct descendant from Lionel . When she bore Henry a son , in whose person were united the claims of Lancaster and York , Henry 's position on the throne was strengthened . Nevertheless , he had to meet the attempts of several aspirants for the throne who were supported by discontented Yorkists and sometimes had the help of foreign rulers . The first serious rebellion was led by an impostor . Lambert Simnel , who had good manners and grace of carriage though he was the son of an artisan , was coached by Yorkist leaders to impersonate a member of the house of York descended from Lionel . When he was finally educated in de-meanor , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many Irish leaders pledged themselves to his cause , and he also had the support of Margaret , the sister of Edward IV and dowager duchess of Burgundy , whose court had become the refuge of discon-tented Yorkists . In 1487 he landed in England with an army of 8,000 made up of German mercenaries supplied by Margaret , and of Irish-men . In the short but stubbornly contested battle of Stoke the conspira-tors were defeated and Simnel was captured . Henry , considering him beneath the dignity of execution , made him a scullion in the royal kitchen , but while he might make merry over the rebellion , it had been a serious menace . Though this rebellion did not end the conspiracies of the Yorkists , it temporarily halted their activities , leaving the king free to give his attention to foreign affairs . Acknowledgment of the equality of his house by the ruling dynasties of Europe was what he particularly de-sired . His purpose could best be accomplished by a marriage alliance , and so Henry began to seek a marriage for Arthur , his eldest-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella had created a unified state . The Spanish sovereigns saw in Henry 's offer an opportunity to further a project which they entertained against France . They desired to recover two Spanish provinces located in the eastern // Pyrenees , which had fallen into the hands of Louis XI , ' but they were too occupied with a war against the Moors in the south to undertake the project unaided . They demanded of Henry , therefore , that he should invade the north of France while they attacked in the south . It was a high price to pay for the alliance , for peace and economy were neces-sary for the restoration of order within England . But the marriage alliance was so essential for the welfare of the house of Tudor that Henry took the risk . In 1489 he signed the Treaty of Medina del Campo , agreeing to attack France in return for the marriage alliance . The war with France was of brief duration . In 1489 Henry sent troops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-vasion , and others to assist Maximilian , heir of the king of Germany2 and guardian of his son 's rights in Burgundy , against whom the Flem-ings were rebelling with the aid of the French . Maximilian changed sides with a characteristic fickleness that was typical of the diplomacy of the age , and the duchess made peace with France . Left in the lurch , Henry extricated himself by brilliant diplomacy . Charles VIII , the king of France , had so set his heart upon an invasion of Italy that he was ready to pay a high price for the peace which would enable him to depart . In 1492 he made the Treaty of Etaples , wherein he agreed to pay Henry a large indemnity to withdraw his army from France . A later treaty gave Spain possession of the contested provinces in the south . For Henry it was a notable diplomatic triumph . He obtained the marriage alliance , did little fighting , and secured an advantageous peace that covered his expenses . His European success came just in time to be of aid against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Perkin Warbeck , a Flemish apprentice of goodly outward mien , and persuaded him to impersonate an heir of the house of York . The support of Charles VIII was speedily secured . By the Treaty of Etaples , however , the French king agreed not to harbor pretenders to the English throne , and Perkin was forced to take refuge with Margaret of Burgundy . There he re-ceived the support of Maximilian , who in 1493 became king of Ger-many , and of Philip , Maximilian 's son , who was the duke of Burgundy . He had already been acknowledged by the king of Scotland . Perkin thus became the center for the union of all of Henry 's enemies . In 1495 , when Perkin finally got an expedition under way with ships and men furnished principally by Maximilian , the English shore was so vigorously defended that he sailed on to Ireland . Subsequently Henry The Beginnings of the Modern Era X85 deprived him of most of his foreign support . Charles VIII met with such surprising success in Italy that in 1495 the League of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pope , Maximilian , and Spain united to drive him from Italy and keep him out . For the latter pur-pose they desired the alliance of Henry . Maximilian accordingly made peace with the English king . In return Henry agreed to do little more than not to help France . This diplomatic victory deprived Perkin of all foreign aid except from Scotland . In 1496 a Scottish invasion of Eng-land failed , but in the next year internal disorder in England gave Per-kin a new chance . The collection of a tax in Cornwall started a rebellion joined by 15,000 men . The king of Scotland invaded the north and sent Perkin to land in Cornwall . It was " a dangerous triplicity to a mon-archy , " says Bacon , " to have the arms of a foreigner , the discontents of subjects and the title of a pretender to meet . " 3 The movements failed to come simultaneously , however . The rising in Cornwall was sup-pressed and King James was driven back across the border before Perkin landed in England , where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies which Henry had fol-lowed so long . He had won recognition from foreign powers , repelled foreign invasion , subdued internal rebellion , and removed the threat to his position on the throne which had caused him keen anxiety for many years . The ambassador of Milan , reporting to his government at this time , wrote : " This present state is most stable , even for the king 's descendants , since there is no one who aspires to the Crown , " and the Spanish ambassador reported : " Henry is rich , has established good order in England , and keeps the people in such subjection as has never been the case before . " 4 It was the turning point in his reign . He never again had to face a serious plot against the throne . Conspiracies still cropped out occasionally , but they received little support and never came to a head . Henry succeeded in making the position of his house secure . Meanwhile Henry insured peace with Scotland by the marriage of his daughter Margaret to James of Scotland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England and Scotland . In 1503 the Spanish alliance was renewed by a treaty which arranged for the marriage of Katherine of Aragon , the daughter of Ferdinand and Isa-bella , whom the premature death of Arthur had rendered a widow , to his brother Henry , who was now the heir to the throne . For the re-maining years of his reign Henry 's friendship was generally sought // by European powers without significant diplomatic result . Henry 's foreign policy as a whole was highly successful . He secured ample recognition of the Tudor dynasty and notably increased England 's prestige in European politics . In large measure Henry 's foreign policy was dominated by the exigencies of diplomatic situations created by the pretenders . Another of Henry 's policies affected by the pretenders was that which he pur-sued with regard to Ireland . Since the time of John no English king except Richard II had gone to Ireland , and for the most part English kings had neglected it . They made sporadic attempts co keep control of the English in Ireland , which were neither prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pale had been shrinking . Many of the Anglo-Irish , moreover , sank their civilization to the level of that of the native Irish , who remained in the sixteenth century , as they had been in the twelfth , a half-savage people , organized in turbulent clans , practically impossible to control . The English in Ireland who retained their English traditions were generally hostile to the native Irish , but they had become impatient of English control and were likely to oppose any English government which attempted to regulate their affairs too closely . Henry had to face the Irish difficulty because the majority of the Anglo-Irish were Yorkist , and Ireland became the favorite hatchery of Yorkist plots . The government of Ireland was given nominally to an English viceroy , who never went near Ireland . Such government as existed in Ireland was administered by a lord deputy , who was usually a member of the Anglo-Irish community within the Pale . For a long time the award of this office had been mixed up with a family feud , which for generations had been waged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pale . For some years before Henry 's accession the earls of Kildare , who were heads of the victorious family , had been lord deputies . Since the family was Yorkist , Henry deprived the earl of his deputy ship , and in 1494 sent Sir Edward Poy-nings , an Englishman , to take his place . Sir Edward secured from the Irish parliament the enactment of several statutes for the better govern-ance of Ireland , usually designated as Poynings ' Acts . One required that before a parliament assembled in Ireland , the lord deputy and the Irish council should notify the king of the proposed agenda . The parliament could be held only if the king consented , and it could trans-act only such business as the king approved . Another established in Ireland the laws enacted by the English parliament previous to 1495 . This legislation made the control of the king over Ireland closer . The // new deputy , however , did not stop the quarrels of the rival families . In 1497 , when the danger of Yorkist plots was removed , Kildare was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain order . Henry VII not only established his house but he also won for it the loyal support of a wealthy and influential class in the nation by his commercial policy . During the fifteenth century the export of woolens , the principal article produced by English manufacturers , increased in relation to the export of wool , the staple raw product of foreign trade . English foreign commerce was ceasing to be passive and was becoming active . Some English merchants were doing business on a sufficiently large scale to enable them to build their own ships and market their own wares , and the number of English merchants engaged in foreign trade mounted steadily . They carried on their business under many risks and difficulties , to obviate which they sought the help of the central government . During most of the century the seas about England were infested by pirates , who together with England 's enemies made even the shores and harbors of England unsafe . When English mer-chants penetrated new markets , they were restricted by the protective measures of the native merchants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had to compete with foreign merchants who were well established in control of large branches of English trade . Italian cities handled most of the trade between England and the Medi-terranean , which since the Hundred Years ' War had gone largely by sea through the Strait of Gibraltar . The Hanseatic League dominated the trade of the Baltic and of part of the North Sea . These foreigners , who were settled in England with special privileges , tried to exclude Eng-lish merchants from the fields whence they came . The need of aid from the central government was becoming the more pressing because trade was shifting from an intermunicipal to an international basis . The recent centralization of France , Spain , Burgundy , and other states made it almost essential for central governments to treat together con-cerning the commercial rights and privileges of their nationals . The municipal basis of trade had not disappeared entirely , but individual English towns could no longer arrange their commercial relations with individual towns of Flanders as profitably as their king could settle them with the duke of Burgundy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compara-tively small . Under the pressure of parliament the Lancastrians per-mitted the expansion of the restrictions imposed in the later years of the fourteenth century on foreign merchants trading in England . In general these were merely the application on a national scale of regulations which towns and gilds had long enforced locally . Laws required from foreign merchants heavier tolls , limited the duration of their stay in the country , prohibited them from dealings with other aliens , excluded them from the retail trade , and denied them permanent residence in England . Such legislation was difficult of enforcement , and the attempts to enforce it were never consistently maintained for any long period . The most important groups of foreigners , moreover , such as the Hansards , were exempted by their privileges from the greater part of these restrictions . English merchants trading abroad received even less help . Commercial treaties were negotiated with several powers . Merchants trading to the Baltic and to Flanders secured from Henry IV the right to organize associations for mutual protection . They elected governors who could arrange disputes between English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners , and to some extent regulate locally the English trade in these parts . Such groups were often styled Merchant Adventurers , and their organization was analogous to that of the Merchants of the Staple , who continued to flourish at Calais . From time to time the Hansards were threatened with loss of privileges in England if they did not make concessions to English traders in the Baltic ; but at the end of the period the position of the Hansards in England was little impaired , while the trade of English merchants in the Baltic had declined so greatly that the groups of Merchant Adventurers trading there had ceased to exist and the Merchant Adventurers trading to Flanders constituted the only association left with the name . Henry VII was fully awake to the needs of English merchants . He wanted the support of the rich and powerful mercantile class for his dynasty , and he saw the wisdom of expanding English commerce in order to secure the national strength which would render England influential in the international relationships just struggling into existence . Consequently he conceived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed the principle of the obsolete Navigation Act of Richard II . He took every opportunity to negotiate favorable commercial treaties . From foreign merchants who had privileges in England he demanded reciprocal privileges for English merchants trading abroad . So strong was his international position in the latter half of his reign that his commercial negotiations and policies were highly successful . They gave English merchants decided advantag ? s in such branches of trade as the Flemish , enabled them to break some part of the monopolies of trade previously maintained by // the Hanseatic League and Venice , and reduced the privileges of the Hanseatic League in England . The importance of trading companies as agencies for the expansion of English foreign commerce Henry recognized fully . The central gov-ernment as yet gave English merchants trading abroad little protection against pirates , injuries inflicted upon them by foreigners , and re-strictions imposed upon them by foreign governments . Only by or-ganization among themselves could English merchants meet foreign competition and protect themselves against piratical attack and foreign commercial jealousies . To perform these functions successfully , such organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government could confer upon them . The Stap-lers , who had long possessed such privileges and powers from the government , occupied an established position which Henry took pains to preserve . The Merchant Adventurers , who had their mart at Ant-werp and dealt chiefly in woolens , received from him much fostering care and protection . They were organized as a regulated company . Any English merchant gained entrance by payment of a fee . The members elected officials who protected members of the company trading in Flanders , excluded from the trade English merchants who did not belong to the company , and laid down rules which each member of the company had to observe in the transaction of his business . They regulated , for example , such things as the price of goods and the amount one merchant could sell . Each member of the company , however , made his own private ventures . Because Henry saw that the expansion of the growing trade in cloth was to the interest of England , he imposed a heavy duty on exported wool and a light duty on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merchant Adventurers . He allowed the company to reorganize and gave it increased and bet-ter-defined powers of regulating the trade . The Merchant Adventurers justified Henry 's judgment by winning much of the English foreign trade that had previously been in the hands of foreigners . Thus Henry consistently attempted to further the interests of the new mercantile class . He favored the English merchant against the alien in England and at every point he tried to assist Englishmen in penetrating new fields of commercial activity . His policy was an im-mediate success . An Italian resident in England commended Henry for having made England rich by the support he accorded commerce . His work was even more important for the future because he laid down the lines of policy followed by later Tudors . Henry 's most important industrial legislation had to do with the // craft gilds . They had passed the zenith of their influence and were beginning to be supplanted by the domestic system . Industrial organiza-tion in England has passed through four phases . First came the family or household system where work is carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household . Then followed the craft gild . A master employs a few workmen in his own house or shop to produce goods for sale , usually directly to the consumer . Organization in gilds t was superseded by the domestic system , under which work is carried 1 on by families in their homes or by masters in their shops , but it is no longer done with economic independence . The worker often receives his raw materials from a merchant capitalist and always sells to him . A middleman is introduced between the actual producer and the con-sumer . Last of all appears the factory system , still in vogue , where workmen are gathered in large groups under the direct control of the capitalistic employer . These stages are neither rigidly distinct nor ex-clusive , but during the second half of the fifteenth century there was a perceptible drift away from the gild organization toward the domestic system . The causes were many . Most important , perhaps , was the capi-talistic control of the gilds . As the masters acquired wealth , they made the terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeyman to become a master . The workmen in some industries were already revolting against the exclusiveness of the masters in the fourteenth century , and in the fifteenth some of them began to migrate to the rural districts , where they could carry on work unrestricted by the regulations of the gild . This movement was made possible by the appearance of capitalistic merchants who could supply the workers with raw materials and take the finished products , paying the workers for their labor . In the woolen industry particularly this transformation was well developed by the time of Henry VII . Another cause of the decline of the gilds was their local selfishness . Their attempt to ex-clude all competition in their immediate localities caused stronger opposition , as the shift of commerce from an intermunicipal to an in-ternational basis made it more apparent that the local privileges of the gilds often conflicted with the national interest . Before 1485 the central government began to regulate the craft gilds in some details , and Henry expanded this control . In 1504 it was enacted that no ordinance subsequently decreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by certain of the king 's judges or ministers . Thus he made the future policy of the gilds subordinate in some measure to the central government and assisted the decline already begun . In the field of agriculture Henry 's attempts at regulation had little // effect . Agrarian organization was well on the road to a revolution being wrought by the practice of enclosures . During the fifteenth cen-tury this practice became common . Landlords or large tenant farmers were throwing together the small tenements on their lands and con-verting the whole into one large area of tillage or sheep pasture . The latter was the more common because the increasing demand for wool was making it more profitable to raise sheep than grain . This change was disastrous for the small tenants who were ejected from their hold-ings . They found it extremely difficult to settle again because the care of sheep required less labor per acre than the cultivation of the soil , and hence the demand for rural labor was falling off coincidently with the ejections . By the time of Henry VII the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which became rife in later reigns . Parliament imposed restrictions on the practice of enclosures without success . Enclosures were the result of a natural eco-nomic development which legislation proved powerless to stop . Although Henry VII failed in this one particular , both external commerce and internal industry waxed prosperous during his reign . His regulative legislation , however , would have been without effect , had he not also ended internal disorder . The restoration of law and order was the most important of Henry 's tasks . To it he devoted so much attention that he has been dubbed the Big Policeman . One of the principal forces that had made for disorder was the nobility . The nobles had been the leaders in the Wars of the Roses , and it was they , with their bands of retainers , who constantly menaced the orderly administration of law and justice . The wars , however , had left them weak . Their numbers had not been greatly decreased , but " the tallest heads were gone . " ' None arose to take the place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their estates had shrunk in many cases and their wealth was diminished . The nobles were not in a position to offer strong opposition to a king whose deter-mination to rule them with a heavy hand commanded the approval of the influential middle class . From the first Henry excluded the nobles from a share of political power . The offices of state and household were given mainly to men drawn from the middle class , whose interests were so dependent on those of the king that they served him faithfully . They also constituted the influential element in the council . Men of this stamp , who could not oppose the royal will with impunity , were selected by Henry as // the fitting agents of the strong government which he was engaged in building . The position of the nobles who attended the royal person was reduced to that of courtiers . In the house of lords Henry worked his will through the spiritual lords , among whom were several of his former supporters . The upper house appears never to have opposed the royal will . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the nobility politically weak , it was easier to enforce against them the many laws enacted to secure the preservation of the peace . This legislation applied to all classes of society , but , since the nobles had been the chief promoters of discord , it hit them the hardest . At his first parliament the new king forced the lords to take an oath against maintenance and livery . Of course the evil did not disappear immediately . When Henry once visited the earl of Oxford , he found him keeping a band of retainers . The earl 's hospitality did not bar Henry from exacting punishment . In farewell he said : " My lord , I thank you for my good cheer , but I may not endure to have my laws broken in my sight ; my attorney must speak with you . " The speech cost Oxford 4 io , 000 c Despite such exceptions , the bands of retainers gradually disappeared until they reached the vanishing point . Another obstacle was the maladministration of justice . Trial by jury seems frequently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and juries that were not bribed were overawed . Frequently criminals were not apprehended and never came before a court . Numerous acts aimed to eradicate these evils . Those accused of murder were to be brought before a court within a year ; townships which failed to appre-hend a murderer were . fined ; and coroners who held an inquest were paid for it , while those who failed to hold one were fined . Juries were dealt with severely . From a civil jury appeal could be had to a special jury of twenty-four . If the second jury reversed the first , each member of the first jury was fined . If a criminal jury acquitted an accused person wrongfully , the council could review its verdict and inflict penalties upon the jurors . The most notable of Henry 's judicial reforms was his use of the court of star chamber . This court was not created by him . It was simply the council exercising jurisdiction which it had long possessed . ' His // innovation was to employ the court in a vigorous campaign to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bribery of juries , and similar deeds of violence which were the sources of the prevalent disorder . The court was better adapted to the purpose than were the courts of common law which had failed so long and so lamentably to punish adequately those guilty of such offenses . Its procedure was more elastic , and it could use manv methods of obtain-ing the necessary evidence which were denied to the courts of common law . It tried cases without a jury , and even the most influential could not hope to bribe or intimidate it . The rigorous enforcement of justice through the agency of this court gradually compelled the powerful law-breakers to desist from those practices which had imperiled the rights of the king 's subjects and set at defiance the royal authority throughout the fifteenth century . As employed by Henry VII , the court of star chamber was a boon to his people . Wrapped in this court was a threat to popular liberties , because it tried cases without a- jury and , on account of its personnel , was more amenable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not until the abuse of the court by the Stuarts did it acquire that ill-favored repute which has made it synonymous with tyranny ; it served Henry as the most effective instrument at his disposal for the restoration of law and order . Although Henry did not abuse the court of star chamber , it was his intention nevertheless to rear a strong monarchy . This appears most clearly in his relations with parliament . After the early hectic years of his reign , Henry followed the example of Edward IV and did without parliament . Of the seven parliaments which he summoned , six sat before 1497 . Financial independence of parliamentary grant gave him freedom from parliamentary control . This he secured in far greater measure than Edward IV . He soon discovered that grants of taxation from parliament not only subjected him to parliamentary checks but also endangered his popularity . On two occasions the levy of taxes granted by parliament provoked local rebellions . From his seven par-liaments , therefore , he sought but five grants of direct taxation . The revenues which he enjoyed practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward IV , but their yield was greater . His first parliament authorized the resumption of crown lands which had been alienated since 1455 and gave him tonnage and poundage for life . The increase of foreign commerce rendered the latter a fruit294 History of England ful source of supply . Henry also raised benevolences , despite their prohibition by the parliament of 1484 . In the later years of his reign he employed the criminal law as a means of extortion , prosecuting under obsolete laws or false charges , and obtaining fines sometimes through conviction by packed juries . All of these sources were insuffi-cient to render independent of parliamentary grant a king who in-dulged in wars or in lavish expenditures , but Henry practiced economy with a rigidity that gave him the reputation of a miser and accumulated a large surplus above his needs . When parliament met , the king usually succeeded in managing it . This was easier in the sixteenth century than it would be in the twentieth , because the lack of easy means of communicaticn made it difficult for any common public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely secure the opinions of their constituents on measures presented to them in the course of the session , they came to parliament with no common purpose , and the shortness of the sessions hindered the formation of an esprit de cords after the house had met . Under these conditions the speaker became an instrument of management , and the king generally secured the election to the office of a member of his council , who would expound the royal views . Parliament was the more amenable , because Henry so mani-festly ruled in the interest of the middle class which constituted the backbone of the house of commons . Such acts as that providing for the trial of certain classes of cases without indictment by jury mani-festly threatened the popular liberties ; but they were of obvious and immediate practical benefit to the king 's subjects . It is indicative of the extent of the royal control that the greater and more important part of the legislation of the reign originated with the king and his officials , though the commons did not cease to initiate legislation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal authority . He gave the English nation what it most desired . At his death the new dynasty was securely established on the throne with a title undis-puted at home and " safeguarded from external attack by a series of alliances with foreign powers , " ' the important and growing commer-cial interests had received much encouragement , peace and order had been restored , and the realm was free from the danger of civil disturb-ance . In the process " England became the prize of that Tudor dynasty which had brought her deliverance . " 10 De jure the constitution had been changed but little , but de facto the king was far more powerful . // The council placed no check on his will , parliament was not a serious obstacle , and the administration of justice could be controlled or per-verted to suit his ends , if needs be . Henry 's people were not unaware of the increase in the royal authority , but they acquiesced because the parliamentary experience of the fifteenth century had made it evident that the only road to law and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Henry increased his power worked to the advantage of his subjects . Henry 's personal ambitions coincided with the popular interests . Henry , moreover , used his power wisely . He was rarely guilty of a wanton or capricious act , and he displayed real solicitude for the welfare of his people . Furthermore , the extent of his power was somewhat concealed from the popular view because the outward form of the constitution underwent so little change . Thus Henry laid the foundation of the strong monarchy which was charac-teristic of the Tudors , and secured for it the popularity on which it rested . The reign of Henry VII was manifestly a period of great changes . The alteration in the character of the government , the remarkable expansion of commerce , the agrarian revolution , and the decay of the gilds were signs of a vast transformation that was in the making . An other movement which assumed importance in his reign , though it began before and continued after , was the Renaissance . It began with a renewed interest in classical antiquity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The study of classical literature was not new , but the spirit with which men approached its study was new . They sought the truth . They soon developed a critical faculty and cast aside the trammels of authority which had restricted the speculative thought of the schoolmen . They applied their new ideas to actual life and began to act upon them . Literature and learning were the first to feel the impulse , but eventually art , architecture , politics , religion , and every other field of human endeavor were affected . The most significant aspect of the new spirit was its individualism . This did not originate solely in the revival of classical antiquity , but the revival strengthened the concept , for individualism is writ large in the classics . The right of the individual to think and act for himself inde-pendently , a concept alien to the point of view of the average medieval man , became the watchword of students of the new type ( humanists ) , and from them spread gradually but widely to the rank and file . The Renaissance has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In England the earliest trace of the Renaissance is found in Chaucer , who was infl.uenc ? d in some measure by the pioneers of the movement // in Italy . It proved to be merely a fleeting impression . During the fif-teenth century English literature fell from the high pinnacle where Chaucer placed it . Poetry continued to be written in large quantities , but it consisted for the most part of poor and feeble imitations of Chaucer 's work . Prose fared somewhat better . " The thing to be remem-bered for the moment is that the number of prose-writers increases . They write more abundantly than formerly ; they translate old treatises ; they unveil the mysteries of hunting , fishing , and heraldry ; they com-pose chronicles ; they rid the language of its stiffness . " 11 Prose was being popularized . But not yet was English the language of the learned or prose the form taken by literature designed to entertain . Malory 's Morte d'Arthur is the brilliant exception . Utilitarian , didactic , or devo-tional are adjectives applicable to most of the prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique . Historical writing went the way of the other literary efforts of the century . In this period the monastic annals dwindled away . Walsing-ham continued his work until 1422 . Thereafter few monasteries kept up the historical tradition . Those which did produced only meager annals covering brief periods and containing little of other than local interest . History was being written elsewhere than in the cloister . Latin , moreover , was ceasing to be the language of historians . Two lives of Henry V written in Latin follow classic models and display a de-parture from the medieval annalistic tradition under the influence of the Renaissance , 12 but the greater number and the most important of the histories were written in English . The only chronicle which was continuous and contemporaneous for any large part of the period was an English work called the Britt.13 The number of editions still extant testifies to its popularity . Even more indicative of the changing times is the considerable number of civic chronicles written in English . They were of no great literary merit , but those written in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the fact that through the London Chronicles and the Brut a narrative written in English speech for popular use for the first time takes rank as a leading con-temporary authority . " " The writing of history was passing from the monks to the burghers , and the reading of it from the learned few to // the large middle class . The transition was not productive of the best type of historical work . Nothing in the fifteenth century can compare with the chronicles of William of Malmesbury or of Matthew Paris . But history was being popularized , and the way was being prepared for the historian who would apply the critical spirit of the Renaissance to the materials which he utilized for the narrative intended for popular consumption . With the work of Polydore Vergil that stage was reached . He was an Italian scholar who came to England as collector of the papal revenues in 1501 . After long study of English chronicles he wrote a reasoned history of England " based on evidence selected with some critical judgment of its value . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annalistic form of presentation . Vergil wrote in Latin , which was the language of the humanists , but his book was soon translated , and it became popular . His method in-fluenced many later historians , and in the sixteenth century the historical art attained a higher level . The history of the fifteenth century , however , is told inadequately in contemporary narratives . More than ever it is necessary to rely on other sources . Official and semi-official documents of the types previously described supply the most important information , and legal treatises again become significant.17 Literature other than historical is of less value for history than the literature of the preceding century . But a new source is provided by private letters . These became more common in the fifteenth century than ever before , because so many more people could read and write . They not only give intimate glimpses of every-day life , but they also contain many allusions to public affairs . Private correspondence in those days often supplied the news now gleaned from newspapers . Of the several collections of letters which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructive , and the most amusing are the Paston letters 18 They were written by and to three generations of a Norfolk family which had recently entered the ranks of the gentry . The business and the diversions of the family , the disorder and corruption of the times , the social customs , the political affairs of the kingdom , and other aspects of life infinite in variety pass in a naive review which is as entertaining as it is informative . Probably no other source gives to the reader as vivid an impression of the life of the fifteenth century . The higher learning suffered the same decadence as literature . At // Oxford and Cambridge several new colleges were founded , but the material resources of the universities were generally inadequate for their educational needs . The number of students declined substantially . The higher degrees were rarely taken . The universities were intellec-tually stagnant . With the final suppression of Wycliffism at Oxford early in the fifteenth century , scholasticism lost its life . Syllogistic reasoning became an empty form which merely preserved the dis-torted tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus to intellectual activity . In the fifteenth century , before the Renaissance began to quicken the thought of the universities , England produced neither a great scholar of European fame nor any great leader of European public opinion . Though the intellectual attainment of England in the fifteenth century was on a lower level than in the preceding centuries , educa-tion was becoming more widespread . The sons of noblemen were still generally educated in the castle , as they had been in the heyday of chivalry , but the sons of the country gentry and the sons of prosperous merchants who did not intend to follow the clerical calling were begin-ning to attend the universities in small numbers and the grammar schools in large numbers . The value of an education in school as a training for the ordinary pursuits of life was beginning to be appreci-ated , and education was being secularized . It was ceasing to be a clerical monopoly . New grammar schools were founded ' up and down the land , and in many instances they were maintained by lay authorities . While higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intellectual atmosphere of England in the fifteenth century was so unfavorable to the spirit of the Renaissance that the movement made little impression until the end of the century . Isolated individuals displayed an interest in the new thought which found such brilliant exposition beyond the Alps , but they had small influence upon con-temporary Englishmen . One of the first of these was Duke Humphrey of Gloucester , the brother of Henry V. Selfish and erratic as he was in politics , he was nevertheless the patron of letters and the friend of Oxford , when its slender endowments placed it in sore need . His inter-est in the intellectual movement led him to bring to England Italian humanists to instruct him in the new interpretation of the classics and to arouse in England an interest in the revival of letters . Not long after Duke Humphrey 's death Englishmen began occasionally to go to Italy to study under the leaders of the new movement . They brought back to England the spirit of the literary Renaissance , but they appear to // have done comparatively little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of the humanities on the Italian model . That was the work of the next generation of English scholars who sought the light in Italy . The first who began to teach in England the new views he had acquired in Italy was William Selling , an Oxonian and a monk . He went to Italy in 1464 . After his return he became prior of Canterbury , where he made the monastic school a center of the new learning . Among his pupils , was Thomas Linacre , who went from Canterbury to Oxford and thence to Italy , where he studied the classics and science , taking a degree in medicine . Another Oxonian , William Grocyn , who had been a friend of Linacre 's in college , went to study in Italy contemporaneously . Early in the last decade of the century these two returned to Oxford and began to lecture . They were profound scholars who acquired European reputations , and they practically es-tablished humanism at Oxford . Linacre later became the tutor of the sons of Henry VII and eventually was appointed physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Linacre was John Colet , who , following in the footsteps of his teachers , went to Italy , and returned to teach at Oxford in 1497 . His lectures on the epistles of St. Paul cast aside the allegorical interpretation inherited from the Middle Ages and attempted to arrive at their meaning by putting them in their historical setting . Later he became dean of St. Paul 's in London , where he introduced the new educational methods in a school for boys . Such fame did these teachers acquire that Erasmus , a Dutchman , who later became the most prominent figure in the northern Renaissance , came to Oxford to study with them . The result of the work of these and other lesser scholars was to set up a new conception of scholarship in England . The systems of thought which had been imposed by medieval scholasticism did not give way without a struggle . At Oxford the opponents directed their attack against Greek as the typical study of the new regime , and the " Tro-jans , " as they called themselves , tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Grecians , however , secured the support of the king . Henry VIII had been trained in the new culture , and he was easily persuaded by Sir Thomas More , who held a place of high favor at court , to lend his influence to the suppression of the Trojans . More had studied under Grocyn , Linacre , and Colet , and , though he had never been to Italy , was thoroughly imbued with the scholarly spirit of the Renaissance . His Utopia , in which he pictures an ideal society , so at variance with existing political and social conditions as to be a severe criticism of them , is a typical product of the freedom of thought // inspired by the new learning . Thanks largely to his influence , the Trojans were silenced , and the new studies were enabled to take root at Oxford . Cambridge was still more thoroughly inoculated with the virus of the new system ; and from the universities the movement spread to the schools . The results , if judged by the scholarly product , were disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compara-tively few and the literary product of the classical Renaissance in Eng-land was not of great importance . By the middle of the sixteenth century attendance at the universities had again fallen off perceptibly . But the influence of the Renaissance in England was not primarily literary . The chief result was to provide a new conception of life , and this gradually permeated all classes of society . Though the universities declined , schools continued to increase in number , and the new point of view passed from the schools to the home and the market place . Though derived from classical writings , it was translated into English action , and the actions of men in the Tudor age were long of more importance in other fields than they were in literature . When the new conceptions finally found glorious expression in the literature of Elizabeth 's day , the literature which they produced was distinctively English . The important results of the revival of letters in England were indirect . " The real revelation of the Ancient World was later felt by those who , unable to construe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living figures of antiquity . " 13 What men wrote about life was less affected than the life that men lived . The popularization of the ideal of the Renaissance was promoted by the invention of movable type which made it feasible to print books . The new process appears to have been used first at Mainz in 1454 . It was brought to England by William Caxton , who set up a press at Westminster in 1477 . Within three years he printed editions of thirty different books . Other presses were soon at work , and a stream of literature began to issue from them . The new books , produced cheaply by mechanical means , could be bought by many who had been unable to afford the cost of manuscripts copied laboriously by hand . The printed page brought to the multitude the opportunity to acquire knowledge at just the time when the spirit of the Renaissance was arousing among them the desire for it . Another manifestation of the Renaissance which affected England profoundly was that of geographical discoveries . These were so great // that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to sail the seas in the ninth and tenth centuries , Euro-pean knowledge of the world was hardly wider than that possessed by the Romans . The vikings discovered Iceland and Greenland and in all probability reached America , but the area of commerce was little expanded thereby . Commercial ventures on such a scale were imprac-ticable when fluid capital , the protection of centralized states , and the stimulus of a broad intellectual horizon were lacking . With the later growth of the overland trade with the far east , Europeans began to travel in Asia . Beginning in the thirteenth century some of these travelers wrote accounts of their experiences which were read with keen interest . Marco Polo 's marvelous narrative circulated widely . The popular imagination was thus being kindled when the conquests of the Turks began to cut off the established trade routes between east and west . By this time the trade of Europe with Asia was of great importance . These conditions stimulated men in the fifteenth century to seek for a route to the east by sea . They looked in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of Africa , until in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India by the way of the Cape of Good Hope . Under the auspices of Spain Columbus sailed west and dis-covered America in 1492 . The spirit of discovery was not lacking in England . The earliest ventures were financed ' oy merchants of Bristol who were then among the wealthiest and most progressive merchants of the kingdom . In 1480 two ships sailed to the west in search of land . The expedition failed in its quest , as did several others undertaken in subsequent years ; ' Mt in 1497 John Cabot , an Italian resident of Bristol , was successful in reaching the mainland of North America . Cabot 's expedition was another private venture , though Henry VII granted Cabot a monopoly of trade in any lands he should discover and bestowed on him a pen-sion after the successful issue of the voyage . Cabot 's sons and other merchants of Bristol continued the voyages of exploration for a few years , but , as the barren lands which they had found yielded none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king pro-vided little in the way of financial support , they became discouraged and abandoned the project . Between the explorations of the reign of henry VII and the first expeditions which yielded immediate commer-cial returns , half a century elapsed . But while these early voyages were without immediate tangible results , they did something to fire the imagination of contemporary Englishmen and helped to create the // spirit which later sent Englishmen forth into all parts of the newly discovered world to seize their share of the world 's commerce . Though Englishmen were slow to realize it , the result of the new discoveries was to place England in an entirely new commercial posi-tion . In the course of the sixteenth century the area of commerce ex-panded enormously and the main routes of trade changed entirely . England , which had been in a side eddy of the world 's commerce , was now placed in the center of its main stream . Few Englishmen grasped the full significance of the change immediately , but in the second half of the sixteenth century they began slowly to reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Tudor was laid to rest they had built the enduring foundation of England 's sea power and prepared the way for her colonial empire . CHAPTER XVII HENRY VIII WHEN Henry VIII ascended the throne in 1509 his position was as different from that occupied by his father in 1485 as can well be imagined . Danger from rival claimants to the throne was gone ; the feuds of York and Lancaster were laid to rest ; peace and order had been maintained long enough to produce a tradition of strong gov-ernment ; the rising commercial class was loyal to the house of Tudor ; and no foreign ruler could longer shake the throne by threat of pre-tender and internal rebellion . By his people Henry 's accession was hailed with joy . At eighteen he was open , genial , and generous . In sharp contrast to the old , crafty , and suspicious Henry VII , who was respected and feared , the young king could be loved by his subjects . Ile knew how to share himself with his people , how to be familiar with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificent physique , was fond of sports , and was reputed the best archer in his kingdom . He had all the popularity that today would go to a king who was the best bat in England . Henry VIII also at-tracted to him the learned of his kingdom . From his tutors he had imbibed the spirit of the Renaissance , and his court was the resort of men cultured in the new learning . Henry further increased his popularity by his early acts . He par-doned most of the offenders condemned during the last years of his father 's reign , and canceled the obligations of those who had been forced by extortion to agree to pay the king money . He married Katherine of Aragon , and forthwith his court became the scene of never-ending pageants , revels , and tournaments . The treasure piled up by Henry VII fast disappeared , but the gorgeous display did its part in making Henry VIII beloved of his people . During the first years of his reign the government ran smoothly in the channels fixed by Henry VII . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention at home , Henry VIII turned to foreign affairs . There the new king soon found scope for his youthful ambition to win glory and renown . Europe was still in the throes of the Italian wars which had begun in 1494 . These wars were caused chiefly by the national consolidation of France and Spain at the close of the fifteenth century . As these states began to feel their national strength , they 303 // wanted to try it out , just as most small boys pass through a period when they want to fight all the other small boys in the neighborhood . Italy , divided into several petty states jealous of one another and torn by dissension , offered the obvious field for conquest . Twice France won and lost the southern kingdom of Naples , which finally fell to the crafty Ferdinand of Spain . With Milan in the north the French had better luck . They conquered it in 1499 and were still in possession . The year before Henry VIII came to the throne Italian affairs had passed through one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel and the pieces fell into the League of Cambrai . The pope , Louis XII , king of France , Ferdinand , king of Spain , and Maximilian , the emperor , joined to attack Venice . In 1509 the French defeated the Venetians , and all shared the spoils . The Italians then did what they had often done before . When the foreigner , whom they had invited to enter , had served his turn , they united to drive him out . The pope soon allied with Venice , secured the aid of Ferdinand , who changed sides with no more scruple than he changed his coat , and invited Henry VIII to join the Holy League against France . To Henry the invitation was welcome . He desired to emulate the martial deeds of Edward III and Henry V ; England was no longer forced to refrain by internal disorder ; and France was the traditional enemy when fighting was to be done . In 1511 he satisfied his ambition and displayed his loyalty to the church and his respect for his father-inlaw , Ferdinand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slice of French territory , and his allies allowed this to stand as his ostensible object . What they really wanted was a diversion in France while the French were driven out of Italy and ousted from Spanish Navarre . In 1512 an English army was sent to Spain to cooperate with Spanish troops in southern France . It was so placed as to serve as a screen for the Spanish operations in Navarre and given nothing to do . After several months of inactivity and insubordination the English army returned home without orders from the king . It was " a breach of discipline , unexampled in the military annals of England , " 1 and a severe blow to Henry 's pride . By now it was becoming apparent even to Henry that he was being used by Ferdinand as a cat's-paw . The league 's chestnuts were out of the fire , since the French had been driven out of Italy and the Spanish were in occupation of Navarre , but Henry felt he must retrieve the ridiculous position in which his // army had placed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , won the Battle of the Spurs , and captured two cities . It was a brilliant and futile campaign . While Henry was in France , the Scots , following an ancient tradition , invaded England , only to be overwhelmingly defeated on Flodden Field in a battle that cost their king his life . Ferdinand , meanwhile , had made a truce with France practically withdrawing from the league ; a new pope favored peace ; and Max-imilian soon deserted the alliance . Left in the lurch by his allies , Henry had no recourse but peace . In 1514 a marriage was arranged between Louis XII of France , who was worn out and decrepit at fifty-two , and Henry 's younger sister Mary , aged seventeen . The king of France agreed to pay the English king an annual pension and allowed him to keep Tournai as a pledge for its payment . Henry was well out of a difficult situation . His principal gain was a thorough knowledge , acquired by bitter experience , of the lying and deceitful methods of contemporary diplomacy . The war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolsey to the fore as Henry 's chief minister . By birth Wolsey be-longed to the middle class . He received a good education at Oxford and rose to be one of the chaplains of Henry VII . Under Henry VIII he occupied a position of minor importance in the household , until he became the leading spirit in the organization of the war . He assem-bled troops , provisions , and transports for the largest expedition England had ever made against France , he helped to plan the cam-paign , and the successful negotiation of peace was largely his work . In 1515 Henry VIII made him lord chancellor , he was already arch-bishop of York , and he was soon a cardinal and papal legate . From this time until his downfall in 1529 Wolsey was mainly responsible for the policy of the government . The young king gave his time to tennis and the dance , to music and the chase , while Wolsey worked . f lenry kept his finger on the pulse of public affairs . He was a bright young man , and he managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pleasures . When he gave orders they were obeyed , for Wolsey early discovered that , despite his youth , he " would be obeyed , whosoever spake to the contrary . " But for the most part he left Wolsey a free hand . His confidence was not misplaced . Wolsey was an able statesman . At diplomacy he could beat Ferdinand and Max-imilian at their own game . When he wanted to lie on a grander scale than usual , he could speak " as it becomes a cardinal , on the honor of the cardinalate . " He had one great fault . As his power grew , so did his pride . The Venetian ambassador records that when he first arrived // in England , Wolsey used to say " his majesty will do so and so " ; soon it became " we shall do so and so " ; and finally it took the form " I shall do so and so .

For many years Wolsey 's attention was given chiefly to foreign affairs . In 1515 Louis XII died , dissolving the marriage alliance with England and bringing to the throne of France Francis I of the house of Valois . The new monarch , who was only twenty-one , was eager to restore the prestige of France , and before the year was out he reconquered Milan . In 1516 Charles of Habsburg , who was the duke of Burgundy , became king of Spain by the death of Ferdinand . ' His first step was to make peace with France in order that he might be free to strengthen his position in Spain . But his acquisition of the Spanish crown made war between Habsburg and Valois well-nigh inevitable . Charles was even younger than Francis and no less ambitious . The causes of the rivalry of France and Spain in Italy still existed ; as duke of Burgundy Charles inherited a tradition of hostility to France ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to French power . In 1519 the death of his grandfather , Maximilian , brought to Charles the ancestral lands of the Habsburgs , which centered in Austria , and resulted in his election as holy Roman emperor . With that event the outbreak of open hostilities between the dynasties of Habsburg and Valois became only a question of time . In 1521 began the war which was destined to last intermittently for nearly forty years . It was chiefly a dynastic struggle waged for territorial possessions and power with utter dis-regard for the interests of peoples , but it dominated the international relations of European rulers . The keen desire of his master to profit from the situation to advance his own fame led Wolsey to enter upon a long career of tortuous di-plomacy . During its course he seems to have glimpsed the theory of the balance of power which later became a cardinal principle of Euro-pean diplomacy . It was the necessary complement of the development of the nationalistic principle that no one state should be allowed to // become so powerful as to threaten the independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too powerful , others should ally against it . If Wolsey saw the principle , he failed lamentably in execution . In 1519 , when war impended , both Francis and Charles began to bid for Henry 's support . After the new emperor had visited England , Henry went- to France to hold with Francis the famous interview in the Field of the Cloth of Gold , where all the pomp and circumstance of chivalry were revived . The most important event was a wrestling match in which Francis threw the English king and thus heaped fuel on the bitter jealousy which Henry felt for his brother monarch . Henry then went to see Charles in Flanders , where he secretly dis-played his preference for the cause of the Habsburgs . After the war began , Wolsey went to Calais to mediate between Francis and Charles . While he was presiding over the arbitration proceedings , he negotiated an offensive alliance with Charles . This was published early in 1522 , when Henry was ready to take part in the war . The war went badly . Expeditions sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable invasion of England by the Scots was turned aside more by good fortune than by design . Henry learned , moreover , that the war was not popular with his subjects . In order to obtain the necessary supplies , a forced loan was raised in 1522 , and in 1523 parliament , which had not met in eight years , was summoned to grant taxation . Wolsey demanded for the king a huge subsidy . When the commons hesitated , he ' came down in state and attempted to overawe them . They refused to debate in his presence . Eventually they granted less than the desired sum , but in the course of the debate some of the speakers criticized sharply the policy of war . For the tax Wolsey received the blame , but the king saw that he could not ask for further grants without risk to his own popularity . As a consequence England marked time in relation to the war . In 1525 the whole situation was altered by a victory won by Charles at Pavia . The French were overwhelmingly defeated and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator of Europe . Henry 's first impulse was to join with his ally to invade France and divide the spoils , but for a year past he had contributed practically no aid , and Charles naturally declined to share with him the fruits of victory . Henry found , moreover , that he could not get money to finance such a policy . Mindful of his recent experience with parliament , Wolsey in 1525 tried to raise the amicable loan . It was in reality a heavy tax assessed against each man who would have been required to pay a tax had parliament granted one . The Londoners resisted payment , and in // Suffolk it caused open rebellion . Wolsey then withdrew the demand for a fixed quota and permitted each to contribute what he would . The Londoners retorted that benevolences had been illegal since the reign of Richard III . Eventually the demand had to be withdrawn entirely . It was Henry 's first rebuff , and he learned his lesson well , as later events were to prove . The worst of the immediate consequences he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his martial ambitions had to be abandoned . He turned , therefore , to Wolsey 's pol-icy , and made an alliance with France , designed to help restore the badly disturbed balance of power . After the release of Francis the arrangement was expanded into an offensive alliance against Charles , but before England had taken any aggressive action under it , the whole situation was complicated by Henry 's desire to secure the an-nulment of his marriage with Katherine of Aragon . Henry 's desire for a divorce " arose from mixed motives . One influ-ential factor was his desire for a male heir . Of several children born to him and Katherine , all except Mary had died at birth or shortly after . For a reigning queen on the English throne there was no prece-dent . It seemed likely to mean a disputed succession and a return of such evils as England had suffered in the fifteenth century . The situa-tion caused the king apprehension long before he began action in 1527 , and there were many who shared his fears . Henry 's affection for Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine could never forget that she was a Spanish princess , and she was importunate in behalf of Spain at inopportune times . As far back as 1514 she had so angered her husband by her championship of her father 's interests , when Henry had just cause to believe that Ferdinand had betrayed him , that he had threatened her with divorce . ' The cause that probably was the immediate occasion of Henry 's attempt to secure a divorce was his passion for Anne Boleyn , one of the ladies attendant on the queen . He probably fell in love with Anne early in 1527 , though the event is obviously of a type which it is beyond the power of the historian to date specifically . At any rate Henry made manifest his intention to seek a divorce in April of 1527 . He based his action on a technicality . Katherine was his brother 's widow , and the law of the church forbade the marriage of a deceased brother 's wife . To make the marriage possible , the pope had issued // a decree which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended that the dispensation was invalid . It was his first thought to secure a judgment in an English ecclesiastical court , marry Anne , and later obtain the confirmation of the pope . This scheme was stopped by events in Italy . In May , 1527 , the troops of Charles sacked Rome and made the pope , who was the ally of Francis , a prisoner . With the head of the church in the power of Charles , who was the nephew of Katherine , it became too great a risk to contract a second marriage before the papal court , the highest court of appeal on marital law , had dissolved the first marriage . It became necessary to deal directly with the papacy . Henry therefore asked that power to try the case should be delegated to Cardinal Wolsey . This the pope refused , but he com-missioned Wolsey and Campeggio , an Italian cardinal , jointly to try the case in England . He instructed Campeggio secretly to delay the decision , because he wanted to be sure whether France or Spain would win in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1529 , but , before it reached a decision , the case was summoned to Rome . Shortly after-ward the Treaty of Cambrai ended the war between Francis and Charles , leaving the latter the dominant power in Italy . The pope could not afford to antagonize Charles . Henry could not hope for the papal annulment of his marriage unless he could bring pressure to bear on the papacy to counterbalance that exerted by Charles . In England the failure of the court to grant the divorce had two results . The first was the fall of Wolsey . He had failed to secure what Henry had set his heart upon . For that his property was confiscated and he was dismissed in disgrace , though nominally he was punished for violation of the Statute of Pramunire . His years of faithful service did not condone the one failure with a king who was colossally selfish and utterly heartless . The second was that Henry took the lead of the forces in England that were opposed to the papal and sacerdotal power and began an attack on the papal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English church and placed it under the headship of the king . To obtain the help of the nation Henry called parliament in 1529 . Before it was dissolved seven years later , it had ended the papal jurisdiction in England . For that reason it is called the Reformation Par-Iiament . How far it represented popular opinion is an important ques-thin and one impossible to answer beyond the shadow of a doubt on the basis of the evidence so far brought forward . There are those who would have us believe that Henry by his control of parliament forced the separation of the Anglican church from the Roman communion
