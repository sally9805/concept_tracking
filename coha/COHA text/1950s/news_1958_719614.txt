txt The United States and its economic policies are something of an election issue in Canada , our reporters Gemmill ( an American ) and ( a Canadian ) report in a joint ' dispatch from Ottawa . There are a number of things irritating the Canadians . For one , there is growing U.S. control of Canadian industry through capital investment . For another , there is the dumping , of U.S. wheat in world markets , cutting into Canada 's important grain exports . But lately , there is the rising tide of protectiEnsism in the United States . This tide is in part due to the , recession in this country ; some industries , with demand lessening , have sought to shut out foreign competition . For example , the oil industry has sought and gutters " voluntary " quotas on petroleum . Too , there is always a certain amount of protectionist sentiment in the U.S. no matter what the general economic situation , and this sentiment is seizing on the recession as an excuse , just as it has always seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter is that Canada is having a recession of its own and there is a desperate scrambleunder way between its two major parties ? Conservatives and Liberals  --  to escape the blame and shove it on the other side . The Canadian recession 's beginnings roughly coincided with the assumption of power by the Conservatives , but naturally they are arguing that tlsey merely inherited the trouble . The danger to the United States is that there might be a wave of counterprotectionism as a result of this political push and haul . This , it is sometimes argued , would be improbable because the Canadians would perhaps suffer more than the U.S. from such action ; hence such action would be illogical . Illogical it might be . But illogical mixtures of economics and politics are one of tthe few things ( that almost all nationa have in common nowadays , no matter what form of government ; hey have . Canadians have ? a reputation for being slow to anger and to take drastic action . Counter-protectionism by Ottawa can only heighten the strain between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way out , of course , is for this country to reexamine barriers it has thrown up against Canadian products .
