txt // The particular way in which each substance acts varies considerably . In the case of penicillin , a clue to its action was provided by the observa-tion , already referred to in Chapter 3 , that while amino acids can diffuse into the interior of some species of organisms , others behave differently in that some acids , particularly glutamic acid , must he actively transported // across the cell wall . Gale and Taylor have suggested that penicillin causes a breakdown in this transporting mechanism . The interior of the cell therefore lacks an essential nutriment , in spite of the fact that it may be present in abundance in the surrounding medium . Organisms which are insensi-tive to penicillin are able to synthesize their glutamic acid inside the cell from substances which are able to reach its interior by simple diffusion . ) It is probable that whatever metabolite is withheld from the organisms by penicillin , it is one which is employed more for cell division than for cell growth , because it has been repeatedly shown that bacterial cells in sublethal concentrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of bacilli , may become extremely long but without signs of division . Streptomycin , on the other hand , would appear to act in quite a differ-ent way , probably by interfering with the oxidation of pyruvic acid which is produced in the course of carbohydrate breakdown.2 SENSITIVITY OF ORGANISMS TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS If , as seems probable , chemotherapeutic agents owe their activity to their ability to interfere with the metabolism of the infecting organisms , it follows that their efficiency will not be the same for all species of organ-isms because the metabolism of different species varies considerably . Probably for this reason , some substances are much more useful for the treatment of infections by Gram-positive cocci , for example , than for Gram-negative bacilli . Similarly , substances acting on Gram-negative bacilli may have no action at all on Mycobacteria . The metabolism of the smaller viruses is probably very different from that of the larger bacteria , and it is not therefore very surprising that they are quite unaffec-ted by any of the chemotherapeutic agents now available . But it is also interesting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metabo-lism may perhaps resemble that of bacteria more closely , are susceptible to the action of some of the more powerful antibiotics . The relative efficiency of the different substances available is summarized below . Arsenicals . Salvarsan or its derivative , neosalvarsan or arsphenamine , is not unduly toxic , but is of undoubted value for the treatment of spiro-chaetal infections such as syphilis , yaws and relapsing fever . Sulphonamides . Sulphanilamide , either as such or coupled with a dye as Prontosil , was first employed for infections with Strep. pyogenes , in which it undoubtedly has great value . Later , sulphanilamide was shown to be of considerable value for the treatment of infections by N. meningitidis , // the species of Clostridia which cause gas gangrene and ( when it was first introduced ) N. gonorrhoeae . With these discoveries , research was then carried out to synthesize substances having a greater range of activity and less toxicity . These resulted in the production of a whole series of compounds closely resembling but slightly different from sulphanilamide . Some of them had the required properties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is nevertheless not only much more effective for streptococcal infection but can control those due to pneumo-cocci , for which sulphanilamide has little value . Sulphathiazole goes a stage further , being not only less toxic and more valuable for streptococcal and pneumococcal infections , but capable of dealing with those due to Staph. aureus . A number of other analogues of sulphanilamide possess special properties which render them useful in certain forms of infection . The two com-pounds sulphaguanidine and succinyl sulphathiazole belong to this class , for they are not absorbed to any great extent from the intestinal canal , and for this reason have proved to be of value in the treatment of intestinal infections , particularly those due to Shigella . Penicillin . The spectrum of activity of penicillin is slightly wider than that of the sulphonamides and , despite the introduction of other anti-biotics , it is still the most powerful agent we possess for infections due to the Gram-positive species , such as streptococci , pneumococci , B. anthracis and the clostridia of gas gangrene . It is also of great value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this organism during recent years has been a serious complication . So much is this so that some consider that aureomycin is the drug of choice in such infections . The Gram-negative cocci , N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae , are also very susceptible , but Gram-negative bacilli are much less so . Perhaps the most important aspect of penicillin is its ability to effect cure of spirochaetal infections , particularly syphilis , yaws , pinta , relapsing fever and Vincents angina. l Chloramphenicol ( chloromycetin ) . Chloramphenicol has a slightly differ-ent range of activity , with marked tendencies to be more active against the Gram-negative than against the Gram-positive species . It is , therefore , of considerable value in the treatment of infection due to organisms of the coli-typhoid-dysentery group and their near relations , Proteus vulgaris and Kl. pneumoniae . It is also of value in infections by Brucella and , perhaps most important of all , in rickettsial infections such as typhus and Q fever.2 // Streptomycin . Streptomycin is a third antibiotic whose range of activity is also limited but which can combat some organisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is , moreover , not without activity on the staphylococci . ' Since , however , nearly all species of bacteria acquire resistance to this antibiotic with astonishing rapidity , it should be reserved for those infections due to Myco. tuberculosis and Proteus vulgaris , which will not respond to other drugs . Aureomycin ( chlortetracyclin ) and terramycin ( oxytetracyclin ) . These compounds are so much alike that they can be described together . Their range of activity is very much wider than any of the other substances , very few organisms being completely resistant . Accordingly , they can be used for all the Gram-positive cocci and the Gram-positive bacilli , such as B. anthracis ( their value in gas gangrene is still unknown ) . The Gram-negative cocci are also susceptible , as are the Gram-negative bacilli of the cob-typhoid-dysentery group and the brucellae . Some of the larger viruses , such as rickettsiae and those of psittacosis , lymphogranuloma , primary atypical pneumonia and possibly herpes zoster , are also susceptible.2 Other antibiotics . Erythromycin ( Ilotycin ) has a similar spectrum to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polymyxin E. is of value in the treatment of infections by Ps. pyocyanea . Gramicidin is also useful despite the fact that it is more toxic than most of the antibiotics . Chemotherapeutic agents employed for tuberculosis in particular . Para-aminosalicylic acid , a compound having the same general formula as sulphanilamide , can inhibit the growth of Myco. tuberculosis , and because of its relatively low toxicity , a fairly high level can be maintained in the circulating blood . It is , however , weak and should not therefore be used alone . Isoniazid , or isonicotinic acid hydrazide , has the added advantage in that it not only inhibits the growth of Myco. tuberculosis but can reach the comparatively dense interior of giant cells . It has proved to be of value in the treatment of infection . NATURAL VARIATIONS IN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SULPHONAMIDES AND ANTI-BIOTICS In the above discussion we have confined ourselves to the broad spec-trum of activity as between different species , but the question arises as to whether all strains of any one bacterial species are equally susceptible to the activity of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more detail later in this chapter , that exposure to these substances may result in the emergence of strains with a high degree of resistance // makes this question difficult to answer , unless precise determinations of the sensitivity of large numbers of strains isolated before the introduction of a drug for treatment are available . There seems , however , very little doubt that there is actually some natural variation in susceptibility . Of 50 strains of N. gonorrhoeae , isolated before the introduction of sulphonamides for treatment , 12 were found to be more resistant to sulphonilamide than the remainder . ) Variations in sensitivity to strepto-mycin on the part of strains of Myco. tuberculosis , isolated before contact with it , have also been observed . ' Sensitivity of Staph. aureus to anti-biotics may likewise vary and in an investigation in which 200 strains of this organism isolated from wounds and other infective conditions in out-patients were tested in different concentrations of streptomycin , chloram-phenicol , aureomycin and terramycin , the majority of strains occupied a median position but some were clearly more and others less resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no sense were the organisms tested in any of these investigations so resistant that they would have defied treatment . // DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS Quite early in the history of chemotherapy Ehrlich I observed that try panosomes isolated from animals treated with trypanocidal drugs in doses too small to effect complete cure were much more resistant than the parent strain . Only a little later it was found that by subcultivation of many different species of bacteria in gradually increasing concentrations of dyes or antiseptics they became capable of survival and even multiplication in concentrations quickly lethal for the strain from which the organisms were derived . When , therefore , sulphonamides and , later , antibiotics were introduced into medical practice , it seemed probable that somewhat similar changes might occur . Because of its obvious importance a great deal of attention has been devoted to this question . There is , firstly , no doubt that it is possible to produce highly resistant strains in test tube experiments . McIntosh and Selbie , 2 for example , showed that Strep. pyogenes may acquire a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing increasing concentrations of sulphanilamide . In one experiment a particu lar strain of this organism multiplied in the presence of 1/312,000 sulph anilamide but not in 1/62,400 . Organisms taken from . the tube containing the former concentration behaved in the same way in the second passage . But at the third passage they survived in a concentration of 1/12,500 . With further passages , there was a gradual increase in ability to survive in higher concentrations until at the seventh and eighth passage some were still alive after exposure to 1/500 sulphanilamide . Other organisms such as the gonococcus and the pneumococcus have also been shown capable of becoming resistant to sulphonamides by growth in gradually increasing concentrations in vitro . Resistance to the antibiotics can be induced in similar types of experi ment , but the degree of resistance varies with the species of organism under consideration . The gonococcus may become so resistant that in one investi gation it survived exposure to 21 units of penicillin per 1 cc of medium . The meningococcus , too , may become capable of survival after exposure to as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation the resistance of Strep. pyogenes had only increased four times after as many as 78 subcultures in increasing concentrations of penicillin . Resistance to streptomycin may not only reach a very high level but can be acquired very quickly . N. meningitidis , N. gonorrhoeae , Ps. pyo eranea , E. coil , Proteus vulgaris and , perhaps most important of all , A4yco. tuberculosis may behave in this way . // In this connection it is of considerable interest that by continued ex posure of organisms to some chemotherapeutic agents it is even possible to go a stage further and to evolve in this way a strain which is actually dependent on the agent to supply it with some essential metabolite . Miller and Bohnhoff showed , for example , ' that once they had acquired resistance to streptomycin , meningococci might become so dependent on the anti-biotic that they failed to grow in media which did not contain it . Strepto mycin therefore became an essential growth substance and if it was admini stered to animals infected by these organisms it actually made matters worse , animals treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly dependent strains of other organisms , such as Staph. aureus , E. coli , Ps. pyocyanea and K. pneurnoniae , have also been reported . Interesting as the development of resistance or dependence following exposure to antibacterial substances in vitro may be , of far greater import ance is the fact that it may develop in vivo when they are used for treatment . This may occur with all the substances under consideration but , as might perhaps have been expected , both species of organism and substance employed impose their own variations . Pneumococci , whose growth is prevented by only 1 mgm sulphapyri dine per 100 cc of medium , may , for instance , become so resistant during treatment with the same agent that they can survive concentrations as high as 15-20 mgm per 100 cc.2 Gonococci , too , may become so resistant // to sulphonamides that treatment with them is valueless . Str. viridans may similarly acquire a considerable degree of resistance to penicillin in the course of treatment of bacterial endocarditis due to this organism . But perhaps most important of all is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streptomycin during treatment.i Resistance developing in this way is specific , sensitivity to other agents generally remaining unaltered . There are , however , exceptions , organisms resistant to one sulphonamide being resistant to the others while resistance to aureomycin also involves resistance to terramycin . It is , however , necessary to add that if an organism which is resistant to one antibiotic is subsequently exposed to the action of another antibiotic , it may acquire resistance to the second as well . Probably as a consequence of this , strains of organisms are now in existence which have become resistant to all the known antibiotics . Not only is this of considerable importance , but the position is made rather worse by the observation that when resistance has been acquired it generally remains as a permanent characteristic of the strain , which may persist even when it is repeatedly subcultured in media devoid of any chemotherapeutic agent . Very little is known of the alterations which bacteria undergo when they become resistant . If , as seems probable , chemotherapeutic agents act by interfering with the metabolic processes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of development of resistance , alternative mechanisms which act as by-passes and allow the organism to obtain its foodstuffs are brought into action . This is to some extent confirmed by the observation that , under suitable conditions , some species of organisms may become dependent on the chemotherapeutic agent as an essential metabolite . The fact that a race of organisms which , at one time , was highly suscept ible to a particular compound and then , in the course of a few days or even hours , may become completely and permanently resistant has provoked a great deal of controversy amongst geneticists as to the underlying mechanism : whether it is selection of naturally occurring resistant mutants , or a mutation induced by the presence of the chemotherapeutic agent . No very definite conclusion can as yet be reached as to which of these alternatives is correct . PRODUCTION OF INACTIVATORS FOR CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS BY BACTERIA However resistant bacteria may become to sulphonamides and most of the antibiotics , this is not due to their ability to form enzymes or other // substances which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was found that some organisms could destroy it by forming penicillinase . This applies to some strains of B. subtilis and B. anthraces , E. coli , K. pneumoniae , Sh . shigae , Proteus vulgaris and Ps. pyocyanea , and most important of all , Staph. aureus . Because of their ability to inactivate penicillin , such strains are insensitive when tested in vitro , while the drug leaves much to be desired when employed for treatment . For all practical purposes , therefore , such organisms are resistant to penicillin . But this resistance is very different in character from that form of resistance described in the preceding section . It is , for example , impossible by any known method to alter the capacity of Staph. aureus to produce penicillinase . Strains of this organism which can not form this enzyme will not develop ability to do so if they are subjected to treatment which usually renders organisms resistant ; that is , by subcultivation in gradually increasing concentrations of penicillin . Nor does continued subcultivation in media devoid of penicillin diminish to any measurable extent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other example of this type of resistance so far encountered is the ability of some strains of Ps. pyocyanea to inactivate streptomycin . PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS TREATMENT OF INFECTIONS Choice of drug . In many forms of infection the clinical picture alone will provide sufficient information to guide the practitioner as to which chemotherapeutic agent he should employ . Because of this , treatment is generally started before the results of bacteriological examinations are available . Dosage . In view of the almost constant finding that , in the presence of sublethal concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents , micro-organisms tend to become resistant , it follows that whenever such drugs are employed they should be given in large doses and sufficiently often to maintain their concentration at a high level for some days . In this way something approaching the " doses magna sterilizans " which Ehrlich considered was the ideal way in which to employ chemotherapeutic agents may be achieved , all the infecting organisms being destroyed almost at once , leaving no survivors . Prevention of the development of resistance . As already mentioned , this may to a large extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been found that if two dissimilar antibiotics be employed the chances of a resistant race developing are much less . This is no doubt due to the ability of the second antibiotic to take care of resistant survivors from the onslaught of the first antibiotic . It is , however , necessary to add that it is inadvisable to use a bacteriostatic substance such as aureomycin or sulphonamide with a bactericidal substance // such as streptomycin or penicillin , because this tends to weaken the action of the bactericidal substance.t LABORATORY CONTROL OF CHEMOTHERAPY The bacteriologist can play an important part in controlling the chemotherapy of cases of infection , in a variety of ways . These include the identification of the organisms concerned and , in cases undergoing intensive therapy , ascertaining whether such fungi as Cans/ida albicans are becoming too numerous in the flora of the nasopharynx . There is little need to comment on these activities . But he can also assist by determining the sensitivity of the organisms to whatever agent is suggested , whether the organisms develop resistance in the course of treatment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such body fluids as the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.2 Measurements of bacterial sensitivity . Although so much is now known of the relative sensitivity of different bacterial species to chemotherapeutic agents as to render tests of their sensitivity unnecessary before treatment is started , the existence of resistant strains of certain organisms , some of which are becoming commoner , makes tests of sensitivity not only advisable but on occasions obli-gatory , if the dosage employed for treatment is to be properly gauged . Many methods have been introduced for this purpose . When pure cultures of the organism are available and it will multiply readily in liquid media , the most accurate method is the so-called tube test in which equal numbers of organisms // are added to liquid media containing increasing concentrations of the chemo therapeutic agent . By this method it is possible to ascertain the highest concentra tion in which the organisms can survive and multiply . The cup test also requires pure cultures . For this purpose , the surface of a suitable solid medium is heavily inoculated with the organisms . Shallow cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are placed on the medium . As many as six can be disposed on the surface of an ordinary agar plate . Different concentra tions of the chemotherapeutic agent are placed in the cups and the plate is then incubated . If the strain is sensitive , there will be a wide halo round the cups , where the substance has diffused into the agar and inhibited growth . The width of the halo naturally depends on the strength of the agent in the cup . More recently , disc tests have been introduced . These comprise circles or squares of filter paper impregnated with the different antibiotics . They can be bought ready made , or can be made in the laboratory , each piece of paper con taining a known concentration of antibiotic . When pure cultures are available , they can be used in the same way as the cups , but because of their convenience can also be employed for primary cultures , particularly those from purulent // secretions where the culture is quite frequently pure and uncontaminated by other organisms . Other methods , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organism such as Myco. tuberculosis must be tested , are rather more specialized applications which it is unnecessary to describe . Determination of concentrations of drugs . The methods described above can be adapted to provide useful information as to the concentration of chemothera peutic agents at different sites in the patient . These usually involve comparison between the behaviour of a sensitive strain of organisms in different dilutions of blood , cerebrospinal fluid , tissue extract or other material , and the behaviour of the same number of organisms in solutions containing known concentrations of the chemotherapeutic agent . SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF RESISTANCE There seems to be little doubt that in countries where antibiotics and sulphon amides have been extensively employed , the proportion of resistant strains of // pathogenic micro-organisms present in the population is not only higher than in countries where they are used less frequently but this proportion may well be rising . This has obvious implications and every possible step should be taken to pre-vent the emergence of such strains and their colonization of the community . Some of the steps have already been alluded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible , for which reason it is of very considerable importance that the sale of chemotherapeutic agents of this nature should be strictly controlled , to prevent self-medication or their use in face-creams , tooth-pastes , etc. , while medical practitioners , too , should realize their duties by restricting the employment of such agents to infections which are likely to benefit and by using adequate dosage when they use them . The discovery that combined therapy , with two agents instead of one , may prevent the emergence of resistant strains is also of very considerable practical // importance , and should therefore be employed whenever possible . Lastly , there is quite sufficient evidence to suggest that even when chemotherapeutic measures are widely and successfully employed , resistant strains of organisms , such as Staph. aureus , may emerge and may colonize hospital staffs , in this way securing their survival in the community ( see Chapter 13 ) . For this reason every measure that can prevent the passage of organisms from patient to patient or from patient to staff in hospitals should be applied with vigour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species are constantly present in our environment . Some fulfil useful functions such as the production of alcohol from sugar solutions or gas from carbohydrates for the leavening of bread . Other species can similarly multiply in foodstuffs but produce toxic substances which may cause severe illness . CI . hotu/inum , for instance , is a spore-bearing organism whose natural habitat is the soil but which can elaborate such a toxin if it is able to multiply under anaerobic con ditions in meat or certain vegetables . When the food is eaten the toxin causes a syndrome known as botulism Contrary to what might be ex pected , the principal symptoms are due to paralysis of certain groups of muscles , chiefly those of the eyes , mouth and throat.1 Some strains of Staph. aureus may produce another toxin if they multiply in such common articles of diet as custards or cream-cake fillings . This causes acute diarrhoea and vomiting.2 Somewhat similar symptoms may follow the ingestion of foods ? chiefly meat ? containing toxins elaborated by certain strains of B. subtilis and CI . welchii . In all four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient but they seldom survive for very long , and the symptoms are entirely due to the toxins which were produced before the food was eaten . With these exceptions any form of illness produced by micro-organ isms in human beings is principally due to their ability to survive and multiply in our tissues . But when one considers that organisms are always present in the air we breathe or food and water we consume and they invariably contaminate every object we touch and the dust and dirt that get into our wounds , it is surprising that so few of these encounters are followed by symptoms indicative of active infection . There are , however , many reasons for this . Many of these organisms are free-living species , capable of survival and multiplication without relying on the food and shelter provided by a host . To colonize the tissues and produce infection would necessitate their becoming parasites and very few free-living species are capable of so mo mentous a change in their habits . But even with micro-organisms which // have become habituated to life as parasites , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those to which they are accustomed . It is probably for this reason that most animals are completely insusceptible to many bacterial and virus infections of man . Conversely , many animal infections are not transmissible to human beings . Because of this specificity , colds and measles are exclusively human diseases , while distemper is confined to dogs and rinderpest to cattle . There are , however , exceptions to this rule and some animal parasites can cause infection of human beings . L. icterohaemorrhagiae , bovine strains of Myco. tuberculosis and the virus of rabies , which are respectively parasites of rats , cows and dogs , belong to this category . But whether they are free-living organisms or organisms which are capable of life as parasites , they can not survive for very long unless they can overcome the defensive mechanisms with which man and animals are equipped . These assail them as soon as they reach any part of the body . THE NATURAL DEFENSIVE MECHANISMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL The mechanisms which are responsible for protecting the body against chance-met organisms can be divided into outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is intact , the skin prevents settlement of bacteria in the tissues beneath . But , in addition , it can evidently kill organisms which , reach its surface . It may , for example , be impossible to cultivate E. coli , Salm. typhi , Proteus vulgaris , Ps. pyocyanea and Strep. pyogenes only 30 minutes after they have been placed on human skin.l Mucous membranes . Conjunctiva and mucous membranes of the naso pharynx . These membranes act as a barrier which prevents invasion of t he tissues beneath , but many bacteria and other particles reaching their surfaces are removed mechanically by such agencies as coughing , the move ments of the cilia and the flow of tears , mucus and saliva . Organisms which are not dealt with in this way may be acted upon by an enzyme known as lysozyme , 2 which is present in high concentration in tears and , Io a less extent , in nasal mucus and saliva . It probably depolymerizes a mucoid substance ( acetyl amino polysaccharide ) present in many species of organisms3 and is so powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /ysodeikticus disappear completely in the course of a minute or two when tears are dropped on to them . In other investigations // it was found that even when the tears were diluted a hundredfold , they killed no fewer than 74 strains of organisms out of 104 which had been isolated from the atmosphere.I Substances formed by some of the commensals normally present in the nasopharynx may act in similar fashion . Sufficient hydrogen peroxide is apparently released into the saliva by Strep. viridans to inhibit the growth of C. diphtheriae.2 It is possible that in the normal throat some similar mechanism prevents the development of Candida albicans and K. pneu moniae , because these organisms may appear in large numbers when the normal bacterial flora of the throat disappears in the course of intensive therapy with penicillin . Intestinal tract . The acid present in the stomach is quickly lethal for such organisms as Strep. pyogenes , C. diphtheriae , V. cholerae and the pneumococcus . This undoubtedly protects the small intestine against these and many other species of organisms which may be swallowed in food or drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not yet been determined , may operate in the upper part of the jejunum . Further down the intestinal canal , fermentation of carbohydrates by coliform bacilli may play a part in preventing the survival of many other species of organisms . Vagina . Owing to the fermentation of glycogen from the vaginal epi thelium by Doderlein 's bacillus or L. acidophilus , the lumen may become so acid that its pH may be as low as 4.0 . This degree of acidity is quickly lethal for many species of organisms . Before puberty and after the meno pause as well as during pregnancy , the pH is nearer neutral . INNER DEFENCES Many species of organisms from the atmosphere or the soil , which reach the mesoblastic tissues beneath the skin or mucous membranes , die or fail to multiply because they are unable to utilize the tissues and their fluids as foodstuffs or to carry on their metabolic processes at a tempera ture which is generally much higher than that of their normal habitat . The normal oxidation reduction potential or Eh of the tissues may also act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is usually in the region of +0.12 volts . At this Eh , the spores of anaerobic pathogens such as Cl. tetani and Cl. welchii will not germinate . Evidence is now accumulating that when organisms reach the deeper tissues , the micro-environment in their immediate vicinity , as it has been // called , soon becomes different from that of the remainder of the body , and that substances may collect in high concentration which are bactericidal . Haem compounds released from haemoglobin , some peptides and possibly ketones or organic acids derived from carbohydrates , may , for example , be present in sufficiently high concentration to exert a bacteriostatic if not bactericidal action on certain species of organisms . ' These investigations , it must be emphasized , are still in their infancy , and although there seems to be little doubt that substances of this nature may play an active part in preventing development of organisms in the tissues , two other mechanisms which have been investigated in great detail are also of equal , if not greater , importance . These are phagocytosis and bacteriolysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mucous membranes , organisms inevitably encounter cells which are generally able to ingest and dispose of them by intracellular digestion.2 This process is known as phagocytosis , but because it is fully described in text-books on pathology its details will not be given here . A few of the more important points may , however , be mentioned . // When organisms reach deep tissues , motile phagocytic cells ( polymorpho nuclears and large mononuclears ) leave the blood vessels and tissue spaces and emigrate along the tissue planes towards them . This is known as positive chemotaxis and is probably due to the formation of certain chem ical compounds in the inflamed tissues.i In view of the relative paucity of such cells in areas of very intense inflammation , it has been postulated that the cells are repelled by compounds which produce negative chemo taxis . There is , however , considerable doubt whether this is the case . Organisms which leave the infected area and reach the blood stream encounter sessile phagocytic cells in such organs as the liver and lungs , while those leaving the infected area by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lymphatic glands.2 In whatever way the organisms come into contact with phagocytic cells , they are generally engulfed or phagocyted . But this can not occur unless they have been acted upon by a heat labile ( destroyed at 56 ? C ) substance in the body fluids known as opsonin , Q/ibWyEW ( I cater for ) .3 Very little is known of the process by which the organisms reach the interior of the phagocytes , but large numbers can apparently be taken up by one cell and become distributed throughout the cytoplasm . A very high proportion of the organisms taken up in this way do not survive for very long . Some organisms such as E. cols quickly lose their sharp outlines and within 30 minutes , or even less , all that may be visible is a little bacterial debris . Other species such as Strep. pyogenes or Staph. aureus may remain apparently intact for much longer periods . It is , however , probable that the majority of these organisms are dead or dying . Suitable experiments have shown that defibrinated blood to which such organisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixing machine for 30 ? 60 minutes . In parallel experiments in which the blood has been deprived of all or nearly all its leucocytes by previous passage through cotton wool the organisms not only survive but may even multiply . There seems to be no doubt that phagocytosis and intracellular digestion by both motile and fixed cells is an extremely efficient mechanism for the protection of the host against the great majority of organisms which may find their way into his tissues.4 Bactericidal action of the body fluids . When organisms of certain species , such as E. coli , are incubated in the fresh plasma or serum of normal animals , the number of living organisms may fall so rapidly that only a // few are still alive at the end of 1 hour , none at all after 5 or 6 hours ( see Table 6.1 ) . Microscopic examination of such mixtures shows that many of the cells undergo striking changes in appearance . Some lose their bacillary shape and become spherical , while others may become four or five times longer than normal and correspondingly wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than a little debris . ' This phenomenon is frequently referred to as bacteriolysis , but there is evidence that the body fluids may be able to exert a marked bactericidal action on the organisms without necessarily producing lysis or dissolution of the organisms in the process . Whether bacteriolysis is or is not produced , the failure of the organisms to survive for very long in the normal body fluids is due to the combined action of two substances . One is probably a form of globulin recently isolated by Pillemer and his colleagues which they have called properdin.2 This combines with the organisms but can not kill them or disrupt them .. Nevertheless , it sensitizes the organisms to the action of the second substance , which is much more labile and is known as complement ( see Chapter 7 ) . It is this substance which is actually responsible for the bactericidal and bacteriolytic action of the body fluids . Many strains of V. cholerae , the salmonellae of food infections and of // typhoid and paratyphoid , the shigellae , the meningococcus and H. influenzae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of normal persons , but Past . pestis , Staph. aureus , Strep. pyogenes , Strep. viridans , C. diphtheriae and the pneumococci are uniformly resistant . ' Within its limits it is probable that this activity on the part of the body fluids of normal persons is an important and useful adjunct to phagocytosis for the elimination of chance-met organisms . Disposal of viruses . There can be no doubt that we encounter viruses almost as frequently as we do bacteria , but clinical infection does not invariably occur . Why this should be so is still unknown for there is no evidence that viruses are dealt with by phagocytosis or lysis by comple-ment . COLONIZATION OF THE TISSUES BY MICRO-ORGANISMS Although the defensive mechanisms described above protect us against the great majority of the organisms we encounter , some species are able to survive and maintain themselves in the tissues . Commensals , for ex-ample , parasitize the skin and mucous membranes soon after birth and many species remain with us until we die . These include Strep. viridans , H. influenzae , various species of neisseriae , diphtheroids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lactobacilli and E. coli which parasitize the gut , and Staph. a/bus the skin . Under most circum-stances , these organisms are quite harmless . Viruses , too , may persist in the tissues without clinical evidence of their presence . Huebener , 2 for example , has found viruses in the tonsils and // pharynx of normal human beings which may have very little pathogenic ability and probably behave in very much the same way as the bacterial commensals mentioned above . Other species of organisms may produce symptoms . Such organisms have generally reached the individual at the start of the incubation period of the disease in question and produce an acute illness , which ends in either death or complete recovery . But this does not always occur . A chronic infection may , for instance , be produced which never heals but which does not appreciably shorten the life of the patient . Secondly , a proportion of thoFe harbouring the organisms may suffer from nothing more than a subclinical infection which , as its name implies , denotes some degree of multiplication of the organisms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atypical or so mild as to be unrecognizable as associated with any particular micro-organism . Thirdly , pathogenic organisms may , on occasion , remain in the tissues as commensals or in a dormant condition without actually producing symptoms or harming the host in any way . And , lastly , they may for some reason fail to obtain a footing at all and disappear soon after their arrival . Thus , although medical students may be tempted to concentrate on the more dramatic aspects of the host-parasite relationship , this is , in fact , only a part of the story . Whether the organisms are commensals or pathogens they must , if they are to survive and multiply in the tissues , be able to resist the normal defensive mechanisms of the host . Much is now known of their capabilities in this direction . R SISTANCE TO SURFACE DEFENCES Although the skin can evidently kill many species of organisms , it is perhaps significant that Staph. aureus , which is responsible for most skin infections , is resistant . Strep. pyogenes , too , may survive for comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lysozyme normally present , which is so efficient a defensive mechanism for dealing with the organisms of the atmosphere , is of very little value where more pathogenic species are concerned . In one investigation E. coil , Sahn. typhi and pneumococci were found to be resistant and only six out of 22 strains of streptococci and two of four staphylococci were susceptible to it . The acidity of the stomach is also insufficiently high to kill organisms such as E. coli and Salm. typhi , which can parasitize the intestinal canal . Myco. tuberculosis also survives . Iirucella and V. cholerae , on the other hand , are susceptible , and we still do not know how they succeed in passing through the stomach to produce infection . // RESISTANCE TO DEEP DEFENCES The continuity of the skin and mucous membranes is frequently broken by trauma of various kinds , allowing access of a great many species of organisms to the tissues beneath . If the wound be clean , many species can not survive for very long in the serous exudate . But the organisms principally responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not only able to survive ; they can multiply rapidly . When , however , there is much dead tissue , acid may accumulate and organisms such as Proteus vulgar/A ' , which may be unable to survive in clean wounds , are then enabled to do so . Local ischacmia and the resulting necrosis of tissue may also affect the oxidation reduction potential to such an extent that the Eh may drop from the normal +0.12 volts to a level as low as - 0.04 volts . Since the spores of Cl. tetani can germinate at or below an Eh of +0.01 volts and those of Cl. welchii at +0.07 volts , it follows that the protective effect of high oxygenation and its consequently high local Eh no longer operates and the spores of the various species of clostridia may be able to germinate to produce their vegetative forms.l // Resistance to phagocytosis and intracellular digestion . Although phagocytosis and intracellular digestion is undoubtedly an extremely efficient mechanism for dealing with organisms reaching most parts of the body below the skin and mucous membranes , it is not invariably successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time that Myco. tuberculosis can be phagocyted quite readily but is not necessarily killed in the process . Indeed , virulent ( see Chapter I for a definition of this term ) strains of this organism may be able to multiply in the cell , if the latter is kept in a suitable environment.1 Virulent strains of other organisms have , apparently , gone a stage further , in that the phagocytes of normal animals can not even ingest them . Virulent pneumococci or Strep. pyogenes , for example , injected into the peritoneum of the mouse survive and multiply so rapidly that the animal may die within 24 hours . Microscopic examination of the peritoneal contents shortly before death will show that there are large numbers of organisms lying free in the exudate , but the phagocytic cells also present contain very few organisms . Somewhat similar results may be obtained in test-tube experiments in which virulent and avirulent strains of these organisms are employed . When added to the defibrinated blood of normal persons , or mixtures of phagocytic cells and normal serum , avirulent strains are phagocyted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // mononuclears , whereas these cells take up very few , if any , organisms when highly virulent strains are employed . ' Somewhat similar differences between virulent and avirulent strains of Sahli. typhi have also been observed.2 There is also evidence that the ability of Strep. pyogenes and pneumococci to resist phagocytosis is most marked during the active phase of growth . Ageing organisms in the decline phase lose the ability to resist phagocytosis . The inability of the phagocytes to take up the virulent organisms in these experiments is not due to paralysis of the phagocytes . This was demonstrated many years ago in a singularly elegant experiment by Bordet3 in which an easily phagocytable organism such as Proteus vulgaris , injected into the peritoneum of a guinea-pig dying of streptococcal peritonitis , was phagocyted in large numbers by the cellular exudate , whereas the streptococci were left untouched . There is an increasing body of evidence that resistance to phagocytosis exhibited by virulent strains is due to the presence of certain chemical compounds on the surface of the organisms . Such compounds may be present in sufficient amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form envelopes or skins whose presence can only be inferred by indirect methods . The more virulent strains of pneumococci , K. pneumoniae , H. influenzae and N. meningitidis , tend therefore to develop capsules whereas their avirulent variants are devoid of them . Past . pestis , Cl. welchii and B. anthracis , too , form capsules when actually producing infection , but probably because of lack of some essential metabolite they seldom produce them in culture . Salm. typhi , on the other hand , never forms capsules , but when this organism is virulent it possesses an envelope covering its surface which is known as the Vi antigen . Virulent strains of Strep. pyogenes have a similar coating known as the M substance . The chemical composition of many of these substances is known . The capsules of the pneumococcus and K. pneumoniae consist of polysac charide , as does the Vi antigen of Satin . typhi . The M substance of Strep. pyogenes , on the other hand , is protein . None are essential to the life of the cell . The avirulent variants do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cell , some can be removed by enzyme action without harming the bacterium itself.4 That such substances are responsible for the ability of the organisms to resist phagocytosis is confirmed by the observation referred to in more // detail in Chapter 7 , that antibodies which can combine with these sub-stances render the organisms no longer capable of resisting phagocytosis and intracellular digestion . But perhaps the most convincing evidence is that obtained by Dubos and Avery l with type III pneumococci . They were able to prepare an enzyme acting specifically on the capsule of this organism but which had no action on the organisms themselves . When therefore the enzyme is present , the capsules disappear and such organisms then become phagocytable . If the enzyme be injected in sufficient doses it is even possible to protect mice against infection by type III pneumococci . Resistance to the bactericidal action of the body fluids . Although the plas ma , serum and other body fluids of normal persons can exert a marked bactericidal and bacteriolytic action on many species of organisms , the more virulent strains may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholerae , for example , are killed readily and in large numbers by the fresh serum of normal animals or human beings . But virulent strains of the same organism may be almost completely in susceptible.2 Similar differences between virulent and avirulent strains of Bairn . typhi , N. meningitiais and H. influenzae have also been observed.3 Very little is known of the attributes which enable the more virulent strains to resist this particular defensive mechanism , but it would seem possible that here , too , it is due to the development of surface coatings in the form of capsules or skins . Although we have been able to advance suggestions as to the reasons for the ability of some species of micro-organism to overcome the normal defensive mechanisms , it must be admitted that very few species have actually been studied in this way . It is therefore possible that other , as yet undetected , activities on the part of the organisms may play an import-ant part in enabling some species of organisms to gain a footing in the tissues . I IIE . GENESIS OF INFECTION From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the human body possesses a whole series of mechanisms by which it can protect itself against the many species of bacteria and viruses it encounters every day , but that species peculiarly adapted to produce infection possess , in their turn , attributes which enable them to breach these defences and settle in the tissues . When , therefore , actual infection occurs , it is natural to assume // that the defences were quite adequate for most purposes , but were over-come by a strain of organisms possessing an unusually high degree of pathogenicity and virulence . Nevertheless , there is always the alternative possibility that the organisms possess some , although not exceptional , ability to induce infection , but the defence mechanisms of the patient had either always been subnormal or , because of some extrinsic factor , had temporarily broken down . With the information we possess , it is still not possible to say which of these alternatives is likely to be correct in any particular case of infection . This is partly due to the fact that we still possess no satisfactory method for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different persons . But there is evidence that other factors , such as the race to which the individual belongs , his age , state of nutrition , condition of his endocrine system , may play a part in altering his ability to resist in fection . Race . On the whole , the different races of man seem to be equally susceptible to most pathogenic micro-organisms . Tuberculosis is , however , an exception , negroes , North American Indians and Eskimoes , amongst others , being apparently more susceptible than the white races . Although this may be partly due to relatively greater poverty , etc. , amongst such races , these complicating factors may to a large extent be eliminated by studies of the incidence of the disease in soldiers whose environment is generally very much the same , no matter what their race may be . Amongst native troops in the West Indies , for example , Cummins found that between 10 and 16 per 1000 contracted the disease , whereas amongst British troops living under the same conditions 1 the incidence was only 1 ? 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality rate from tuberculosis amongst negro soldiers in the U.S. Army is appreciably higher than that of whites.2 It is probable that the greater resistance of the white races to Myco. tuberculosis is due to their having been parasitized by this organism for at least 3000 years , so that the more susceptible individuals in each generation were eliminated . Negroes and other races have had a much shorter period of contact with this organism . This suggests that susceptibility and in-susceptibility to some forms of infection may be hereditable . And it is a striking fact that by selective breeding it has been possible to produce strains of mice which are much more or much less resistant than the parent stock to such organisms as Salm. typhi-murium and the virus of louping ill.3 Age . There seems to be very little doubt that in the course of a normal // life of 70 or more years our susceptibility to bacterial and virus infection may undergo marked changes . It is , for instance , a common observation that infants seem to be more susceptible to many forms of bacterial infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bron chopneumonia are more likely to occur and bring about death in old age than in the prime of life . But susceptibility to particular micro-organisms may also alter . Young children are much more likely to contract ring-worm than adults . On the other hand , they are relatively insusceptible to chickenpox and mumps ; both these diseases are commoner in the second than in the first decade . The incidence of clinically active tubercu losis , too , tends to rise steeply after the twentieth birthday . The severity of the infection produced by a particular variety of micro-organism may also vary with the age of the patient . Perhaps the best example of this is poliomyelitis which tends to be relatively mild when contracted in early childhood , whereas the much more dangerous bulbar paralyses may occur in adults . Sex . Except that young female adults would appear to be more likely to die of tuberculosis than males of the same age , and that women are more likely to become carriers of the organisms of enteric , no differences in the sexes can be mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starvation and short-age of vitamins render the host abnormally susceptible to infection , there is actually very little evidence that such is the case . Experiments have even been carried out in which animals in a state of semi-starvation were found to be more resistant to virus infections than those whose diet was adequate . I t has also been suggested that a deficient diet may render the antibody-forming apparatus unable to carry out its functions properly , but in experi ments carried out at the end of the second world war there was no evidence that the antibody response to diphtheria toxoid was at all reduced even when the body weight was 40 per cent lower than normal.1 It would how-ever , seem probable that in the special case of tuberculosis , starvation or semi-starvation may render the individual prone to the development of infection . I t has also been suggested that lack of vitamin A in the diet might pre-dispose to infection by producing such alterations in the surface epithelium of the nasopharynx that pathogenic organisms or the normal commensals can obtain a footing and set up active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before this occurs , the changes must be gross and there is certainly no evidence that minor degrees of vitamin lack play much part in rendering the individual less resistant to infection.2 // Although there is very little experimental evidence that chronic starva tion or shortage of vitamins play very much part in rendering the popula tion as a whole more susceptible to infection , recent experiments by Dubos 1 would suggest that withdrawal of food , and particularly proteins , for a period of only 36 hours might render mice much more susceptible to infection for a short period of time . What part these experiments play in determining the onset of human infections is still doubtful , but they suggest that nutrition may have more to do with susceptibility to infection than previous work would have us believe . Fatigue . Although it is frequently assumed that bodily fatigue pre-disposes to infection , there is very little direct evidence in favour of this view . Experiments have , for instance , shown that rats fatigued to the point of exhaustion in revolving drums were less resistant than controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in resistance to either human or bovine strains of Myco. tuberculosis could be detected.2 Fatigue , or at least violent exercise using certain groups of muscles more than others during the early stages of poliomyelitis , has , however , been recently shown to result in a greater degree of paralysis in such muscles than those of the rest of the body . The endocrines . So far as is known , the endocrines have very little effect on the ability of the individual to resist bacterial infection , but there is a growing body of evidence that A.C.T.H. and cortisone can do so by re ducing the inflammatory reaction and thereby weakening the local defen sive mechanisms . Probably because of this , injection of A.C.T.H. not only renders animals more susceptible to bacterial and virus infections , but may turn a non-fatal into a fatal infection . While the differences are quite striking , it is as yet too early to judge whether variations in the ability of the individual to produce substances of this nature play much part in predisposing to infection by any particular pathogen.3 Lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnorm ally susceptible to infection , for acute tuberculosis and severe staphy lococcal infections frequently occurred in diabetes before the advent of insulin . Whether this was due to semi-starvation or to the abnormal amounts of blood sugar is quite unknown . Intercurrent infection . In a number of virus infections , such as measles and influenza , so much damage may evidently be done to the cells of the respiratory tract that other organisms , the pneumococcus , Staph. aureus and H. influenzae , for example , may not only gain an entrance to susceptible // tissues but produce an active and sometimes fatal infection . Secondary bacterial infection in other pathological conditions , such as smallpox and common colds , is also relatively common . Exposure to radiations . Doses of X-rays , which bring about marked reduction in the number of circulating white cells , may render the indivi dual less resistant to infection . Gamma rays from the explosion of atomic bombs may also reduce resistance since bacterial invasion of the tissues and blood stream was found to be relatively common amongst those surviving for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain circumstances the individual may be abnormally susceptible . This may well account for the bronchopneumonia which quite frequently attacks the oedematous and emphysematous lungs of old people ; the pyogenic infections of the naso pharynx which may follow a virus infection of that area ; or the staphy lococcal infections and tuberculosis of the lungs , which may be relatively common in severe , uncontrolled diabetes . In all these instances it is more probably some deficiency on the part of the host rather than an unusual degree of pathogenicity on the part of the organism which was the prime factor responsible for the infection . But it is difficult to believe ( as was at one time held to be the case ) that it is any deficiency on the part of the patients which is responsible for the pneumonia that may suddenly occur in previously healthy young adults , for the severe influenza which attacked nearly every member of the population in the pandemic of 1918-19 , or for the streptococcal infection of the uterus that may carry off a woman recently delivered of a baby . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influenza and Strep. pyogenes , it is much more probable that it was some attribute possessed by them , rather than a deficiency on the part of the host , which was the prime factor responsible for the production of these infections . Whatever may be the reasons for the initiation of infection , its course , severity and eventual outcome depend , in part at least , on the varying ability of the organisms to survive and multiply in the tissues , because dead , resting or dormant organisms are virtually harmless ; to produce toxic substances causing injury to the tissues in their immediate neigh bourhood and more generalized symptoms , with injury of distant organs such as the heart and brain ; and to extend their sphere of activity to other tissues in their neighbourhood and by way of the blood and lymphatic channels to other organs , because it is a rule that the more tissue infected , the more severe the illness , the greater the amount of injury , and the more likely is the patient to die . // The way in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MULTIPLICATION IN THE TISSUES We still know very little about the multiplication of the organisms in an area of inflammation . Some species of organisms , Staph. phogenes , Staph. aureus and the pneumococcus , can multiply quickly in such body fluids as serum , plasma or lymph . It is therefore to be presumed that these organisms will have little difficulty in colonizing any tissue they may reach . But other organisms , such as Satin . typhi , do not multiply in such fluids when tested in vitro and we are still in ignorance as to how precisely they succeed in doing so in the body of the patient . Other organisms such as Clostridium and Proteus vulgaris may , however , multiply if the normal alkalinity of the serum be neutralized by acid . This may ex-plain the presence of these organisms in wounds where there has been extensive necrosis of tissue , or where acid has been produced by other organisms . The viruses , on the other hand , can not multiply in the body fluids under any circumstances . They require living cells and frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long distances in search of them . The viruses which cause encephalitis are an example of this . They enter a new host by means of an insect bite but , so far as we know , they will only multiply in cells of the central nervous system ; the particular way in which they reach their area of operation is still unknown . The mechanism by which a virus particle enters a susceptible cell was also quite unknown until recently , but recent work suggests that some viruses , such as that of influenza , first attach themselves to certain muco polysaccharide receptors which are present on the cell wall . The receptors are then inactivated or destroyed by a mucinase secreted by the virus particle itself . This releases the particle and enables it to pass through the cell wall into the cytoplasm.i Whether or not the elementary particles of other viruses make use of a similar mechanism to obtain entry to cells is still quite unknown , but the fact remains that they do succeed in finding a way into the interior of cells , where they multiply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This generally so upsets the cell that it dies and necrosis occurs . This releases the particles into the surrounding tissues for the invasion of other cells in the neighbourhood . Growth of the organisms in the tissues may produce many different types of local injury that concern pathology more than bacteriology , but // in general the result is death and necrosis of cells and supporting structures in the neighbourhood of the growing organisms . The exact mechanism by which these changes are brought about is still not known , but there can be little doubt that some of the many substances such as acids , ketones and ammonium compounds produced by organisms in the course of growth may be partly responsible . Hyaluronidases , collagenases and other enzymes , too , may contribute their share . While activities of this nature play a part in almost all forms of bacterial infection , they have been investigated particularly in connection with dental caries , for which bacteria are undoubtedly partly responsible . Certain varieties of bacteria such as L. odontolyticus and Strep. mutans are comparatively common in carious teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisms are more glycolytic than almost any other variety likely to be found in human tissues . In culture media containing glucose , for example , so much acid may be formed by L. odontolyticus that the pH falls below 3.0 . It is therefore to be presumed that acids formed from carbohydrate in the food by this organism reach so high a local concentration that the calcium salts in both enamel and dentine can not resist them . And it is significant that sound teeth immersed in cultures of both this organism and Strep. mutans may become carious . PRODUCTION OF TOXAEMIA Accompanying almost all bacterial and virus infections there is some form of toxaemia which generally comprises headache , fever , increase in the pulse rate , nausea and vomiting with , in the more severe infections , delirium and finally death . It must be admitted that the mechanism by which these symptoms are produced is still largely unknown , but some may be due to relatively simple compounds resulting from the metabolism of the organisms , some may be due to the formation of specific exotoxins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most species of organisms produce acids and alcohols from carbohydrates and ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from proteins . Although such products of metabolism are probably excreted by the kidneys , it is conceivable that some may be produced in sufficient amount to cause some of the symptoms accompanying a bacterial infection . Enzymes produced by some species of bacteria may contribute to the toxaemia by acting on proteins and other substances in the tissues of the host . Urease , for example , is formed by certain species of bacteria and might produce // toxic concentrations of ammonia from the urea of the blood . What part substances produced in this way play in the toxaemia of infection is , however , still very doubtful . ' EXOTOXINS Animals are generally quite unaffected by the injection of the cell-free filtrates of broth cultures of most species of organisms . But some filtrates may cause severe symptoms and death . This is due to the formation by the organisms of soluble substances which are generally referred to as exotoxins . Roux and Yersin were the first to demonstrate the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. diphtheriae , 2 but shortly afterwards Von Behring and Kitasato showed that another was produced by Cl. tetani.3 The exotoxins produced in this way may have clear-cut physiological actions . That of CI . tetani , for example , produces localized muscular spasms or , in larger doses , generalized convulsions 12 ? 36 hours after injection into guinea-pigs , mice or rabbits . Accidental inoculation of the toxin into human beings has produced most of the cardinal signs of the disease , including spasm of the muscles of the jaw and opisthotonos.4 There seems little doubt , therefore , that nearly all the symptoms of the actual disease are due to the liberation of this toxin from the organisms in the wound . The toxin produced by C. diphtheriae behaves differently . Injected into the skin of the guinea-pig or rabbit , small doses produce erythema , and larger doses oedema and necrosis as well . Subcutaneous injection in larger doses generally causes death of the animals in 2 ? 4 days with congestion and oedema of the tissues in the neighbourhood of the injected material . The remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in the guinea-pig , are generally swollen , with acute oedema , vascular congestion , and scattered haemorrhages . If the animals recover from the primary acute toxaemia , some of them may eventually show signs of muscular paralysis . Other than the local injury brought about by the development of false membrane and the risk that it might cause sufficient obstruction of the trachea to suffocate the patient , the principal pathological changes in diphtheria of human beings are myocardial degeneration and muscular paralysis . There seems no reason to doubt that they are due to the toxin formed by the organisms . // Following the discovery that Cl. tetani and C. diphtheriae could produce exotoxins which are responsible for most of the signs and symptoms associated with infection by these organisms , many investigators attempted to produce toxins from other species of organisms . Some of these attempts were successful . It was , for instance , found that strains of Strep. pyogenes , isolated from cases of scarlet fever , liberate the so-called erythrogenic toxin which produces , when injected into the skin of human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses , many of the symptoms of scarlet fever such as a generalized erythematous rash with desquamation of the skin , increase in temperature , headache , nausea and vomiting.i Crude filtrates containing this toxin do little harm to animals but a concentrated toxin has been made which can kill rabbits . Although there can be little doubt that this toxin causes many of the symptoms of scarlet fever , it has yet to be proved that it is responsible for the toxaemia associated with non-scarlatinal infections by this organism . A fourth toxin is that produced by Staph. aureus . This toxin , usually known as alpha toxin , will produce erythema and necrosis of the skin . Injected intravenously into rabbits it may kill them within 24 hours.2 Very little is known of the part it plays during infection by this organism . A fifth toxin is that which is produced by Sh . shigae which , on injection into mice and rabbits , produces paralysis and death , but strangely enough no diarrhoea or intestinal lesions reminiscent of those seen in human cases of dysentery.3 Lastly , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangrene , Cl. welchii , septicum and oedematiens , some of which , particularly those designated as alpha toxin , are capable of killing animals . Although it is a legitimate assumption that part of the toxaemia in human gas gangrene is due to these toxins , it has been suggested that the pro-ducts of tissue breakdown may play a part as well.4 In these instances the toxin can only produce its effects if it be injected or is formed by organisms multiplying in the tissues . But , as already men tioned at the beginning of this chapter , two organisms , notably Staph. aureus and Cl. botulinum , can form toxins if allowed to multiply in suit-ble foodstuffs which , after absorption from the alimentary tract , produce definite symptoms . Although the particular manner in which these toxins are brought to bear on the tissues of the host is slightly different from that which is usual in the case of C. diphtheriae and Cl. tetani , there seems no reason to doubt that in all other respects these toxins possess the same general characteristics . // Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of purity and two at least ( those of Cl. tetani and Cl. botulinunl ) have been crystallized . Such highly purified preparations are the most toxic substances known . Thus doses of the order of 0.0001 cc of a potent botulinus toxin will kill guinea-pigs and 0.005 cc of the toxin of CI . tetani is also lethal . The dried toxin of C. diphtheriae will kill guinea-pigs in doses as small as 0.001 mgm . Other toxins are not quite so powerful . It requires 0.2 ? 03 cc of that of CI . we/chii to kill guinea-pigs and the toxin of Staph. aureus will only kill rabbits in doses of 0.5 ? 1.6 cc . It should perhaps be added that ability to produce potent exotoxins is not possessed by all strains of the organisms mentioned above . For example , only 42 per cent of 328 strains of morphologically typical C. diphtheriae , isolated from carriers , produced sufficient toxin to kill guinea-pigs , ' and variant strains of Cl. tetani have been found which are completely non-toxigenic.2 Consideration of the data given above will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strep. pyogenes , Staph. aureus and Sh . shigae produce filterable exotoxins of some degree of potency , this list omits a whole series of organisms which are quite as lethal to human beings . But despite a great deal of search it has never been possible to show that exotoxins are produced by such organisms as those of the con-typhoid group , the vibrios , or the neisseriae , to mention but a few . Clearly , therefore , exotoxins , important as they may be , are responsible for the signs and symptoms associated with infection by only a minority of the organisms responsible for human infection . ENDOTOXINS To account for the illness which may accompany infection by organisms which evidently do not produce exotoxins , it was postulated many years ago that toxic materials might be present in the bodies of the organism causing the infection . So long as the organism is alive they are sealed into its substance and harmless , but if , as usually occurs in most active infec tions , some of the organisms die and undergo autolysis , the toxins might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore called endotoxins.3 For a number of years very little was known about such substances but about twenty years ago , matters became much clearer . In a long series of experiments it was , for instance , shown that if large enough doses of killed organisms are administered by intravenous injection to rabbits , the animals may become obviously ill and death within 24 hours is not // unusual . Gram-negative organisms are much more likely to do this than Gram-positive species.1 Further experiments then showed that treatment of several species of Gram-negative organisms , such as salmonellae and shigellae , with solvents like trichloracetic acid , phenol , urea , aqueous pyridine , trypsin , diethylene glycol or chloroform brought into solution substances which , after precipitation with acetone or alcohol and subse quent dialysis , could likewise cause illness and sometimes death of animals on intravenous injection . Somewhat similar substances have been extracted from N. rneningitidis , V. cholerae , Bruce/1a abortus and Bon/etc/la pertussis . The substances in question make up from 5 ? 20 per cent of the weight of the organisms and are evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unharmed by the treatment . The chemical composition of these compounds is extremely elaborate ; they consist of polysaccharides , phospholipids and conjugated proteins and their molecular weight may be as high as 8,000,000 . They are frequently referred to as glucolipid antigens.2 As might perhaps have been expected , there is some relationship be tween ability to produce substances of this nature and ability to produce infection . For there is evidence that the glucolipid antigens of the salmon ellae are identical with or closely associated with the so-called 0 antigens of these organisms ( see Chapter 12 ) , and it is known that strains which are devoid of these antigens are incapable of causing infection . Although there is no doubt that substances of this nature can kill experimental animals , no specific changes in any particular organ have been observed following their administration . An initial hyper glycaemia followed by a hypoglycaemia with an initial lowering in the inorganic phosphorus level and a later increase have , however , been recorded.3 It is possible that somewhat similar endotoxins are produced by rickett siae and viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formalinized ( and therefore dead ) influenza virus to human beings may , for instance , produce quite severe generalized reactions com prising fever , rigors , nausea and vomiting . It has also been observed that the intraperitoneal injection of large doses of this virus might kill mice.4 Massive doses of the viruses of the **27;749;TOOLONG group , given intraperitoneally or intravenously to mice , may also produce prostration , dyspnoea and death of the animals within 24 ? 30 hours . // Large doses of living rickettsiae similarly possess a marked toxic action for mice . The symptoms comprise dyspnoea , cyanosis with convulsions , and finally death , usually within 6 hours of injection . Thus , although exotoxins may be responsible for part of the toxaemia associated with infection by a few species of organisms , endotoxins for those of other species , particularly Gram-negative varieties , and somewhat similar substances for the toxaemia of virus infections , it must be admitted that there are many other forms of infection in which there is a consider-able degree of toxaemia for which we possess no explanation . DISSEMINATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a tendency for the organisms to be confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the primary focus . But with the majority of pathogens their sphere of activity may be considerably enlarged by invasion of neighbouring tissues . In addition , further invasion along anatomical planes or by way of the lymphatics , blood stream or , with some viruses , the nerve trunks , is frequently a possibility . In this the organisms may be aided by their ability to form substances which have the property of dissolving the normal constituents of the tissues . Hyaluronidase , for instance , splits the hyaluronic acid that forms part of the mucoid cementing substance of the tissues and , in so doing , may open up channels permitting centrifugal spread of the organisms from the primary focus.I It is certainly a striking fact that Staph. aureus , Strep. pyogenes , pneumococci and the species of Clostridium which cause gas gangrene , all of which can invade the tissues in their neighbourhood , produce hyaluronidase , whereas organisms such as V. cholerae , Brucella , Haemophilus and Neisseria which do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invade.2 The clostridia which produce gas gangrene may also form collagenases and lecithinases , both of which may assist them to digest their way through muscles and other tissues.3 A fourth substance having much the same form of activity is fibrinolysin or streptokinase.4 This is formed by the streptococci , but the staphylo cocci and possibly some of the clostridia of gas gangrene may also produce it . A substance with this type of activity can not only assist the organisms in digesting their way through the fibrin barriers which some authors have described as appearing in the tissues round the infected area , but may also // promote the liquefaction of thrombosed venules ; I thanks to this , organ-isms present in blood clots may eventually reach the general circulation to produce bacteraemia . RECOVERY FROM INFECTION A number of infections , such as actinomycosis , tuberculosis and some forms of deep-seated pyogenic infection , may run an extremely chronic course and although death may be postponed for many years , the patient never actually recovers . In such cases the organisms persist in the lesions for the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the host himself is apparently unable to do more than keep them in check . On the whole this is uncommon and the usual course of events is an acute infection , with complete recovery or death as its ending . When recovery occurs , the organisms generally disappear at the onset of con valescence . But they may persist despite complete clinical recovery in such infections of the nasopharynx and intestinal canal as scarlet fever , diphtheria and enteric , and some patients may continue to harbour the organisms for the remainder of their lives . Whether the organisms disappear or persist , there is no evidence that the clinical recovery of the patient is due to any alteration in the patho genicity or virulence of the organisms . Whatever may be responsible for the cessation of the symptoms is therefore more probably some change in the host rather than in the para site ; confirmation of this is afforded by the very old observation that in many forms of infection one attack may not only render the patient resis tant to re-infection during convalescence , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is for this reason that second attacks of such diseases as diphtheria , scarlet fever , measles and mumps are so unusual . The changes undergone by the host during the acute phase of his illness , which not only determine his recovery but give him lifelong immunity , became the subject of detailed investigation almost as soon as bacteria were discovered . It would be unprofitable to review the early theories put forward to account for recovery from infection , but one of the most sig nificant advances came in 1894 and the following years , when Pfeiffer and his colleagues were studying the behaviour of the host during experi mental cholera in the guinea-pig.2 " these researches established the fact that when cholera vibrios in doses which produced severe , overwhelming infection in normal animals , were // injected into the peritoneum of guinea-pigs convalescent from experi mental cholera , they failed to produce infection at all , and quickly dis appeared . This perhaps might have been expected but their further studies were of fundamental importance , for it was shown that the plasma or serum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts into normal guinea-pigs , conferred on them ability to resist an otherwise fatal dose of cholera vibrios . Plasma or serum from normal animals , it is hardly necessary to add , had no such protective effects . Clearly , therefore , one at least of the changes which occur in the course of recovery is the appearance in the fluid portion of the blood of entirely new properties . Since these early studies , many researches have clearly established the fact that in many forms of bacterial and virus infection the circulating blood undergoes somewhat similar alterations . This is shown clearly in Fig. 6.4 , which illustrates those undergone by the blood in a case of pneumococcal pneumonia . Whereas the serum of the patient during the early stages of the disease was unable , when injected into mice , to protect them against infection and death by virulent pneumococci , // serum withdrawn about the time of recovery of the patient on the eighth day and on successive days during convalescence protected mice against many lethal doses of pneumococci . Further studies soon showed that ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of a particular variety of globulin in the plasma , serum and , to a lesser extent , other body fluids such as lymph . Because of its protective function it was given the name antibody . There seems no reason to doubt that development of antibodies plays an important part in recovery from . infection and in protecting the individual against further onslaughts by the same organism , but the particular manner in which they do so can not be discussed until antibody formation and the action of antibodies on micro-organisms have been dealt with . Further discussion must therefore be postponed to Chapter 9 . Chapter Seven ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES WHEN the reaction of the host to bacterial infection began to be studied , it soon became apparent that following recovery the circulating blood possessed properties which it had not had before the infection began . This change was found to be due to the development of new substances or antibodies which appear in the plasma or serum at the end of the acute phase of the infection . Because of their evident importance as factors concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensive study . One of the first facts to emerge was that the presence of living organisms in the tissues is unnecessary and that other forms of stimulation also re sulted in the production of antibodies . This became clear when , following the discovery of the ability of C. diphtheriae and CI . tetani to produce exotoxins , the classical researches of von Behring and Kitasato showed that by giving a series of gradually increasing doses of one of these exo toxins I animals could be trained to resist many lethal doses , that this was due to the development of circulating antibodies known as antitoxins , and that the injection of these antibodies into normal animals could pro tect them against the toxin . Not very much later it was also found that a series of injections of a sufficient number of killed organisms could similarly stimulate the immun ity apparatus to such an extent that the animal could not only survive the subsequent administration of many lethal doses of living organisms of the same strain , but that its serum could , on injection , confer a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 showed in another masterly paper that substances which had nothing whatever to do with bacteria could act in very much the same way as the exotoxins or killed organisms . For , as a result of the administration of a series of gradually increasing doses of ricin , a poison derived from the castor oil plant , mice not only became capable of with-standing many lethal doses of ricin but this protection was due to newlyPROPERTIES // acquired antibodies in their circulating blood , so that injection of their blood serum into normal mice rendered the latter equally resistant . These experiments clearly established the fact that although antibody formation is part of the reaction of the host to living organisms in the tissues , other stimuli could also evoke their formation . They are , indeed , a protective device for dealing with many foreign substances which may find their way into the tissues , but because of their obvious importance in bacterial infections , antibodies themselves , the stimuli which call them forth , and the manner in which they act , must receive fuller treatment . GENERAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substance or substances , detect-able in the plasma , serum and other body fluids , which is elaborated by certain cells of living animals following their stimulation by complex substances , known as antigens . The composition of antigens is discussed later in this chapter , but it is necessary to mention that although bacterial cells and the soluble substances such as exotoxins that they release into the surrounding tissues can act as antigens , other substances such as pro teins similarly evoke the formation of antibodies . And although antibodies are produced sooner and in larger amounts if organisms are multiplying i n the tissues , or the antigens are administered in solution by subcutaneous , intramuscular or intravenous injection , they may make their appearance following ingestion of the antigen or its intranasal instillation ; but in neither case is the response so high or so regular . I The antibodies which first appear following stimulation in this way are what are known as incomplete or univalent antibodies . They can-not be detected by the usual antigen antibody reactions referred to in detail in the succeeding chapter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existence . But if the antibody-forming apparatus is further stimulated by administration of the same antigen , complete or multivalent antibodies then appear . These can be readily detected by direct methods and it is with such antibodies that we are mostly con cerned.2 Antibodies form part of the globulin fraction of serum , albumin possess ing little or no activity . They therefore possess large and heavy molecules . I heir size has been calculated as 20 ? 50 A but their weight depends to some extent on the animal whose serum is being studied . Rabbit antibody , for instance , has a molecular weight of 160,000 , whereas that of the horse // may be as heavy as 990,0001 . There seems to be little doubt that anti-bodies consist of newly-formed beta and gamma globulins , and for this reason the total amount of globulin in the serum may increase very con siderably following repeated doses of an antigen.2 It is also of interest that the amount of antibody formed and released into the circulating blood may be many thousand times greater than the total amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.12 mgm of diphtheria toxoid stimulated the formation of 13 grams of antitoxin3 and in another , 14 grams of antitoxin were produced following injection of 16.2 mgm of the toxin of Sh . shigae.4 When antibody has appeared in the course of infection or as a result of a series of injections of antigen , it tends to disappear following recovery or the last of the injections . Nevertheless , detectable antibody reacting with the viruses concerned may remain for many years following such infections as yellow fever or poliomyelitis . From experiments with iso topic tracers , it is extremely probable that in such instances new antibody continues to be formed despite the almost certain disappearance of the organisms from the tissues.5 Specificity . One of the most important attributes of antibodies is their extreme specificity so that , in general , they will only react with the particu lar antigen used for stimulating their formation . For this reason diphtheria antitoxin will not protect animals against tetanus and sera containing antibodies reacting with the polysaccharides of type I pneumococci have no action on those of type II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of specificity may be seen with antibodies pro duced following the injection of antigens which have no connection with bacteria . Human blood serum , for instance , injected into rabbits stimulates the formation of an antibody which reacts in vitro with human serum . But this antibody will not react with the blood serum of such animals as the horse , ox , cat or dog , although it may do so , but at a much lower titre , with the serum of animals such as chimpanzees , which are more closely related to man . Tests of this nature are extensively employed in forensic medicine for the detection of the source of blood stains on clothing , etc . On the other hand , some antibodies may react with what appear to be two completely dissimilar antigens . Thus , during an attack of epidemic typhus , an antibody is developed which reacts with certain strains of // Proteus vulgaris . But epidemic typhus is due to an organism quite unlike Proteus vulgaris . The reason for the cross reaction would appear to be that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The site of formation of antibodies . Despite much experimentation , it is still not known where antibodies are produced or by which type of cell . ' It is , however , probable that the cells of the whole reticulo-endothelial system take part in the process but that the most active cells are those in the immediate neighbourhood of the antigen which is stimulating their pro-duction . Following the injection of an antigen into the pad of the foot of a rabbit , for example , the corresponding antibody first appeared in the pop-liteal lymph node and the lymph draining from it . Only later was antibody detectable in the blood.2 Other experiments have suggested that , in the rabbit , antibody may also be produced by cells in the skin , fat , muscle and cornea , while only lymph glands have so far been shown to be active in the horse . As regards man , nothing whatever is known.3 Distribution of antibodies . In general , antibodies are at their highest concentration in the blood plasma . The other body fluids may contain much less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the antibody titre in liver lymph was found to be 75 per cent of that in the blood , the leg lymph 35 per cent , the tissues of the liver , spleen , kidney , lung , uterus and skin 10 per cent . Very little antibody was found in the central nervous system . The titre of the cerebrospinal fluid was only 0.33 per cent , the brain 0.82 per cent and the spinal cord 0.49 per cent of the titre in the blood.4 Antibodies may also reach some secre-tions such as the colostrum and milk . Influenza virus neutralizing anti-body has been detected in the nasal mucus . Antibodies have also been found in the faeces of guinea-pigs in experimental infections of the intes-tinal tract by V. cholerae.5 Theories accounting for the formation of antibodies . Advances in our knowledge of protein chemistry have gone far to explain the mechanisms involved in the formation of antibodies . These suggest that antibody is a new globulin produced in cells of the reticulo-endothelial system , the stimulus being provided by the presence of molecules of antigen within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the process of synthesis the ends of the chains fold up to produce a globular or elliptical molecule which is characteristic of antibody globulin . This // folding of the peptide chains can take place in an almost infinite number of different ways . But the particular way in which they fold is governed by the shape of the antigen molecules stimulating their production . These act rather like a mould or template . This not only accounts for the speci ficity of the antibody ? for its molecule will only " fit " molecules of antigen with the same configuration ? but also for the enormous number of differ ent antibodies which can apparently be produced . ' Measurement of antibodies . If , as seems probable , antibody is newly-formed globulin , it might at first be thought that the weight of this globulin , separated from the other blood constituents would provide sufficient data for the estimation of the antibody content of any specimen of serum . Although such a method has been employed , 2 this technique does not distinguish between different antibodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method usually employed for the estimation of antibody content takes advantage of the fact that when an antigen and its antibody combine , reactions visible to the naked eye may occur . These are more specifically described in the following chapter but generally comprise the formation of precipitates when solutions are used , and with intact organisms , agglutina tion or clumping . The first step therefore involves making a series of dilutions of the serum with saline . Known volumes of these dilutions are then mixed with a measured quantity of a solution or suspension of the antigen . The mixtures are then observed and note made of the highest dilution of the serum at which the reaction can take place . This dilution is taken as the end point and is usually called the titre of the serum . For a number of reasons , estimations of the antibodies which neutralize exotoxins , and which are usually referred to as antitoxins , can not be carried out by these methods . It is necessary to use a comparative method . For this purpose a standard serum known to contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may be either a particular specimen of serum containing antitoxin or one or other of the International Standard antitoxins issued by W.H.O. The actual test is then carried out in two stages . For the first stage , a suitable dilution of the standard antitoxin is made so that a known volume contains exactly one unit of antitoxin . This volume is then added to a series of dilutions of toxin . These mixtures are then submitted to a series of tests which will indicate the presence of un neutralized toxin . This may entail death of animals , such as guinea-pigs , the production of areas of necrosis or erythema on intradermal injection , // or in vitro tests such as flocculation reactions , and the haemolysis of red cells . If the dilutions of the toxin have been judged properly , it will then be possible to ascertain the least amount of toxin which , when mixed with one unit of antitoxin , will still produce the reactions specified above . The second stage comprises the addition of the amount of toxin chosen in the first stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antitoxin content is being measured . These mixtures are then tested in the same way . Some of the mixtures will contain so much antitoxin that no reactions are produced . Others will contain so little that the reactions in the tests indicate that there is still an excessive amount of unneutralized toxin in the mixture . But over a middle zone it will be possible to identify a mixture whose behaviour indicates that only one unit of antitoxin has been added to the toxin . A suitable calculation from the dilution employed will indicate how much antitoxin per 1 cc was present in the serum under test . Antibodies which can promote the phagocytosis of resistant organisms by leucocytes can be estimated by a method which does not involve the preparation of a series of dilutions . All that is necessary is to count the number of organisms phagocyted by a chosen number of cells in the presence of the antibody and in a control preparation containing no antibody . Provided the differences are large enough , such a technique can give reasonably accurate results . ANTIBODY PRODUCTION Although antibodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much useful information can actually be obtained from patients 1z or from artificially-infected animals , considerably more may be learned about the principles which underly antibody formation by experiments in which antigens , in the form of killed organisms or solutions , are used to stimulate their formation . In such experiments the dosage and spacing of doses can be more readily controlled than is possible in infections . Number of doses of antigen required . In general , only one injection of an antigen is valueless and several are necessary to produce measurable amounts of antibody . In Fig. 7.1 it will be seen that small amounts of an antibody which brings about phagocytosis of larger numbers of streptococci than occurs in the presence of normal serum was produced as a result of two intravenous doses of killed streptococci three days apart . Nevertheless , the response was at best feeble and the antibody soon disappeared . But when five or more doses were administered , the antibody formed was not only more powerful but persisted for long periods following the last dose . Size of dose . Within limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better the response . This is demonstrated in Fig. 7.2 , in which each // rabbit received ten injections of killed streptococci at intervals of 3 or 4 days . Although the rabbit receiving 50,000,000 organisms at each injection formed a reasonable amount of antibody , it did not persist for very long , but with the larger doses ( 2000 and 5000 million organisms ) the antibody was more powerful and remained in the blood for a very long time after the last of the injections . Spacing of doses . In the preceding experiments it is obvious that the animals required about 3 weeks to produce antibody in detectable amounts . // This is a usual finding . The reasons for this delay in antibody production are still not known but the antibody-forming apparatus evidently requires a certain amount of education . After this , further doses of antigen produce a quicker and more marked response than that of a normal animal . ' this is illustrated in more detail in Fig. 7.3 . In this experiment a human being who received three doses of tetanus toxoid over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antitoxin per 1 cc of serum . His blood still contained this amount 12 months later . He was then given one dose only of toxoid . Within a week his circulating antitoxin had risen to 0.5 units and eventually reached 0.75 units . This was still // present when his blood was tested after a further 12 months . Thus , although the " education " of his antibody-forming apparatus had taken place 12 months previously , one dose of antigen produced a considerably greater response than did three doses at the start of the experiment . // Glenny and Sudmerson I have called the poor and delayed response given by animals whose antibody-forming apparatus has not been edu-cated the primary response , and the rapid and marked reponse of edu-cated animals the secondary response . This observation is of considerable practical importance , for it is obvious that in prophylactic immunization of human beings much economy of effort may be achieved if these prin-ciples are borne in mind . Variation in height of response . Different individuals vary considerably in their ability to produce antibodies . Some respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at best , extremely feeble ( see Fig. 7.4 ) . Indeed , some individuals have been detected who are evidently incapable of forming antibodies at all . Persistence of antibody after immunisation has ceased . When the anti-body level reaches its peak after a series of injections of an antigen , there is a marked tendency for the titre to fall , particularly in the early stages . The curve then tends to flatten ( see Fig. 7.6 ) and may take a very long time before it reaches zero . Persistence of antibody also depends on the individual . This is illustrated in Fig. 7.5 , showing the variations in the level of // neutralizing antibody for influenza virus in the blood of three individuals over a period of 3 years following clinical infection during January 1937 . Negative phase . When the host already possesses some antibody , another dose of the antigen , particularly if it is large , may be followed during the succeeding 3 ? 4 days by a pronounced fall in the antibody level , followed by the rise to be expected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative phase is probably due to com bination between the injected antigen and the antibody in the circulating blood ( see Fig. 7.7 ) . // Titre after blood loss . When large quantities of blood are withdrawn from an animal possessing antibody in measurable amounts , the blood which is regenerated contains antibody at nearly if not the same titre.I Simultaneous response to two or more antigens . When two or even more entirely dissimilar antigens are administered at the same time , the antibody-forming apparatus is generally equal to the task of simultane-ously producing the corresponding antibodies ( Fig. 7.8 ) . Experience has , however , shown that approximately equal quantities of antigen must be administered . If one or other greatly exceeds the rest in amount , it may " swamp " the antibody-forming apparatus . ANTIGENS The chemical substances which can stimulate the formation of anti-bodies are known as antigens . The principal requisite for an antigen would seem to be that it should have a large and heavy molecule . Possibly for this reason , inorganic compounds and the simpler organic compounds can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gelatin , prolamine , or the individual amino acids . Some of the latter may , however , // act as antigens when adsorbed on larger particles such as collodion , kaolin or charcoal . ' The antigens associated with bacteria and viruses can be divided into sessile antigens , which form part of the cell , and soluble antigens , which the cell releases into the tissues or culture medium during growth . THE SOLUBLE ANTIGENS The soluble antigens comprise the exotoxins , the haemolysins , fibrino lysins and similar substances produced by organisms . The majority are probably proteins because they can be adsorbed by charcoal or alum and precipitated by ammonium sulphate ; with the exception of botulinus toxin and the erythrogenic toxin of the streptococci , they are destroyed by proteolytic enzymes . SESSILE ANTIGENS Different compounds present in or on bacteria act as antigens . They may be somatic antigens sealed into the bacterium itself , they may be present as a capsule or they may form part of the flagella . Some of these antigens can be brought into solution by such methods as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formamide , bile or phenol , or by sonic vibrations . Study of such solutions has shown that these antigens are all elaborate chemical compounds . Polysaccharide antigens . The majority of organisms possess polysac charide antigens which are of great importance in immunity . They are all of high molecular weight , frequently acidic , and with acetyl or amino groups . They form long chain polymers with an extremely asymmetrical molecule and , because of these properties , their solutions tend to be viscous and show anisotropy of flow . Protein antigens . Proteins are present in the cells of all organisms and can act as antigens , but some are of greater importance than others and have been studied in greater detail . The so-called M substance formed by Strep. pyogenes , for instance , is soluble in 80 per cent alcohol , is heat stable , and is rapidly destroyed by both trypsin and pepsin . It has a mole cular weight of about 41,000.2 Nucleo-protein antigens . Antigens consisting of nucleoprotein have also been described . One is found in pneumococci and streptococci . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is insoluble in alcohol.3 // Glucolipid antigens . These are extremely complex substances which are formed by a number of Gram-negative organisms ( Salmonella , Shigella and Neisseria ) and , as already described in the previous chapter , are highly toxic when injected into animals . That of Sabn. tvphi , for instance , is probably a calcium salt of a phosphatide polysaccharide protein in the form of an enormous molecule with a very high molecular weight . They are relatively resistant to heat and to proteolytic enzymes . Antigens in viruses and rickettsiae . Because of their small size , it has proved difficult to demonstrate and study the antigens produced by organisms of this nature . But there seems to be little doubt that antigens are present in the elementary bodies . Those of vaccinia virus contain at least four separate antigens known as the " L " , " S " , " N. P " and " X " antigens , of which the first is probably a protein and " N.P " a nucleoprotein . Nomenclature of antigens . The chemical composition of only very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason it is not possible to employ chemical terms to describe them . They are therefore generally designated by letters of the alphabet or by Roman or Arabic numerals . Examples of this will be found in succeeding chapters . But two terms which are most commonly employed require further explanation . These are the H and 0 antigens which form part of the bacterial architecture of a number of flagellated species . These initials were derived in the following way : Proteus vulgaris normally grows as a smooth sheet over solid media because some cells , which are larger than most and evidently equipped with particularly active flagella , carry the growth over the surface . This type of growth has a slight resemblance to the film of condensation which forms when one breathes on a cold window pane . This film is described in German as Hauch . By suitable treatment it is possible to obtain strains of Proteus vulgaris which do not develop flagella and therefore do not spread over the surface like condensation on a window pane . Such strains were described as Ohne , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was found that the flagella which enabled the organism to spread possessed their own antigens , the latter were called the Hauch antigens or simply H antigens . But the antigens on the body of the organism and which had nothing to do with the spreading of the growth were called 0 antigens . This terminology was later applied to the flagellar and body ( or somatic ) antigens of other flagellated species of organisms , particularly the salmonellae . IIAI ' ' II:NES AND ARTIFICIAL ANTIGENS As already mentioned , solutions of proteins such as egg albumin or the // exotoxins produced by organisms will , on injection into animals , stimulate the formation of antibodies . But solutions of the polysaccharide which constitutes the capsule of the pneumococcus , for example , may not stimu late the formation of antibodies . When , however , suspensions of pneumo cocci with their capsules intact are injected , antibodies for these substances are formed which will react with solutions of the polysaccharide . Obviously , the polysaccharide is antigenic ( i.e. capable of stimulating the formation of antibodies ) when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not antigenic when in solution . Landsteiner named substances with this character haptenes , and suggested that while they were present on the cell they are linked to a larger molecule , probably that of a protein . Because of this linkage they are able to stimulate the formation of antibodies . ' In order to prove this point , he was able to produce artificial antigens having this type of construction . Relatively simple chemical compounds , which by themselves are quite incapable of stimulating antibody formation , were coupled with proteins . The resulting complex was antigenic , stimu lating the formation of antibodies which reacted in vitro not only with the complex but with the coupled substances alone . Thus meta-amino benzene-sulphonic acid is unable to act as an antigen , but when coupled with a protein it then became antigenic . Accordingly the resulting complex , injected into rabbits , stimulated the formation of antibodies which reacted with **27;778;TOOLONG acid . A compound which behaves in this way when coupled to proteins has been called a " determinant group " and it would seem . very probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the complex making the complete antigen . It certainly has much to do with the speci ficity of antigen antibody reactions , for in the experiment with meta aminobenzene-sulphonic acid referred to above , the antibody formed as a result of its injection had little or no action on the ortho- or para-amino benzene-sulphonic acids . Stereo-isomers of tartaric acid , l-tartaric , d-tartaric and 1n-tartaric acids , coupled with proteins , behave in the same highly specific fashion . Thus it would appear that the antibody-forming apparatus can be stimulated by relatively simple substances provided they are coupled to larger molecules , and can distinguish between chemical compounds in the determinant groups whose only differences are in the position of atoms in the benzene ring in the case of the aminobenzene sulphonic acids , or in the spatial relationship of the different constituents in the tartaric acids . Not only are these experiments of great theoretical interest but they also provide a possible explanation for some forms of hypersensitivity // to certain substances manifested by human beings . Such sensitivity is probably dependent on the presence of antibodies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances are not generally antigenic . Aspirin or the constituents of certain pollen grains belong to this category . It has , therefore , been suggested that on some previous occasion individuals who are hypersensitive to such substances had absorbed some which had then combined with their own proteins in such a way that they acted as determinant groups . The resulting pro-antigen , as it has been called , might then elicit the formation of antibodies . ' ToxolDs Most , if not all , of the toxicity of the exotoxins may disappear on pro-longed incubation at 37 ? C. This is greatly hastened in the presence of formaldehyde or iodine trichloride . Toxin treated in this way may become completely harmless . But it will still act as an antigen , stimulating the formation of antitoxin . Such modified toxin is called toxoid . COMPLEMENT In many antigen antibody reactions a second substance present in the serum plays an essential part in the reaction . This substance is complement or alexine , from the Greek , clAEety , to defend.2 Complement possesses quite different properties from those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or so at room tempera ture . Exposure to a temperature of 56 ? C for only 30 minutes renders it inactive ( antibodies , on the other hand being unaffected by this degree of heating ) . Complement is present in the serum of all mammals and does not in-crease in amount during immunization , or as a result of infection . It is also non-specific , in the sense that the complement required for comple ment fixation reactions is probably the same as that which is required for hacteriolysis . It is possible that the complement present in the serum of some species may be different from that of other species , but very little is actually known about variations of this nature . There is evidence that it is a complex substance probably consisting of four fractions , C'l , C ' 2 , ( " 3 and C ' 4,3 all of which form part of the globulin fraction of the serum . 1 n practice , fresh serum from guinea-pigs is used to provide complement in antigen antibody reactions . // THE FUNCTION OF ANTIBODIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies is fundamentally a mechanism for dealing with foreign protein and other substances with large molecules which may from time to time reach the tissues of the host . Many of these substances are harmless but antibodies , capable of reacting with them , are formed and may even assist the host in ridding himself of them . But some of these substances are either poisonous or enable micro-organisms to survive and multiply in the tissues . The ability of antibodies to combine with these substances is undoubtedly of considerable importance to the host , for in the process their poisonous or other noxious qualities are neutralized . Discussion of these aspects must be postponed to a later chapter . Chapter Eight ANTIGEN ANTIBODY REACTIONS WHEN antibodies were first discovered , the only method available for detecting them depended on their ability to prevent death of animals from bacterial invasion or toxaemia . But in the intervening years other methods have been discovered , some of which have proved of great value for elucidating the mechanism of antigen antibody reactions , for the diag nosis of disease , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when an antibody is brought into contact with an antigen , the two substances combine . As a result of this combination certain changes take place in the solubility of the combination , or in the behaviour of micro-organisms containing the antigens . Many of these changes can be detected by suitable in vitro tests . PRECIPITATION One of the most important alterations which occur when a solution of antigen is added to an antibody is the development of a white , flocculent precipitate . The first phase of the reaction consists in the development of a milky-white haziness in the mixture which may become so marked as to render it opaque . Minute particles or floccules then appear . These gradually coalesce to form larger masses which slowly fall to the bottom of the tube . In the later phases , all that can be seen is a white precipitate at the bottom of the tube with a clear supernatant fluid above . A second method is to place the serum containing the antibody in the bottom of a small tube , and then carefully float the solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on the surface . At the junction of the solution of antigen and the serum containing the antibody , a narrow ring of precipitation appears which can be seen best by direct illumination against a black background . This is frequently referred to as the ring test . In many respects the precipitin reaction is different from that form of precipitation which occurs when two inorganic crystalloids , such as barium chloride and sulphuric acid , are mixed , because both antigens and anti-bodies are colloids . When in solution they are hydrophilic colloids ; that // is to say , they consist of molecules of antigen or antibody surrounded by masses of water molecules . It is the presence of these water molecules that keeps them in solution . But when the antigen and antibody are mixed , their molecules adhere to one another . Under such conditions the antigen antibody complex becomes a hydrophobic colloid ; that is , the water molecules disperse . Facilitated by the presence of electrolytes , the antigen antibody complex tends to go out of solution . The complexes formed in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if there are a sufficient number they form floccules which are visible to the naked eye . These , too , may coalesce , producing quite large masses of amorphous precipitate . Analyses of the precipitates produced in this way have shown that they contain both antigen and antibody , but that about seven-eighths consists of antibody ) The particular manner in which the two combine is still a subject for controversy , one theory holding that the antibody forms a shell or coating round the antigen molecules , while the other ( the lattice theory ) maintains that both the antigen and antibody molecules each possess one or more " specific combining sites " , by which they can adhere to one another , the remainder of their surfaces being inactive . In this way the combination tends to form an openwork lace pattern or lattice.2 In what-ever way the antigen and antibody combine they are undoubtedly bound together very tightly and intimately , but neither antigen nor antibody // necessarily lose their identity in the process . It may indeed be possible to disrupt the complexes after their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second peculiarity of this reaction is that although the antigen and antibody molecules combine , no matter what their relative numbers may be , the formation of visible floccules or precipitates does not necessarily or invariably occur . That this is the case can be deduced from experi ments in which gradually increasing amounts of one component are added to constant amounts of the other component . The results obtained in an experiment of such a nature are given in Table 8.1 , in which different amounts of antigen ( horse protein ) were added to the same amounts of antibody produced in a rabbit . As might have been expected , in mixtures containing only very small quantities of antigen , i.e. where only 0.0003 cc or less was present , there was no precipitation . As the quantity of antigen increased from 0.0004 cc to 0.0012 cc , a gradually increasing amount of precipitate was formed . Where this was greatest , it would have been possible by suitable methods to show that all the antigen and all the anti-body have combined and appear in the precipitate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still further increases in the amount of antigen added did not increase the amount of precipitate formed . Indeed , precisely the opposite occurred , the amount of precipitate becoming less and less until , in the mixtures containing 0.0018 cc or more , there was actually no precipitation at all . The mixtures in which this occurred are known as the " prozone " . A similar type of result would have been obtained had varying amounts of antibody been added to constant amounts of antigen . In consequence there would be a prozone where there was little or no precipitation in the presence of too large amounts of antibody , a middle zone where there was maximal precipitation , and an end zone where there was no precipitation because there was too little antibody to bring it about . It is possible to show that in experiments of this nature , combination between the antigen and antibody actually occurs in the mixtures con stituting the prozone despite the formation of only small amounts of precipitate or even none at all . But for maximal precipitation to occur , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be in nicely balanced amounts or , as Dean has expressed it , in " optimal pro portions " . i Thus , useful as the formation of a precipitate may be as an indicator that combination between an antibody and an antigen has occurred , the absence of visible precipitation does not necessarily imply t hat no such combination has occurred . In the account given above , the antigen was an animal protein . But // bacterial antigens react in the same way with the appropriate antibodies , that is to say , precipitates consisting of complexes of antigen and anti-body are produced . In such experiments , a filtrate of a suitable culture can be employed to provide the soluble antigens such as toxins and haemo lysins , but the sessile antigens , such as the capsular polysaccharide of the pneumococcus , must be brought into solution by methods referred to in the preceding chapter . The results obtained when a soluble antigen ( diphtheria toxin ) is mixed with the appropriate antibody ( antitoxin ) are given in Table 8.2 . It will be observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner from the preceding experiment in that constant quantities of antigen are added to gradually increasing amounts of the antibody . A second point of difference is in the method of recording the results , the time at which opalescence first appears in each tube being given for each mixture . This is employed because this is easier to determine than volumes // of precipitate and it is known that the largest amount of precipitate will eventually appear in the tube which first shows signs of opalescence . In all other essentials , this is another example of a precipitin reaction ) Because antibodies are highly specific , combining only with the antigen that stimulated their formation by an animal , it follows that precipitation reactions are equally specific . NEUTRALIZATION OF TOXINS BY ANTIBODIES In the preceding section it was shown that when the toxin formed by t he diphtheria bacillus was mixed with its appropriate antibody , floccula-tion and precipitation occurred due to the formation of complexes of antigen ( toxin ) and antibody ( antitoxin ) . Although the toxin and anti142 ANTIGEN ANTIBODY REACTIONS toxin in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the toxin has lost its ability to kill animals . It is therefore spoken of as being neutralized . If , therefore , a series of mixtures are made in which gradually decreasing quantities of antitoxin are added to the same quantities of toxin , and the same dose of each mixture injected into animals susceptible to the toxin , those receiving mixtures in which there is sufficient antitoxin to combine with and neutralize the toxin will live , those in which there is insufficient antitoxin to neutralize all the toxin will show symptoms but recover , while those receiving mixtures where most of the toxin is free and uncombined will die . ' AGGLUTINATION In discussing the precipitin reaction , it was mentioned that antigens present in the bodies of bacteria could , after being brought into solution , react with the homologous antibody and produce precipitates . When intact organisms are used , the only point of contact between antigen and antibody is at their surface . Even so , the antibody still combines with the antigen . In consequence , addition of large numbers of organisms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in the " absorption " of all this particular antibody . This combination between antibody and the antigen on the surface of the organisms has profound effects on the subsequent behaviour of the organisms themselves . In the absence of an antibody , most species of bacteria float freely and show no tendency to adhere to one another . But in serum containing an antibody reacting with one or other of their anti- // gens , the organisms stick to one another and eventually form clumps which are large enough to be visible to the naked eye . This reaction is known as agglutination and probably occurs in two stages . The first stage is the combination between the antigen and the anti-body in the form of a thin film of antibody globulin on the surface of the organisms . This alone will not cause agglutination . The second stage con sists in the ionization of this layer , a process which evidently requires salts in solution . This brings about depression of the surface charge below a certain critical level . When organisms in this condition collide , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger and larger masses leading to visible agglutination are produced. , This reaction has been extensively employed to detect the various anti gens of which organisms are composed . And although the same results might have been obtained employing precipitin reactions with the anti gens in solution following disruption of the organisms , this process is not only time consuming but may be very difficult to achieve . Agglutination exhibits the same high degree of specificity as precipitin reactions . On occasions this may be troublesome for it has already been pointed out that no organism consists of a formless and undifferentiated mass of protoplasm . It always contains two and sometimes more antigens in its body or on its surface while , if it possesses flagella , these provide still more antigens . If the intact organism is present in the tissues , each of these antigens stimulates the formation of its own antibody . In consequence , sera from patients or immunized animals may possess several distinct antibodies , each of which will combine with its own antigen to bring about agglutination . Under such circumstances , crude agglutination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related under Practical Applications , at the end of this chapter , it is possible to get over these difficulties in various ways . NEUFELD QUELLUNG REACTION When an organism which possesses a well-marked capsule , such as the pneumococcus , is placed in serum containing an antibody which will produce precipitation with solutions of the polysaccharide , of which the capsule is composed , there is combination between the capsular substance and the antibody . This produces marked alterations in the capsule which can be detected microscopically . This was first observed by Neufeld2 and is usually referred to as the Neufeld quellung ( swelling ) reaction . Within a few seconds of adding the antibody to the organism , its capsule // becomes less translucent and therefore more visible , while its outline is more clearly defined . Because of this , the capsules appear to be two or three times their normal diameter . ' They also become liquefied so that if , as is usually the case , agglutination occurs at the same time , the boundaries between the individual capsules disappear and the organisms can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although chiefly studied with the pneumococcus , a similar change has been observed when other capsulated organisms , such as K. pneumoniae , H. influenzae type B or N. meningitidis group I , are immersed in serum-containing antibodies for the substances of which their capsules arc composed . // THE PROMOTION OF PHAGOCYTOSIS If , as would seem probable , the capsules of such organisms as the pneu-mococcus serve to protect them from phagocytosis , it might be assumed that when an antibody produces the swelling and alteration of the capsule which is visible in the Neufeld quellung reaction , this would deprive the capsule of its ability to protect the organism . Whether such be the case or not , many experiments have certainly shown that , in the presence of the antibody which reacts with the capsular polysaccharide , this organism becomes amenable to phagocytosis . As already mentioned in a preceding chapter , surface antigens on other organisms , such as Strep. pyogenes or Salm. typhi , may likewise protect against phagocytosis . In the presence of antibodies reacting with these antigens , nothing resembling the Neufeld quellung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antibody acts on the antigen in the same way and renders it useless as a protective covering . In consequence , phagocytosis of previously resistant organisms becomes possible . Some-thing of this nature can be shown to occur with Strep. pyogenes where the surface antigen concerned is the M substance , I and with Salm. typhi where it is the Vi antigen.2 Both these organisms can be phagocyted in the pres-ence of the appropriate antibodies for these antigens ( see Table 8.3 ) . // Other experiments have shown that a high proportion of the organisms which have been phagocyted in this way are killed by the phagocytes . Virulent strains of streptococci , for instance , which resist phagocytosis show no diminution in numbers when placed in normal defibrinated blood , and they may even multiply . But in the presence of an antibody reacting with the M substance , abundant phagocytosis occurs , the bacterial population falls rapidly , and complete sterilization may occur ( see Table 9.1 ) . BACTERIOLYSIS It was shown in Chapter 6 that probably because they possess 0 anti gens , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholerae could resist the bacteriolytic action of normal serum devoid of specific antibodies . But if such organisms are placed in serum containing an antibody reacting with the 0 antigens , combination between the two will occur . This , as might be expected , brings about agglutination . But it has other effects . For the organisms are sensitized to the action of com plement . If , therefore , small quantities of fresh guinea-pig serum contain ing complement be added to the mixture , it is possible to show that many of the organisms are killed and there may be no survivors afterwards.I In suitable preparations it can also be shown that they undergo marked changes in morphology . The organisms lose their motility and become swollen and rounded . In course of time they may even become globular and then burst , leaving only a formless mass of debris.2 Precisely similar changes may be seen when living virulent V. cholerae are injected into the peritoneum of a guinea-pig recovered from experi mental cholera . The antibody formed during infection , together with the complement provided by the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas a similar dose of V. cholerae injected into a non-immune animal survive , multiply , and kill it . Since this was first observed by Pfeiffer , it is frequently referred to as the Pfeiffer pheno menon , 3 but equal credit must be given to Bordet4 for elucidating its underlying mechanism . It should be added that for some reason antibodies capable of bringing about bacteriolysis are never formed in the course of infection or immuni zation with Gram-positive cocci , such as Staph. aureus , Strep. pyogenes or the pneumococcus. // ANTIBODIES ACTING ON VIRUSES AND RICKETTSIAE The antigens in the elementary bodies of the viruses stimulate the forma-tion of antibodies during infection by the virus concerned . Similar anti-bodies may appear following a series of injections of killed elementary bodies . The antibody combines with the antigens in the virus particles in the same way as do the antibodies for larger organisms , such as bacteria . Provided sufficiently heavy suspensions of virus are employed , agglutina-tion may occur as a result of this combination . But of considerably greater importance is the fact that virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not produce the usual lesions if injected into suitable animals , fertile eggs or tissue cultures . This is known as virus neutralization ( see Table 8.4 ) .1 It is , however , necessary to add that virus neutralization must not be confused with the bacteriolysis which occurs when the larger visible bacteria are acted upon by antibody and complement , for there is no dis-solution of the virus particles nor is complement required . Indeed , the union between antibody and virus is for a time unstable , so that by suit-able methods it is possible to dissociate the one from the other , leaving // the virus particle alive and still capable of producing infection , despite its previous union with the antibody . COMPLEMENT FIXATION The antibodies responsible for all the reactions discussed above are heat-stable , resisting 56 ? C for 30 minutes . In antigen antibody reactions such as precipitation , the results with heated and unheated sera are gener ally the same . But if complement be present ( as , for instance , may occur if the serum is fresh or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the mixtures ) it does take part in the reaction and is evidently absorbed into the antigen antibody aggregates . This was first detected by Gengou I but was studied in considerable detail by Deane and Goldsworthy.3 Several methods might conceivably be employed to demonstrate the incorporation of complement in the aggregates , but that which is invari ably used nowadays takes advantage of the fact that the serum of rabbits which have received a number of injections of sheeps ' red cells contains an antibody ( haemolysin ) which will lyse or dissolve sheeps ' red cells , releasing the haemoglobin into solution . But this antibody can produce haemolysis only if complement be present , and in its absence the cells remain intact . A mixture of sheeps ' red cells and the haemolytic antibody can therefore be used as an indicator for the presence of the unadsorbed complement . Comparative studies have shown that complement may be adsorbed in mixtures where so little antigen is present that visible precipitates are either not formed at all , or are so small that they could easily be missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect antigen antibody reactions where it is difficult to obtain sufficiently concentrated solutions of antigens . Tests of this nature have been extensively employed for the diagnosis of syphilis . For some unknown reason , the antibodies developing in the course of infection by Tr. pallidum combine with a cholesterolized extract of heart muscle , but do not necessarily produce aggregates or precipitates visible to the naked eye . They do , however , adsorb complement if it is present . The serum of normal persons , on the other hand , being devoid of the antibody , does not react with the muscle extract , so that the comple ment is left free and unadsorbed . Detection of the antibody in this way constitutes the Wassermann reaction . Subsequent to its introduction , it became possible to make stronger // extracts of heart muscle which produce visible precipitation when added to the antibodies in the serum of syphilitics . This reaction forms the basis of the Kahn test . In all essentials , therefore , the Wassermann and Kahn tests are the same , the only difference being the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for detecting its combination with the antibody . Besides the Wassermann test for the detection of syphilitic antibodies , complement fixation has also been employed for detection of antibodies in other forms of infection such as those due to Myco. tuberculosis and N. gonorrhoeae . It has also been invaluable for the detection of antibodies in many forms of virus infection . In all these instances a suspension of the organisms concerned is used as the antigen . OTHER EXAMPLES OF ANTIGEN ANTIBODY REACTIONS In addition to the antigens which are released when the bodies of the organisms undergo autolysis and toxins or haemolysins which they liberate into the tissues during an infection , a number of other substances such as fibrinolysin , hyaluronidase , collagenase , etc. , which assist the organisms to invade the tissues , are also released . Most of these substances are also antigenic and provoke the formation of antibodies by the host . In suitable preparations in the test tube , these antibodies can generally be shown to prevent the particular activity by which the antigens concerned can be detected . Thus , patients with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by the organisms and suitable immunized animals may possess antibodies capable of neutralizing the collagenases , hyaluronidases and lecithinases produced by the various species of Clostridium which cause gas gangrene . It is not necessary to detail these antibodies or to describe the methods whereby they can be detected . Suffice it to say that they are formed in the course of infection or immunization and that , so far as we know , they behave in the same general way as other antibodies . THE MODE OF ACTION OF ANTIBODIES In the above discussion of antigen antibody reactions it may not have escaped the reader that the combination between an antigen and an antibody may be detected in more than one way . Thus , if we consider an antigen which forms part of the architecture of an organism , it will , when brought into solution , form precipitates with the antibody , but if the antigen is in its place in the organism , the antibody will bring about agglutination and if the antigen is present in sufficient quantity to form a capsule , there will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteriologists would have considered that three different antibodies were responsible for these different activities and would , therefore , have spoken of the particular serum used in the above instance as containing agglutinins , precipitins and capsular swelling antibodies . There is , however , so much evidence that the same antibody is actually responsible for all these various activities that the old idea of a multiplicity of antibodies , each reacting in a different way , has now been generally abandoned and replaced by the modern unitarian hypothesis , which simply implies that one antibody may be detectable in a variety of ways depending on the particular manner in which the antigen is brought into contact with it . Nevertheless , in most forms of bacterial infection , more than one antigen is released by the organisms and more than one antibody is formed . The picture may , therefore , in practice , become extremely complicated . But discussion of the relative importance of the antibodies must be postponed to the next chapter . PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The detection of antibodies in one or other of the ways mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the practical business of diagnosing infection and judging the success of immunization procedures . Antibodies can also be used for the detection of antigens in bacteria , and may possess considerable value as therapeutic agents . These activities must be discussed . DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE When it was first realized that antibodies appear in the circulating blood during infection , it was not long before their detection was invoked as an aid for the diagnosis of infection , particularly enteric or diseases such as yellow fever , syphilis and brucellosis , where the isolation of the causative organism may be difficult , if not impossible . The particular technique used for the detection of the antibodies is largely governed by convenience . In enteric and brucellosis , agglutination reactions are employed . In syphilis , precipitation or complement fixation , and in yellow fever it is virus neutralization . Further details of the methods used , the results to be expected and the precautions to be taken in assessing them , are given when the organisms are discussed in Chapters 15-24 . IMMUNIZATION Antibodies can also be employed to gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , the assumption being made that if antibodies develop to a sufficiently high titre the individual is thereby protected // against infection . This may involve estimations of the antitoxin level in the blood following immunization against tetanus , the use of the Schick test in immunization against diphtheria and agglutination reactions following the administration of killed organisms to prevent enteric . The more important of these procedures are referred to in greater detail in Chapter 11 . SEROLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF BACTERIA The discovery that antigen antibody reactions are extremely specific showed that it was possible to employ antibodies to detect one antigen even when a great many are present . This has been applied to what is commonly called the antigenic analysis of micro-organisms . It is therefore necessary to obtain a series of sera , each of which contains only one antibody capable of reacting with a known antigen . For this purpose the obvious procedure is to give to animals a series of injections of killed organisms whose antigenic constitution is already known , until they produce antibodies in sufficient titre . Their serum would ordinarily contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the suspensions and would therefore be virtually useless . But various expedients can be employed to get over this difficulty and provide serum containing only one antibody . Some of the animals may , for instance , react peculiarly in that an antibody is produced for only one antigen . Other animals may produce an antibody in high titre for one antigen , whereas those for the other antigens are in such low titre that they can be disregarded . A third expedient is to " absorb " the serum with organisms possessing some of the antigens but not others , thus removing some at least of the unwanted antibodies . Still another expedient is to annul or inactivate some of the antigens by suitable treatment before the organisms are used to stimulate antibody production . In one or other of these ways a reasonably pure reagent , that is , a serum containing only one antibody reacting with a known antigen , can generally be obtained . The detection of antigens in organisms using reagents of this description can be carried out by agglutination reactions or by precipitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable methods of extraction . Here again it is unnecessary to go into detail , but where these methods are applicable they are referred to in Chapters 15-25 . PASSIVE IMMUNIZATION When antibodies were first shown to be frequently present in the blood stream following recovery from infection , attempts were made to bring about cure of active infections by injection of antibodies . If they can not be obtained from human convalescents , the only alternative is the production of antibodies in animals . For this purpose , large animals such as horses or oxen are employed and a long series of injections of suitable antigens given to ensure their producing antibodies with very high titres . When this has been achieved , and it may take 6 months or longer , large bleedings can then be taken and the plasma separated from the cells . Crude plasma is not suitable for treatment of human beings and it is invariably purified and concentrated before use . For this purpose , precipitation with ammonium sulphate or peptic digestion are employed . As a result , a soluTREATMENT // tion is obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally been concentrated about 100 times and from which most of the unwanted blood constituents such as the albumen and those portions of the globular complex not associated with antibodies , have been removed . Before the introduction of modern chemotherapy , the only specific treatment available for many forms of infection was serum made in this way . These sera were , for the most part , " antibacterial " , that is to say , they were made by injecting the organisms themselves and contained antibodies which it was presumed would assist the patient in killing the organisms . It is very doubtful whether most of them were of much value and sulphonamides or antibiotics have accordingly ousted them . But " antitoxic sera " , which neutralize the toxins , are still used for the prevention and treatment of diphtheria , tetanus and gas gangrene . They are referred to in more detail in Chapter 11 . Chapter Nine ANTIBODIES IN PREVENTION OF AND RECOVERY FROM INFECTION BY MICRO-ORGANISMS IN the preceding chapters the antibodies which make their appearance following infection or immunization were described , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results which may follow this combination . In this chapter it is necessary to complete the story with a description of the part played by antibodies in infection . ANTIBODIES AND THE PREVENTION OF INFECTION Antibodies reacting with the organisms or their products are usually present in the blood stream following an infection and such individuals are immune for a time , if not for the rest of their lives . Similarly , people who have received a sufficient number of injections of killed organisms or their toxins may be rendered immune to infection by virulent strains . The question therefore arises as to whether immune individuals are pro tected from infection because of the development of antibodies or by reason of some other change in their tissues , rendering them unsuitable hosts for the organisms . This is by no means easy to answer shortly and concisely , but one of the most cogent arguments in favour of the hypothesis that antibodies play a large part in producing such immunity is that it is possible to trans fer a similar high degree of resistance to normal animals by injecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , possible to obtain a fair amount of local immunity with-out an accompanying increase in antibody level of the circulating blood , or increase in the immunity of all parts of the body . Injection of strepto cocci into the skin of one flank of a rabbit may , for instance , produce a local erysipelas-like infection which eventually heals . When the skin returns to normal , a second injection of streptococci into the same area may fail to cause infection at all or produces only a minor lesion . But the same dose of organisms injected into the other flank may produce a lesion of the usual size and severity . ' // These experiments suggest that an absence of circulating antibodies does not necessarily indicate that the host is as susceptible to infection as is the normal person . But , conversely , there seems to be little doubt that if antibodies develop , they do play a part in producing the total , or almost total , resistance of the convalescent to infection . Discussion of the manner in which they achieve this protection is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INFECTION There is no doubt that during the early acute stages of most bacterial and virus infections , antibodies reacting with the organisms or the soluble substances they release into the tissues are either absent altogether or only present in very low titre , but that they can generally be detected in the circulating blood about the time of recovery and remain for a longer or shorter time afterwards . The antibodies in question are formed by the host as part of his response to the presence of the organisms in his tissues , but since most organisms possess several sessile antigens and liberate other soluble antigens into the tissues , it follows that a number of different antibodies are generally formed in the course of an infection . Some of them are almost certainly of greater importance to the host in his effort to combat the invaders than others . But discussion will be facilitated if the antibodies formed in the course of infection be divided into three categories : those concerned with the destruction of the organisms ; those playing a part in the neutralization of the exotoxins ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which assist the organisms in their efforts to enlarge their sphere of operations . ANTIBODIES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ORGANISMS The part played by antibodies in the elimination of living organisms from the infected area can best be described by reference to certain forms of infection in which the necessary investigations have been carried out . Pneumococcal infections have received a considerable amount of attention . The pneumococcus almost certainly owes its pathogenic ability to its polysaccharide capsule which protects the organism from phagocytosis . But in the course of infection an antibody develops which , as pointed out in the preceding chapter , can combine with the capsule to produce agglutination of the organisms and the alterations in appearance , known as the Neufeld quellung reaction . Probably as a result of the latter the organism then becomes amenable to phagocytosis and destruction by intracellular digestion . But it is necessary to add that , so far as is known , neither this antibody nor any other developed in the course of infection has any direct bactericidal effect on the organism . // The appearance of this antibody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in considerable detail by Robertson and his co-workers , using a method in which the serum of the patient actually induces the phagocytosis and destruction of resistant pneumococci by normal phagocytes . It is evident from Fig. 9.1 that during the early stages of pneu-monia the serum of the patient was devoid of an antibody having this action , but about the time of crisis it appeared in high titre and persisted for some time afterwards . In fatal cases , however , the antibody generally failed to appear . Thus it would seem probable that , in pneumonia , re-covery largely depends on the prompt production of an antibody whose presence can be detected in a number of ways , but whose principal func-tion would seem to be its ability to disrupt the protective capsule round the organism and so render the latter amenable to phagocytosis and destruc-tion.I In infections by Strep. pyogenes the reaction of the host resembles that which occurs in pneumonia . No antibody develops which is capable of direct bactericidal action on the organism . But antibodies appear which // can combine with the surface protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of Strep. pyogenes to resist the phago-cytic mechanisms of the normal individual . This antigen is never thick enough to be actually visible as a capsule , for which reason nothing re-sembling a Neufeld quellung reaction can be seen when the antibody is added to the organism . But this antibody certainly enables normal phagocytes to take up and destroy resistant Strep. pyogenes . There is no doubt that it makes its appearance in the course of infection.l A purely intestinal infection such as cholera is probably combated by a different mechanism . In this disease the organisms are limited to the bowel and there is little or no aggregation of leucocytes into the infected area . It is therefore unlikely that phagocytosis plays much part in dealing with the organisms . But probably because of the presence of the 0 antigen , virulent cholera strains can resist the bacteriolytic activity of normal serum and the other body fluids . In the course of the disease antibodies for this antigen rapidly appear . Such antibodies produce agglutination of the organisms in suitable in vitro preparations.2 Agglutination per se is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is probably the same anti-body can sensitize the organism for lysis by complement . Such an anti-body has been demonstrated in the blood and lumen of the intestine in guinea-pigs recovering from experimental infection.3 Dysentery resembles cholera in many respects and the reaction of the host would seem to be similar in character . Antibodies detectable by agglutination make their appearance in the circulating blood , but some at // least of these antibodies can also sensitize the organisms and render them susceptible to lysis by complement . Such antibodies have also been detected in the faeces.I Typhoid fever has been studied in great detail . The organisms respon-sible possess at least three antigens , the H , O and Vi antigens . Antibodies for each antigen appear in the blood stream during infection and can be detected by agglutination reactions ( see Table 9.2 ) . There is , however , no evidence that the H antigen assists the organisms to resist the normal defensive mechanisms of the host or that the H antibody assists the host in combating the organisms during actual infections . But the Vi antigen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which develops during infection can overcome this. I The 0 antigen probably protects the organisms against lysis by complement in the body fluids of normal individuals . But the 0 antibody renders them susceptible to lysis.2 This antibody certainly develops in the course of infection.3 It is therefore to be presumed that both Vi and 0 antibodies play a part in recovery of the patient , but it must be admitted that they frequently appear long before recovery actually takes place and relapses may occur even when they are present in high titre , Less is known about the mechanisms involved in combating infection by the Gram-negative cocci , N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis , but it is very probable that antibodies able to bring about their lysis by comple ment are the principal agents concerned.4 A similar antibody probably plays an important part in leptospiral infections.5 In regard to other spirochaetal infections such as syphilis , our inability to cultivate Tr. pallidum renders investigations of this nature very difficult . Nevertheless , it was shown many years ago that the serum of syphilitics could agglutinate Tr. pallidum , render it non-motile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More recent investigations have shown that 30 per cent of patients in the primary stage of syphilis and 63 ? 67 per cent in the later stages possess such an antibody. ? The part played by antibodies in recovery from infections by viruses and rickettsiae is still controversial . Some authors have even considered that whatever immunity developed was a pure tissue immunity in which anti-bodies played no part.8 This has , however , been largely abandoned and there seems little doubt that antibodies play the same important part in recovery from such infections as those due to bacteria . The elementary bodies of the rickettsiae and some of the viruses are large enough to make suspensions which can be used for agglutination reactions . There is no doubt that antibodies capable of producing agglutination of the elementary bodies make their appearance in the course of these infections . In this respect , therefore , the antibody response
