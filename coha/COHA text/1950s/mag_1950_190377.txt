When young ( 22 ) Pancho Gonzales turned pro last fall , U.S. amateur tennis lost the top man on its totem pole-and the only player in sight who might have sat it out for a while . At Forest Hills last week , the low men were scrambling for Pancho 's old spot . The result was a good deal like the confusion in the heavyweight division when Joe Louis hung up his gloves . <P> Theoretically , this should have been Australia 's year . The Aussies had just trounced the U.S. ( four matches to one ) for the Davis Cup . But in the National Singles last week , the Aussies played like men still in a happy trance over winning the international cup , and as if anything else was anticlimax . By the quarterfinals , the Australian first-liners-Frank Sedgman , Jack Bromwich and Ken McGregor - had all been upset by less-favored Americans . <P> Early this week , by scrambling their way into the semifinals , four men had as good a claim as anybody else to be considered the pick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 in . ) Lefthander Art Larsen , 25 , of San Leandro , Calif. , No. 6 in U.S. rankings . Larsen , a steady , unspectacular stroker who had wanted to play on the Davis Cup team himself , had had the satisfaction of putting out Davis Cupper Tom Brown . <P> Long-legged , ungainly Dick Savitt , 23 , of Orange , N.J. One of the most improved young players at Forest Hills ( No. 16 last year ) , Savitt had beaten Australia 's Bromwich to enter the semifinals . <P> Blond , crew-cut Herbie Flam , 21 , U.C.L.A. senior , and victor in the 1950 Clay Court Championships where he defeated the U.S. 's No. 1 Davis Cupper , Ted Schroeder . <P> I Tall , dark &; handsome Gardnar Mulloy , 36 , of Coral Gables , Fla. , the only member of the U.S. 's Davis Cup team to reach the semifinals. * <P> By week 's end the best tennis of the tournament had come from bronzed , smooth-stroking Veteran Mulloy , who won all of his matches last week in straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's long career ( he made his first appearance in the Nationals 15 years ago ) . Mulloy was not surprised by his durability . <P> " Why not ? " he said . " I do n't smoke or drink . I learn more each year . Tilden won his first national title at 27 , and was still winning ten years later . I 'm in better shape than any of these youngsters . I figure I can go all the way . " <P> Mulloy was wrong . In a semifinal match this week , he lost to the cool retrieving of Herbie Flam in a long , five-set match . Art Larsen subdued Dick Savitt to become the other finalist . One of the two would climb to the top of the totem pole this week , but the pole seemed stumpier than usual . <P> <P> The Women 's Championship almost had a form upset when Althea Gibson ( TIME , July 17 ) , first Negro ever to play in the Nationals , carried Wimbledon Champion Louise Brough to within one game of match before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22-year-old Tennist Gibson no longer had her touch or speed , and she went out of the tournament , 6-1 , 3-6 , 9-7.
