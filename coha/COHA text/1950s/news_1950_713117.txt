txt This nation passed one of the sharp dividing lines in its history on Sunday morning , June 25 , but few of us fully realized what had happened until Wednesday , July 19 , and possibly not all of us fully realize it now . Many of us , perhaps , could still be startled ny such predictions as that made yesterday by an unnamed but highly placed official in Washington that our major counter-offensive in Korea might have to be put off as far as next spring . The news from Korea has taken longer to come through than did the news from Pearl Harbor . The comparison may seem sinister . It need not be so . What we are now trying to do is to see to it that the news from Korea does not mean what the news from Pearl Harbor did  --  that is , our entrance into a world war . We are militarizing part of our economy in order to- avoid having to militarize all of it . We are preparing to spend many billions on warlike preparations to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and lasting peace in the rest of the world  --  a gigantic saving in the long run . The necessity for spending those billions pursued us like a nightmare . Mr. Truman and his advisers came to it slowly and reluctantly as the news grew worse and one by one their hopes were disappointed . The man in the street does not know all that the Administration knows , but we may assume that some facts not yet made public reinforced the decision finally reached . That decision Mr. Truman stated last Wednesday in his message to Congress . He drew the conclusion that " the international Communist movement is prepared to use armed invasion to conquer independent nations , " and that we must therefore increase " our military strength and preparedness not only to deal with Aggression in Korea but also to increase our oommon defense , with other free nations , against further aggression . " This effort calls for a sacrifice from every one of us ? from young men who will have to give up civilian opportunities and go into uniform , from consumers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of our true national wealth will slow down . The labor and materials that must go into defense can not produce homes , school houses , hospitals , and an unlimited supply of the luxuries and conveniences , great and small , that make the American standard of living . This does not mean that the runs which have started in some consumers ' goods are justified . They are , as President Truman said , " perfectly ridiculous . " But what is spent for one purpose can not be spent for another . A policeman 's work raises no potatoes . None the less , it so happens that some - things are more precious than potatoes , more precious , even , than increases in the standard of living . The " basic moral principle " of which , Mr. Truman spoke on Wednesday is one of them . Because of this we were not " deterred by the relative immediate superiority of the ? attacking forces " in Korea . Because of it we are willing to divert a part of our strength from the productive activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even the economic argument is not against such preparation . It is better to spend a few billion dollars to stop a war than ten or twenty times as many billions  --  perhaps , even , all that we value in our civilization  --  to win a war . We may look to the immediate future with sad hearts . How much more cause for rejoicing there would be if the dispute between the two main systems of human society could be settled according to which could do the most for its citizens , which could house its people best , feed them best , make the best use of their energies and their initiative , raise them to the highest levels of intelligence , enable them to live the most happily and freely ! We of the free nations would accept such a challenge and glory in it . That opportunity is not offered us . We must stand firm , when the news is bad and equally when it is good , knowing that if we betrayed the " basic moral principle " now we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears .
