In the White House rose garden , under the hot Washington sun , stood 69 fresh-faced students from 17 nations . Before them , in the view finders of their cameras , stood the President of the U.S. , as fresh-faced as they . " Well , youngsters , " said Dwight Eisenhower , " it seems a bit of fortunate coincidence that I should have an opportunity to see you just as I am about to depart for Geneva . " He was going to Europe to talk peace , he said , in the hope that he could bring about a more tranquil life for their generation than his generation has had . But , in a word of advice to the youngsters , he expressed the basic philosophy that he was taking across the Atlantic : " Never sacrifice the basic principle that the human being is the important thing on this planet . " <P> All week long the President worked hard at setting that tone for his fateful meeting with the leaders of the Soviet Union , Great Britain and France : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He briefed congressional leaders on how he proposed to employ that philosophy at Geneva , and he promised them " frequent progress reports " through cables to Vice President Richard Nixon . Late into one night he sat with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in the second-floor study of the White House , where Abraham Lincoln used to read the Bible every morning before breakfast , and finished battening down the U.S. position . <P> " A Mighty Force . " Only an hour before he took off for Geneva , the President turned to the people to discuss his philosophy . Referring only occasionally to his notes , and hesitating now and then over his words , he talked frankly on television and radio for 15 minutes about his aims and hopes for Geneva . The President knew that the world , as well as the U.S. , was listening . <P> Throughout , his tone was conciliatory ; he did not excoriate Communism or Communists . But he lost no time in bringing up two subjects that the Communists were bitterly opposed to discussing at Geneva : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and 2 ) " The problem of international interference in the internal affairs of free governments . " <P> Given firmness and understanding , said the President , there was hope for Geneva . " The people of all the world desire peace . . . They do not want to go to the battlefield ; they want to live in peace-not a peace that is a mere stilling of the guns but a peace in which they can live happily in tranquillity , in confidence that they can raise their children in a world of which they will be proud . This common desire for peace is ... a terrific force in this world ... to which I believe all political leaders in the world are beginning to respond . They must recognize it . " <P> Then the President turned to another power : " The free world believes under one of its religions or another in a divine power . . . Suppose on the next Sabbath day observed by each of our religions , Americans165 million people of us-went to our accustomed places of worship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world the sincerity and depth of our aspirations for peace . This would be a mighty force . "
