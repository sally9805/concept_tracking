txt The Eisenhower Administration and the Democratic Congress were involved today in a tax struggle amid perhaps the most bitterly partisan atmosphere of the President 's tenure . Senate debate on a bill by the Democratic leadership to cut the taxes on low incomes and repeal Republican tax relief for business and shareholders opened in a storm that went beyond the issue . A vehement Republican-Democratic row involving Paul M. Butler , the Democratic National Chairman , and a remark he had made concerning the President 's wife became a part of the proceedings . The Administration 's chief fis- ' cal officer , George M. Humphrey , ' Secretary of the Treasury , denounced as " irresponsible , " " political " and " silly " the new tax cutting bill . The top man in the Demo-1 Cratic leadership , Senator Lyn- ' don B. Johnson of Texas , called on the principal Senate Republicans to repudiate Mr. Humphrey 's accusations . Republicans Challenged Mr. Johnson suggested that Ole Eenublicans , in complaining that Mr. Butler had tried4o involve Mrs. Eisenhower in politics by raising questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphrey 's attack on the " motives " of the Democrats in the tax fight . Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire , the senior Republican member Of the Senate , arose to disavow two of the Humphrey charges but to endorse a third . Mr. Bridges , chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee , declared from the floor : " I certainly want to disassociate myself from two parts of that the Humphrey attack on the Democrats . I do not want to stand here and see sincere men called silly or irresponsible . " But when they are called political , I think the Secretary has a pretty good name for it . " Almost overshadowed was the formal start of the tax debate . Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia , a powerful conservative // Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee , took the lead for the Republican President . Senator Byrd confined himself for the moment to a hostile analysis not of the new Senate Democratic leadership bill , which was disclosed only yesterday , but rather to its predecessor . This was a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives to grant an income tax reduction of $20 for everybody . The Senate bill is a major revision of this House approach . It would allow a $20 reduction to the head of a household , and $10 for each dependent other than husband or wife . It also Would repeal tax reductions granted last year to business and stockholders , which the Democrats estimate at $6,155 , - 000,000 a year . By this approach Senator Johnson seeks to find revenues more than offsetting the losses in an individual income tax cut . He and his associates argue that with the Senate bill the President could balance the budget in the fiscal year to open July 1 , 1956 . Senator Byrd has left the main body of the Democrats on the issue in pursuit of an old personal policy of resisting any tax cut until the budget is balanced . Mr. Byrd told the Senate that , while he was " greatly disappointed " that the Administration in its third year had not balanced the budget , a valuable beginning nevertheless had been made . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsound or premature tax cut , " regardless of its size , might " be the factor that tips the scales toward inflation . " The House plan , he asserted , would increase the Federal debt by $2,250,000,000 a year for the purpose of granting what would amount to a tax reduction of 38 cents a week a person . 1 " This , " he . declared , " just does n't make sense to me . " Secretary Humphrey 's new attack on the Democratic majority 's Senate plan was made before the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives . Mr. Humphrey had appeared there to support repeal of sections of the Republican tax bill of last year that the Democrats said resulted in " windfalls " to business . One of these permits business to set up a reserve for estimated future expenses and then add to it each year without paying taxes on the additions . The ' other allows business to prorate prepaid income , for tax purposes , over a period of years . An example of this would occur if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiveyear paid-in-advance basis . Instead of taking the payment in a lump , and thus paying the full tax over one year , the income might be prorated over a three or four-year period at a lesser tax burden . Secretary Humphrey 's comment on the Senate proposal came after several Republican members of the committee had tried in vain to interrupt the line of questioning being followed by Representative Wilbur Mills , Democrat of Arkansas , Representative Jere Cooper , ' Democrat - of Tennessee , and chairman of the committee , overruled their objections and permitted Mr. Mills to continue . At first the Secretary said he had not had a chance to study the Johnson Senate amendment and so could not comment . But a moment later , his face flushed with anger , he told the commit-tee : " A year ago the prophets of gloom and doom were sending this country straight to the dogs . " Instead of being headed to doom and gloom , we are headed toward , and in , better times . It is perfectly silly to say this Senate idea would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doom want to reverse the field and send us back to doom and gloom , they ought to pass this proposal . It 's just as irresponsible and just as political as the original $20 ) proposal . " Secretary Humphrey told the committee at one time that the new Democratic tax proposal put forward by a minority of the Senate Finance Committee was " just as irresponsible , just as political , just as bad from every point of view , as the original proposal . " Mr. Humphrey then went on to defend the general Administration tax program with equal vehemence . " This tax program is part of the whole Administration program of turning from doom and gloom to better times , " he declared . " Everyone who ' is participating-in better times can thank the tax laws of this Administration for part of the accomplishment . The tax program has helped create better times . It did n't do it all alone . But it has helped . " The Secretary said he thought the " windfall " loophole was a bad error that ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blame should be shared equally by the committee and the Treasury . " It was a mistake we made in the Treasury in the first instance in suggesting it , and it was a mistake you gentlemen participated in. as we went along , " he said . " I think we all made a mistake which ought to be corrected . " " Who in the Treasury bought the idea when it was first suggested ? " Mr. Mills asked . " I think we all did , and I think you gentlemen did , too , " Mr. Humphrey replied .
