An attractive red-haired housewife named Elsie May Keene walked into the office of K. F. Reynard in Beaumont , Texas , told him a physician had said she was dying of diabetes . Reynard , one of Texas ' 400 practicing naturopaths , knew just what to do for her . First he gave her repeated enemas . Next he administered the pendulum test-a piece of steel supported on chains between two rods which he held over Mrs. Keene 's heart . " Your heart is beating too fast and the blood pressure is too high , " he told her . His diagnosis continued : a large heart lesion which would take a long time to cure ; also kidney and bladder trouble . Reynard charged Mrs. Keene $10 for the examination , $4 for some pills . <P> Elsie May Keene went around to the office of Arvid Lovgren , complained to him of pains in her throat . Naturopath Lovgren took her blood pressure , told her that her heartbeat was too fast , promptly administered a " chiropractic adjustment " with a vibrator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat ?

He sold her special foods for $9 , and for the examination ( done by twiddling the dials of a machine that looked like a short-wave radio ) he charged $40 . <P> The fact was that Elsie May Keene was not sick at all .

Though Mrs. Keene was the star investigator , other equally healthy agents had called on all the naturopaths picked for investigation and subjected themselves to their treatments .
