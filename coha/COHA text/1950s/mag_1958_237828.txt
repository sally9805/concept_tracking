The agile , accomplished New York City Ballet , which often dances in practice costumes to spare its skintight finances , shot the works last week on a brash , brassy premiere , Stars and Stripes , set to the marches of John Philip Sousa . The works were well shot , thanks largely to George Balanchine , at 54 not only the world 's most prolific choreographer ( the Sousa ballet was his 93rd ) , but its finest . <P> Beneath a striped canopy , Balanchine marshaled 41 dancers wearing spangled tutus and brass-buttoned coats loaded with a fruit salad of stars , medals and epaulets ( famed Costumer Karinska , who traditionally arrives , cavalrylike , just as Balanchine is about to burn , outdid herself by producing the outfits several hours before curtain time ) . All the dazzle did not glare from the costumes : Ballerina Diana Adams , in a blue , yellow and red drum majorette 's rig , led a regiment of girls in high , prancing kicks to the tune of Rifle Regiment ; Ringmaster Balanchine had 13 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Arranger Hershy Kay 's combination of Sousa 's The Thunderer and The Gladiator . <P> Showstopper : a wacky session in which tiny Ballerina Melissa Hayden piccoloed about on her toes , and lanky Jacques d'Amboise bounded around in great , oompah leaps to the Liberty Bell and El Capitan marches . <P> For Choreographer Balanchine , it was the fourth premiere in an amazing nine-week stretch . The first was Square Dance , a whimsical leap between cultures . To the chamber music of Corelli and Vivaldi and the cadenced commands of Square Dance Caller Elisha C. Keeler , dancers executed the disciplined , classic patterns that Balanchine has made a trademark . The mixture was unlikely , but when Keeler had twanged out his last call ( " That is all ; the dance is ended/ The music is finished ; the caller 's winded ' ' ) , audiences cheered the blend of do-si-do and pas de deux . <P> Next came the hugely complex Agon , Balanchine 's danced counterpoint to Stravinsky 's brilliant , abstract score ( TIME , Dec. 16 ) . Two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate construction on the French composer 's first symphony . <P> The settings were 19th century and romantic , the tutus were pink and yellow , the dancing poised and beautiful . But Balanchine wove tensions not usually found in such period pastels . Massing dancers in great , wheeling formations , he demanded uncanny accuracy from his corps , succeeded in presenting the audience with hard , precise form through the swaths of tulle . <P> With a toe-danced hoedown , a flight of several light-years into the abstract , an astringent costume piece and last week 's boisterous blast of Fourth of July fireworks , Balanchine accomplished the richest and most varied season of his immensely productive career .
