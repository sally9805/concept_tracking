txt Scientists have bounced a radar signal off the planet Venus and back to earth , a round trip of 50 million miles . This is 100 times farther than such a signal has ever been sent previously . Scientists here hailed the reception of . a radar echo from Venus as a big step toward probing outer space . It was the first time direct measurements of interplaneMillstone Hill radar transmitter . tary distances had ever been obtained with great accuracy . This , they said , would be essential to future navigation in space . Nearest Beyond Moon Slightly smaller than the earth , Venus is man 's nearest neighbor beyond the ' mob , heretofore most distant radar target . The moon , slightly less than a quarter million miles away , was first reached by radar 13 years ago . Scientists of the Lincoln laboratory project 11 e r e hit Venus with 10 cents worth of electricity in February 1958 , it was disclosed Thursday . It has taken thousands of dollars and over a year of effort to confirm the " blip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from Millstone radar for nearly five minutes . With most.of the signal expended in space , scientists estimated they received back about 1.10,000,000 of the original power . It took approximately two and one-half minutes for the signal to reach Venus and the same time to return to earl h . Longest Transmission It was by far the longest man-made radio transmission ever achieved . Eventually scientists hope that radio probing will teach them , more about the actual surface of Venus . It is continually h I d d'e n from visual observation by a dense cloud cover . The radar transmitter is an 84 foot dish antenna mounted atop Millstone hill . The antenna , which can be used also for receiving , weighs 90 tons , but it can be focused with precision to pick up moving targets in space . Lincoln laboratory is sponsored by Massachusetts Institute of Technology on behalf of all the military services . Venus is the " evening star " of countless generations of poets and lovers .               @ @ @ @ @ @
