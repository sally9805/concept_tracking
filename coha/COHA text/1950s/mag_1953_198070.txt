Aristotle Socrates Onassis is a Greek-born Argentine who water-skis in the best international circles and includes among his friends Prince Rainier III , Pooh-Bah of the tiny principality of Monaco and its famed Monte Carlo Casino . At 47 , Onassis has homes in Paris , New York , Montevideo and Antibes , owns or controls a fleet of 91 tankers , freighters and whaling ships worth an estimated $300 million , and has a pretty 23-year-old wife . But he did n't get all this by breaking the bank at Monte Carlo-quite the opposite . Last week " Ari " Onassis let it be known that , for $1,000,000 , he had bought the 75-year-old Casino , lock , stock and roulette table , and with it , the purse strings of Monaco . <P> Reason : he needed some office space . <P> As top man in nearly 30 shipping companies* under five different flags , Onassis already has headquarters in Montevideo , branch offices in Paris , London , New York , Hamburg and Panama . But since much of his tanker business is bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , he thought he should have offices near the Mediterranean ports of Marseille and Genoa , where many of his ships are repaired . To Onassis , some empty buildings he had seen on a visit to Monaco looked ideal . A year ago , he approached Monaco 's Societe des Bains de Mer et Cercle des Strangers ( Sea Bathing Society and Foreigners Club ) which controls most Monacan real estate , along with the Monte Carlo Casino . Would they rent him a building ? They would not . <P> Craps &; Hand Grenades . But as soon as Onassis called on his old friend , Prince Rainier , the atmosphere became more friendly . The Casino , once the gathering place of rich royalty and the royally rich , had fallen on bad times . Gone were the days when Alexandra , Czarina of all the Russias , could bring the entire corps of the Imperial Ballet to dance while she gambled , when a Casino patron could toss a hand grenade into the roulette wheel after losing his wad and scarcely raise a commotion . Currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the recently installed crap tables ( TIME , Feb. 28 , 1949 ) , having failed to attract Americans in any quantities , were merely confusing the other customers , who stood around in baffled silence as the croupiers intoned such unfamiliar phrases as " I 'm so hot I wo n't need a blanket tonight . " In recent years , the Casino had lost money , and Prince Rainier , who gets 10% of the take in profitable years , was looking for some $1,000,000 in new capital . Three of the Casino 's directors were out lining up money , when Onassis hove into sight .
