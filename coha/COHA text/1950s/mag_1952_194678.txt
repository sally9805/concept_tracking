Just a week after Paris ' reigning theatrical couple had scored on Broadway ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) , it was Athens ' turn . Heading the National Theater of Greece , Katina Paxinou and Alexis Minotis arrived for a two-week run , enacting ( in modern Greek ) the title roles of Sophocles ' Electro , and Oedipus . <P> The situation of Electra is almost that of Hamlet : a royal father 's murder , by his wife and her paramour , must be avenged . But the protagonists of the two plays could hardly be more different . Electra , with her brother Orestes , is all clenched purpose and will . Indeed , despite the language barrier , last week 's production particularly brought home what fierce , barbaric feeling is channeled by Sophocles ' classic art . From the moment the curtains parted to reveal , on a bare , dim-lit stage , the bodingly severe entrance to the palace of Atreus , there was the sense of something ancient , awesome , implacable . <P> Actress Paxinou-already known to Broadway for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electra . Impressive , too , was the Orestes of Thanos Cotsopoulos , the Clytemnestra of A. Raftopoulou . But what is usually the stumbling block of modern productions of Greek drama-the management of the chorus-was this time the special glory . There were " a few too-mannered touches ; but its grave movement , its now murmurous , now resonant chanting , its sudden , swift , intensely dramatic confrontation of the audience , gave it a kind of orchestral grandeur and swell .
