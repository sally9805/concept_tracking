In the hungry fires of industry , modern man burns nearly 2 billion tons of coal and oil each year . Along with the smoke and soot of commerce , his furnaces belch some 6 billion tons of unseen carbon dioxide into the already tainted air . By conservative estimate , the earth 's atmosphere , in the next 127 years , will contain 50% more **25;10665;TOOLONG <P> This spreading envelope of gas around the earth , says Johns Hopkins Physicist Gilbert N. Plass , serves as a great greenhouse . Transparent to the radiant heat from the sun , it blocks the longer wave lengths of heat that bounce back from the earth . At its present rate of increase , says Plass , the **25;10692;TOOLONG in the atmosphere will raise the earth 's average temperature 1.5 Fahrenheit every 100 years . <P> As the blanket of **25;10719;TOOLONG gets thicker , it also prevents the tops of clouds from losing heat as rapidly as before . The smaller temperature difference between cloud base and top cuts down the air currents which must circulate through the cloud before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drier climate . Less cloud cover will be formed , more sunlight will reach the earth , and the average temperature will rise still higher . <P> After thousands of years , says Professor Plass , plants and the slow-moving seas will absorb most of the excess **25;10746;TOOLONG . But for centuries to come , if man 's industrial growth continues , the earth 's climate will continue to grow warmer .
