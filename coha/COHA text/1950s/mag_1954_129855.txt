This week more than 30,000,000 American children will return to their classes in elementary , junior and senior high schools . Their minds , despite overcrowding and understaffing , will be adequately trained . But what about their bodies ? // Americans like to think of themselves as an athletic people among whose youth physical fitness can be taken for granted . What we fail to realize is that a large proportion of our youth is growing up pitifully weak in stamina , seriously neglected by the average school program . The full meaning of certain widely publicized and alarming statistics has yet to sink in : // During the Korean war 47% of American draftees  --  nearly half of all young men called up  --  were rejected as physically or emotionally unfit . // THE BIG-TIME CONCEPT // In a recent comparison of European and American children between 6 and 19 conducted by Dr. Hans Kraus and Mrs. Ruth P. Hirschland of New York University , 57.9% of the American children  --  more than half of thousands tested  --  failed to achieve minimum standards of muscular strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // One of our real troubles is that the concept of the big-time sports competition has captured the imaginations of too many teachers and parents right down to the grade-school level . Our schools are concentrating on the star system , oblivious to the many that this excludes , particularly those who need physical education most of all  --  the ones who are not " naturals . " In New York City , for example , only an estimated 5% of all school children participate in school sports . // The big-time sports concept also puts our younger children under strains which are far beyond their childish capacities . We know that heart and lungs and other organs do not keep pace with the body growth in weight and height of children , yet we cheer them on to give their all as though they were grown-up players . The same is true of tackle football for 12-to 15-year-olds , a practice which is spreading in our schools . Of 242 doctors who were recently questioned about interscholastic football for this age group , all but 22 were against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded the ranks of the young . In many places , elementary-school competition for those who have star potentialities is on the rise . In South Dakota , for instance , coaches are assigned to grade schools to spot and develop likely prospects for high-school competition . Indiana carries basketball in schools to enthusiastic extremes , making high-school games into really big-league affairs . Last year more than 1,380,000 spectators watched the state high-school tournament , which grossed $750,000 . Some of the high-school teams played two games a day for three successive weekends , a pace not even matched by pros . // Nowhere , however , is the sad physical state of the Union more dramatically illustrated than in swimming . This is an ideal body-building sport , and a vital skill in war and peace as well . Facilities for it are ample . Yet of America 's 80,000,000 bathers , only 12% know how to swim . And less than one American school in every 10 offers swimming instruction . // To answer the challenge of the big-time sports concept in our schools , imaginative and colorful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not suffice . But a concept of physical education which can meet the challenge is available . Its teacher is a graduate of a four-year college course , with an educational background equal to that of a teacher of academic subjects . Given a chance , he can work wonders with his students and capture their enthusiastic interest as well . // Here , for example , is what modern physical education , in the person of Dr. Helen M. Starr , a former associate professor at the University of Minnesota , has done for the 70,000 elementary-and high-school children of Minneapolis . // RECREATIONS FOR A LIFETIME // Dr. Starr moved across town to become Director of Health , Physical Education and Recreation for the Minneapolis public schools after 17 years at the University . In Superintendent Rufus Putnam she found an educator who fully shared her views on good physical-education programs . Their concept of physical education as an integral part of the total educational program has permeated school life , keeping the children not only physically fit but also teaching them leisure-hour skills and recreation which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon last June , a random tour of schools showed the following activities taking place : // Play Day at Sheridan Junior High involved all 522 boys and girls . There were track and field events , volleyball , dodge ball and other games . // At the Franklin School , in Minneapolis ' most depressed neighborhood , a swimming class was splashing in the pool . Badminton , Ping-pong and volleyball games were going on in the gymnasium , and a softball tournament filled the sunny air with shouts outside . // At Southwest High School , the students were practicing archery . Some others were setting out on a bicycle trip , while still others were headed for bowling lessons . Three intramural tournaments  --  softball , tennis and golf  --  were in progress . The golfers were among 3,000 students who had been given free lessons by local pros . // The sports program was spread to include everyone . Minneapolis coaches do not receive preferential salary treatment , nor are they paid a portion of the gate receipts , an incentive still practiced in some New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . // Nor does the Minneapolis program stop with athletics . School doctors and nurses , dental hygienists , physical educators , social workers and teachers of handicapped children have all been coordinated by Helen Starr . Health classifications determine the activities which a child is permitted and there is no being excused from physical education . Thus even the handicapped child gets in a game  --  like the girl with polio at Franklin School who gets her turn at bat in softball while one of her teammates runs with the hit . // What does all this cost the taxpayer ? About $300 per year per pupil . This is about average for cities of 200,000 or more . Minneapolis is a city of 540,000. // OTHER BRIGHT SPOTS // There are other bright spots in the nation besides Minneapolis . In Boston , every youngster who tries out for a school team is kept on the squad , whether he is a hot-shot or not , so that he may learn the sport he enjoys . In Great Neck , Long Island 80% of the children take part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school students plays on at least one interschool-league team . // Another promising program is the establishment of school camps , launched in 1940 by Julian W. Smith , Associate Professor of Outdoor Education at Michigan State College . Besides learning to plant trees , construct game shelters , blaze trails and perform the routine chores of a camp , students learn the art of living with each other and their teachers . Social barriers fade away . " It is every American child 's heritage to have experiences in the outdoors , " says Smith , " and every teacher should be able to teach outdoors as well as in a classroom . " // Today , thanks largely to Smith 's tireless efforts , more than 80 Michigan school districts send elementary-and high-school children to camp for a week or longer . The cost is about seven dollars a week for food . And the idea has spread beyond Michigan to 24 other states which now report at least one camp program in action . // With the knowledge and equipment which the modern physical-education instructor has ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is not seriously handicapped need grow up a weakling , oppressed by the feeling that he " could n't make the grade . " It 's easier to lure the children from the cheering sections , the TV sets and the movies than we think . Given a chance , they will embrace a modern program of sports and physical education with enthusiasm and will remain enthusiasts all their lives .
