txt The New York , Chicago &; St. Louis Railroad ( Nickel Plate ) had a fairly good year in 1952 despite the steel and coal strikes , but may not be able to do as well in 1952 , L. L. White . president , said yesterday . On revenues of $162,727,000 last year , Mr. White noted in a talk before the New York Society of Security Analysts . the road earned $8.96 a share on its common stock , against 18.79% in 1951 . Of these revenues . 11.5% was carried down to net income , he said , although taxes consumed 16 05 cents of each dollar of operating revenues and other income . " We have made our plans , " said Mr. White , " on the assumption that our traffic volume will be slightly lower in 1953 , particularly in the last half , and that even with the present higher level of freight and passenger rates in effect for a full year , and without allowing for any labor disturbances . our revenues will be about 3% below 1952 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike , Nickel Plate was obliged to carry over into this year part of the rail laying and car repair work that ordinarily should have been performed in 1952 . Mr. White said . He added that the Nickel Plate had an increase in " bad order " cars ever since the letdown in traffic during last summer 's steel strike . and any letdown in traffic tends to send cars home to lines that have an adequate car supply . " This condition , combined with the anticipated lower level of revenues . " the Nickel Plate president remarked . " means that unless we have some tax relief we can not count on carrying down to net income the same proportion of revenues as in 1952 . A new Administration moved into Washington last Tuesday and perhaps we can look for some tax relief ? or . at the least , a reduction in Government extravagance before too long . " Last year Nickel Plate had $1 million excess of amortization charges on new equipment and facilities over normal depreciation . with income tax saving of 5520,000. or 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the excess amortization will run about $1.5 million and the tax saving . at current rates , will be 42 cents a share . For the threeyear period of the Excess Profits Tax Law , expiring at the end of next June , the road figures it will not be liable for the tax . In a few days , Mr. White stated . Nickel Plate will invite competitive bids for $10 million refunding mortgage bonds , to be dated March 1 and to mature in 25 years . with 1. -1 , annual sinkuig fund Parts of the proceeds will be used to retire in advance of maturity the $2.250,000 balance of a collaterally secured note . and the rest used to build up working capital . Before the end of last year the road paid off the $1,750,000 balance of promissory notes that were due to mature next February 15 . Mr. White declared the Nickel Plate has about passed the peak of its expenditures for extraordinary physical improvements and the peak of equipment debt maturities will be reached in 1954 , when they probably will exceed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the rate of $4,000,000 a year .
