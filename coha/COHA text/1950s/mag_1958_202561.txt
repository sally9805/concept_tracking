After weeks of agonizing difficulties , the U.S. had a big week in missilery . On Johnston Island , 700 miles southwest of Hawaii , one morning the sky blossomed red when the Army 's reliable Redstone took a nuclear warhead up an estimated 100 miles and exploded it in the thin air on space 's edge-a high-altitude test , say intelligence reports , that came ten months behind a similar U.S.S.R. shot in the crucial race for the anti-bomber and antimissile missile ( see SCIENCE ) . Next day Air Force missilemen at Cape Canaveral , Fla. sent their mightiest beast , a 100-ton three-engined Atlas-B ballistic missile , on its first successful full-power flight . <P> One Atlas attempt last month had ended in an ignominious mid-air explosion two minutes after launch . No such trouble dogged last week 's test . With the loudest bull bellow the cape has heard yet , the Atlas rose from its pad on 360,000 Ibs. of thrust ( 150,000 each from the two out board booster engines , 60,000 from the central sustainer ) . Hitting mach 10 just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped away with their skirts . The central sustaining engine roared another 120 seconds or so , shoved the missile to its apogee 400 miles up . After a 22-minute hop through 2,700 miles , the separated nose cone splashed down for the longest and best flight of the nation 's biggest bird .
