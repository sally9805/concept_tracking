txt A 5.11 alarm fire at the height of the evening rush hour Friday caused an estimated 8259,000 damage to the Sacred Heart Catholic church , 815 W. 19th st. , one of the city 's oldest churches , and forced precautionary evacuation of residents from nearby homes . No one was in the church when the fire started , apparently in a loft high in the rear of the 86 year old brick and stone building , which was erected a year after the Chicago fire . The fire may have been caused by faulty wiring , said Chief Fire Marshal Raymond J. Daley . He listed the cause as undetermined , but said he would ask the fire attorney to investigate the possibility of arson . Wooden Roof Falls The interior of the church was destroyed by the flames . The wooden roof , which arched to a point about seven stories high , collapsed , as did an octagonally shaped superstructure which held a 12 foot cross above the front door .

Firemen used three aerial towers and numerous other pieces of equipment in a vain effort to save at least a portion of the historic church . Save Religious Articles The Rev. Leo Hanley , pastor , saved the sacrament , vestments , and other religious articles from the church shortly after the blaze broke out . Firemen from truck 14 , station a quarter of a block away , were called soon after the fire was spotted by a group of youngsters playing nearby . Firemen fighting the blaze in the cold quickly became covered with ice created by the spray from hose streams . Three to four inches of ice covered their helmets . The parish , situated in the heart of an industrial district , was established in 1867 in a prairie dotted with truck farms . The church itself was built in 1873 and activities were directed for many years by the Jesuits . The church is now under diocesan leadership .                @ @ @ @ @
