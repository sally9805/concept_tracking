this day a white farmer had stopped his wagon underneatha hickory tree and sat dozing in the shade . The earnest young black man driving the Taylors stopped the car and went forward and told the farmer he 'd like to pass . " Ef'n y'all will just hol ' yo ' mules , sah , Ah 'll drive by easy as Ah ken make her go . " The farmer was a lank , long-haired , weather-reddened typical Mississippi redneck , dressed in a striped shirt and faded denim overalls . He looked at the solemn Negro student out of sunfaded , pale blue , baleful eyes , and spat a stream of tobacco juice into the hot heavy dust . The student waited for a moment and then returned to the car . He was worried . " Miz Taylor , w'en Ah ask that man to hol ' his team he didn ' say nuthin " tall . " " Drive on , " Mrs. Taylor directed . " Ah don ' know , Miz Taylor , " he began hesitantly . " Fess Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rednecks . An ' that white man look lak  --  " " Drive on , " Mrs. Taylor ordered peremptorily . Suddenly the whites of the young man 's eyes seemed enlarged . He cranked the car and , steering far over to the opposite side of the road , tried to pass the wagon . But the mules bucked in terror and bolted off the road . The farmer reached down and got a rifle from the wagon bed . The driver stopped and shut off the motor . The farmer charged forward and stuck the muzzle of the gun into the young man 's face . " Git down , niggah , ' n git mah team back on the road or Ah 'll blow out yo ' brains , " he raved . The coal-black driver turned gray with fear . William began to whimper . Charles was rigid with rage and terror . But Mrs. Taylor 's eyes glinted and her mouth set in a cold , deadly fury . When the driver got down and went to calm the mules , she took a small revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back . Charles hated the uncouth , bestial man and hoped his mother would shoot him . But William begged hysterically , " Do n't , Mama , please do n't , Mama , do n't shoot him , Mama , he 'll kill all of us. "  |p101His  mother lowered the pistol and held it in her lap . When the young man had righted the team and backed the wagon onto the road , he came back and cranked the car . The farmer held the rifle aimed at his back . Mrs. Taylor looked straight into the white man 's face , but he did n't look at her . The driver was barely able to steer the car . A mile down the road he stopped the car beneath a tree and wiped his face and neck . He was wringing wet with sweat . The incident marked the children in a curious way . They felt humiliated . For a time they hated the white man . They dreaded recalling the incident . It took the pleasure out of riding in the automobile . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were golden ripe persimmons on Professor Patterson 's tree . And bushels of big greasy pecans to be gathered from their own back field , the rich yellow meat so fat that oil oozed through the thin brown shells . They 'd slip down the front porch roof and climb down the fig tree and run in the cool night dust , and no one was ever the wiser . It was more fun sneaking out at night than riding in an automobile , anyway . And eating the big purple figs when they were ripe , holding them by the stems and sucking the sweet delicious insides right out from the peelings . . . Running into a mean old redneck with a rabbit rifle . Charles wished his mother had shot him . IN THE BACKWOODS OF MISSISSIPPI THE MAJORevents had a way of passing scarcely noticed . The United States had entered the first World War . At the college , enrollmentof male students had slackened . More crops were planted to feed our allies . And the women worked in the fields . Services were said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered for our President , our generals and our allies . Big blackp102headlines in the out-of-town papers screamed the alarming report : Paris was endangered . But the Yanks were coming . " To make the world safe for democracy , " President Burton intoned the classic line . But , for all that there was scarcely any change . In the Taylor household nothing was affected by the war . Mrs. Taylor had grown increasingly dissatisfied with the passingyears . She nagged at her husband . Tom had been home only once in the past three years . He could n't bear his mother 's nagging . He spent his summers in Cleveland , working . Mrs. Taylor knew that she 'd lost him . She held it against her husband . One more thing for which he must account . He charged her with driving him away . They quarreled bitterly . Now she centered all her attention on her younger children . Inadvertently , they were drawn into the strife . Now when the the parents fought at night the children crept downstairs and stood beside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared her moods ; when she suffered , they suffered with her . Their father was bitter and alone . During the last summer of the war , he took them to visit the family of one of his students in the delta country . He thought it might help to break their mother 's influence over them . The Wallaces lived in a section of the country known as Little Africa . The trading post was Alligator . Most of the residentswere Negroes who owned their farms . The Wallaces had seventy-nine acres . They lived in a dilapidated , weatherbeatenshack . But parked in the backyard , rotting in the hubdeepmud , was a brand-new expensive automobile . Sudden riches had been dumped into the laps of these poor farmers . Their rich bottom land was planted heavily in cotton that had soared to a dollar per pound . In fertile spots the corn grew eight feet tall ; vines of field peas and string beans climbed the tall cornstalks . There was plenty to eat of the food they loved  --  " Hoppin ' John " with hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttermilk . And there was plenty of money to be spent wantonly on things they 'd always wanted but could n't use  --  expensive phonographs without needles  --  electric sewing machines in houses that had never had electricity  --  pianoswhich no one had ever learned to play  --  fine automobiles that no one had ever learned to drive . On Saturday the Wallace boy dug the automobile out of the mud , and the next morning Professor Taylor drove them all to church . There were two Wallace girls beside the boy , the parents and one grandmother , and the four Taylors , but they all got in somehow . The church was a small frame structure , once painted white , with a tilted , wind-broken spire , half-hidden in a grove of pines . They arrived early so the children could attend Sunday school . Professor Taylor was made honorary superintendent and led the prayers . The congregation came , some walking the dusty roads , some in wagons and by muleback . The expensive cars owned by others had been left behind for want of drivers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and put on their stockings and shoes . Soon the church was crammed to overflowing . A long black preacher in a frocktail coat mounted the pulpit . He began his favorite text  --  " Dry Bones . " His rich , carrying voice was of an indescribable range . He took them with a shuddering whisper down into the deep dark valley of doom , then lifted them with a soaring crescendo to the bright gay streets of heaven , paved in gold . " Is y'all got yo ' wings ? " " We 's all got our wings ? " the congregation chanted the ' responses , which were as inflexible as Catholic liturgies . " Ah say , is y'all got yo ' wings ? " " We say , we 's all got our wings ? " Lulled into a deep , passionatemourning happiness . " DRY BONES IN THE VALLEY ! " he thundered suddenly , the bull roar of his voice shocking them insensibly . A woman rose , lifting her arms , and screamed in utter terror . Her companions sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams . " De sinnahs 'll burn in brimstone . An ' de reek of burnin ' meat 'll rise to warn dose who dilly wid dere neighbor 's wives in de cotton fields . . .  | " YOU HEAR ME ? " " We hear you , reb-um ! " " Ah say , does you hear me ? " " Oh , we hear . . . we hear ... " He threw back his head and let forth his mighty roar : " DRY BONES IN THE VALLEY ! " All over the church men and women screamed as if panic had been let loose in their midst . They shouted and moaned and cried and fought . Mrs. Taylor caught her children by the hands and ran . Women were . standing on the pews , eyes glazed , tearing the riotous colored clothes from their strong dark bodies , shouting to their God . " Ah is pure . Look on me , God . Ah is pure . " Raising strong black arms to heaven , full black breasts lifting , buxom black bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mah soul is white as snow ! " Men were turning somersaults in the aisle , dancing the buck and jig , bobbing to the strains of an unheard banjo playing somewhere deep inside their opened souls . Mrs. Taylor got the children out . Her hat was gone , her dress torn . " Whew ! " she exclaimed , then laughed with relief . The children were in a state of uncontrollable excitement . They wanted to go back and dance and yell with the others . But she made them sit quietly in the car . It was pleasant in the shade . About them , in the grove , the placid mules were tied to the scarred trees . The little church sat on wooden piers . From inside came the shouting and the screaming and the dancing and the moaning . Over and above was the stentorian roar : " DRY BONES IN THE VALLEY ! " They sat and watched the little church rock on the wooden piers . They 'd never been so excited . The following week was spent in Mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Mound Bayoup105was the only city in the country inhabited exclusively by Negroes . All of the public officers as well as the businessmen and the proprietor of the cotton gin were Negroes . Only the express agent was white , and he lived in another city . There seemed an unwritten understanding to let the Negroes have this city , of which the governor was as proud as if he had founded it . " Miss'ippi is the only state in the Union where Negras have their own city , " he was wont to boast . Professor Moseley owned a large brick house . The children were awed by so much splendor . Mrs. Taylor reminded them of the pleasant little house in Missouri where they were born . But they could not recall it . One afternoon they were coming from the post office . " Is where we were born as large as this city , Mama ? " William asked , scuffing his shoes on the strange pavement . " Oh , much , much larger , " his mother replied , a little startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneered . " What do you know about it , " William said . " You were n't even walking when we were there . " " I was too walking , " Charles said angrily . " And I remember it better'n you do . " They were walking on each side of their mother . " Children , it is n't nice to shout . " " He 's a liar , " William said . " He 's always telling some kind of lie . " Charles reached around his mother and hit William . " Children ! " she cried . " You behave this instant . " " Liar ! " William shouted . " Liar back ! " Charles yelled , striking William in the face . " Children ! " their mother screamed . William grappled with his brother . Before she could stop them they were fighting savagely in the dusty street . Several men ran out of a grocery store and pried them apart . Seeing them fighting on this strange village street , their mother was profoundly shocked . It struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the campus overnightin five years . Away from the home perspective , amid these strangers and strange scenes , she saw how they 'd grown . " These boys is wild , lady , " said one of the men who was holding them apart . They were big , strapping boys of nine and ten , with their sheared skulls looking as savage as Indian bucks . The animal in them was shockingly apparent ; fearful was the violence she had suddenly seen . Their father had to come and take them home . Mrs. Taylor was panicky . What had she done to her children ? " God in Heaven , if You 'll just give me strength I 'll get them out of this savage country , " she prayed . On their return to the college she was overcome with haste . She wrote a score of letters , applying for a post in some boarding school . It was already the middle of August . Finally she received an offer from a tiny church school in South Carolina . She accepted it . Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home for a week before school opened . But his mother was too filled with her own plans to give him much attention . The children had grown very vague toward their older brother . They could hardly realize the kinship . He was a tall , gangling youth , head and shoulders over either of his parents . Mrs. Taylor said he 'd taken after her father , who was over six feet . But his manner was very strange . His speech was different , and his complexion was sallow and pimpled . The darkly bronzed children were both proud and ashamed of him , but with no real blood affection . His short stay left scarcely an impression . The week following , Mrs. Taylor and the children left . The boys were grown enough to feel the humiliation and indignityof the Jim-Crow car , one half of the coach containing the white smoker . It became breathlessly hot in the packed quarters beneath the blazing sun . Windows were opened . But black smoke belched inside every time the train turned , first on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk dressp107was ruined . The children squirmed with discomfort as their mother wiped the cinders from their reddened eyes . No water or toilet was provided for these passengers . Most of them carried their own refreshments  --  water , lemonade , buttermilk , corn whisky  --  in jugs and bottles and buckets . When the train stopped for water , the passengers went into the woods and relieved themselves . On boarding the train they 'd looked so fresh and happy , dressed in their clean cotton dresses , starched overalls and candy-striped silk shirts with peg-topped Palm Beach trousers . Their faces had been washed , their hair combed . Their eyes had sparkled as they waved good-bye to friends and relatives . They 'd carried their lunches in neat boxes and baskets , and had brushed off the seats where they sat . Now , after riding in the hot , cramped car , they were greasy and dirty  --  mean-looking , sweaty black people with red , evil eyes . Paper and bones and scraps littered the floor . Some were half-drunk . They 'd become noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled dirty black pigs . A man emptied his drinking bottle and urinated in it . Mrs. Taylor was disgusted , sick with frustration . The train crawled slowly through the baked , barren lands of Mississippi . Scrub cotton stood burnt in the parched fields . Lean , lackadaisical rednecks leaned on their plows , while their mules stood with bowed heads , watching the train go by . The croppers ' shacks , with their black rotten walls and curled shingles , stood row on row , blistered and neglected , as poor and downtrodden as the people who leaned in the doorways . The shacks leaned , the people leaned , even the mules leaned ; nothing stood straight . It was evening when they came into Meridian on the Alabamaborder . Night brought relief . The darkness hid the misery . A brakeman came and lit two gas lights . The train crawled through the darkness , lights flickering through the gusts of smoke coming through the open windows . Snores and stink and smoke , fatigue and pain and discomfort filled the Jim-Crow car.  |p108The  children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . " I hope it blows back into those white people 's faces , " Charles said . " Charles ! " his mother reprimanded . " Hit ain ' blowin ' back in they faces but hit sho is blowin ' back in mine , " a Negroid voice came from behind . Mrs. Taylor rose in alarm . " Oh , I 'm so sorry , " she said , flutteringhelplessly . " Set down , lady , " the voice said . " Hit ain ' de firs ' time . " A few minutes later when they were going around a bend the children wanted to have another try , but she made them hold it . " It 's bad enough to be a heathen from necessity , " she told them . They were so excited they could n't sleep . It was their first night ride since they 'd come south . Their eyes strained into the night . The train turned , a string of lights hung across the darkness . " Oh , look ! " Charles cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his garden party . " William tugged at his mother 's sleeve . " Look , Mother ! Look what Chuck found . " The lights flickered and spread , became irregular ; a tiny village grew into the night . The train roared through without stopping . Charles thought of the people living there in that little village . It felt weird and strange to be passing through their lives in the night without stopping . Phantom children played silently in the empty streets . The telegraph poles leaped by . Once a man stuck his head out of a train window and got it knocked off by a telegraph pole . He could see the headless man running along beside the train , dodging in and out the telegraph poles . Thus he amused himself . Suddenly tracks leaped out from beneath the speeding train . And then more tracks . Dark hulking buildings loomed in the shadows . Dim lights hung at street corners . Gloomy streetsp109tunneled in the distance . And then fire sprang shockingly into the dark night . Round brick structures , like igloos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licked up from a row of burning pots , throwing shadowed giants who battled silently in the sky . Souls burned in the vats of brimstone , while naked men and women , doomed into hell , ran screaming soundlessly through the burning pits . The children held their breath in terror . " What is it , Mama ? What is it ? " William asked . " It 's the blast furnaces , children . They 're making steel . " They 'd come into the steel foundries of Bessemer . " It looks like Dante 's Inferno , " Charles whispered . " So it does , " their mother said . Birmingham was next . The passengers stirred . The train pulled into the station . Sitting with their heads hung far out the window the boys watched the strange people rushing past . The Jim-Crow car half emptied . Their mother took them into the colored waiting room and stood while they went to the toilet . Her skin was blackened and gritty ; her hair hung loose . Exhaustionlined her face , pulling down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could while the boys waited for her . They bought sandwiches to carry . The Jim-Crow car had filled again . Finally the children slept . The next day they arrived in Atlanta , where they were to change to another train . Gathering their parcels and luggage , they went to look for Tom . Mrs. Taylor had written him when they would be passing through . But he 'd not come . She was worriedand would have gone out to the university , but was afraid they did n't have time . Their train was due in an hour . She fretted and fussed , walking to the door to look out . It was Sunday and the streets had that deserted Sunday look . He should 've come , she thought . At the street entrance to the white side was a fruit and confectionary stand . Rosy peaches and red pomegranates and shiny yellow bananas were colorfully displayed , the warm fruitp110scenting the air . Mrs. Taylor and the children were drawn admiringly . They stood on the sidewalk and looked through the doorway at the delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bananas ? " Mrs. Taylor asked , approaching a little closer . The vendor stared curiously from her to the children . " I ca n't sell ' em to you , " he replied . Mrs. Taylor bristled . " And why not , I 'd like to know ? " " You 're on the wrong side , lady . " He was a dark , curlyhairedman . She thought he was Italian . He looked around and then leaned forward and whispered , " Do n't think I do n't want to sell ' em to you , lady . But they 'd fine me and take away my license . " She sighed . " Oh ! Well , I declare . " They trudged disappointedly back to their side of the waitingroom . Their train was hours late . Tom did n't come . They 'd had plenty of time to have gone out to the university . Now they were tired and frustrated . Even the children were getting fretful ; their excitement had worn off . It was late afternoon before their train arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Taylor closed her eyes . The rocking motion of the coach put her to sleep . The children looked disconsolately out the window . It was dark before the brakeman came to collect their tickets . " You 're on the wrong train , " he said . White people called most Negro women " aunty . " They seldom called Mrs. Taylor anything . " This is the train to Cheraw , " she said sleepily . " Nope , we go straight through to Charleston . " " But the trainman called this train for Cheraw , " she contended . " Nope , you 're dreaming " " But I heard him call Cheraw distinctly . " Her attitude and manner of speaking irritated the brakeman . " Or else you 're lying , " he said nastily . " Do n't you dare say I 'm lying , " she flared.  |p111He  flushed angrily . " I 'll stop this train and have you put off right here in these woods , " he threatened . " And I 'll sue the railroad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalked from the car . Shortly he returned with the conductor . " You 'll have to get off at the next town , " the conductorsaid . " Then you 'll have to give me a return ticket , " she demanded . " I 'll give you nothing ! " he shouted . Her mouth tightened grimly and her eyes glinted . " Then I wo n't get off . " The children sat silent and frightened . The train sped through the night , going to an unknown place . It was like going off the end of the world . They huddled close to their mother , wordlessly . The train slowed and stopped at a darkenedstation . " Now get your things together and get off , " the conductor ordered . Mrs. Taylor refused to budge . He stood for a moment , undecided , then went away . The minutes passed and no one came . No one in the coach spoke . The train waited . They all sat in the fearsome night waiting in the silence . The minutes seemed interminable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now git yo ' things together an ' come on , les go , " the deputy ordered her . " I ' 11 not move until I have a return ticket , " she replied defiantly . " Then Ah 'll have to arrest you . " " Well then , if I 'm under arrest , I suppose I shall have to go to jail , " she said with great dignity . She arose and gathered her parcels . The children carried the luggage , clingingclosely . They descended to the dark platform . The train puffed and went down the tracks . The deputy sheriff stood beside them until its red tail light had disappeared in the darkness . " Now you jes ' set right heah an ' you 'll git a train back in the mawnin ' , " he told her.  |p112I  'm going to sue the railroad , " she said determinedly . " Thass ' tween you an ' the railroad . If you jes ' Joan make me no trouble Ah ain ' gon na do no more ' bout it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . They found seats on the dark platform . Shadows prowled the sinister night . Somewhere near was a sleeping village , but it , too , was entombed in darkness . They sat huddled close together , warmingtheir fear . The indignity and the outrage slowly gave way to horror . Now the whole train ride , all the misery and discomfort , was climaxed in remembered nightmare . In the pitch-black dark that comes before day Charles 's mind cut loose ; reality encroached the dream , death danced as a skeleton leadingskeletons to the grave . He sat close to his mother , absorbing the horror of the real and the dream , and could n't tell them apart . Down the tracks , across the bright green fields of tobacco , the Carolina sun rose in sheer , majestic beauty . Following their miserable night its wonder gripped and held them . And then the train came and took them back . They were at the school in Cheraw two weeks . Mrs. Taylor was bitter in her denunciation of the railroad . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that community advised her against it . She had to content herself with a scathing letter to the president of the line . That fizzling out of her determinations was the major tragedy of Mrs. Taylor 's life . Most of the time it rained . The weathered wooden buildings stood disconsolate in the rain . Boys and girls scene . The bullfrogs set up their unceasing chorus . Owls hooted startlingly . Mrs. Taylor was vexed and harassed . The children were frightened and lonely . Their own discontent seemed to drench the place . Then the letter from Crayne Institute in Augusta caught up with her . She packed up the children and left.  |p113CRAYNE  INSTITUTE WAS IN THE HEART OF THEcolored section . It faced a thoroughfare that ran up a hill , passing through a white business district , and came to a stop at a fort . Originally it had occupied a city square , enclosed by a high plank fence . But a number of the old buildings on the surrounding streets had been added from time to time . Mrs. Taylor and her children arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old horse cab . The boys were turned over to a matron who took them to a room on the third floor of an old brick building across the street . " Chuck , come and look , " William called his brother to the window . Charles went and stood beside him . The building stood on a height and below lay the city lights . They stared tensely , quivering like wild colts at civilization 's first barrier . " It looks like Rome , " Charles said . " I wish Mama was here , " his older brother confessed . " Mama said we might not stay with her . " Suddenly William began to cry . Charles went over and sat on the bed beside him . " Do n't cry , Will . " A frightened desolate loneliness came over them both . There was no sound from the old gloomy house . They felt abandoned and lost . Charles bit his lips to keep from crying also . Finally they put on their pajamas and knelt side by side and prayed : Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep If I should die before I wakeI pray the Lord my soul to take . Charles lay listening to his brother 's lonely sobbing . He felt torn up by the roots . All was so strange and sad and dif/ferent . He wished his mother could be happy , then everything would be all right again . The next morning a boy about their age came for them . " Mi Rainy san ma tu fotch yo fa tu cume brakefost . " They did n't understand a word he said . He was a strange skinny child , bony as a skeleton , with slanting red eyes and a huge egg-shaped head that was completely bald . He looked grotesque in old handed-down clothes . They stared at each other helplessly . " Brakefost , " the boy said . " Brakefost . " He was of a curious racial mixture of African , Indian and Spanish , whom the people in that section called " geechies , " and spoke a patois of these native tongues combined with English . For generations his people had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been free long before the Civil War . He saw that these new ones did n't understand him . " Pomp , " he said , pointing to himself , and then beckoning , " Cum . " They followed him out the building and across the street through a side gate in the high plank fence , and were struck by the confusion of buildings . Boys and girls of all ages streamed across the yard . Several turned to stare at them and many of the girls giggled . The children shrank with shame and trepidation , quivering with a strange kind of fear . They were afraid of other children . The dining room matron seated them at a long board table with others of their age . They searched frantically for their mother , and then kept their eyes glued to their plates . " Whar you pigmeat come frum ? " a bully across from them asked . Charles looked up , so tense he could scarcely speak . " Miss-issippi . " The boy snorted . " ' Sippi niggers . " In a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shet yo ' mouth , boy . Usin ' dat dirty word . " The boy subsided sullenly . A snicker ran around the table . " Ah 'll git you for that , " he threatened Charles when the serving women left.  |p115Charles  felt the blood burning in his face . Their mother came for them at the end of breakfast . They 'd never been so glad to see her . " Children , " she laughed delightedly , returning their embraces . " You 'd think that I 'd been gone for ages . " " We were scared , " William confessed . " Well , it wo n't be long , " she consoled . " Mother will try to get you with her . Now we must go and see Miss Rainy . " The children were shocked by the sight of the big , black , ox-like woman who greeted them in a deep , gruff voice , " So this is Will an ' Charles . " She had the flat features of the Zulu tribes with short-cropped graying hair , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . She patted their heads . " You boys 'll have to toe the line even if your ma does teach here . Ah don ' make no favorites of nobody 's children an ' Ah didn ' make no favorites of my own when they was here . " " Do n't think I 've spared the rod , " Mrs. Taylor said . " My boys ca n't say I 've spoiled them . " " Speak up , speak up , the cat got your tongue ? " the headwomanbade . " Say how do you do ' to Miss Rainy , " their mother urged . " How do you do , Miss Rainy , " they chorused . Miss Rainy grinned , her thick dark lips parting over goldcrownedteeth . " Now you boys run along with your ma . " Then to their mother , " When you get settled , sister , Ah 'll take you over the ground . " Crayne was named after the Senator who had donated the site . Once it had housed the slave quarters of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it should become a seat of learning for the progeny of those creatures . But Cindy Rainy was the institution . She 'd never gotten beyond the sixth grade of a backwoods school . As a child she 'd served in white homes , and after marriage had mothered white children to earn money to feed her own . But it was her greatest ambition to give other Negro children the education she 'd missed . Her iron will had raised the Institute from ap116shanty schoolhouse to an institution of prominence . She 'd built it herself ; she 'd begged every dime . She 'd been hard on herself and she was hard on her students . In her office were two wooden paddles , one of ' light seasoned cedar with which she beat the girls , and one of heavy , thick oak she used on the boys . As with many dark Negro women who 've struggled to prominence , she had a preference for light-complexioned persons , both as friends and subordinates . Though most of her students were young black folk , a predominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but the athletic director , science teachers and chaplain were women . Mrs. Taylor 's position was that of music instructor . Two of her nieces , Martha and Mary Manning , her brother Tom 's children , were also on the staff . The relationship was quite marked ; both were very fair girls with brown wavy hair . And there were also a number of teachers acquainted with some branch or other of the Manning family . She was delighted to be among her own . Her nieces thought her most elegant and refinedand were quite devoted . She was given a couple of rooms on the ground floor of the faculty house across the street , so she could keep her children with her . The boys had a back room with low windows openingonto a narrow alley . They had but to step outside and they were free . She saw very little of them that winter . It was as if a dam had broken loose within her . She talked and talked , catching up on the family news . She told and retold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even a nuisance at times . But she could n't restrain herself . The words and phrases poured out in an endless stream . Even the children were astonished . She talked a great deal to them , bringing up bits and sketches of her childhood . That was the winter she told them that their great-great-grandfather , Grandma Charlotte 's sire , was General Beauregard . She would come into the children 's room at bedtime and , without preamble , say , " Your cousin , Martha , is just like herp117grandfather . She likes her coffee scalding hot , " smiling reminiscently . " My mother could never get his coffee hot enough . No matter how hot she 'd have it , he 'd say , Lin , this coffee is stone cold . ' And she 'd have to put it back in the pot and heat it . She got tired of him saying his coffee was cold and one day she put the cup in the oven and got it red hot . Then she filled it with boiling coffee and set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his cup his mouth was all set to say it was stone cold . But when he put it to his lips we could hear the skin sizzle . My mother was afraid she 'd given him an awful burn . It must have hurt him terribly . But your grandfatherdid n't bat an eye . He just looked across at my mother and said , Lin , for once in your life you got my coffee hot . ' " The memory made her laugh with pleasure . The children did n't understand her . She seemed strange . They felt that she was slipping away from them . A vague insecurity threatened them . They became closer to each other . Their teachers could n't separate them . They sat on the same bench . Should one falter in his recitation the other took it up . Their mother had taught them well . They were both brilliant in their classes . But they did n't make friends . When one got into a fight the other would rush to aid him . Charles did most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opponent 's legs while Charles pummeled him . After several of these skirmishes the bullies left them alone . Their studies were so easy they soon were bored and took to playing hooky . They 'd slip behind the wooden buildings , skirt the playing field , and climb over the fence behind the scoreboardin the corner . There was a grocery store across the street where many of the day students bought their lunch . The proprietorwas n't permitted to sell to the students between hours , but he did to those he trusted . They 'd buy a loaf of bread , cut a wedge from the top and fill it with molasses or condensed milk or sardines , and after the juice had soaked in plug it up again . They carried their " sog ' em " to the neighborhood known as the " Blackberry Patch , " and there in the shade of their favoritechinaberry tree on the bank of a creek they feasted.  |p118Although  they were fed plenty in the mess hall  --  black-eyed peas and rice one day , boiled pork and baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hominy grits and hot fat for breakfast  --  they were always hungry . Their mother supplementedtheir diet with dry cereals and fruit . Both loved the baked fish that was served on Fridays . The big steaming pan of porgies with onion gravy was set in the center of the table . The other children liked fried fish best , so this one day they had all they wanted . During supper , the school horse , an old gray mare named Maud , was fed a half-dozen ears of dried field corn in her trough beside the kitchen door . It was great sport with the older boys to try to steal an ear when they came from supper . But Maud was on to their game and snapped at them like a vicious dog , her big teeth clacking dangerously . Charles loved dried corn and once he tried to steal an ear and run . But Maud was too quick for him , and bit him across the cheek and nose . For days he wore a bandage and a tiny scar remained . But he learned how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention was distracted . One night the children were awakened by the sound of fire engines . They dressed and slipped out through the window . Toward the Patch was an orange glow in the sky . All about them were running people . A fire engine turned the corner , drawn by four white horses , smoke belching from its stack . All else forgotten , his brother and mother , the night , Charles went flying in its wake . " Wait , Chuck , " Will called . But Charles did n't hear him . The urge to run heedlessly , unrestrainedly , like the mad surge of the beautiful white horses , blew out his other thoughts . Soon he was separated from his brother . He ran with a long , smooth , digging motion , down the dim streets , jostling people , through the muddy gutters on into the Patch . Black and yellow people were panicky in the streets . He followed the engine through the milling crowd , came up at the edge of the fire . Police had thrown up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flimsy hovels burned anp119immense bonfire . Black people loomed suddenly from the haze of smoke , lugging a straw mattress , a bundle of clothing , a paper sack of cold corn bread . Beds and furniture and clothingand boxes were scattered like debris down the streets of chaos . Over and above the crackling of the fire and the hissingof the water came the wailing and the moaning and the shouting of the people . Charles was cut loose from reality . The stark raw panic in the black faces transmitted itself to him . He started to run like a crazed horse into the midst of the flames , but was caught up in front of a dark , lonely shack by a woman standing in the door . She was a young mulatto girl , dark hair hanging to her shoulder ; a vague shape in a loose nightgown . There was in her posture a strange bitter forlornness more terrible than a Gorgon 's head . He was too young to know that she was a whore watching the fire from morbid curiosity . He saw only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one left house . He was ineffably drawn to her ; he felt an affinity deeper than kin . FIe went toward her timidly , filled with the great flaming desire to serve her with his life . " Can I help you , lady ? " She looked at him startled , then cursed . " Git der hell away frum heah an ' mind yo ' own bizness . " He felt a sharp , brackish shock , turned and fled . For a long time aimlessly he watched the fire , absorbed into the misery of the homeless groups , and afterwards he wandered listlessly in the ruins . But deep inside he was badly hurt , first opened by the suffering of the people , then poisoned by the strange woman 's scorn . He could n't understand her viciousness ; her rejection cut him to the heart . It was early morning when he crawled back into bed . William was asleep . For a long time Charles lay there crying until the sobbing waked his brother . " What 's the matter , Chuck ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked . " What you crying about ? " " Nothing , I tell you . "  | " There is something too , you 're crying . " " I 'm not . " " You are too , and I 'm going to tell Mother . " " I 'm not , I 'm not ! I tell you I 'm not ! " " Do n't cry , Chuck , " William consoled . " I was just crying a little bit , " he confessed . " I 'm all right , really I am . I was just crying a little because it 's all so sad . " " Go to sleep , Chuck , " William said . " Everything 's going to be all right . " " All right , Will . Do n't tell Mama I was gone . " " I wo n't tell . " As Charles grew older there were many more exciting happeningsthat he forgot . It was always very hard for him to recall the inside of all the many houses he lived in . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkened doorway , watching the misery of her people , nor the utter viciousness of her rejection . That year William was very kind to his younger brother . He lied to the teachers when Charles played hooky and never once told on him for slipping out at night . After the first strangeness had worn off and they 'd become accustomed to the difference in their mother 's attitude , they liked it there . They liked their newly discovered cousins and the thrilling sound of laughter in the streets in the early evening ; and they liked the long walks they took through the city with their mother on Sunday afternoons . The thing they liked best was an old minstrel who came around the school and fiddled for the students . He was a very old man with a deeply seamed face , the color of saddle leather , and a thatch of dirty , yellowish-white hair . His old brown eyes had the bluish tint of age , and but two brown snags hung loose from bare shrunken gums . His clothes were tattered and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with loving care in a square of fine old velvet . The students loved him and whenever he appeared a crowd collected . " Play Hole in de ground , " ' they begged.  |p121He  played a jig tune and cut a step , then he played a spiritualand mumbled out the words . " Oh , Mistah Minstrel , please play Hole in de ground : " His old lined face beamed with pleasure and his eyes sparkled youthfully . He began chanting the endless ballad , sawing the accompanying sounds : Oh once ' pon uh time dare wuz uh hole in de ground An ' de green grass growin ' all ' round an ' ' roundDe green grass growin ' all ' round .. . In de li'l hole dare wuz uh li'l tree Tree in de holeHole in de ground An ' de green grass growin ' all ' round an ' ' roundDe green grass growin ' all ' round ... . " Oh , what was on the tree , Mistah Minstrel ? What was on the tree ? " On de li'l tree dare wuz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de ground An ' de green grass growin ' all ' round an ' ' round De green grass growin ' all ' round .. . " Oh , what was on the lim ' , Mistah Minstrel ? What was on the urn ' ? " His old bluish eyes twinkled with delight . And on and on it would go : An ' on dat li'l bee dare wuz a li'l tail Tail on de beeBee on de leafLeaf on de branchBranch on de limbp122Limb on de treeTree in de holeHole in de ground An ' de green grass growin ' all ' round an ' ' round An ' de green grass growin ' all ' round ... . The children squealed with glee . What would be on the tail ? Sting on de tail .. . And what would be on the sting ? Pisen on de sting .. . They loved the old minstrel . But then , the Taylor children loved most things the other children loved . They loved the same games and pastimes ; sucking dill pickles stuffed with wine balls , munching peeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holiday celebrations , the outdoor barbecues , running with the football players in the fall , baseball in the spring , the Maypole dance , the Easter Ramble . Quite often they laughed at the same things . The time Pomp came screaming into Miss Rainy 's office , " O ' Mi Rainy ! Mi Rainy ! De goat done dead ! " It became a classic example of the ungrammatical form . Nor did Miss Rainy show them any favoritism . William escaped ; she thought he was a nice , obedient boy . But she paddled Charles several times for fighting , playing hooky , and the hardest of all for calling another boy a " monkey-devil . " The difference was deeper ; the difference of upbringing , of perspective . Taking their napkins to the mess-hall in the old worn wooden napkin rings . Saying , " Thank you . " The absence of dialectin their speech . The feeling that their teachers did n't know everything . Their unacceptance of the common childish conviction that Negroes were the strongest people in the world . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads  --  in class or in chapel when the students were assembled ,  |p123the  black-burred craniums with bald tetter patches and the short straightened hair of the girls with grease running down behind their ears . And on Saturday night the smell of burning hair permeating the very air over the school and the Patch and the entire Negro community , as if there were a witch-burning of incredible numbers . It always gave Charles a queasy stomach , sick enough to vomit . Yet his own hair was kinky ; he could n't imagine himself without kinky hair ; he never thought of it as ugly . It was the atrocities they committed on themselves to be what they were never intended , which he could n't reconcile . Thin , black girls with white ribbons tied to their crop of short braids always reminded him of Topsy ; and the burred white thatch of the Old Minstrel was Uncle Tom again . But Topsy and Uncle Tom were real people like his mother and himself , and why all the shame ? However , they learned to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they learned of their family on their mother 's side . There was little in the classes they had n't already learned . But they became accustomed to classroom procedure . And they 'd gotten out of Mississippi . If for no more than that , their mother was grateful for that year . THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CHILDREN ATTENDEDschool with students twice their age . Their father had missed them the year before . He kept them home that fall and enrolledthem in the College . They 'd completed the sixth grade at Crayne . Now they were enrolled in the freshman year in college , which was the equivalent of the eighth grade . Mrs. Taylor fumed and threatened . But she could n't leave the children . She was trapped . All that summer she 'd talked incessantly as if she 'd beenp124wound up and could n't stop . Tom was home briefly before going on to Cleveland . He thought his mother queer . Then it was the little children who felt her insecurity . " Do n't ever forget that you are Mannings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring off into the past . She frightened them with her ceaseless prattle . Now , with the frustrating of her hope to take them off again , she was assailed by prolonged despair . It was as if she 'd returned to the scene of a long and bitter defeat . The old scars and humiliations of battle opened sharply with new hurt . Before she 'd been determined to depart . Now she was obsessed with escape . At times her frustration was so heightenedshe felt that she 'd go crazy . Her eyes were often red from crying , and deep lines of discontent began settling in her face . " You 've done everything in your power to destroy me , " she charged her husband . " Now you 're trying to destroy me by making monsters of my children . But I sha n't let you . " Her eyes were wild , her hair disordered . She was becoming a little hysterical . " By God , they 're my children too . And I want ' em here with me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages were different ; they had grown older . Professor Taylor had developedchronic constipation . " You 'll regret this , Mr. Taylor . You 'll suffer in hell for what you 're doing to your children . " The house was sick with fear and hate that morning they entered college . The children spilled their cereal and bolted their eggs . Their mother 's face was grim . Finally their father rose to go . " Now be good boys and do n't give your professors any trouble , " he admonished . " Professors at their age , " their mother said . " I tell you , Mr. Taylor , it 's criminal . " He went off without replying.  | " Children , " she began without preamble , " I want to tell you how babies are born . " They looked at her from large , startled eyes , squirming uncomfortably . She became embarrassed but went on grimly as if forcing the words from her lips : " The seed of the male impregnates the womb of the female and the mother becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother for nine months , growing and growing until it is formed , then the mother gives birth . You recall when Mrs. Sherwood was pregnant last year . She was carrying the baby in her womb ; her little baby Alice . " The birth of a baby , " she continued , swallowing painfully , " is very sacred and should never be discussed . Only persons who are married are permitted to conceive babies . But there is nothing secretive about it . It is a very natural function  --  it is as natural as a bowel movement , although we do n't talk about that either . I want you children to understand this , and when the older men try to tell you about it you tell them that your mother has already told you and that will shut them up . " She looked away from their huge staring eyes . " Do you want to ask any questions ? " They shook their heads . " No , Mother , " William said . " Do you understand it ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Sherwood carrying the baby in her womb . He 'd never seen a newborn baby . The first time he saw the baby it weighed twenty pounds . He wanted to know how it got out . But he was too ashamed to ask . Their mother 's raw embarrassment had affected them with a strange sense of guilt . They knew less than before , when they 'd assumed that babies were born like other animals . Now they were confused . They 'd formed no clear association betweensexual intercourse and the conceiving of a baby . To them sexual intercourse was still something sly and dirty the grownups did.  |p126The  school bell rang . Finally they set off to college in their knee breeches and black cotton stockings , burdened with a vague picture of giant babies in their mothers ' stomachs . But they distrusted even this knowledge and felt flooded with shame whenever they saw men and women embrace . The sight of them was a shock to their classmates . " You chillun lost , ain'tcha ? " " Them ain ' chillun , them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The women thought it funny . The professors had a problem also . The studentsthumped the children 's heads with their knuckles . " Naw , he ain ' ripe . " They guffawed . " Bastard nigger ! " Charles cursed , charging his tormentors . The students held him off . " Where you learn to cuss , li'l niggah ? " " He bad , ain ' he . He tough . " " We take that out ' im . " They trudged behind their elders from one dim basement to another . " Po ' li'l tadpoles , doan you cryYou 'll be bullfrogs by ' n by "  --  the students teased . The men prodded each other in the rear . The one prodded would jump and strike out , often embrace a girl . " Uh goosy good time was had by all , " some wit would whisper . " You ain ' all that goosy , " the woman would protest . " Ah 'd lak to goose you , sugar pie . " The children hovered in wide-eyed attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be talkin ' so nasty fo ' these li'l boys . Li ' 1 pitchers got big ears . " The children felt ashamed . The air seemed thick with inuendo . Grown-up speech had double meaning . Only during recitations did they fully understand it . The older students soon discovered their naivete.  | " Hey , Charlie , Ah found uh li'l pussy las ' night , " the man at the next desk whispered . " Where ? " asked Charles innocently . " It war hid way down ' tween two fine brown legs . " The man winked at his cronies and laughed . Charles blushed . " I know what you mean , " he said defensively . Jerry Ramsey walked along with the boys when they were going home one evening . " When Fess Williams calls my name one of you boys tell ' im Ah 'm gone chasing whores . " The children understood the word to be " hoers . " Jerry 's parents had a farm not far from the college . It did n't seem strange to the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going , Jerry ? " " You going to Port Gibson ? " " Naw , Ah 'm goin ' to a whorehouse in N'Orlins . " Professor Williams was a thin , dark , solemn man with a stern visage . He was always afraid his students might try to take advantage of him , and as a consequence was very strict . When he came to Jerry 's name during the roll call next morning , William punched Charles . Dutifully Charles stood and said , " He 's gone chasing hoers . " " To a hoerhouse in New Orleans , " William whispered . " To a hoerhouse in New Orleans , " Charles repeated . For an instant the room was gripped in a dead silence . Thenthe students roared with laughter . " Shut up ! " Professor Williams bellowed . The boys were frightened . They looked at each other and looked about to see what they 'd done . " Come up here , boy , " Professor Williams ordered . His black face was gray with fury . Charles went forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you say Ramsey was ? " the professor asked through clenched teeth . He was a slow-witted man and had n't grasped that the boy was the victim of a prank . " I said he was gone after hoers in a New Orleans hoerhouse , " Charles replied straightforwardly.  |p128Professor  Williams slapped him . Charles had no awe of the professors . He was a strong boy and now caught up in a violent rage he grabbed the professor about the legs and threw him to the floor . The professor struck wildly with his fists . They struggled and rolled over . The professor beat Charles in the face . Then William ran forward and jumped on the professor 's back , pulling him over . Charles came up , turning over , and began beating the professor in the face . Then the students separated them . Professor Williams sent the children home . Shortly their father arrived out of breath ; he 'd run all the way . " It 's what you get for putting them in school with uncouth grown-up savages , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story from the boys . " Whores are bad women , " their father told them . " It 's a word you should n't ever use . " That afternoon one of the young women asked Charles curiously , " Didn ' you really know what it meant ? " " Aw , sure I knew , " he muttered , blushing with shame . " I was just teasing Mr. Williams . " Still neither of them were quite certain just what a whore was . Bad how ? If it meant what the men were always whisperingabout , why go all the way to New Orleans ? There were plenty bad women on the campus ; they 'd seen them in the weeds . Some of the women students often kissed them . Once one pushed her tongue between Charles 's lips . He felt like hitting her . But the children began playing with themselves . At night they 'd sit in the outhouse and play with each other . William now experienced a definite sex sensation , but it left them both with a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . It was more fun to urinate in a long , thin arc . Often when the children encountered students in the outhouse , the men would shake their penises at them . " W'en you git sompn ' lak that you can call yo'self a man . " The children had such tiny organs that they felt inferior . Once Charles drank a glass of his urine to show how brave he was.  |p129But  for the most part that year was very vague to both the boys . The days were filled with grown-up strangers whose names they knew but whose habits they never understood . Nor did they ever learn the subtle connotations of grown-up speech , as other children , less self-sufficient , might easily have done . Their almost primitive , incurious innocence was kept intact . The deepest impressions came from their mother 's incessant nagging . Her voice , like a stream of bile , flowed endlessly through the house . " Mr. Taylor , I 'll never forgive you for bringing me to this Godforsaken place . God will punish you as surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored the very atmosphere . Their only escape was into the cold , lamp-lit attic . But even there the voice would search them out . " You children will catch your death of pneumonia up there , and I 'll be the one who 'll have to look after you . Your father-11 run to his shop and chase around what manner of people nobody knows all night long . Come right down out of that cold . If you ca n't find anything to do but ruin your eyes reading , blame it on your father . He brought us down here to this Godforsaken place among these heathen savages ... " However , there were times when Charles escaped and read alone and she seemed to have completely forgotten his existence . In the cold , dimly lit attic he fought a thousand duels and saved as many damsels in distress . He was Ivanhoe and Richard the Lionhearted , Alexander the Great and the Count of Monte Cristo , Genghis Khan and the Scarlet Pimpernel . It was often his face in the iron mask , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage from the mud . Most often he was Achilles chasing Hector around the walls of Troy . When all else failed  --  when he ached with loneliness and Caesar 's legions failed to conquer ; when Ivanhoe had bad dreams and Horatio could n't hold the bridge and mud was clinging to his mother 's feet  --  then he was Achilles . There was something poignantly apt about being Achilles in Mississippi . In the end , Mrs. Taylor got them out . She went to Vicks/burg and registered in a white hotel . When she came down next morning the manager confronted her . " You gave a college for your address . What college is this , Madam ? " " The state college . " " The state college ? But that 's in  --  " " The state college for Negroes . " Again the governor had to intervene . He telephoned ProfessorTaylor at the college . " Willie , Ah 'll give you forty-eight hours to get that woman out of Mississippi . " Packing was a nightmare . So many of Mrs. Taylor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wagons came all day , carting away their furniture . They left at twilight and went down the long dark road , as they had come seven years before , to catch a train at nine o'clock . They were going to St. Louis . Charles cried . It was the first of a long , unending series of good-byes . It was the end of something ; the beginning of change . Charles never liked change ; he was more sensitive to it than most . He was affected by its imminence and again by its actuality . It required the readjustment of his two worlds ; sometimes he made the one without the other , never both , often none . For all its unpleasantness , his life in Mississippi had been simply wonderful . It was the end . He hated the end of anything . He cried for Mississippi . Professor Taylor bought a huge old house beside a Catholic school in a changing neighborhood . It was a cold , austere house , once pretentious , with dark oak-paneled halls and cracked marble mantelpieces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead smell of old coal smoke seeped from its ancient flues . The dim gas jets filled the gloomy rooms with trembling shades . The children hated the house . They hated its smell of death . They spent most of their time in the backyard and the shed . They could hear the subdued voices of the phantom children behind the high stone wall next door.  |p131In  the twilight after supper they sat on the high stone steps . Below on the pavement people passed . The colored people spoke . " Good evening . " " Good evening . " From behind came the strained hushed voices of their parents . " I 'm doing what I can , Lillian , honey , Until something better comes I 'll just have to take it . " " You 'll not talk me into leaving here again , Mr. Taylor . " Other parents were sitting on their porches in the cool dim light . The tip of a cigar glowed . Away on Taylor Avenue a street car passed , its trolley striking blue lightning in the dusk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many people in the city . They lived so close together . The arc light at the corner sputtered and hissed . Down the street under the distant light , children played wildly . The Taylor children listened tensely to their strange excited voices . Five . . . ten . . . fifteen . . . twenty .. . Are you ready ? . . . I 'm not readyTwenty-five . . . thirty . . . thirty-five . . . forty .. . You 're peeping .. . No I 'm notCount again .. . Forty-five . . . fifty . . . I 'm coming , ready or not .. . Then the sound of running feet as they peered toward the wild motion ; the squeals as one was caught .. . You 're it . . . you 're it .. . Five . . . ten . . . fifteen . . . twenty .. . They were assailed with loneliness . " Can we go play , Mother ? " " When you get to meet the children , Mother will let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind on other things . " Mother will take you to meet them as soon as we meet the parents . " " Let the children go , honey , they ca n't hurt anything . " " I 'll not have my children running like wild animals through the streets . " Charles stood up . " I 'm going to get a drink of water . " He rushed from the kitchen , flying down the alley . Then he stood in the darkness near the wildly playing children . The white children were playing with the colored . He was taken for one of them in the dark ; a hand touched his arm . " You 're it ! " a voice cried . " You 're it ! " He turned and ran like light up the dark alley and disappeared into his own backyard . He was out of breath when he returned to the porch . His parents did n't notice . The summer passed in a strange lonely tension . And suddenlythey were gone . The house was closed and they were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pine Bluff , Arkansas . Teaching was his way of life . Mrs. Taylor had to face up to it . OUT AT THE END OF TOWN , ON THE FLATS WHEREthe Iron Mountain and Southern Railroads crossed , a group of wooden buildings had been thrown up to house the Negro college . The Taylors took a house two miles away , along the tracks . Nearby was the Negro business section ; out where the pavement ended was the " Patch . " The white world was sealed off . By comparisonthe colored world seemed shrunken and distorted , as ifp133a specimen had been placed beneath an inverted microscope and had become strangely infinitesimal . In the morning long lines of colored children filed down the railroad tracks , going to the city school . They stood to one side , their ragged clothing flying in the rush of air like the banners of their section , their black faces lifted curiously , eyes intent , as a train went by . The Taylor children went to college . They loved to walk the rails . " See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're looking but I 'm not . " " I am not looking . " " You are too . " They tried to walk the two miles without once stepping off . Often the other children challenged their right of way . One would push the other off . Then there 'd be a fight . Excited childishfaces would ring the fighters in . The brothers always fought together . They had become savage again . A train would pass and they 'd race the engine , flying recklesslyalong the shoulder of the bed . All the way to school they threw rocks at the telegraph poles . They stuck close together and delighted in goading the ragged city children . Hardly a week went by without their getting into a rock fight . Once Charles tried to hop a fast freight . He ran mightily along the gravel bed and leaped for the low iron rung . His hands got hold , but he was flung about , his back striking the side of the box car , and then hurled to the gravel bed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the rail . The onrushing heavy steel wheel struck them as they turned , knocked them away from the rail as it sped on . He kept rolling down the steep embankment , came up skinned and breathless in the gulley . " Whew ! " he whistled , laughing . " Whew ! " " You almost got run over ! " William screamed in agitation . Charles laughed at his older brother . " It threw me all right . But I got the trick . You got ta jump on the journal box . "  |p134The  next morning he waited for the train and hopped it . A neighbor told their mother . " I do n't know what 's getting into you children ; you 're becomingso ugly , " she scolded . Their father whipped them , and afterwards made them walk to school with him . To show his defiance , Charles hopped a freight and rode all the way to Little Rock and was gone all day . He took another whipping . They did n't like the college . It was bleak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restless . They were always running away from it ; running away from something . They cut classes to go wandering about the town . They loved to pick a street and see where it would end . Carnivals delighted them , opening up a strange new world . In the twilight after supper they 'd ask : " Can we go down to the corner , mother ? " " To the corner ? What for ? What 's happening at the corner ? " " Nothing . We just want to take a walk . It gets so tiresome staying in the house all the time . " " You have your homework to do . " " We wo n't be gone but a minute . We do n't have to do any homework anyway . We 're way ahead of the class . " Finally their father would say , " Let them go , honey . There 's nothing they can get into . " " Well  --  do n't be gone long , " she 'd call as they took off like a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on Cherry Street and stand for a minute , out of breath , watching the fascinatingspectacle , the crowds of white people , the ferris wheel and the carrousel and glittering midway  --  and then run home again . " Where did you children go ? " their mother would ask anxiously . " Just down to the railroad tracks . " " You 've been running ; you 're out of breath . " " We ran back . "  | " I 've told you time and again to stay away from the railroad tracks . " " We were n't on the tracks . We were standing off to one side watching the signal lights . " " It 's getting so I ca n't believe a word you say , " she complained . It was that way all that fall . Now they 'd stay out roaming the streets until nine and ten o'clock . They were always running . Their father whipped them now , but they did n't care . Their mother was assailed by her old anxiety . They acted so ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a defiance in their attitude that made their acts seem actually wicked , as if knowing right from wrong only bedeviled them . Charles worried her most . There was a vein of violence in his nature that kept her constantly on edge . She lived in constant dread of his killing some other boy , or getting himself killed or maimed for life . She becameobsessed with the fear that God was going to punish her for the strange passion she had for him . She brooded for weeks , worrying and fretting between moments of intense anguish . She doubted if he 'd live to see his twenty-first birthday . Life would never take his reckless challenge ; it would kill him . But what brought her such deep torture was the fear that it would hurt him first . Out of all her sons she dreaded most to see him hurt . He would buck and strain against it and die in abject misery . And then , it was as if God sent the smallpox to save them from destruction . The day before Christmas both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they had caught common colds . But when her treatment failed to get results she called the doctor . He was familiar with the dread disease and clamped a quarantine . Within the hour the house was posted . Their father rushed home , but was n't allowed inside the picket fence . Mrs. Taylor talked to him from the porch . The children had been put to bed . For three days they were critically ill , drifting in and out of delirium as their fever rose and fell . Their mother waited on them hand and foot . When the pustules came she anointed themp136constantly with carbolic salve . They lay naked on the slimy bed , the touch of cloth unbearable . Their bodies were covered with eruptions from head to foot , the palms of their hands , beneath their fingernails , the soles of their feet ; their faces and lips and ears were a mass of greasy pus . During the long hours when little else could be done , their mother prayed . " God take my life ... give me the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I 'll do anything . . . I 'll he a good wife .. . I 'll follow Your teaching ... " The bodies of her sons seemed rolling away before her very eyes . " God in Heaven , what have they done ? " she cried in anguish . " What have my children done that You should punish them like this ? " Professor Taylor came and stood outside the fence . He brought food which he tossed into the yard . Nights he slept in the men 's dormitory . Mrs. Taylor stood in the door and talked to him when she was not too weary . For hours in the settling dusk and on into the night he kept a lonely vigil . Walking back and forth before the picket fence he also prayed . In their extremity there was only God for both . Both had been reared in a God-fearing tradition ; both knew no other light . " Lord , have mercy , have mercy on my boys , " he would mutter to himself as he walked back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dark gray suit , high celluloid collar and a worn derby hat , fading into the gathering darkness . " God , have mercy on my sons . " Fear did n't touch the children ; they were too sick to know . There was only a cottony haze of unending misery , trancelike in its persistence , almost remote ; thirst and the strange sliding into blackness . Charles found it soothing to drift into delirium . When the crisis passed , their mother 's heart sang like a mockingbird . Professor Taylor stood crying in the street , joined by friends and curious neighbors . But the children were assailed by an unendurable itch ; their hours were filled with longing to scratch . Their hands were tied in pillows at their backs as the scabs began to form ; but in theirp137itching frenzy they tore the mattress with their teeth . They screamed and raged in misery and frustration . " If you pick the scabs they 'll leave pockmarks , " their mother said . " You do n't want your faces filled with pockmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief of scratching they were willing to pay the price . Finally the scabs began to fall ; the itching passed . They stood in the window and waved to their father and watched the people pass . Soon they were up and about ; the quarantine was lifted . Mother and father knelt beside the children and thanked God . Mrs. Taylor felt that God had given her another chance . Afterwards , she took her husband 's hand and promised solemnly , " I will be a good wife to you , Mr. Taylor . " The furniture in their room was burned ; the house was closed and fumigated . They went to a neighbor 's house and Mrs. Taylor slept ; her deep-set eyes were haggard and she was skin and bones . The children found it good to be out in the open again . Both retained slight pocks , almost unnoticeable , on the bridges of their noses . Now they could boast of having had smallpox . Professor Taylor moved his family from the haunted house out on a hill called Battleville where Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a high bluff overlooking a muddystream , was a skeet trap , and all Sunday long the booming shot-gun blasts of white men shooting skeet lay heavily on the singing in the little frame church . Sometimes the children slipped away from home and joined others standing at a distance watching . They loved to climb the bluff , but the shooters made it dangerous . Although their mother restrained them as she always had , they knew that she was changed . She was thinner and more nervous , but she was kinder , too , and she rarely nagged them anymore . She was more pleasant toward their father , and their home was happier than ever before . " You are big boys now and must stay for church after Sunday school , " she bade them . " You must express your love and thanksgivingtoward God for bringing you through alive . " They did n't mind . There was always something fascinatingp138happening in church . Once a baptism was held way across town in the Arkansas River and there was a fish fry afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gaily clad black people , filled with their joy of God , frolicked happily among the shanties and broken-down jetties along the river bank . The liquid laughter and caressing voices , smell of frying catfish , dimly moving people melting into the gloom , made magic of the strange night scene , and Charles was lost in fantasy , wanting to hold the moment and never let it end . Soft strange happenings touched him ; the dark , whispering river , a young girl 's smooth black face silhouetted against the deepening dusk . He liked the mystery of the half-seen , the poetry of the dark . Sharp , hard-angled perspective always kept him tense . And he hated dirtiness and vulgarity in anyone . Once , at a Sunday afternoon picnic in the far-off woods , a brash young thirteen-year-old girl named Susie kept urging him , " Come on ' n do it to me , baby . Come on , doan be so skeered . " She wore white shorts and her long black legs were goosepimpled ; there were scars on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze . He was n't scared ; inside he was sick with shame . Afterwards , in Sunday school , he avoided her ; he would n't look at her . Then suddenly a tug , he 'd turn ; her slant brown eyes were daring him . Finally he told William . " What do you mean ? " William asked . " She wants me to do it to her . " " You let her alone , " William said . " You should n't think of anything like that . Besides , you do n't know how . " " I do , too , know how . " But shortly afterwards , study began claiming their attention . Their studies had become interesting at last . They plodded eagerly from class to class , along the cinder paths between the crowded buildings , their footsteps ringing hollowly on the worn wooden stairs . Both loved chemistry . Their happiest hours were spent in the laboratory in the basement of the chapel , arranging complicated apparatus , melting crystals over the Bunsen burners , heatingp139strange mixtures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complacent patience of a squaw grinding corn . The formation of water by burning hydrogen held them in breathless anticipation . They were intrigued by all experimentation , and were always doing something on their own  --  silverplatingpennies , dropping a tiny ball of sodium to dance crazily on the surface of a beaker of water , dunking copper wire into sulphuric acid . The mystery of the commonplace was especially alluring . At dinner they 'd say , " Please pass the sodium chloride . " " I 'll have a glass of H20 . " " Mother , you did n't put enough C12 H22 O11 in this pudding . " Their mother indulged them laughingly . " Pretty soon there 'll be no living with you two . " They were startled to learn that gunpowder was made from common ordinary sulphur , saltpeter and charcoal . And if you mixed it with potassium chlorate and powdered glass it would detonate itself , like the torpedoes used in the great world war . They made little torpedoes to put on the streetcar tracks and stood nearby until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the motorman got out to see what had caused the explosion . Explosives held for them a special fascination . They blew up buckets and washtubs and barrels . Their mother became a nervouswreck . Once Charles exploded a dynamite cap on the front porch . Luckily the charge went down instead of up and blew a hole through the floor . The only injuries to himself were tiny cuts all over his face and hands , as if his skin had burst in a hundred different places . After that their mother forbade them to make any kind of explosive . But in the lab , without her knowledge , they worked industriouslyat making guncotton and improving their torpedo charges . They often stumped their professor by forming some unfamiliar compound . Once they filled the lab with bromine gas , bringing out the school fire department . The volunteers came galloping across the yard , lugging the carts of hose . Classes had to be letp140out for the remainder of the day to allow the gas to clear . The children were unharmed . " God takes care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And fortunately , you are both . " " It 's just that we know our stuff , " William replied boastfully . " We can make anything , " Charles echoed . Their mother was struck by their complacency and felt a suddenfear . " Do be careful , children . Chemicals are so dangerous . " " We wo n't get hurt , " William assured her . " We 're careful , " Charles echoed . EACH YEAR , DURING THE WEEK OF COMMENCEment , a program was held in the auditorium so the undergraduatescould demonstrate their skills . Selected students from every department performed rare feats of learning . A portable forge and anvil was rolled upon the stage and mules were shod , cows were milked , dresses stitched , pies baked , poetry recited ; and there were weighty discussions in the fields of science and history . It had a circus aspect and there were always thrills and laughter . Though dedicated to the parents , everyone attended . The Taylor children were chosen to make explosives . Their mother was torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . " And right up on the stage . Why ca n't they do something less dangerous ? " " They 're not going to throw a bomb into the audience , honey , " Professor Taylor reassured her . " My students 'll have a live forge going and that 'll be more dangerous than anything . " " But explosives ? What will the parents think you 're teaching them at the college ? " Professor Taylor chuckled . " You have a point . But they 're very good at it , honey . And since the war everybody 's talking about explosives . Professor Tanner thought it 'd be effective . "  | " Effective indeed ! I 'm sure it 'll be effective , " she said dis paragingly . The children were thrilled and excited by the prospect . For days before the exercises it was all they talked about . They had made a number of torpedoes in the lab which they exploded in their backyard the morning of the big shindig . It made their mother nervous . " Do stop playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told you time and again and I 'm not going to tell you anymore . " " We 're practising , " Charles replied . " You 're doing no such thing , " she contradicted crossly . " You 're just taking this opportunity to disobey your mother . " " What do you know about what we 're doing ? " Charles said defiantly . " Do n't you dare talk back to me , " she said . In a fit of resentment , when she 'd withdrawn , Charles threw a torpedo against the house . It exploded with a terrible bang . She rushed into the backyard . " Which one of you did that ? " she demanded , her face flaming with fury . Charles looked at her challengingly . " I did . " Her mouth closed grimly with anxiety and rage . " Just for that you sha n't take part in tonight 's program . " " I do n't care , " he replied sullenly . " You do n't want us to any-way . " His insolence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's gotten into you . " " Nothing 's gotten into me . You 're always fussing . Fuss-fussfussall the time . " She never permitted the children to talk back . But now her anger was torn with worry . She did n't know what was coming over him . " God does n't like ugly , " she finally said . The remark infuriated him ; he 'd heard it all his life . " Who cares ? " he muttered recklessly . She was profoundly shocked by what she considered blasphemy . He , too , was frightened by his own remark , as if he 'd gone beyond the realm of safety . He 'd always considered God asp142omnipresent , able to reach out and touch you at His will . It would not have surprised him had God struck him dead , or burnt him to a cinder . " God is going to punish you , " she said grimly . " God is going to punish you as surely as you 're standing there . " And he believed it . But from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiance to the end . " I do n't care , " he said . " Let Him punish me . " Mrs. Taylor looked at him silently , her face settling into lines of agony . She went into the house , trembling with fear for him . God was going to hurt him in some awful way , and there was nothing she could do to stop it . She closed herself within her room and prayed God to forgive him . Charles was silent all through dinner . His mother would n't look at him . William looked at his brother covertly . Professor Taylor wondered at the strain . " What 's the trouble , son ? " " Charles has been ugly , " his mother replied . " And he sha n't take part in the program . " " Ugly ! Ugly ! Ugly ! " Charles shouted , jumping from the table . " That 's all I hear  --  ugly-ugly-ugly ! I s'pose if I was a sissy like Andy Baldwin you 'd be satisfied , " he said , dashing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupping her face in her hands . " God is going to punish him , " she sobbed . " There , there , honey , " her husband consoled . " He 'll be all right . He 's just high-strung , and he 's excited . After tonight he 'll settle down . " She looked up , her face hardening beneath the tears . " He sha n't take part in the program , and that 's that ! He 'll have to learn to control himself . " " But , honey , Professor Tanner 's depending on the boys . " " I do n't care , " she said . " He 's not going to get away with his insolence . " " I can do it by myself , " William said , looking at his father . Charles was bitterly disappointed . It was a sad , silent family that set out for the chapel . Charles was put to ushering . Whenp143he passed his mother 's seat she looked away . He thought she 'd put a curse on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out . A strange unearthly fear filled the corners of his mind and he began trembling in the dark . The exercises he scarcely noticed . He stood by a window looking out into the night . Orion winked indifferently from the distance and the Milky Way settled on his melancholy . He 'd never see the stars again , or his mother or father or brother or anything . His mother did n't matter , he did n't care if he never saw her again ; but his brother he 'd miss most . He 'd be lost without his brother . And he 'd never again see him throughout all eternity because he was going to Hell and Will would go to Heaven . His brother 's voice captured his attention . He looked back toward the stage . William stood before a small wooden table , grinding solids in a mortar . He talked as he worked . " Now I 'll add point seven-five cubic centimeters of potassium nitrate , KNO3 , " he looked up and grinned , " which is known to you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience . Charles watched him make the familiar moves , thinking of all the fun they 'd had at it . And now they 'd never do that again  --  or anything . He saw William add the potassium chlorate , explaining that it was the oxidizer ; and then the powdered glass  --  the detonator . Now the pestle moved so delicately in the mortar as William said , " Do n't be alarmed , I wo n't hurt you , " getting another little laugh . William moved around the table and stood before the lights . Not the pestle ! Charles was thinking . Not the pestle , Will .. . The explosion came in a sudden white puff , the size of a pillowcase . William stood there for an instant in the center of the stage , the silence deafening about him , holding his face in his hands . There was something of the crucifixion in his posture , a stone of rigid tragedy in a field of barren loneliness . Some instinctive memory , working even then , warned him that to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was the stairwell down to the landing , and he went off into space . Whenp144he regained the chapel floor William was surrounded by their parents , Dr. Lukas and others of the faculty . Men were pushing forward , crying , " Clear the way ! " Downstairs he got behind the vanguard . They pressed through the confusion . William was mute . His mother held tightly to his arm , guiding him . He allowed himself to be led ; his feet stumbled on the uneven ground . On the other side his father held him up . " Here ! Over here ! " Dr. Lukas called in the darkness . They groped forward toward the car . Doors opened and there was fumbling . Professor and Mrs. Taylor got into the back seat with William between them . " Where 's Charles ? " his mother asked anxiously . " I 'm here , " he sobbed from the shadows . Suddenly he discoveredhe was crying ; salt taste was in his mouth . " Get up here with me , " Dr. Lukas said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand pump on the dashboardwhich rendered high compression . Dr. Lukas told him to work the pump . Shortly the motor roared . The car backed and turned and sped through streets of unreality , the bright lights carving strangely distorted scenes out of the dark horror in their minds . Charles wanted to turn and reach over the back seat and touch William . But he was afraid to leave off pumping . All he could do for him was this . He sat tensely , pumping for his brother 's life . No words were spoken . The race was against despair . Prayer fused them within the doubtful hope . Charles was afraid to breathe lest God discover him . The car wheeled into a courtyard , a lighted doorway looming . A sign to one side read : EMERGENCYENTRANCE . Dr. Lukas sounded the horn and jumped from the car . Two white-clad men came from within the hospital . Mrs. Taylor had gotten out and was helping William down . Professor Taylor ran around the car to help her . Two more cars roared into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A brief violent conference was taking place before the lighted entrance , the two white men surrounded by a mob of panicky Negroes . Two more white men hastened from within , and Charles saw his father move forward in an attitudep145of prayer . One of the white men slowly shook his head , regretfullyit seemed . And Charles saw his father break down and start sobbing like a baby . He 'd not moved from his seat , and now he saw his mother and William at one side , remote from the contestants , forgotten in the contest . Then another car came swiftly into the scene and a big hatlesswhite man pushed forward through the crowd . After a rapid exchange of sharp , harsh voices , the big white man came forward and took William by the arm and gently guided him across the courtyard and through the lighted entrance . Professorand Mrs. Taylor and Dr. Lukas followed in single file . The others gathered in clusters , talking tensely . Charles recognizeda number of the teachers , his chemistry professor and the college president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray . But there seemed something funny about God . At the time he did n't know what . His thoughts were unjelled . Every now and then he 'd work the pump on the dashboard . It felt that he was helping . An eternity went by . Then Dr. Lukas opened the door . Mrs. Taylor guided her son outside . His face was bandaged so that only his mouth and nose were visible . In the light from the open door Charles caught sight of his mother 's face . It was gonegone-GONE ! She was an old woman . And then a little stoopshoulderedold man came out last , stumbling on the stones . Everything broke loose inside of Charles and he doubled down in his seat crying . He felt his mother 's hand tugging him . " Charles . Charles . " Her voice had altered . It was so high and light and tremulous , as if the slightest breath would blow it all away  --  the voice of an old , old woman . " Yes , Mama , " and he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Will . . . " But it was too late . " Do n't worry , Chuck , " William whispered through the bandages . " Do n't cry . " Emotion came up and cut his breath . They took their places in the car again . Now there was no race . The race was lost . They went now through the dark winding void of tragedy to thep146colored hospital . Once more Charles touched William 's hand . But now William was mute again . Mrs. Taylor went with him into the hospital and the others followed . They waited until he was put to bed . His mother said that she would stay . Professor Taylor took his youngest son and they went out to find a streetcar . The car came and they sat huddled in the Jim-Crow section at the rear . Not until then did the nightmare grow complete . The next day his parents tried to build up hope . As soon as the tissue healed specialists would have to operate . Miraculous things had been done during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital in St. Louis . They bolstered their courage with talk of its fine surgeons . But they all knew that William was blind . And Charles knew that God , who had taken his sight , would never give it back . It left him with a sense of shock that never wore off . He might have been able to adjust to his brother 's loss of sight . But he never learned to rationalize the error of God 's judgment  --  the profound and startling knowledge that virtue did n't pay . Before , life had held a reasoned pattern . There was good on the one side and bad on the other . And anyone could tell the difference . One knew what to expect . Good had its reward , and bad its punishment . It had been that simple . Now it was complex . Who was to say what was good , if you were punished for it ? Or that a way was bad when all it ever brought was good ? God did n't like ugly , his mother always said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference , he thought bitterly . Because he himself was the one who 'd acted ugly . It made being good a farce , and took the meaning out of right and wrong . It was then that time began its nightmare race ; incidents crowded together without continuity , days lacked their accustomedfamiliarity , his actions had no meaning , commotion piled on commotion . And always there was something missing . He 'd turn in a sudden catch of excitement and say , " Will  --  " and it would break off . Hurt would cascade down until he could n't bear it . He 'd have to do something to ease it off . Whatever came to mind . A vague memory of someone saying he had stolen ap147drink from the bottle of grain alcohol in the lab  --  and he broke in and drank the whole bottle and lay sick to death , vomiting on the floor , until midnight . When he got home his parents did n't even ask where he had been . His mother looked at him queerly . They 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible choice . Both sons needed her desperately . Whichever one she tried to save , the other would be surely lost . Should it be the seeing or the blind ? But he thought in some vague way she blamed him for it . Her white old face was ravaged with despair , but the grim thin mouth was undefeated . And the curious gray-green eyes , with strange glints , seemed to follow him accusingly : Why was n't it you ? Why was n't it you ? She was so tired . She sat before the dresser with her long silky hair let down , the brush held limply in her lap . He stole timidly into the room . " Mama , I 'll brush your hair . " " All right , my son . Your mother 's very tired . " The long brown strands flowed beneath the brush . " Mama . " She waited . And then asked , " What is it , Charles ? " " I wish it 'd been me , too , Mama . " The deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clasped him to her breast . " My little boy . . . my baby . . . you must be a good boy for Mother 's sake . " At that moment she made her choice . He was so close to her , always so much a part of her , instantly he knew . " It 's all right , Mama , " he said . " It 's all right . " Now both of them were gone . He dried his tears and went back to brushing her hair , prolonging the moment . But finally she was weary . He kissed her tenderly and said goodnight . The next week Mrs. Taylor took William to St. Louis . He 'd come home for the day . Charles took him to the barbershop . Their affection had always been strangely inarticulate , expressedp148largely in their swift assistance to each other , blind headlong loyality in a fight , the completion of a sentence should one falter in class , consoling each other at night , the almost mystical sharingof joy and pain , the oneness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as sparse as signals , cryptic as a code , made up of the said and the known . " Chuck . " " Huh ? " Walking down the railroad track . " Something 's wrong . " " Old Six knew that . " " Six does n't know ' bout Joe and Maybelle . " " Ha , but he will . Look , old Billy 's loose . " " Pomp ought a be here . " " Mi Rainy ! Mi Rainy ! De goat done dead . " And they 'd stop to laugh . They 'd seldom been out of each other 's sight since Charles was born . And though often it seemed the opposite , Charles always thought of William as the leader , even when it was he who took the lead . Now it felt so strange and wrong to be guiding his brother down the cinder lane . He felt a deep sense of shame and embarrassment , as if all the older people whom they passed were hiding something . It was like coming into a church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . As if all of them together had conspired with God to do this , and in some way he knew that they were guilty . The conversation would n't jell . " Will . " " Huh ? " " That old yellow car with the bay window . " " Car ? " " Boxcar . " " Oh ! " " It came back . ' Member we marked it to see . And it came back yesterday . I saw it on a manifest on the Iron Mountain . " " Pare . " But William was n't interested . Charles could n't say look . And now he could n't say remember.  |p149They  were lost . Charles had the feeling that William was waiting only for the time when he would see again . And he knew that time was never . All that was left was the emotion that flowed between them , like the blood of joined twins . But when William left that night that was severed too . " Good-bye , Chuck . " " Good-bye , Will . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ! Not if I can s  --  er  --  hear him first . " He could n't say see but it was worse to stumble . " Good-bye , Mother . " " Good-bye , son . Please try to be a good boy . Mother worries so when you are ugly . " Ugly ! He turned and went off to one side ; and he was crying like a baby . Soon afterwards Professor Taylor took his son away from that house  --  now it also was haunted with so many hurting memories  --  and they went to room with a woman across from the campus entrance . They fixed their own meals , sharing the cookingbetween them , and made the bed in which they slept together . The food was either burnt or raw , and always tasted queer . Once Professor Taylor left a pot of beans to cook and hours later the neighbors broke in to quench the fire . Nothing seemed to go right . Their home in St. Louis had been leased until September , and Mrs. Taylor and William were rooming too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors were picking glass and scar tissue from the cornea . There were many complications ; and there was very little hope . Her letters were sad and bewailing ; she spoke of taking him to Germany if the operation failed . The gap seemed widening every day . Professor Taylor had to stay for the summer sessions and Charles worked for the school . He drove the school sedan and cleaned the president 's office . The driving took him all about the town ; twice a day he picked up mail at the main post office ; often he met the trains , took money to the bank . Someone was always after him to transport them some place . He had lunchp150with teachers in the restaurants off the grounds and was always taking ladies to Wednesday night church . He lived a strange , grown-up life . On Friday evenings motion pictures were shown on the president'slawn . Once , standing in the shadows , watching a picture the name of which he never knew , sweat started pouring from his body . It was a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat . But the sweat came out of his hair and ran down his face and he could feel it streaming down his body in a deluge . He went searching for his father , frightened . " You 're all wet , son , " his father observed . " What 've you been doing ? " " Nothing . I was standing watching the picture and all of a sudden I started to sweat . " " You 'd better go home and lie down , " his father advised . " You 've been too active lately . " " But it wo n't stop , " Charles complained . " I can feel it coming out my skin . " " You go home and I 'll get Dr. Lukas . " He went home and undressed and lay in the dark . But the sweat still streamed from his body as if he was being subjected to some insane process of dehydration . The doctor came and examined him but could find nothing wrong . " You take these and drink a lot of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pills had no effect . A pool formed about him on the sheet and sunk into the mattress . After a time it stopped as suddenly as it had begun . Most of the summer school students were teachers from the district schools . Charles had a habit of playing tennis with them during the afternoons . But after the seizure his father bade him stop . The next day he went out anyway . His father saw him from the blacksmith shop and came running across the campus . " Confound it , I 'm not going to tell you again , " he said , and picked up a rotten stick to whip Charles . Charles was sick with shame and fury at being whipped beforep151all the grown-ups he 'd been playing with . He grappled with his father and they tussled about the court , digging deep holes in the packed clay surface . Finally Charles got the stick and threw it over the fence . His father looked astonished . Without another word he turned and went back to his shop . Charles went off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the incidentin all his life . He never tried again to whip Charles . But the next day he took his son downtown and bought him new long pants . They made a difference . Now the older women looked at him . That day he was out on the tennis courts waiting for a game . Classes kept the others later and he was always first . A young woman in a short white skirt sauntered up and sat beside him . She was pretty in a slow , sensous way and he 'd never seen a woman wearing so short a skirt . Dark hair grew like tendrils from her strong smooth neck and her full-blown lips were glisteningred . She had the ripeness of the South , slumbrous eyes with dark heat circles underneath and that strange look of dissipation found in sultry climates . Her breasts shook like molds of jello beneath the cotton blouse and her heavy thighs were smoothly tan as velvet . The men thought her an exciting piece , but to Charles she was beautiful and inaccessible . He adored her instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the slurred , languid voice habitually affected . " Oh , no one in particular , " he stammered self-consciously . She glanced at him appraisingly . " Ah have n't seen you ' round before . " " Oh , I 'm out almost every day . I work for the president " " Ah must 've seen you ' round . You his nephew or somethin ' , ai n't you ? " " You 're thinking of Harry . My name is Charles  --  Charles Taylor . My father teaches blacksmithing . " " Oh , you 're Professor Taylor 's son . " She seemed impressed . " Want to play ? " Her skill was entirely dependent upon her opponent 's generosity . He let her win as often as he could , he did n't know why.  |p152Usually  he played all games with a reckless will to win . But she seemed to expect all the concessions . She 'd serve and wait complacentlyfor the return to come to her . After a couple of sets she was winded ; they quit to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work inside of him . Her proximity sent tingling waves of cold fire coursing down his spine , yet he felt strangely heavy , weak , almost lethargic . To have her enfold him in her full , tanned arms and hold him closely to her heaving , sweating body came scalding through his mind like sinful ecstasy . And yet it had no definition ; it stopped just short of sexual desire . " I 'll take you to a show , " he blurted . She looked at him , doubt mingled with expectancy . " Flow old are you ? " " I 'm seventeen , " he lied . Even that would be robbing the cradle , she thought . But the heat and exercise had flamed her blood with passion . " Ah don ' know , " she hesitated . " Ah 've got to take a bath . " " I 'll wait , " he panted excitedly . " I 'll meet you by the side gate over by the men 's dormitory . " " Well  --  all right . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed himself in his newest blue long pants with a new white shirt and tie . He waited by the gate for two hours before finally she came . She wore a white dress with pleated skirt and patent leather pumps . Now she was commonplace in a way that seemed accessible . His heart pumped flame . But she was nervous and unsure and held herself aloof . " How old did you say you were ? " she greeted him . " I 'm seventeen , " he lied again , but uncertainty cut into his ardor . Two men passed nearby and looked at them curiously . She turned away in shame . " Ah 'm too old for you , " she said harshly . " Ah 'm twenty-two . " His face mirrored his hurt and humiliation . The woman came up in her and she felt sorry for him . Tenderly she held his hands.  | " You find a girl your own age . Ah like you , honey , but you 're jes ' too young . " " All right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly around the building . Then suddenly he was running in headlong flight . He ran until he was out of breath . But the shame would n't leave him . Finally he went home . He tried to play at making out that he was great and famous and that she would come seeking his attention . But he could n't find the handle to the dream . There was no defense against his age . Afterwards he shunned the tennis courts for fear of seeing her . There was little else to do . The afternoons became empty . He took to walking out of town and wandering through the woods again . The countryside had always been his friend . On the last day of the summer session he met a girl his age . He saw her standing on the cinder walk beside the chapel . She looked lost and on the verge of tears . He 'd just alighted from the school sedan . He looked at her curiously and would have gone past . But she touched him lightly on the arm and stopped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the domestic science building ? " she asked timidly , painfully embarrassed . He felt mature and condescending . " Sure , it 's over by the diamond . Hop in , I 'll drive you over , " he offered grandiloquently . " Oh , thank you , but I can walk . " Her huge brown eyes shone shyly from a thin , fragile face . She was as tall as he but very thin , her body like a reed in the faded calico dress , but her face blossomed from the long neck like an exquisite flower . Something in the slight droop of her narrow shoulders made him think of dogtooth violets in bloom . " Why walk when you can ride , " he said arrogantly . Mutely she permitted him to bully her . He drove around the chapel and across the diamond . " You 're new , " he remarked . " Oh , we just came for sister , " she blurted out . She was rigid with self-consciousness . " Sister studied here this summer . "  |p154He  pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name ? " She glanced at him and her gaze fled off in panic . " Jessie . " " Mine 's Charles , " he said . " My brother calls me Chuck . " She saw her parents and jumped guiltily from the car . She ran off , then ran back and cried , " Thank you , " and then ran off again . He watched her go with the older people into the building . After waiting for a time he turned the car and drove away . But all that day he thought of her . She seemed so wild and fresh and yet so fragile that should she fall she 'd break . That evening during the exercises in the chapel he saw her on the steps . He took her arm . " Want to go for a ride , Jessie . " Her huge eyes widened in fright . " Oh , I could n't . " " Let 's walk then . " Her eyes sought his and lingered for a moment ; her thin taut body seemed caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked along the cinder path toward the campus gate . " I work here in the summer . My father teaches . " " I know , " she said . " It must be wonderful . " " You know ? " " I showed you to my sister . " " Oh . " And then suddenly it struck him . " Wonderful ? How ? " " Everything going on all the time . " " I do n't know , " he said thoughtfully . " I never thought about it . When Will was here we never  --  " he broke off . They left the campus and sauntered slowly up Pullen Street . Neither knew where they were going . " I guess you miss him lots . " He turned and stared at her . Her face was blurred and softly dreamlike in the dark . " My sister told me he lost his sight . " They went along in silence . After a time he said , " He 's in St. Louis now . " Later he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool hand groping for his fingers and took it gratefully . " I always wanted a brother , " she confessed.  | " I guess we wanted a sister too , although I do n't remember ever thinking of it " Then for a long time they just walked through the cool , dim night , matching strides . Their arms swung a little with their fingers locked together as they walked along without talking , caught in the entrancement of the moment . Finally she said , " We 're going back to Brinkley in the mornin ' . " " We 're going to St. Louis tomorrow too . " It frightened him . " Do n't be scared , " she said intuitively . He choked to keep fromcrying . " You can do a lot of things all by yourself . " " I know , " he said . His voice sounded strange and thick . He tried to make it clear . " I 'm always doing something . " " Not what you used to do together . " " No , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bright lights that extended down past Main . Instinctively they turned into the darkness of Cherry Street . " But I used to never tell my dreams , " he said . " I mean  --  you know  --  while you 're awake . Just sort of making up things you 'd like to do if everything was different . " " Like what ? " " Oh , like I 'd say you were Penelope and I was Ulysses returninghome from twenty years of wandering . Then I 'd make out you 'd been waiting for me all those years . " He did n't feel embarrassed ; he was excited telling it . " But you could n't really be there ; I mean , if you were there I could n't make it up . " The back of the icehouse loomed up , loading docks vague in the darkness . " Why ca n't you do it with me here ? " she whispered timidly . " You 've never tried . " He stopped to look at her and she turned from one step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " he mumbled . Then awkwardly they groped together , clumsy from inexperience . But there was a young sweet poetry in their clumsy hands and awkward motions . His mouth kept searching for her lips as they tried to adjust their faces and his arms about her slender body . Finally their lips were meeting , softly pressing in a clear ,  |p156cool  kiss . The queerest sort of feeling surged from deep inside him ; an overwhelming sense of love and purity gathered in his heart . He was flooded with the impulse to defend her . Wordlesslythey broke apart and looked straight into each other 's eyes . There was no shame ; only the bright , luminous quality of their love . Her long dark hair , worn in loose curls down on her shoulders , made a soft , delicate cameo of her thin , fragile face . " You 're very pretty , " he said chokingly . " You look something like my mother used to look . Only her hair was lighter . " " Would you like me better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're a funny boy , " she said tremulously , catchy-like , as if she thought he might vanish or fly away . He laughed from happiness . " I 'm just natural nuts . " Now she laughed along with him . " You are not ; you 're nice . " " Come on . " He took her hand . " There 's a carnival at the fairgrounds . " He must show her what he knew . Time and parents were forgotten . The night was filled with magic as they swung along . Clouds drifted in disorder across the moon . He drew her to a stop and pointed . " See , it 's Pegasus . See how the wings spread out and the hoof is raised . " He was all excited . " That 's a horse , is n't it ? " He laughed uproariously . " What a question ! Did n't you ever do that ? Play at finding things in the clouds ? Will and I used to all the time . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people mostly ; just folks whom we both knew . " " You ought 've been with us . We used to find all sort of things . " " You and I could too , " she said stoutly . " Race you ! " he said suddenly . They leaped and ran with joy . The darkness sang with happiness as they sped along . Then , there in the distance was the carnival , a noisy , crowded , ecstatic wonderland . They wandered down the midway and breathed in the excitement . White people eyed them curiously , but none bothered . They swung along , hand in hand , enveloped in a dream.  |p157But  time , that old iconoclast , kept tugging at their elbows . They made the journey home in silence , walking rapidly to keep ahead of tears . But at the end they cried anyway . She would n't let him come to where her parents waited with the whipping they held in store for her . He had to say good-bye at a distance and watch her walk away alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dear life . And as at first , their cool , young lips searched before meeting , and the taste of each other 's tears was in their kiss . The next night he was on the train going to St. Louis . He could n't stop the crying . It just kept on coming up and flooding out . These good-byes were coming too rapidly for him . He was getting so he cried easily as a baby . He thought continuously of her . In the outside night that raced along the window he saw her face in all its exquisite moods . And her voice kept time with the thumping of the wheels over the section joints . . . You 're a funny boy .. . a funny boy . . . a funny boy .. . a funny boy .. . a funny boy .. . a funny boy . . . a funny boy . . . It felt as if his heart would burst with aching .

It seemed as if the turmoil in his head would flame explosively . " Do n't cry , son , " his father gestured with vague helplessness . " It 's going to work out all right . You boys 'll be together before another year . " Charles looked up at his father , choking back his tears . Deep , sinking lines like mutilations pulled down the full , strong features of his father 's face . And his skin had lightened , taken on a grayish pallor beneath the black . The settled look of age shocked Charles to reality . " I 'll be all right , " he mumbled , knuckling at his eyes . " I 'll be all right , Dad , I 'll be all right . " Then later on he asked , " Can I get you a drink of water , Dad ? " " No , son , thanks . . . I 'm not thirsty . " The wheels clacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was gone . . . **29;7756;TOOLONG . . .

Though they 'd gotten back their house , it never became a home . Within it they became prisoners of their despair . William was being treated by famous specialists at the great hospital . He went five times a week . But no miracle had happened . One eye could distinguish light from dark ; the other could make out type print held an inch or two away , and distinguishoutlines at a distance of four or five feet . Grafting corneas to both eyes was considered , but only a few such operations had been attempted , and the ratio of success was low . There was the added difficulty of obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living persons or from corpses shortly dead . His mother offered hers , but the doctors did n't think it worth the risk . Charles was never told for fear he might do something rash . The major hope was to remove sufficient scar tissue so light could penetrate . It was a slow , nerve-racking process that went on all that summer . But William never seemed discouraged , never complained . Charles was awed by his brother 's courage . In William 's presence he became inarticulate , but worshiped him across the gap . Tom was there that summer . He did all the things for William that Charles would have liked to do  --  little things like walking him to the store , taking him to the barbershop , buying him somethingspecial . Their mother did the special things , like taking him to the hospital and cutting up his food . Charles felt left out . It seemed as if he was too young to be of any good at all . Tom was working as a bus boy in a downtown restaurant . He'dp159come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles would massage his arm and feel that he was helping . Professor Taylor had no ability at all for city life . At heart he was a missionary . He 'd lived his life in southern Negro colleges . There , a professor was somebody . He counted in the neighborhood . His family counted too . But in St. Louis he did n't count . He 'd gotten a job waiting on tables in a roadhouse out near Carondulet . " It 's a goddamned crying shame about that son of yours , Willie , " his boss , Joe Terry , would say , shaking his head in real lament . " You ought a be back teaching your people instead of here waiting on roughnecks like these . " Professor Taylor would smile courageously . " Mr. Terry , the world 's not coming to an end because I 'm away from teaching for a year or two . " It was in his home that he 'd been defeated . He was a pathetic figure coming home from work ; a small black man hunched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old cap pulled down over his tired , glazed eyes , a cigarette dangling from loose lips . His occupation was never mentioned before the children . But they 'd overheard their parents discussing it , and were ashamed for him . Usually they were long in bed when he returned from work . But once , going to the bathroom , Charles saw his father slowly trudging up the stairs . He looked so old and stooped and beaten . It frightened him . Suppose his father died . What would become of them ? For a short time at summer 's end , after Tom had returned to school , Charles had William to himself . The bandages had been removed from William 's eyes but the burnt lids and bluish-tinted irises were more shocking than before . Both tried desperately to recapture the old feeling . They fell into their old-time habit of playing rough , tusseling with each other and doing feats of strength and agility . But suddenly William would turn to shout excitedly and Charles would catch sight of the blueish pebbles in the burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He justp160could n't get over it . Or William would bump head-on into something , and the hurt would course through Charles like brackish , bitter venom . He was always keyed up , too anxious to make his playing seem natural . They 'd rob a huckster 's wagon in the early dusk and race wildly down the alley with the apples and bananas . William 's foot would catch on some obvious obstruction , an overturned garbage can , a kid 's tricycle , and he 'd pitch headlong , sprawling on the bricks . Quick , violent protest would shake Charles loose from reason ; with a savage insane gesture he 'd throw his own stolen fruit in a blind arc , breaking windows , he did n't care . Once they were out in the alley throwing rocks at a garbage can placed against the schoolyard wall . William had got the range and was doing fine . Their mother called Charles and he was gone for a moment . William went forward to grope beside the can for rocks . Charles dashed back , throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the rock was on its way . " Will ! " he screamed in terror . William looked quickly up , seeing nothing , and the rock struck him in the center of the forehead right between the eyes . Caught in rigidity , hurt surged through Charles like acid in his veins . Then he ran forward . But William had gotten up and was dabbing at the cut with a handkerchief . He heard his younger brother 's gasping breath and laughed it off . " It was n't your fault , Chuck . I was n't looking . " Charles could n't take it . After that he quit playing with his brother . And the gap widened . Charles hated the city high school . He was given entrance examinations and assigned to the second year . The teachers found it hard to comprehend that he 'd attended college . " Now what 's the name of that school you attended in Arkansas ? " his home room teacher , Mr. Sawyer , asked . " Well , they called it a college . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor 's son because they did n't know Professor Taylor either . And there was something about the students he never liked.  |p161They  were all so preoccupied with themselves , so quick to ostracizeand condescend . They seemed to him so cheap-smart and city-dirty . At first they were distant and unfriendly . He was alone now ; alone against them all . William had entered the state school for the blind and Charles went with him on Saturdays . Unlike the city schools , here Negroes were n't segregated . Charles wondered if it was because the students could n't see . William enjoyed it . But for Charles , Saturdays became a time of death . There was something unearthly about the blind studentsmoving so cheerfully among the grim , forlorn buildings . He could n't meet the teachers ' eyes . A sense of guilt shattered him . He felt so awfully ashamed for having sight . He 'd leave his brother at the door and run until he could n't breathe . William studied braille and took lessons on the clarinet and soon was playing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of them had a wonderful sense of humor . Their errors due to blindness were a constant source of merriment . William was always recounting something funny he 'd done , such as entering the girls ' toilet by mistake . In the darkness he could n't see at all . He felt around and his hand had encounteredhair . " I said , Excuse me , I 'm looking for the urinal . ' Then someone said in a shrill voice , Wrong department . ' " He laughed uproariously . It made the goose flesh crawl on Charles . Finally he asked in a small , strangled voice , " What 'd you do ? " " Heck , I just laughed and went across the hall . " Nights when the band rehearsed , all of them were accompanied by relatives . It was something like a party ; they laughed and talked between rehearsals and ate ice cream and cake . Everyone but Charles had fun ; he sat apart , self-conscious , fuming with impotent rage , cauterized with guilt . . . How could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could they ? his mind protested . Sometimes his brother turned and spoke to him , thinking him nearby , and he 'd have to hurry over . " What 'd you say , Will ? "  | " Oh  --  nothing much . Where were you ? " " I  --  I was n't listening , is all . " The other relatives looked at him curiously . Frequently they smiled in his direction . But he held himself rigidly aloof and unapproachable . In all his actions he was braced against the world . Athletics gave some relief . Across from the high school was a public playground where gangs of city hoodlums collected after school and played a dirty , vicious brutal game which they called football . That became Charles 's outlet . He played out of a deep subconscious compulsion to kill himself . Bareheaded and wearing only a sweater over his shirt , he 'd dive headfirst to make a tackle , flying through the air to meet with full impact a pair of pumping feet . " Nine  --  nineteen  --  twenty-nine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unconsciously calling the death row in lottery , and he 'd receive the ball and start heading , high-kneeing and swivelhipping , toward the violent men , spinning away from one , jumpingover another , until they pulled him down . They 'd pile on top of him , dig their elbows into his back , slam his face into the rocky ground . He 'd get up grinning , teeth chipped , slightly dazed . And for a moment he 'd be free of all the hurt and guilt inside of him . A curious phenomenon took place within his mind that winter . Whole periods of his past became lost to recollection . There was no pattern , no continuity , no rational deletions , as the editing of a text . Fragments of days , whole months , a chain of afternoons were drawn at random , a word would be missing from a sentence which he recalled with startling clarity , the intended meaning now gone . He did n't remember a single recitation period from all the years of his mother 's teaching in Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading up and the nightmare afterwards , were branded on his brain . But from the time he and his father left the hospital to return home , until William , with their mother , boarded the train for St. Louis , was a complete blank . He did n't remember the girl , Jessie , how she looked , what she said , nor their walk out to the carnival on Cherry Street that night at all . But he remembered the discovery of their love likep163the lingering poignance of a moving dream , the dream itself having vanished on awakening . And the feeling of the emotion was still so strong within him at nights it made him cry . It was as if a madman had snatched pages from a treasured book , the story stopping eerily in the middle of a sentence , a gaping hole left in the lives of all the characters , the senses groping futilely to fill the missing parts , gone now , senselessly gone , now the meaning all distorted as if coming suddenly and unexpectedly into a street of funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never lived within their house at all ; never eaten a meal in the dining room , never sat together in the living room . , But outwardly he was helpful and obedient . He was wonderfullyconsiderate toward his brother . When it became cold enough to freeze the lakes they went sledding in Forest Park . Directly in front of the Art Museum was a long , steep slope adjoining the lake and when the snow was packed the sleds went down at a furious pace and coasted far across the lake . William loved to sled . Charles sat at the front to steer , William clung behind , and when it came their turn the policeman on duty gave them a mighty push . It seemed as if they soared through the air . William whooped and yelled like an Indian putting out his face to catch the hard cold push of air . Charles set his teeth and braced his body against disaster . He always felt a sense of trepidation , a fragile , fluttery feeling inside , such as he experiencedwhen looking down from heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time he 'd come apart inside . But Forest Park held their fondest times together . On Sunday afternoons their father came with them . The zoo enthralled them both . William , his head cocked , listened to the scolding of the monkeys . " You can almost understand them , Check . " Charles was fascinated by the lion 's silent prowling , back and forth , back and forth , his gaze caught in the lambent , hypnotic eyes coming forward toward the bars , the fluid body turning like running water , his gaze released , caught , released , caught , released , endlessly . They always tried to reach the birdhouse at feeding time.  | " Listen to the babble of the birds , " William said . It was his great delight . In the spring they liked to walk across the ordered acres , down the long stone walks between the sentinel trees , coming suddenly upon the wildness of a rocky hill . It was away , care was momentarilygone , the people here were all trespassers like themselves . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday afternoons . Spring in St. Louis was a haunting time . The barbecue pits in the backyards were fired and the soft warm evenings were pungentwith the scent of sizzling pork . Excited childish voices floated through the dusk . Five . . . fifteen .. . twenty-five ... Are you ready ? .. . Children fled and screamed . And the morning air smelled of dew and growing things . For that brief period a little bit of country came to the city 's cluttered streets . Once Charles awakened in the night and felt his brother crying . Sharply he recalled a night a long time before when he 'd run off to a fire and had seen a strange lonely lady and was crying for her in the dark ; and his brother 's voice , consoling , " Do n't cry , Chuck . Go to sleep , Chuck . Everything 's going to be all right . " Now he wanted to console his brother as he had been consoled . But he could n't find the words . He clenched his teeth and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job cleaning and delivering for an old German druggist , and his father bought him a secondhand bicycle . The first morning he swept and mopped the floor and wiped the candy counters . He 'd hung his sweater alongside his employer 's , and when the old man was n't looking , stole a package of cigarettes , two packages of chewing gum and a chocolate bar and slipped them into its pocket . At last the druggist sent him on a delivery . On his return the old man thrust his hand into the sweater pocket and dramatically displayed the loot . " You are a thief ! " he shouted , his blue eyesp165dancing beneath the bushy brows . " I should call the police and have you arrested ! " Charles quaked with fright . " The minute I turn my back you steal this trash . " Furiously the old man shook the loot before his face . " Go ! Get out of my sight ! Here , take your sweater , " he called as Charles ran off without it . " II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd tell her you 're a thief . " Ile snatched his sweater and fled . For hours he cycled up and down unfamiliar streets . He was in a daze . He did n't know why he 'd stolen . He did n't want the things he 'd stolen . And he knew the old man would have given him the chewing gum and candy . It was late that night when he went home . The house was quiet . A single light burned in the living room . His mother was waiting up for him . " You must be tired , son , " she said . " Why must you work so late ? " " I had to clean up after the store was closed , " he lied . " But why could n't you do it tomorrow morning ? " " I quit , mother . I told the druggist I was n't coming back . He asked me to stay and clean up for him . " She looked at him searchingly . He could n't meet her eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , mother , I just did n't like the job . " " Do n't get into any trouble , son . Mother could n't bear it . " She arose and led him toward the kitchen . " I saved your dinner . " He watched her as she busied about the stove . She looked so frail and tiny and so old . Gray streaks fell like stripes of sorrow in the long brown tresses he 'd loved so passionately to brush . She was like some strange little white woman he 'd never seen before . What had she to do with him ? He felt trapped in another person'shouse , sitting at another 's table , looking at a stranger 's mother . And then she turned with his plate . He met the greenish glint of her deep-set eyes , and saw the tender worry they held for him . Suddenly she was his own beloved mother in an overwhelmingflood.  | " Mama , Mama . " He groped blindly forward and clasped her about the waist . She put down the plate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby , " she sang tenderly , the crying note of worry cutting through his heart . " My little baby . What have you done now ? " " Nothing , Mama , " he sobbed . " Nothing . I have n't done anything , honest . I just love you , Mama . And I hate to see you worry so . " " Mother loves you also , son . That 's why Mother worries so . " After a moment he wiped his face and ate his food . He made a vow to himself that he would never steal again . And three weeks later he was fired from another job for stealing . All that day he 'd stolen things to carry home  --  a camera , a nickel-plated watch , a carton of cigarettes and two quarts of ice cream  --  and had stored them in an empty barrel in the basement . His employer , Mr. Greenbaum , had been watching him all day . At quitting time he called Charles down and confronted him . " I did n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had to vomit . " I did n't put it there . " " You seemed like such an honest boy , " Mr. Greenbaum said . " Maybe if you 're stopped now you can make something out of yourself . " " I did n't put it there . I do n't know who stole it . It was n't me . " The ice cream had melted and ruined everything . Mr. Greenbaumsadly shook his head . " The loss . It 's nothing to me , boy . I can afford it . It wo n't break me . But the loss to you , son , you ca n't afford . " Charles felt the urge to yield , to confess and beg this kind man 's forgiveness . But to confess would have made him the defeatedone . He felt that if he once confessed he 'd be forever lost . " I did n't take it , " he denied again . " I swear it was n't me . " Mr. Greenbaum looked suddenly old and tired . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He pedaled slowly up the hill of Delmar Boulevard . He 'd always liked the name of that street ; it had such a pleasant sound . People were entering the theatres along the way . They looked so happy . Everyone was with someone else.  |p167At  Vandeventer he saw a hot dog man , the shiny , steaming kettle slung across his back . He stopped and ordered one . The man put the kettle on the pavement , spread sauerkraut between a bun and nestled down the long , black , steaming weiner . Charles sat on his bike and ate it slowly . The man lifted his kettle and went along . The night closed in . Suddenly tears scalded down his cheeks . " Goddammit ! Goddammit ! " he cried . He 'd failed his mother after all . Why could n't she take him as he was , he thought . Why was she always forcing him into making some kind of vow he could n't keep ? Why did n't she let him alone ? He threw the remainder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home . The next morning he told her he had quit . She said sadly , " You worry mother so . " For a time Tom was home that summer and she pinned her hopes on him . He 'd graduate from the university . All that week she 'd worked in preparation for his coming ; she 'd cleaned the house and polished the silver and laundered the curtains . And on the day of his arrival she 'd cooked all the things he liked , and had decorated the living room as if for Christmas . Finally the taxi came and brought him home . She rushed down the steps to greet him . " How handsome you are my son , " she sang , embracing him . Her eyes were filled with tears . Tom was startled by her greeting . " Why , Mother , you 're crying ! " he exclaimed . " Why , so I am , " she said . He was a tall , dandyish man with pretentious manners and an affected laugh . " Hello , Dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was as if he was greeting a subordinate . The children resented him . After dinner he put on his gown and mortarboard . " Now , how does your son look , Mother ? " " You are a man now , " she said . Her voice rang with pride . " Let me see it , " William asked , putting forth his hands . " Here , put it on , " Tom said.  | " Now I have two titled sons , " their mother laughed . " Mine 's no title , Mother , " Tom corrected . " It 's just a plain B.A. " " Yes , my son , but you must wear it as a title and be proud . " Later she had him to herself . Professor Taylor and the children had gone to bed . They sat in the living room and talked . She asked him what he planned to do . He 'd majored in business administrationand accounting and wanted to go into the real estate business . " My son , my son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother famous . " He was embarrassed by the intensity of her emotion . " Now , mother , do n't expect too much from me , " he protested . But he was flattered too . He got a job working on a commission basis with a Negro real estate firm . And for a time the house was filled with activity . The young women gave him a rush . His mother was so afraid he 'd get himself engaged or have to marry before he 'd had a chance to settle down she disliked all the girls . " If you ask me I think Maud is the best one of the lot , " she volunteered . He gave her a startled look . " Maud ? Why , Mother , you know you do n't think anything of the sort . She 's dark and her hair is n't four inches long and you know you would n't want her for a daughter-in-law . " " It 's not what 's on the surface , it 's what 's beneath , " she said sententiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He laughed uproariously . " Where 'd you get that one ? That 's new . I bet you just made it up . " Then suddenly he got her drift and added , " You know good and well Maud 's not only black but she 's evil too . She 's not in love with me ; she just wants a man . And you 're just sticking up for her because you think I 'm stuck on Sally . " " Well , son , you 're grown , " she said , " and if you want to marry Sally I ca n't stop you . But I 'll tell you this much , you 'll live to regretit . Sally is a lovely girl and very smart . But she 's hard and ambitious and she 'll just use you for a steppingstone. "  | " I 'm not going to marry anyone , " Tom said sharply , " so you can just relax . " He was angry with her for interfering . But soon the rush slowed up of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned their attention to young men with better prospects . He began to feel the frustration entombing all of them . More than any of the others , he sensed his father 's humiliation and defeat . The house became a prison . " I 'm going to Detroit , Mother , " he announced . " A lot of colored people are emigrating there and it 's a good field for my line . " " But this is your home , son , " she protested , shocked and at a loss for words . " Mother needs you here . " " I 'm sorry , Mother , but I ca n't stay here and live off dad . " " But we want you with us , " she insisted . " I 've got my own life to live , Mother , " he stubbornly maintained . She was bitterly disappointed . " You can do as you wish , my son . You 're grown and if you want to go I ca n't stop you . But you listen to your mother . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I allowed your father to drag us all over creation . And what has he to show for it ? " " I 've made up my mind , Mother . " Her mouth closed in a grim , unforgiving line . " If you leave me now , you need n't ever come back . " But she could n't stop him . After he 'd gone she became assailed by a sense of persecution . She came to the conclusion that all of them were trying to hurt her , Professor Taylor and the children too . At first it revealed itself in their lack of appreciation for all her sacrifices . She 'd worked herself to the bone for them , forsaken her own family , given up her friends . And at the first opportunity Tom ran off and deserted her . Nor were the others any better . Now that William could get about a little by himself , he 'd forgotten how she 'd slaved for him , nursing him night and day , reading to him by the hour . He was all taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His teachers were closer to him now than his mother . And sometimes she felt that Charles actually hated her . Later she discovered they were doing little things to hurt herp170physically , to drive her insane . One would put too much salt in the stew pot , or turn the fire up on the roast . Charles  --  she was certain it was him  --  sprinkled water in her bedroom slippers so that she would catch a cold . But she was afraid to accuse him of it ; he looked at her so strangely now . And she was positive her husband sprinkled red pepper in her bed , although she could n't catch him at it . But she knew ; she 'd wake up in the morning with her skin all red and blistered . They 'd been sleeping in twin beds in the same room . Now she moved into the room that Tom had occupied and locked the door at night . At times she became so frightened of them she 'd dress and slip out of the house . She 'd go downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their years in Mississippi had darkenedher complexion slightly . That was another thing she held against her husband . Mr. Taylor had deliberately planned it to embarrass her ; that had been his main reason for keeping her so long in Mississippi , so she 'd cease being white . Now she took to coating her face thickly with white powder and rouging her cheeks . She looked white as a corpse . On those days she ate in the white restaurants . Her desire to talk was overpowering . She got into long , involved conversations with strangers . Most times it ended in unpleasantness . She 'd say at some point in the conversation , " I destroyed my life by marrying a Negro . " The shocked , indignant people would rise and stalk away . But she could n't restrain herself . " I think my husband is trying to kill me , " she 'd say after openinga conversation with some strange woman . " Why do n't you go to the police ? " would come the shocked reply . " My husband is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were sufficient answer . The children were affected by her strangeness . Quite often it was left to Charles to cook and serve the meals . William was afraid to ask where his mother was . Their father sat alone and brooded . Charles went off at night and cycled through the lonely streets , sometimes sitting on a bench in some remote section ofp171the city , afraid to think . William visited his blind friends , or went to band rehearsal every night . Two things happened then to save their mother . Professor Taylorlost his job . Prohibition had come into effect and finally the roadhouse closed . Then William was rehospitalized for a serious operation . A cataract had begun to form across one eye . Suddenly their mother realized that she was needed . They sold the house and bought a rental property in a poorer neighborhood . They moved into one of the flats , taking only the barest necessities . Professor Taylor found employment doing odd jobs of carpentrywork . Sometimes on weekends Charles helped him . At lunch , munching the cold bologna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever going south to teach again ? " " I do n't know , son . It depends a great deal on you boys . Did you like it as well there as you do here ? " " Oh , I liked it better . We had some good times in Mississippi . " Reminiscence lit up his father 's face . " I do n't suppose you were old enough to remember the governor . " " No , but I remember hearing you and Mother talk of him . " " We might go there again if Will regains his sight . " " Dad , do you really think he 'll ever see again ? " " I do n't know , son . We can only pray . " After a long time Charles lied , " I do . " " It depends on God now . " Charles looked at his father queerly . " I suppose so " Around the first of December the doctors said there was no more they could do . They were shocked . None of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will . He lost his grip on ordinary things . Caught out in the backyard , halfway to the shed , with a hammer in his hand , he 'd forget where he was going , what he 'd intended to do . Only the mother 's indomitable will saved them . Now that she had overcome the attack of paranoia , she was stronger than before . She would n't admit defeat . " We 'll go to Cleveland , " she told her husband . " They have ap172famous clinic there . And we can live with your relatives until we get settled . " WILLIAM AND CHARLES WENT TO LIVE WITH THEIRAunt Beatrice and Uncle George in a two-story house situated on one of those strange back streets inhabited mostly by Negroes in the heart of an all-white community . Their parents rented a room nearby and took their meals with the Coopers . The Coopers had a son , Freddie , a spoiled , fat , mama 's boy . Beatrice had never forgiven Mrs. Taylor for the manner in which she 'd been treated when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taylors back at the college in Georgia . The little house was always crowded and the air was charged with flaring tempers and the clash of personalities . " You do n't like black people but soon 's you get down and out you come running to us . " " I married a black man who happens to be your brother . " " Yes , you just married him ' cause you thought he was gon na make you a great lady . " " I 'll not discuss it . " " You 're in no position to say what you 'll discuss , sister . This is my house . I pay taxes on it . " " If Mr. Taylor had n't spent all of his money sending you and your sister here from the South he 'd have something of his own now . " You dragged him down yourself , do n't go blaming it on us . If you 'd made him a good wife instead of always nagging at him , he 'd be president of a college today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . He has n't got it in him . " " Then why did you marry him ? " " Only God knows . I certainly don't. "  |p173Mr  . Cooper seemed unmoved by the seething dissension . He came in from work , a big man , six feet four , in dirty overalls , blue kerchief tied around his neck , old black hat down over his huge bald head , and sat before the gas grate in the living room waiting for his dinner . " William , how are you today ? " he called in his loud , husky voice that sounded as if his throat was clogged with phlegm . " I 'm fine , Uncle George . " " That 's good , that 's good . " " How are you , Uncle George ? " " I 'm fine , William . " He chuckled . " Jes ' soon as I get a little food I 'm gon na feel better . " " Then he looked about for Charles . " Charles , how are you today ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Uncle George ? " " I 'm fine , Charles , I 'm fine . Jes ' a mite hungry . " Mrs. Cooper could n't afford to feed him expensive foods . She cooked great quantities of rice and beef lungs . For dessert she made a deep sweet potato cobbler . The rice was gummy , the pie doughy and the lungs gristly . But it was all the same to Mr. Cooper . His wife served him on a turkey platter . He took a quart of rice and covered it with a half-gallon of lungs and juice , and then looked about the table , smiling at everyone , and from then on ate with silent concentration . The talk went on around him . Each evening Charles reported dutifully to William how much their Uncle George had eaten , and they 'd laugh uproariously in their small back room . Mrs. Cooper resented their laughing , and the close way they stuck together , excluding Freddie . She was always calling them to come downstairs . At every opportunity she set Charles to doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " " No , ma 'm . " " An ' you 're big enough to help with some of this housework . " " Yes , ma 'm . " She could n't bear Charles . She felt that he was always laughing at her ! During the days William was away with his mother , visitingp174the various doctors , Charles bore the brunt of his Aunt Bee 's animosity . " And do n't you try to get Freddie to help you , either . He 's just a little boy . " " Yes ma 'm . He 's a year younger than I am . " When Charles entered the neighborhood high school in January , the face of the outside world turned white . He walked down street after street of white residents , the icy blasts from Lake Erie biting into his bones , and was lost in a stream of white faces , rushing up the old stone steps . All of the faculty and all but seven of the pupils were white . He felt strange and out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world he 'd scarcely ever thought of ; and he reacted from emotions he 'd never known he had . He felt an unconscious drawing back , a tightening up . There , among the white pupils , the seven colored pupils noticed him immediately . Only one of them , a lovely girl with olive skin and long black curls , was in his class . But all of them had white friends and ran with white groups instead of with each other . They seemed antagonistic toward him , as if in some fashion he was intruding . Several times , as he passed one or the other in the corridors , he opened his mouth to speak . It was the custom of his upbringing to speak to other Negroes ; it was taken for granted that all Negroes were neighbors . But they would look off as if they did n't see him , as if they were ashamed to be caught speaking to him . After that he never spoke to anyone unless spoken to first . Unlike the other schools he 'd attended , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who applied themselves more diligently . He could n't coast along and count on being the smartest in the class . There was a freckled , redheaded girl , Martha , who took great pleasure in correcting his mistakes . He did his best to outdo her . But she 'd just laugh at him and wait until he faltered . " That 's wrong , Miss Battles . Charles is wrong . " It infuriated him . He hated her . " What 's wrong ? " he 'd challenge , glaring at her . And laughingly she 'd tell him . He wanted to slap her.  |p175When  the pupils were paired off in the chemistry laboratory she chose him as her teammate . He was so surprised and outraged he refused to work with her . After class she cried . He did n't know it . But he noticed she was different . She ignored him after that . He was hurt by her lack of interest . It worried him . He felt he 'd done something wrong . But he did n't know exactly what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the barriers he was strangely outraged and disturbed . He wanted to reject them before they rejected him . But there was a shy , submergedpart of him that wanted them as friends . And when they refused to recognize his rejection , and did n't make friends with him either , he was at a loss , he did n't know how to act . He went into a shell . There were too many of them and only one of him . He was glad when Sunday came and he could go to church . Their father attended the Baptist church far downtown on ScovillAvenue . On Sundays the church folks had this street , but on weekdays it was inhabited mostly by prostitutes and thieves . It was very cold in Cleveland that winter . Snow was banked high along the curbs where the plows had been along . Soot rained down from the huge steel mills in the nearby Cuyahoga River valley , turning everything black , the houses and the windows and the curtains and the snow . Most of the congregation were southern migrants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , crowded in the grim slum street fenced by the high banks of black snow , dressed in their dark Sunday best . They seemed so incongruous , so out of place , so lost , the pearl-gray hats and white cotton gloves spotted by the lumps of soot that floated in the air , crowding about the entrance of the black stone church that had been handed down by white people when they 'd moved farther east . Charles always thought of the hot , rocking church of Mississippi , when he saw them standing there . Yet during the service they were warmed by the preacher 's fiery words ; their black faces became greasy with sweat , their white teeth gleamed and their eyes flashed with animation . The old , tired , lined faces lit up and glowed with ecstasy . Mrs. Taylor attended the Presbyterian church , and sometimesp176she visited the Episcopalian church where all the fair-skinned Negroes went . That was another thing her husband 's people hated . Both of Professor Taylor 's sisters were short and dark and pressed their hair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , from lack of choice , take pride in being virtuous . But Mrs. Cooper yearned to be a fashionable lady . They knew that Mrs. Taylor could pass for white , and very often did . They bitterly resented her white complexion and were envious of her long , straight hair . Had she been a weaker woman and acknowledged the humiliation of her position they would have liked her better . But she treated them as inferiors even though they had the upper hand . There was no getting along between them . After a time she began taking her meals where she roomed and seldom visited either of her sisters-in-law . Most of her time was spent in taking William to the doctors and looking for a house . The doctors offered little hope of William ever seeing . The corneas of both eyes had sustainedpermanent scar tissue that could never be removed . They advised her to wait and see what nature did . So William read his books in braille and spent hours writing exercises . All of his father 's relatives liked him far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Glenville district , and for quite some time had been the only colored family in that section . William went frequently to visit them . His Uncle Casper had been so long in the postal service he was thinking of retiring . Phillip William , their oldest boy , had been away from home for many years . Now Casper Junior had graduated from college and was teaching in a southern school . Only the daughter , Lucinda , was at home . After graduation she 'd taught for several years , but had suffered a nervous breakdown . Mrs. Taylor said it had been brought on by her father 's philandering . She hated her father , and had n't spoken to him for years . But she and William were great pals . Charles seldom went to visit them . They felt that he was more on the Mannings ' side than theirs . Lucinda never spoke to him . Charles thought that all of them were crazy . Professor Taylor took his sister 's part . The children were drawnp177into the feud against their wishes . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it difficult to treat them civilly . Their Aunt Bee picked on him , venting on him her hatred for his mother . William always took his younger brother 's part . The Coopers owned an old enormous car , but they had never driven it . They had bought it and brought it home and it had sat there , in the back yard , rusting and rotting ever since . It was the third secondhand car they 'd owned . They felt it necessary to their prestige to own a car . They 'd never driven any of them . No one in the family could drive . The driveway was extraordinarily narrow , and where the porch extended , angled sharply . Charles wondered how they 'd gotten the big car where it was without having taken down the porch . At times when his mother and aunt were fighting and making the house unbearable , he and William went out and sat on its cold , moldy seat . Early that summer the Coopers sold this car for junk and bought a secondhand Willys-Knight . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would share the joke . " Just for that you do n't get any supper , " Mrs. Cooper flared . He gave her a startled look . " I did n't  --  Well , all right . I 'll get something at the corner . " " " Wait a minute , " William said , rising from the table . " I 'll go with you . " " Now , William , you do n't have to go , " their Uncle George put in . " Bee , let the boys eat their dinner . " " If your father was here I 'd make him punish you , " she said to Charles . " For what ? " " Let 's go , " William said . " I do n't want any dinner . " " You 're just like your mother , " Mrs. Cooper continued to rail at Charles . " Taking your blind brother away from his food . " " Now what brought that on ? " William muttered . The boys had sandwiches and sodas and went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh about it . " Uncle George is just a fool , " William said . " The way he lets Aunt Bee drive him . It was she who wanted the car . "  | " I do n't see how they can buy all that junk . All those funny dresses she wears , and all those feathers in her hats . She mustthink God 's going to call her someday and she 's got ta be ready to fly . " William laughed . " Uncle George is all right . He 's just dumb . " William , how are you today ? " he mocked . " ' I 'm fine , Uncle George : " " Dass good . Dass good .  --  They laughed . One day while rummaging through the bureau drawers , Williamhad found one of those gilt-lettered axioms that people hung on walls . By holding it close to his good eye he 'd been able to read : A FOOL AND HIS MONEY ARE SOON PARTED . When they were preparing for bed that night he got it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mantle . " " Better not let Aunt Bee see it , " Charles cautioned . " I want her to see it . It 'll do her good . " The next morning their mother called early for William . Charles was spreading the bed when his aunt came into the room . She saw the slogan on the mantel . Her face went ashy . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , " she cried in the high , whining tone her voice took in the height of passion . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! Calling me a fool ! The way I 've put up with you and fed you and given you a place to live . " Charles looked at her blankly as if he did n't understand . " What are you talking about ? " She stabbed her finger at the mantel . " That dirty , sneaking little thing you stuck up there . " Rage had made her quite ugly . " Oh , that 's just something we found and thought  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brother , " she screamed . He became coldly defiant . " I put it there . I found it in the bureau drawer and put it there . It belongs to you . I did n't write it ; I just found it . If you had n't wanted it you  --  " " Do n't you dast give me none of your sass , " she shouted . " I 'll slap your face . " " What am I supposed to do , just stand here and let you say  --  " " If you were my son I 'd beat you within an inch of your life . Taking that sneaky way of insulting me . After all I 've done forp179you . You 're just like your mother . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " Watching the contortions of her face , he thought she resembled a black witch singing incantations . He suppressed an impulse to laugh . " I 'll take it down , if that 'll make you any happier , " he said sarcastically . " You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she raged . " The idea . I 've put up with enough from you . I do n't want to ever see you again . " " Yes , ma 'm , " he said . Slowly he bundled his clothes and carried them up the street to the house where his parents lived . It required two trips . She watched him like a hawk as if afraid he might steal something . He would n't let himself think about it . He moved woodenly , his face blank . It was bad enough without thinking about it . Now there 'd be an awful fuss . His father came home at noon . Charles told him that Mrs. Cooper had put him out of her house . A deep frown bit into his father 's old , lined face . " Now what have you done , son ? " " It was n't nothing  --  not much . I found an old saying on a piece of cardboard  --  it was in the drawer  --  and I just put it on the mantel . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said , A fool and his money are soon parted ' . " Professor Taylor looked suddenly exhausted , as if he could n't bear any more . For a moment , he floundered about , gesturing aimlessly . Then he put on his hat and went down to see his sister . He was still there when Mrs. Taylor and William returned to the rooming house . Charles told her what had happened . " Why , I put that there myself , " William said . " Chuck did n't have anything to do with it " " It does n't make any difference , " their mother said . " The idea , a grown woman taking insult from a little thing like that . " She went down the street and called to Mrs. Cooper from the sidewalk , " I want to talk to you , Mrs. Cooper , but I wo n't step foot in your filthy house . "  |p180Faces  appeared in the curtains all down the street . Mrs. Cooper charged onto the porch , brandishing a broom . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll fix you ! " Professor Taylor came running out behind and struggled to restrain her . They wrestled down the steps and to the sidewalk . His sister fought in a blinding rage to get at his wife . A neighbor called the police . Mrs. Taylor retreated across the street and continued to berate them both . " The idea , a grown woman behaving like a maniac . And you 're no better than she is , Mr. Taylor , I 'll tell you that . Letting her persecute your own children . " The police squad car came while they were struggling . Mrs. Taylor turned and walked away and left them to explain . Later she returned and demanded that Mrs. Cooper bring William 's belongingsdown to the street . " I 'll get even with you  --  you dirty , half-white bitch ! " Mrs. Cooper screamed . Another row was in the making . Professor Taylor quickly intervenedand packed William 's things himself . Mrs. Taylor waited on the sidewalk . He followed her like a whipped dog , his arms bulging with clothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man trailing behind the grim , determined woman . It was more than just the humiliation . He felt hurt and betrayed by his sister 's vengeful act . He could find no excuses for her . That evening both of his sisters called on them and tried to draw his wife into another fuss . But Mrs. Taylor would n't see them . She locked herself in her room . They stood out in the hallwayand called through the closed door . " You may as well come on out and talk , sister , " Mrs. Hart said , assuming the role of peacemaker . " Let 's get this settled once an ' for all , " Mrs. Cooper whined . " You ai n't paid me yet for those boys ' board . " Mrs. Taylor refused to answer . Now her husband had to take her part . She felt triumphant and vindicated . The boys were given temporary lodging with their parents . Through the walls they could hear their parents ' bitter bickering.  | " I should have known better than to let my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's as much your fault as hers , " Professor Taylor charged . " You 've always been hostile toward my sisters . The boys would n't be so disrespectful if you had n't encouraged them . " " Disrespectful indeed ! How could anyone respect that woman ? " " Maybe she was wrong this time  --  but you ca n't excuse Charles either ? " " Charles has always been very courteous to her  --  more courteousthan she deserved , " his mother defended . But inside she was deeply concerned for him . She knew he 'd been lonely and unhappy since William 's accident . He needed other companions , but it was so hard for him to make friends . She had hoped he would take up with the white children in his high school , but for some reason he did n't seem to like them . It was a bitter disappointment . She had been so pleased when he 'd been assigned to a white school . Perhaps next term he would feel more at home . But that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem was what to do now . Before going to sleep she decided to separate her sons . School would be opening soon , and until they had a home of their own again she would board them out . It would be hard on both of them for a time . But they were old enough now to be apart . Charles had celebrated his sixteenth birthday the past month . It was time he was on his own . In the end it would be the best thing for both of them . Charles would never learn how to live with other people as long as William was about . He felt too protective toward his brother . Of the two , William was far the better off in this respect , she had long since realized . Perhaps his being blind had something to do with it . He could mix with people and make friends , whereas Charles was always self-conscious and aloof . Through her minister she found a home for Charles on Cedar Avenue . Mrs. Robinson was a colored woman married to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was going to college . She thought Gregory would have a wonderful influence on Charles . William was placed with the Douglas family by the Founda/tion for the Blind . The Douglas 's lived on a quiet residential street and had a son William 's age . Both parents went with Williamwhen he moved . Charles carried his brother 's valise . It gave him a funny sensation to see William in a strange separate room . He had an empty feeling at the pit of his stomach as when he was suddenly frightened . It was something like he felt when Will and his mother boarded the train that took them to St. Louis . Only this time there was no reason to be afraid . He could n't understand it . " So long , Chuck , " William said cheerfully . " Do n't take any wooden nickels . " " Not if I can s  --  help it . " He still could n't say see around his brother . " Be a good boy and do n't give Mrs. Douglas any trouble , " he heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forgotten dream , the hurt of the dream coming back in strange cadence . He ran down the steps and out of the house and walked down the street bordered by trees . Overhead the dusty leaves of summer 's end whispered in the slight hot breeze . A housewife sweeping her front porch stopped to watch him pass . A dog ran out from anotherhouse and barked at him . He felt himself crying quietly inside . CEDAR AVENUE WAS THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE OF the East Side colored section . Streetcar tracks ran down the brick pavement toward the Public Square and Negro businesses fronted on the broken sidewalks . All day long people passed up and down , shouting and laughing , and the noisy streetcars rumbled by , rattling the window panes in the weather-beaten houses . Mrs. Robinson lived in a pleasant frame house in a residential block . Her husband had been a dining car waiter . Through himp183she 'd met Mr. Sutton , the white steward of his car . For years beforeher husband 's death she 'd carried on a love affair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported her . Three nights each week his run put him in Cleveland , and he lived openly in her house . Everyone assumed that he was her husband and he was known as Mr. Robinson . Mrs. Taylor was secretly impressed by Mrs. Robinson 's white husband . She wanted Mrs. Robinson to realize that she was almost white , herself . The day she took Charles there to live she stopped on her way out and told Mrs. Robinson all about the white members of the Manning family  --  the grandfather who was a senator and the one who was the son of a president and the grandmother who was the daughter of an English nobleman . Mrs. Robinson was a big-boned handsome woman in her early forties . She had a light tan complexion with a scattering of freckles , and wore her hair in a boyish bob with a bang across her forehead . As with many Negroes of her complexion , she was awed by the tiny lady with her superior manners and famous white forebears , and she became very attentive to Mrs. Taylor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , she said in her soft , caressing voice , " Just make yourself at home , honey . Ask for anything you want . Greg will be home soon and you two can get acquainted . " Her warm nature and heavily scented femininity affected Charles like a subtle aphrodisiac . He felt a sickness in his stomach and the warmth grow in his groins as he forced a shamefaced smile . He could n't stay in her presence without having an erection . It shamed him and he was afraid she might discover it . " I 'm going to take a walk . I 'll be back in time for dinner , " he mumbled , going out . Mr. Sutton was home for dinner that night . Gregory referred to him as his stepfather and called him " Dad . " Although he knew that Mr. Sutton had a family in Chicago , he never admitted it . He was inordinately proud of having a white stepfather . Mr. Suttontreated him as a son ; they had a wonderful relationship . The fine-looking , elderly white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in excellent taste . At first the clerks were shocked to hear the boy address the man as Dad . But they soon got used to it . With young men his own age , Greg was insufferable . He was a husky young man with an enormous head which he considered leonine , and he wore his kinky red hair in a sort of lion 's mane . Although his complexion was tan , he had the thick , flat features of his father , a squat , black man who 'd been fifty when Greg was born . Greg had a strange look of age . His huge , heavy features sagged like those of a man of forty who had dissipated greatly in his youth . Secretly he was proud of his appearance . He thought he looked blase and sophisticated . When he discovered his mother had taken a boarder , he was instantly resentful . " Why do you have to go and take a stranger in the house ? " he said angrily at dinner . " Son , I 'm surprised at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles . " " Oh , that 's all right , " Charles muttered , so choked he could scarcely speak . But Mrs. Robinson made her son apologize . Afterwards everyone was uncomfortable . For the first few days Charles was tight and lonely and missed his brother more than ever . Mr. Sutton was very kind to the lad . But Greg treated him with studied condescension . Greg was taking courses in Cleveland College and working lunches as a bus boy at the Union Club . He played the piano and had a fair talent for pencil sketching . They had a very cozy parlor and his friends were always calling . Girls found him interesting , although his charm was lessened by his affectations . He seemed to delight in making Charles miserable . Mrs. Robinson noticed the lad 's painful self-consciousness and tried to put him at ease . What he needed was a girl , she thought . " Chuck , why do n't you bring your girl here to the house , " she suggested one day at dinner . " You can entertain her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind . Does she play the piano ? " " I do n't have a girl , " he stammered , blushing painfully.  | " Do n't have a girl ? With eyes like those . Shame on you ! You should n't be so mean to all the little girls . " " He 's just a kid , Mother , " Greg said irritably . He was intensely jealous of his mother . Whenever she showed Charles the least affection he squirmed with anxiety . " He 's not even dry behind the ears . He does n't even know what it 's all about . " " Now tell the truth , honey , " Mrs. Robinson persisted . " Do n't be so shamefaced . Have n't you ever had a girl ? " Charles writhed in an agony of shame . " No , I  --  I just never thought about it . " " Never thought about it ! What 's happening to these little girls in Cleveland . When I was your age I would have thought about it for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ! " he shouted . " Ca n't you see he 's scared of girls ? " " We 'll have to do something about that , " she said tenderly , ignoring her son 's outburst . " You need a girl . Imagine a lovely boy your age who 's never had a girl . " She turned to her son . " Darling , ca n't you find Chuck a nice little girl to go with ? " " I do n't know any girls who 'd even look at him , " Greg said hurtingly . " I do n't want a girl , " Charles cried . He wished they 'd let him alone . " Sure you want a girl , " Mrs. Robinson declared . " Maybe you do n't know it but you do . " She turned to her son again . " Susie Dean would be just the girl for him . " " Susie Dean ! " he sneered . " Why do n't you just give him two dollars and let him get his ashes hauled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she chided , unperturbed . " You introduce him to some of your girls then . I 'm sure they wo n't agree with you . " Despite his mother 's insistence , Greg refused to introduce Charles to any of the girls who called . But after school began he introduced him to some of the young men who dropped around . For the first time in his life Charles had the opportunity to enjoy normal friendships . But he thought the fellows so poised andp186sophisticated , he became shy and inarticulate . Whenever forced to speak , he blurted out the first thing that came to mind . The fellows thought him quite witty . " Chuck 's a sly boy , " Curly Wright observed . " Tell us about your girls back in St. Louis , Chuck . " " Aw , I did n't have any girls , " he replied , trying to keep from blushing . " I just played the field . " Greg gave him a contemptuous look . " Played the field all right , " he said sarcastically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hell , you do n't have to have a girl to get that , " Charles protestedweakly . It was a signal for the boys to brag of their sexual prowess . There was one tall , handsome lad less extravagant than the others . They called him " The Great Profile " and accused him of holding out on them . But Harvard smiled deprecatingly and said , " It 's not that . I just do n't find them easy as you guys . " " They 're tryna marry you , son , " Roy Williams pointed out . Charles admired Harvard Eaton tremendously . He thought him the best looking and most gracious of the bunch . Harvard was always saying something nice to him . Although most of the young men were high school seniors as himself , he felt so much younger and immature . They attended high schools in the colored neighborhoods and had enjoyed greater social activity . And Greg always kept referring to his youth . " Shhh , the tadpole 's listening , " he said once when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have big ears . You 'll be wondering how it got around . " " I wo n't tell , " Charles promised stoutly . The others took up for him . " Lay off Chuck , Greg . What 's he done to you . You scared Marie might fall for him . " " Pshaw , Marie rob the cradle , " he said contemptuously . " She has n't stooped to that yet , eh ? " Bert said slyly . The others laughed . Marie King was the old date-horse . She was older than most of these young men . Although Greg thought she liked him best , she 'd dated all of them at various times.  |p187Many  evenings the boys and girls got together in the Robinson'sparlor . Greg played the catchy tunes popular with their set . The couples whirled gaily about the floor , their feet flying through the intricate patterns of the Charleston . Charleston . . . Charleston . . They chanted and panted , their eyes flashing , bodies bouncing .. Charleston . . . Charleston .. . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be blase , the young women bold and forward . Monkeybackcoats and bell-bottom trousers had gone into oblivion ; sloppy coats and baggy pants were all the rage . And the girls wore skirts above their knees and stockings rolled below ; they clipped their hair in page-boy bobs and wore bangs down to their eyes . A great motion picture lover of the time , possessed of slumbrouseyes and sleek black hair , had set the pattern for manly beauty in a melodrama of love and passion called The Shiek . The young men slicked their hair with greasy pomades and wore tightly knotted skull caps day and night to keep it pressed in place . About the ears and the base of the skull where the hair was left exposed it remained kinky and thick with grease , but the top glistened with gleaming waves . This was called the " pomp , " short for pompadour , because of its similarity to the coiffure worn by the Marquise de Pompadour . And when their pomps were mussed , they became unreasonably furious and quite often fought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , and preened themselves for hours before the mirrors , practising sultry looks from lowered lids . They walked about with burning eyes , seeming halfasleep , and approached their girls with slow , sinuous steps , as if to steal upon them.  |p188Occasionally  the boys brought a flask of bathtub gin to animate the party . From his room above , Charles could hear them laughingand screaming in frenzied glee . Unless the fellows asked for him , Greg never called him down when girls were present . And then all through the evening he made disparaging remarks . " Little Charley ca n't dance ; he 's got two left feet , " he jeered as Charles sat mute and sweating between two willing girls . They looked at him askance . " Come on , baby , let mother shoal you how , " Susie cooed . Mutely he stood and put his arm about her waist and tried to follow through the intricate steps . But he was wooden with selfconsciousness ; his legs like rusty rigid joints . Susie stopped . " Relax , baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  let 's try it later on , " he stammered , flaming painfully . " Oh  --  " But she was relieved to let him go , and found an older man . He tried to get the girls alone . Away from the others he could talk to one girl at a time . He sang a rapid monologue to keep his courage up , and the girls thought he had a sly , sweet line . " Your eyes are like rare wine , " he told Marie as they sat swingingon the porch . " Your lips burn like eternal fire ; I 'd like to quench them with my kisses . Your throat is a pillar of gold , brushed by the lips of men who worship at your feet . Your breasts are softly distant mountain peaks at dusk ; between them flows the dark disturbing river down to the mysterious sea . " She was entranced . " You 're sweet , " she said , her arm stealing about his neck as she leaned forward in the dark and kissed him wetly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran inside . That was as far as he ever got . With one girl in the dark he was exciting as long as he could think up words and fire them breathlessly , no matter what they meant . Quite often he was shocking . " I could kiss you like the sea lapping at a virgin cave , " he said to Susie Dean once , finding her alone in the kitchen . " You could ? " she whispered throatily . She had no idea what he meant ; it was her own interpretation that set her panting.  | " I 'll make you tremble in delirium and cry sweet ecstatic sounds . " He was blushing furiously , his voice breathless from the effort of trying to make a hit . " You lover , " she panted . " Feel here . " He felt her breasts . " Oh shit ! " she cried . " Let 's go down and put some coal on the fire . " " But there is n't any fire in the furnace , " he said uncomprehendingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teaser . " There was always this point beyond which he could n't go . He did n't recognize the moment when it came and did n't know the words to get him over . So many times only a gentle push was needed . But he did n't dream this thing was ever quite that easy . He always got bogged down in a ritual he thought surely was demanded . In his dreams , virtue sat so high on pristine pedestals ; gallant swordsmen dueled to the death to kiss a woman 's hand . He envied the poised attitudes and glib flattery of the older fellows . He never knew his breathless , incoherent rhapsody brought him closer to actual conquest than most of them had ever got . Greg made him think the girls just tolerated him . He did n't dare ask one to be his girl , or even for a date to see a picture show . He only saw them at some impromptu party or gathering where the fellows took him . And then his time was occupied by the younger sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bashful . But once alone with him they changed their minds . He was after the real thing , they thought . He did n't like to play , but Oh Boy , he was really frantic for it . Often Charles went down to the tennis courts at the neighborhoodYMCA hoping to meet a girl . But the players were always paired , the games dated in advance . He wound up on the other field playing rough and tumble football with a gang of ruffians commanded by a young hoodlum called Wop who smoked marijuanaand played a remarkable game at quarterback . Charles always played opposite him . They made a great attraction and crowds gathered along the fence . But Wop was too much evenp190for Charles . He tried to get Charles to smoke marijuana and drink whiskey and once suggested that they cut school and steal a car . " When we get through riding we can sell it , " Wop said . " I know a fence that 'll give us fifty bucks for anything we bring in . All they do is strip it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gon na be caught ? You gon na be with Wop . " Charles shook his head . " If you skeered , go home , " Wop sneered . He was no older than Charles but was already notorious throughout the city . " If you skeered , go home . " He had everybody saying it , even good little boys and girls who 'd only heard of him . Charles did n't envy Wop . He wanted to cut a figure among a different group . If he could just dance like the boy who was winning all the Charleston contests . On the top floor of the Y was a basketball court that doubled for dances on weekends . Charles went to several of the dances but it was no fun drinking lemonade and eating cake alone . Everywhere he turned was the gimlet eye of some chaperone . He could n't even smoke and pretend to be indifferent . He sat in the window and watched the couples cavort about the floor . Charleston . . . Charleston .. . Envy cut him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came by such natural sense of rhythm . He did n't have it , could n't learn it , although he was blessed with remarkable coordination . He left the Y and walked out Cedar Avenue past houses with drawn shades and loud laughter from within , where he was certain women could be bought . He stopped at one and went up to the door . " Er , does Miss er-er Robinson live here ? " he asked the redeyedblack man who cracked the door in response to his timid knocking , giving the first name that come to mind . " Who ? Who dat ? " The voice was thick with rotgut and suspicion.  | " Er , Miss Robinson . She 's a nice-looking , light lady with a gold tooth . " " Ah 'll see . " The red eyes disappeared and the door closed in his face . From behind it he could hear the whiskey-thickened voice . " Mama D ! Yay , Mama D ! You got an ' who ' ' round heah call Roberson ? " " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whining bedroom voice . The door cracked and the heavily made-up face of a light tan woman popped suddenly in the opening . Glazed muddy eyes looked Charles up and down . " Who you wan na see , baby ? " " Er-er , a Miss Robinson . " " Ah 's Miz Roberson , baby . Cum on in . " " Oh ! " His nerve deserted him . He did n't want this painted , staring mass of sinister , effluvious flesh . " Another Miss Robinson . " " Git de hell ' way frum heah you li'l bastard ! " the voice said harshly ; the door slammed in his face . Frightened and chagrined , he fled down the street and crept to bed . But he could n't sleep for thinking about girls . He did n't know why he was so unpopular . It disturbed him . He felt that he was growing unattractive . And he wanted so desperately to fit himself into this fascinating life . He wanted girls to admire him and desire his company . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used to make his pomp so much more attractive than the others . Harvard said he used a combination of cosmetic and vaseline . Charles bought a stick of black cosmetic and applied it to his hair . The result was a fine patent leather shine . That Sunday afternoon he went visiting with the fellows . It was a warm fall day , very pleasant . It affected him with a poignant melancholy he did n't understand . The small cosy parlor was crowded . Tea was served and young men moped about with narrowed eyes like a strange assortment of sinister sheiks . Their heads glistened like lacquered gourds . The girls sat with their skirts above their knees and their legs tightly pressed together . Their bangs were like pretty painted fans above their flashing eyes and animated faces . " Where have you been all my life ? " the male talk ran.  | " What 'll I do when you are far from me and I am blue ? " the girls countered coyly . Conversation was marked by self-conscious pauses . Sudden silences caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their embarrassment . The young men bantered with each other when they could think of nothing else to say . The girls gossiped among themselves . For the moment the gathering was divided into two camps , male on one side , female on the other , each seemingly striving to ignore the other . Then with a concerted shifting about they rushed together again . " Remember the night , the night you said I love you ,  --  the young man said to his new companion . " Remember you promised that you 'd forget me not , then you forgot to remember , " she replied . Their conversation was made up from quotations from the lyrics of popular songs ; without these they could n't converse . Cleo sat at the piano . Together they sang : Though my dreams are in vain My love will remainStrolling again , Memory Lane , With you . From that they went to the rhythmic chant : C'llegiate . . . c'llegiateYes ! We are collegiate . .. The mood passed quickly from frenzied jazz to syrupy sentiment . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice had set the nation crying in its cups . It went with bathtub gin and adolescence . Through the smoke and flame I got ta go where you are .. . Charles kept choked up , on the brim of tears . He did n't know  |p193what  was wrong with him . The exigencies of social life filled him with apprehensions . It was a lovely party . But the room grew hot and sticky . The cosmetic with which he 'd plastered down his hair melted and began to run . Black streaks coursed down his neck and left black blobs on his fresh white collar . " Turn around , " Harvard said . " What 's that on your neck . " " On my neck ? " He dabbed at it with a white handkerchief . It came off black . " Little Charley 's hair is running , " Greg said heartlessly . The girls giggled . Charles felt the flame burning in his face . He could have gone through the floor . " What 'd you use , shoe polish ? " Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleaned off some of the mess . " I do n't know what happened , " Charles said . " I mixed the cosmetic with vaseline just like you said . " " Oh ! " A light dawned . " You used black cosmetic . That is n't the kind . I use white cosmetic . It does n't run . " Charles could n't meet the others ' eyes when he came downstairs . " Do n't let it get you down , baby , " Thelma consoled . " These other sheiks have accidents with their pomps too . " But the pleasure and excitement had been destroyed for him . At such times he felt peculiarly cursed with misfortune . A twist of circumstance and suddenly he became the ugly duckling . More than all others he yearned to cut a dashing figure . But when the occasion called for pretty speeches he was inarticulate . While others danced he stood apart on two left feet . His bow ties came askew , his hair grease ran ; he could n't understand just why he exasperated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something within himself.  |p194THAT  FALL , ONCE AGAIN , CHARLES OCCUPIED HISmother 's thoughts . She reflected how strange it was that he took precedence in her emotions over her other sons . It was as if the umbilical cord still held them joined together . Even at the height of William 's need , and during that poignant time when all her soul had gone to holding Tom , it had never been really severed . And now again it throbbed with blood and worry as she ponderedon the problems of his adolescence . He was so impressionable , so easily hurt , she knew . And he found it so hard to adjust to any change . She knew that he was n't getting along too well in school , that he had n't made any friends among the pupils . She wondered if their being white exercised some vague restraint , but she could never bring herself to ask . She visited him often and was pleased to note that he showed interest in the colored youths . She 'd been so afraid he 'd grow moody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things he did , but Mrs. Robinson kept her informed . From the beginning , Mrs. Robinson had been exceedingly impressed by Mrs. Taylor 's white blood . It was as if , by having such illustrious white forebears , Mrs. Taylor had accomplished so much more than herself . Mrs. Taylor realized this and acted quite superior . Mrs. Robinson was n't resentful in the least ; she would have been disappointed had Mrs. Taylor acted otherwise . She was obsequious in Mrs. Taylor 's presence and very attentive toward her son . Mrs. Taylor was appreciative and quite relieved that Charles had gotten away from the influenceof the Coopers . But yet she knew he needed most of all a home . For a time she tried to get him to take piano lessons . Failing in this , she bought tickets to the symphony concerts and made him accompany her . With all her heart she wanted him to becomep195cultured and learn to love the fine things in life . But he did n't like the concerts . The next time she bought tickets he would n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I just do n't like them . " " You do n't have to like them , " she said . " It 's like eating olives  --  you must cultivate a taste for them . " His dislike for the refined and aesthetic offerings of city life was a source of constant disappointment . She attributed it to his father 's blood . It was curious , she thought , how , of the two , William , with his handicap , was so much better able to adjust to circumstances and so much more receptive to good influences . He seemed to be getting along splendidly and scarcely ever gave her cause for worry . The young man , Ramsey Douglas , with whom he lived , had become his most devoted friend . Although no academic schools were provided for the blind , the state paid for readers , thus enabling blind children to enroll in the public schools . Ramsey spent hours reading to William from all his textbooks in preparation for his entering school . Practically overnight he 'd grown into a charming young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was poised in social contacts and talked with ease . No furtive compulsions harassed him in his associations with young women . He was gay and witty and quite frankly liked them all . They found him a wonderful companion , and he 'd learned to dance excellently in the short time he 'd been away from home . There was always a girl eager to go with him to dancing parties . The brothers ran in different circles and seldom met . But wheneverWilliam mentioned some happy occasion he 'd experienced , Charles felt compelled to boast of his own great successes . Secretly he was awed by his brother 's adjustment to the grown-up world . It was so hard for him to fit with ease at any level . It seemed as if there just was no place for him , like the day he went out for football practice . He 'd donned a castoff uniform with the others in the locker room . Along with the more intrepid ones , he 'd run the three milesp196to the field where drills were held , only to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigaret to prove he did n't care and the coach put him off the field . He did n't go to any of the games . There was a great deal of extracurricular activity among his classmates that fall . They had undergone a subtle change . They were seniors now , and dignity had been added . Class officers were elected , committees appointed ; plans were being drawn for the senior prom . Fierce competition had developed among the honor students . Charles kept aloof , he took no part in anything . He 'd never caught the spirit of the school . His teachers were nice but uninterested . He could have been an A student with but a little effort , but he was n't particular . His teachers gave him B in everything but Latin . He 'd never cared for Latin  --  only for the stories translated into English  --  and had just managed to pass in Caesar the year before . Now in Cicero he was failing . Several times his teacher kept him after school . " I 'd hate to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you will just make a little effort . I know you do n't like Latin and I hope that some day the school system will make it an elective course . But now it is required . And you must pass to graduate . " " I 'll give it more time , Miss Parker , " he promised . " I 'll concentrate on it . " He did n't , but she became lenient because she thought he tried . Again the sense of futility took hold of him . Nothing seemed worthwhile . He wanted so desperately to be important , to stand out ; if not that , at least to belong to something . It was mainly because of that , because he had to be different , to be seen , that he accepted his Aunt Bee 's offer to drive their car , although he knew his mother would n't like it . His aunt had asked him to drive for them in a funeral procession . She 'd gotten his father 's consent . And she seemed trying to atone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her any better . But he loved to drive . Sitting behind the wheel of the big old secondhand car , following the somber procession through the gray afternoon , the black-clad Coopers sitting silently in the back seat , under his control , dependent on him , he felt big and impor/tant again . His aunt was so pleased she invited him to dinner and asked him all sorts of questions about his mother . It was pleasant to be the center of attention . He drove them often after that , without his mother 's knowledge . One day he took the car for servicing and stopped in front of the Robinsons ' to rush importantly through the house . Greg appeared not to notice but Mrs. Robinson was curious . " Is that your folks ' car , Chuck ? " " No , it 's my aunt 's . But I can drive it whenever I want , " he added proudly . " Greg , did you see Chuck 's car ? " " It 's just a struggle-buggy , mother , " he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how about sitting for me now . " He was doing a sketch of Charles sitting at the piano . It was quite unflattering and Charles knew he made it so deliberately . " I have n't time now , " he called , dashing out . He drove off fast , passing other cars along the way , and waved to a girl he saw across the street . For an instant she could n't place him , then waved excitedly after he had passed . He was laughing exultantly when , looking ahead , he saw a boy on a bicyclecut across his path . The boy licked an ice cream cone and looked off in the opposite direction . Charles stabbed for the brake . His foot slipped off the narrow strip of shiny metal . He stabbed again , experiencing the sinking sensation of slipping on a banana peeling . In front the boy and bicycle seemed suspended in mid-motion , the picture rushing forward in growing horror . He wrenched the steering wheel to his right , hoping to pass behind the boy . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . With the quick reflexes of a healthy youth , he gave a mighty wrench to his left . The car struck the front wheel of the bicycle , unseating the boy who 'd never stopped licking his ice cream cone , never looked , now sprawled spread-eagle on the pavement , the car rushing on as if by some evil momentum , Charles 's glance striking on ahead ; and then into his vision came the sight of jam-packed men and women , waiting for an approaching streetcar , directly in front of him . Somewhere the horror stopped and never came alive.  |p198The  car struck them frontally , knocking them down in a mass of kicking legs and flailing arms , crashed broadside into the connecting wall between the corner drugstore and adjoining meat market , shattering the plate glass windows of both , caromed back across the sidewalk . Down the hood Charles saw a short squat man , who 'd been hit before , struggling to his knees as the car struck him again , passed over him , crashed into another car parked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this single grotesquerie became implanted in his mind , and laughter ripped from him . He could n't stop it . Funniest thing he ever saw . He did n't hear the screaming . The door of the car was flung abruptly open . A butcher jerked him to the street , brandishing a bloody cleaver . He looked up into the hard white face , saw the brutal mouth , merciless gray eyes , and felt his consciousness leaving . He tried to hang on to himself , vaguely aware of a violent scuffle taking place as if he had no part in it . When the picture came again he was closed in by a group of colored men . Now he heard the sobbing of the wounded , strident voices raised in anger , the distant crying of the sirens . As far as he could see in all directions was a mass of jabbering people . The police cars came , pushing through the mob , lining up beside the accident end to end , seven in a row . Charles was taken by two officers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He sat there with the police driver and watched remotely all that was taking place . There was no order in his mind , the pictures would n't register ; the persons lying sobbing on the pavementhad no relationship to tragedy . Only the eyes were felt , the countless staring eyes , shifting to the victims , to the policemen , back to himself . He looked at his hands . The eyes disappeared . His hands were steady . The two officials came and sat flanking him , and they drove away . " Damnedest thing I ever saw , " one remarked . " Your car hardly got a scratch . Not even a window cracked . " " All four tires went flat , " Charles said . The sound of his ownp199voice startled him . He was astonished by the observation . Both of them glanced curiously at him . He was questioned at great length at the police station and officers were sent to bring down his parents and the Coopers . At first he thought he could n't tell them anything . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity . He was amazed by his ability to recount in detail sidelights of the accidenthe had no recollection of having seen . Over and over he heard himself saying , " The brake pedal was just like grease . Every time I hit it my foot slipped off . The car just would n't stop . " Afterwards he was placed in a waiting room . He felt as if it was all a dream . The actual tragedy had n't gotten him . His mind contained the photographic pictures of the accumulated grotesquerie , but no connection had been made with the resulting pain and awful hurt and terrible consequences . The victims were recalled as adagio dancers executing comic pantomime . Much of it still affected him as funny . The sheer ludicrousness of the poor guy getting knocked down twice . Little sniffs of laughter kept blowing through his nose . There was something monstrous , inhuman , in his mental rejection of the horror . It was as if the dream was known to be a dream , the horror but the artificiality of the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his work clothes and she with rings of dried soap suds about her wrists , their faces gray with terror . They were taken for interrogation before being permitted to speak to him . Then his mother and father arrived . Her bloodless face was etched with apprehension , her body braced rigidly against the surge of panic . His father was a study in alarm . When he told them what had happened , his mother turned against his father with incontrollable fury . " You contemptible sneak . God curse the day you ever became the father of my children . After all that woman has done to him you let her make a lackey out of him . " His father wilted . The Coopers came out gray and shaken . Mrs. Taylor did n't speak to them . Mr. Cooper wandered aboutp200in a daze . Professor and Mrs. Taylor were questioned briefly . Mrs. Taylor demanded that they prosecute her husband for permitting his son , a minor , to drive . The police officials were confused . Then the Harts arrived . The room seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mrs. Cooper lashed at Charles condemningly . " What have you done to us ? " His mother turned on her in a white rage . " Do n't you speak to him . You black evil woman . Do n't you dare speak to him . The way you 've treated him . You 're the one who should be prose-cuted . " " He should have gone where I sent him , " Mrs. Cooper screamed . " If he was n't so hardheaded we would n't be in this trouble . " " Now , Bee . Now , sister , " Mr. Cooper muttered . " We 're all in this together . " " My son is not in it , " Mrs. Taylor raved . " My son is just a victim . " " Now , honey , I 've called a lawyer , " Professor Taylor interjected . " Let 's just wait until he comes . " " We do n't know who 's dead , " Mrs. Cooper wailed . " We do n't know who 's dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clutching Charles 's arm she fled into the corridor . She sensed that as yet the horror had not affected him . She wanted to keep him in that state of mind . She was afraid for him to experience the full impact of the tragedy . Not then , not all at once . She feared a shock ; perhaps his mind would become unbalanced . There was no telling how it might affect him . He was inclined toward morbid introspection anyway . And his capacities for good and evil were so delicately balanced . She feared that this might be the very thing to send him off unless she shielded him from all the terrible consequences . They had no right to do this thing to him , she thought . She wanted to protect him at any cost . Professor Taylor followed them . He realized her purpose and thought that it was wrong . He felt that Charles should realizep201the consequences of his actions , and suffer in whatever way God saw to punish him . No matter who was right and who was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , and he should be the one to face it , he thought . " Honey , you ca n't do this , " he argued . " The boy must know what he 's done . " But she stood between them , shielding Charles with her body as well as with her soul . " Do n't you dare come out here and accuse my son of any wrong , " she cried . " You 're the one to blame . You had no right to let him drive that woman 's car . God is going to punish you as surely as I 'm standing here for the way you 've let your relatives abuse and mistreat your son . " He could n't stand up to her . Finally the attorney arrived and Charles was released in the custody of his parents . The hearing was set for the following day . His mother ordered a taxicab to take them home . They passed the scene of the accident . Charles noticed that the car was gone and the shattered glass removed . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still it did n't register ; his mind would not accept the pain and horror . His mother shielded him from all discussion of the accident . She took him out to dinner and remained with him until bedtime . He dreamed as he 'd always done , but only of the usual fantasies that made sleeping such a pleasure . It did n't touch him even in his sleep . He sat between his parents at the hearing . He felt like a spectator . He 'd been charged with reckless driving . When it came his turn to testify , he spoke in a clear , untroubled voice . His father was shocked by his detachment . The court was puzzled . Afterwards policemen testified in his behalf  --  the boy on the bicycle had ridden thoughtlessly across his path ; he had turned to avoid running over him , and the faulty brake mechanismhad failed to stop the car . Two of the persons were severelyinjured , two others were temporarily hospitalized , and the remainder had received superficial bruises . Charles listened to the proceedings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing someone other than himself.  |p202The  court reprimanded him for driving without a license and prohibited him from driving again . He was released . There was an action against the Coopers , but he did n't know of it . His mother took him away immediately . They went to see a motion picture . Afterwards they lunched in a pleasant cafe . They talked of happy things and once he made her laugh . The accidenthad drawn them closer than they 'd been in years . He talked bravely of all the great things he hoped to do . She felt again the intense love she 'd always held for him . He was her baby , her beautiful , brilliant baby . And now they 'd been through one more crisis and she prayed it was the last . Soon they 'd have a house , she promised . And then things would be better again . She promised herself to give him more attention . She 'd neglected him dreadfully , but she 'd make it up to him . It had n't touched him . Secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one had died . And it freed him from the curse of anonymity . Already it had acquired the quality of adventure . People he 'd never seen before spoke to him by name . " How 'd you make out , Chuck ? " " Oh , I beat it , " he answered proudly . They looked at him curiously , wondering whom he knew , what sort of importance his folks had . " You 're lucky , kid . " Now girls seemed thrilled to meet him . Their eyes widened coyly and they ruffled their tails like pullets . " Oh , you 're the man who was in that accident . " " Aw , it was n't serious . Just a great to-do about nothing . " " You should have seen all the people standing ' round . Must have been thousands of them . I do n't know where they all came from . " " I saw ' em . You know , people can smell an accident . " " Were n't you scared ? " " Scared ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ran over . " " When that man had that meat cleaver ? Mr. Johnson took it away from him . Were n't you scared he was gon na chop you in the head ? " " Naw , he was only bluffing. "  |p203No  , he was n't bluffing , either . The white people were going to lynch you if the colored people had n't stopped them . " " Lynch me ! " He was shocked . But it was a pleasant kind of shock since the danger had passed . It added to the mystery that surrounded him . Afterwards he 'd say . " You know , for a moment , I thought those white guys were going to lynch me . They might have tried at that if there had n't been so many colored people there . " Mrs. Robinson was very tender with him after that , and even Greg and the gang seemed awed by his experience . He never knew that the Coopers had been fined , that they 'd lost their home and all their life 's savings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from him . Even William knew , but she would n't let him tell . Why should he have to know and suffer guilt all his life for what was done to him , she reasoned . His father felt differently . The boy should know ; it would teach him to be more careful in the future . But he had n't the courage to defy his wife . He was doing no better in Cleveland than he had in St. Louis , still working at odd jobs of carpentry to make ends meet . She 'd gotten the upper hand . She dominated him by nagging and disparagement . He could n't stand up to it any longer . To fight back had become depletive . It was easier to let her have her way . Although they had no legal claim , the Coopers held them morally responsible for half the damages . Professor Taylor felt obligated to pay his share . But the money they 'd received from the sale of their property in St. Louis was deposited in Mrs. Taylor 's name . She refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professor Taylor 's people never forgave her . But she felt that she had saved her son from some dreadful kind of horror.  |p204IT  WAS A SEVEN-ROOM FRAME HOUSE OUT IN THEnortheast residential section , across from the high school , and they were the only colored family . Its location in a white neighborhoodgave them the prestige of suburbanites . Their colored friends were proud to know someone who lived so far away . Mrs. Taylor loved the hard , waxed floors and gleaming banistersand flower plots out back . She sent to St. Louis for her furniture and everything was polished to a turn . Their first Sundaythey celebrated as a family reunion . For his contribution to the dinner , Charles made a wilted lettuce salad they thought delicious . He was proud and delighted by his success , although he never could recall the ingredients he 'd used . He never made another salad although they often begged him . He stood on his laurels to the end . The house did something wonderful for Charles . He was home again . He 'd never realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Harvard Eaton for dinner one evening after school . Then he invited all the gang of boys and girls for tea one Sunday afternoon . They were impressed by the house and loved his mother . She could be charmingly gracious when she chose . It made all the difference with his friends . Now they took him seriously . Even Greg began to call him Chuck and treat him as an equal . The brothers were happy to be together again . Charles built a crystal radio set with headphones for them both . The sweet lilting music coming from the swank restaurants about the city stirred Charles with a poignancy he could n't bear . He 'd take off the headphones and walk out in the back garden and cry it out . Home ! It was home ! It was the only house in which he 'd ever lived that he could actually see . He loved it with a deep wonderful passion . William 's friend , Ramsey , was often there , and the Douglasp205family came to dinner several times . Then there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the wittiest . Afterwards Mrs. Douglas helped their mother with the dishes and the warm , affectionate voices of the women sang above the clatter . The fathers sat in the living room and smoked cigars . Professor Taylor told of his experiences as a teacher and expandedin the pleasant memories . The young men gathered upstairs about the radio . Charles was relaxed , everything seemed to fit . He felt that he belonged . " What 's got into you , Chuck ? " Ramsey asked . " I never heard you talk so much . " " It 's the spinach , " his brother teased . " He 's drunk off spinach juice . Charles laughed . " ' Speech is the window of great thought , " ' he quoted from some forgotten source . " If I never said anything you would n't know how wise I was . " " What Chuck means is he wished he 'd kept his big mouth shut , " William said . " Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas , " quoted Ramsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd better watch your step , " said William . Their father contracted a great deal of carpentry work in the neighborhood and employed two helpers . He had an ingratiating manner with white employers . They liked and respected him . He was n't servile or submissive , but possessed a profound tolerance for human foibles . ' Whenever someone said to him , " Well , I do n't know , I 've never had a colored man do this sort of work , " he assumed his most indulgent attitude and quizzically replied , " Now I doubt very seriously if the work will know the differ-ence . " Charles did his mother 's nails and often at night she let him brush her hair again . When she decided to wear it short she let him cut it for her . He was careful of each strand and worked hard to get it just the way she wanted it . She let him keep a lock . Quite often he helped about the house . She said that he was as fastidious as a girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairing locks , replacing knife handles and other delicatep206chores which no one else could do . " If Charles ca n't do it , no one can , " his mother was wont to boast . His friends organized themselves as the Gnothi Seauton fraternity , and felt quite sophisticated when someone asked the meaning of the name . " Know thyself , " was the proud reply . " It 's the inscription on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi . " " Greg will never know himself , " Marie teased . " He 's his own worst enigma . " Bright sayings were the rage and the remark clung to Greg to his annoyance . Charles was elected sergeant-at-arms , and when they gave their first dance took his duties seriously and marched about the Y gymnasium ordering fellows to douse their cigarettes . They charged admission , made enough to hire an orchestra for their first formal dance , which they hoped would be a social event of great importance , comparable to the annual formals given by the college fraternities . They had a crest embossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was elaborately planned . As the date approached , Charles was filled with trepidation . He ordered a correspondence course in dancing and got Harvard to coach him after school . They danced together after Charles had memorized the various steps . But he was stiff and awkward . " Relax , Chuck , relax , " Harvard cried exasperatedly . " If you move with the rhythm you ca n't go wrong . " " I 'm trying , " Charles said stubbornly . " I believe you 're tone-deaf . " " No , I can hear the rhythms all right . But they just do n't go to my feet . There is n't any connection . I hear them with my mind . " " You 're just self-conscious . Relax . No girl 's gon na bite you . " " I 'm not scared of girls , " he snapped . His mother bought him a tuxedo and patent leather pumps . He 'd need them later , anyway , for the senior prom , she reasoned . It gave him quite an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wished midnight-blue instead of black . When the big night arrived the house was turned upsidep207down getting him prepared . His mother tied his bow and William stood by and gave him sage advice . " Now when the dance starts , hold the girls at a distance . They 'll be worried about their clothes . But at the end  --  that 's when you hold them close . " Their mother laughed . " How do you know so much ? " " I 've been around . " " Now , Charles , be a good boy , " she cautioned smilingly . She looked at him with eyes of pride . " If he 's too good he wo n't get any dances , " William said . " Anyway , if I ca n't be good I 'll be careful , " he quipped . While in the presence of his family he felt grown-up and assured . But on the street car , dressed in his new tuxedo and carefully handling the corsage of sweet peas and yellow rose buds which his mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house where Della lived , stage fright suddenly overwhelmed him and his legs began to tremble . It was his first date . She was a new girl he 'd met at Sunday school . He felt such a sense of dread he was tempted to throw away the flowers and go home . But her parents had already seen him . " How nice you look , Charles , " Mrs. Lane greeted , opening the door . Mr. Lane offered him a glass of wine . " Drink it , son , you 'll need it . " Then Della entered the living room . She was an exquisite girl with a rose-brown complexion , dark liquid eyes and long , luxurianthair . She was wearing a beautiful long gown of pale blue organdy . He glowed with pride . Silently he presented the flowers . She took them solemnly with downcast eyes , whispering , " Thank you . " " Oh , you must pin them on her , " the mother said . He fumbled with the pin , his fingers turned to thumbs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered . Her eyes were bright with tears . It was Della 's first dress affair also . She would n't sit for fearp208of wrinkling her gown . They stood apart from each other , mute and wooden , waiting for the taxicab . The parents chattered nervously . When the horn blew , everyone started as if caught in the coinmissionof a crime . Charles fumbled awkwardly with her cape and she placed her hand shyly on his arm . She wore the cape loosely so as not to crush her flowers and they went down to the taxi and rode in complete silence to the Y. Upstairs she went immediately to the powder room . Charles noticed that the young men and women stood apart . Everyone seemed solemn and constrained . He joined the group of club members who stood conspicuously aloof . Although everythingseemed to be going as they 'd planned , they suffered all manner of apprehensions . Greg suggested that Charles , as sergeant-at-arms , go down to the entrance and direct the guests upstairs . Harvard accompanied him and they stood in the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A group of rowdies had collected about the entrance and picked at the pretty girls . Charles wanted to call a policeman . But Harvardsaid they always hung around a formal dance . The best thing was to ignore them . One of the girls who lived across the street ran down for a trinket she had left . Charles felt it his duty to escort her . He tried to wear the mantle of Sir Galahad lightly and be secure and poised in his behavior . But he could n't take part in any social rite in a normal manner . Inside he was tense lest he make an ass of himself . But he felt impelled to act gallantly , attract attention and be indifferent all at once . His emotions attained a high , explosive quality . When on their return , some rowdy touched her arm , he wheeled and struck blindly , releasing all his tension in the act of violence . He hit the man solidly on the bridge of his nose and stretched him his length on the pavement . Sharp bone hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 'd no idea he 'd struck so hard . Then terror overcame him . There was the man lying unconscious at his feet . The girl had fled upstairs . Harvard had run for a policeman . He stood alone , facing the crowd , withoutp109the slightest notion of what to do . But no one took the rowdy 's part . " That 's Dick Hanson , " he heard someone say . The younger men looked at him in awe . Shortly Harvard returned with the officer who dispersed the crowd . The man regainedconsciousness and the officer helped him to his feet . Charles and Harvard went upstairs . Everyone was talking about his feat . The girls made a great fuss over him . Soon all semblance of his terror left and he expanded with emotion . The driving excitement returned . He felt as if his head would burst . For a time he felt himself vested with supernatural powers , dipped in the river of invincibility . He danced and talked as he never had before . All of his dances were taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found himself saying the most extravagant things . " Where have you been all my life , " he whispered in their ears . " You dance so heavenly in my blue heaven . " He chanted in a low caressing voice , looking deep into their eyes : Where 'd you get those eyesWhere 'd you get those earsWhere 'd you get that hair so curlyWhere 'd you get those teeth so pearly .. . They danced the Charleston and the one-step and the waltz ; and they fox-trotted and cakewalked and did the old collegiate crawl . And he excelled in all of these . Everything turned out perfectly . Della was a great hit with the men because he 'd brought her . When he took her home she let him kiss her in the taxi . Their eyes sparkled with excitement as their sweet hot breath glowed on each other 's mouths . In the dim light he noticed a film of perspiration on her upper lip . Her body felt hot and damp in his arms . They touched the tips of their tongues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi drew up before her house . She ran up the steps . He caught up with her and held her hand . And suddenly he was inarticulate.  |p210He  could scarcely mutter , " Good night . " " Good night , " she whispered softly . He turned abruptly away . At his back he heard the door click shut . He felt the urge to run , but the taxi waited . He paid it off and walked toward Harvard 's house where he 'd planned to spend the night . Young swains could n't afford to taxi home after deliveringtheir girls . Following every formal dance the nearby streets were filled with tuxedoed dandies wending their way home , many walking in their stocking feet , carrying the too-tight pumps . Suddenly he was assailed with the feeling of having funked out in the end . After all the high excitement , the passionate responses and his own overwhelming sense of invincibility , he 'd walked off right at the very climax . Always it was the same , he fumed inwardly . No matter how intense the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climax he failed to carry through . He should have taken her , he told himself . If not that , made her promise to give herself at some other time . Now he knew she 'd expected him to ask ; now  --  after it was over . He wondered what she thought of him , if she considered him too young to know . She must have been keenly disappointed , sick with letdown from her hot passion , he thought . Unbearable chagrin tormented his very soul . He cursed himself bitterly and without mercy . Soon the moment passed and he was filled with exquisite sadness . It was the emotion of one who has lost in love and carries on in heartbreak . Strangely , the sorrow stimulated him . He reveledin an ecstasy of self-torture , assuming the pain of one who 's been deserted . His emotions were vividly alive and hurting . Rivers of heartbreak ran through his soul as he experienced this poignant moment of adolescence . Shortly he began to sing : Me and my sha-had-dowNot a soul to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bert and Clift . " Where 'd you find such a pretty chick ? " Bert greeted . The sorrow vanished instantly and he was happy and excited again . " Never you mind . You just keep your hands off . She 's private property . " " I 'd like to make her my property , " Clift said . Pride flamed in him and all the chagrin of failure was forgotten . He felt only a sense of conquest . " Confidentially , Chuck , you ever get any of it ? " Bert asked . " That 'd be telling , " he replied , slyly insinuating that of course he had . Harvard was waiting down the street . The four walked abreast in noisy exuberance and began to harmonize : Now how in the hell Can the old folks tellIt ai n't gon na rain no more .. . Harvard lived with an uncle and aunt who were childless . They were asleep . The young men talked in whispers as they prepared for bed . " Yvonne lets me kiss her and play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she wo n't let me go any further . I do n't see how she stands it . " " How do you stand it ? " Charles asked curiously . " I do n't . When I leave her house I go straight down on Hawthorneand spend two dollars . " Charles laughed self-consciously . " How do you make out ? " Harvard asked ; then teasingly , " Visit with the widow ? " " Old widow five fingers , " Charles supplemented knowingly , but a hot blush covered his face . " Me ? I 've been lucky . " " Do n't kid old doctor Harvard , son . I know Della wo n't go . I can tell from just looking at her . She 's just like Yvonne . You can get right up to it and no further . " " Not with me , " Charles lied . " I do n't go for that . There 's too many girls that will . "  | " You mean you 've scored with Della ? " " Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dance if I had n't ? " Harvard did n't press it . For a time they talked about the rowdy Charles had struck . " There was another guy there I just wished had said something . I was going to let him have it too , " Charles boasted . " Come off , " Harvard said . " You were just as scared as me . " " Hell , scared of what ? " " All right , Tiger Flowers . " That was the name of a great colored prize fighter . Charles sniggered . But inwardly he felt ashamed and cheapenedby his boastful lying . There was one part of himself that wanted to share confidences with his friend , and another part that shrank from revealing any of his inner emotions . It was as if he felt his inner life would in some way be defiled . As a consequence his talk was shallow and boastful , his accounts juvenile and false . If he could have confessed how terrified he 'd been after he 'd hit the rowdy ; and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and how , strangely , this taut excitement had titillated , making him feel strong and powerful as a person and invincible as a lover ; or spoken truthfully of kissing Della in the taxi  --  " We swapped tongues and she was so hot I could have made her promise if I 'd insisted . She would have then . But I was scared to ask . I 've never asked a girl for that . I 've never had a girl . Do you think she would have ? "  --  he would have been vastly relieved of all his torturing frustrations . But he could n't relate the things he felt . He kept it all bottled up inside himself . He 'd never confessed to any of his friends that he 'd never experienced sexual intercourse . He felt it was a stigma . To cover up he boasted of the girls he 'd had , often giving them bad reputations by the lies he told about them . Afterwards he was ashamed and remorseful . But he could n't help it . Early that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanson family , father and mother and two sons , called at the house and demanded that Charles be sent out to them . Dick'sp213nose had been broken and he 'd claimed that Charles had struck him with a piece of iron . The Hansons ran a trucking business ; the older son , Heavy , had been a prizefighter , and the father was a powerfully built man known as a bully throughout the neighborhood . They felt intolerably mortified that anyone would dare attack a member of their family . Their prestige was at stake . For hours they 'd been hunting Charles like vigilantes , going from house to house of all the club members . The father had a shotgun . Mr. Shoemaker , Harvard 's uncle , denied that Charles was there . The Hansons demanded to search the house . The father threatened to shoot off the lock . The Shoemakers had no telephoneand there was no way they could summon aid . Mrs. Shoemakerpeered from the darkened curtains , faint with fright . The sinister clan milled about on the porch . But Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , neither of the boys is here . Harvard had to go out of town to see his mother . She 's sick . He caught the midnight bus . And Charles went on home . " " Where does that fellow live ? " Heavy demanded . " I do n't know . Way out somewhere . Harvard knows but I 've never asked him . Now I wish you folks would leave . My wife is sick and you 'll make her hysterical . " Finally the Hansons became convinced and reluctantly went away . The boys had n't awakened . For a long time the elders sat debating whether they should rouse Charles and send him home . But they were afraid the Hansons might still be lurking outside . At breakfast they told the boys what had happened . They sat huddled in the kitchen behind drawn shades , held in the grip of terror . By the light of day the experience became all the more frightening . " They 're maniacs , " Mrs. Shoemaker said . " George , you should go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was loath to antagonize the Hansons . " The first thing to do is get Charles home , " he said . " I 'll walk down the street and see if the coast is clear . " When he returned Harvard accompanied Charles to the street/car stop . The friends walked in tense silence , searching every nook and cranny with frightened eyes . Charles hunched his shoulders deep into his coat as if to hide . Both of them sighed with relief when the streetcar came into sight . They shook hands solemnly as if parting for the last time . It was the outlaw quality of the Hansons ' act which terrified Charles most . He was afraid should he meet them on the street by accident they 'd begin beating and shooting him without a word . And there was no one to protect him . He could n't tell his parents . His mother would have gone straight to the Hansons and demandedan explanation . He was afraid they might actually injure her . And his father was such a puny man to stand up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd never thought of his father as such a mighty man . He never dreamed of asking his father 's protection from anything . For a time he kept off Cedar Avenue . And then one day as he was coming from the Y a strong hand gripped his arm . " Now I got you , you little son of a bitch ! " Heavy Hanson exulted . He was taken to the Hansons ' house as if under arrest and held a prisoner in the parlor until the clan assembled . They tried him as if they were a court . Charles stood before them , pleading for his life , it seemed . " You know I did n't hit him with any piece of iron . You think I 'd carry a piece of iron in my tuxedo pocket ? " Dick would n't meet his eyes . " I thought it was a piece of iron . It must have been . " His mother looked at him scornfully . She was a sagging , heavy woman with hair like the Medusa and an ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't beat this bastard I 'm gon na make your brother beat you , " she threatened . " I 'll beat him , " Dick muttered . He was the weakling of the lot . Heavy turned on Charles . " You got ta fight Dick . " " I 'll fight him , " Charles muttered . " I ca n't fight until my nose gets well , " Dick said . " Then you got ta fight me , " Heavy said to Charles.  | " You ? " Charles 's heart sank . " Let Dick fight ' im , " the father said . " He 's the one claims the boy hit ' im with a pipe . " " He ought a be flogged first anyway , " the mother said . Charles felt in the grip of a nightmare . It was finally decided the boys would fight one afternoon on the playground as soon as Dick 's nose was healed . Heavy took Charles to the door and cuffed him on the head . He ran down the stairs , limp as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old lady 's sadistic eyes . He was in a state of terror , jumping at the slightest touch . But worst of all was the dark , ugly blot on the memory of his first formal dance . The two were bound together , the triumphant ectasy of the dance and the ugly aftermath of being hunted like a beast , and he could never think of one withoutthe other . Afterwards a cloud of apprehension shadowed every social event . He remained wary of the Hansons for a long time . But nothing ever happened . He never learned how Dick got out of fighting him . Della became his girl . They were invited to several formal dances . He enjoyed taking her . But there was always this shadow of apprehension , distorting their relationship . He tried desperately to act protective and suffered agony when older men were too pointedly attentive . He wanted her to think of him as a great man of the world , but always underneath was this fear she would discover he was cowardly and weak . He was certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " You should n't dance so much with John Webb , " he 'd say angrily . " He 's too old . " " I do just because he 's good , Chuck . He 's the best dancer here . " He winced with humiliation . " He 's just showing off . You know all he wants . " " He is n't . He 's nice , " she defended . " And he 's not so old . He 's just a senior at Reserve . " It infuriated him . " That 's old enough . And anyway , who brought you ? "  | " You do n't own me , " she snapped . " All right , " he said crossly . " Go on and make a fool out of yourself . Everybody 's talking already . " " But you want me to have a good time , do n't you , Chuck ? " she said contritely . He melted . " All right . But anyway , this one 's mine . " Sometimes , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream parlor , he 'd say such sophisticated things as : " Do n't you think two people should have sex experiences before they marry ? I mean with each other . " Sometimes she 'd give him a shy , upfrom-underlook and murmur something incoherently . And he 'd feel quite mature and self-assured . But often she 'd giggle suddenlyand completely disconcert him . On walking down the street he 'd insist , " After all , we both want it . " But when they sat panting in the darkened parlor he could n't say the words . They 'd sit and talk of this and that , listening for the parents in the kitchen . The Lanes were very lenient toward their daughter and trusted her implicitly . Charles did n't know that Della talked quite freely with her mother . And she 'd promisedsolemnly never to give herself away . " Always keep your legs pressed tight together , " had been her mother 's sage advice . " And when you ca n't stand it go take a drink of water . " When finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gim me a slobber . " Or he 'd chant the lyric : Gim me a little kiss , will ya  --  huhOh gee  --  oh gosh  --  I 'm begging for a kiss . . . " Here , " she 'd say , puckering up her lips . He 'd turn out the light and they 'd snuggle closely , groping for each other . They put their tongues in each other 's mouths until their lips were wet with saliva . But she would n't let him feel herp217legs . Shortly he 'd be frantic , and quite often he became violent , gripping her savagely . The sweet musk scent rising from her body tantalized him and he felt driven crazily through space like a stray leaf in a high gale . But at those moments he could never ask . They struggled silently , he trying to make her yield and she resisting , as desperately as persons fighting for their lives . Yet there were rules constraining both , more felt than realized . Both knew he could n't take unless she gave . Mutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pant , " Yes ! Yes ! " because he could never ask . This she knew . It made the game all the more exciting because she kept control . Strangely , both liked it more than they would have the real thing . They went together until the Christmas holidays . Then she went to a dance with John Webb . Charles never spoke to her after that . He did n't call ; did n't write . She wrote and asked to see him . He did n't answer . They met at a dance . She rushed forward and greeted him . Tears brimmed in her eyes . He would n't look at her . He turned and walked away . It was always his last resort  --  to hell with it ! He had learned to do this during the first months following his brother 's accident . He had developed a credo : No matter how hurt you are , if you do n't think about it , it ca n't hurt . It helped him over many a painful situation . Sometimes it worked ; sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and deep . But sometimes the hard quality of his rejection refused it recognition . CHARLES GRADUATED THAT JAUNARY . THE HOUSEwas filled with fuss and excitement all during the preceding week . He 'd taken the lovely colored girl in his class to the Seniorp218Prom , held in a fashionable hotel . His mother had been so proud she 'd purchased a dozen of the pictures taken there and sent them to all her friends and relatives in the South . His father bought him a new blue suit for graduation . But somehow it did n't touch him . He 'd seen commencements all his life . This did n't seem any different . He was just completing high school . Why all the fuss and bother ? He attended the exercises with a remote nonchalance , slightly contemptuous of his parents ' nervousexcitement . " Relax , mother , all I 'm going to do is graduate from high school , " he said when it came time to leave them and join his class . She held him tightly for a moment . Tears brimmed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of the auditorium , listening to the impassioned speeches with complete indifference . Out in the sea of white faces he located those of his parents and his brother and felt their excitement even from that distance . Inside he was cold as ice . But when his name was called , and he walked forward , and the principal placed the roll of parchment tied with blue and gold ribbon in his hand , he caught fire . It was as if a miracle had happened . He flamed with one of those rare moments which bring a sense of fulfillment , and felt a confidence beyond all his wildest dreams . In some strange and indefinable manner his earth had steadied . As he walked rigidly to his seat , holding the diploma tightly in his hand , he felt he could do anything he should ever hope to do . His mother cried . She 'd lived so long in tight anxiety for fear of his doing something beyond redemption , now her very bones seemed to melt in vast relief . He 'd made it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been so many times she 'd doubted if he ever would . William beat him on the back . His father kept saying over and over , " Now , son . Now , son , " shaking his head as when greatly moved . " There 's nothing to stop you now , " his mother said . " You must n't let mother down , son . "  | " I wo n't , " he promised , deeply touched by the flow of their emotion . " I wo n't . I could n't . " He was always touched by extravagantemotion . His confidence was contagious . It affected all of them . His parents renewed their hope in it . As long as he progressed , their own future could never die . In the past , while he was growing up , his future had been held within their lives . Now theirs was caught in his . Each night his mother prayed fervently to God to keep his ambition burning , to hold him steadily on the path . Neither would acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after nearly a quarter-century of marriage , he was all they had . They could n't admit it even to themselves . But his position in the household changed . They catered to him in a number of minor ways . He realized it and came to feel a great responsibility toward them . He had reached that delicate stage of first maturity where every son feels honor-bound to make his parents proud of him . It was a new emotion , affecting him strangely . He saw sharply the gray in his father 's hair , his old , seamed face , now fading to a saddle color ; he saw the deep lines about his mother 's eyes , how the flesh had sagged down from her high cheekbones , making her jaws more pronounced , squarer . Her lips had thinned and her eyes had become sunken , the lids age-lowered , so that their steady glint was almost baleful . With advancing age her face had taken such a great sternness as to appear mean . He was stricken with pity for them . Once as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , " Do n't grow old , Mama . Please do n't grow old . " He yearned to make some great sacrifice to bring back youth to her face . William entered the high school across the street that month . He remembered his mother as he 'd last seen her and missed the poignancy of her gradual aging which so affected Charles . He was a brilliant student and very popular with the teachers and pupils alike . Soon the house was filled with boys and girls who flocked about him . Except for Ramsey Douglas all his new friends were white . William could not see that they were white and never thought of it . They never thought of him as colored . Theyp220achieved an intimacy that was wonderful . But whenever Charles came into the group they lost it . Charles seldom took part in his brother 's activities . Their interestshad grown apart . He was away from home a great deal of the time , and most of his evenings were spent with Harvard and his friends of the Gnothi Seautons . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to the St. Valentine 's Day dance . They were late getting out and the streetcars had stopped running . He set out for home walking , singing softly to himself : It 's three o'clock in the morningWe 've danced the whole night through .. . Two inches of fresh snow had fallen . The old houses flanking the car-lined street were dark and asleep and the park was blanketed with the new white snow . Slanting his hat at a jaunty angle , he became Hermes on winged sandals , bearing a message to Zeus . He could be anything he wanted to at night . It was pleasant to be Hermes through the deserted night . The days sped swiftly in dreams and it was March before he found a job . His father sent him to a large eastside hotel to interviewhis old friend , Dick Small , who worked there as the headwaiter . Charles arrived while breakfast was being served . Across from the elevators two pretty young white women sat in a glassenclosedbooth checking the room service orders . Brisk young waiters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dancers balanced urns , paraded swiftly past their sharp smiling eyes , hurrying into the elevators . They looked up at Charles as he hovered indecisively , and smiled . He asked for Mr. Small . One of them told him to be seated on the bench beside their booth . He sat , fiddling nervously with his hat , and looked across the kitchen . Great ranges caught in stark white light loomed in the center of confusion . About them milled the waiters , pushing and quarrelsome , voices cutting across voices , panting with a sense/less fury , their bright white smiles and unctuous manners saved for the guests in the dining room . Charles was frightened by what seemed to him a meaningless pandemonium . His first impulse was to slip silently away and forget that he 'd ever been there . He 'd come up on the elevator but he looked for the door to the stairs . Before he could escape , a slight , balding man with bird-like movements and bright , dark eyes , impeccably attired , came into the kitchen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're Charles Taylor . " " Yes sir . " The bright dark eyes searched him with a glance , scanned his fingernails , dug into his ears , observed the neatness of his hair , the cleanness of his collar , the polish of his shoes , but so briefly that Charles saw only the warm , cordial smile . " Son , I 've known your father for forty years . We went to school together . Professor Taylor is one of the finest men I know . Come into my office . " He turned away so quickly Charles had to leap to follow . They entered a dressing room off from the kitchen which contained a desk and couch . A row of spotless tuxedoes hung neatly down one wall . Mr. Small sat behind the desk and waved Charles to a chair . A moment later a waiter entered with breakfast and silently served them . " Son , waiting is an old and honorable profession , " Mr. Small said . " I would n't hire a man who condescended toward it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Charles replied , thinking of the hard , hurried confusion he 'd just seen . " I just do n't know if I would fit . Everything seems so hurried . " " In waiting tables time is the essence , son . Your guests must be served with rapidity . The leisure belongs to the guests , never to the waiter . " " But they sound so  --  well , violent . You 'd think they were going to fight . " Mr. Small laughed . " When my waiters stop fighting at the ranges it is time for me to worry . But do n't let that worry you , son . A good waiter and a good chef always get along . I 'm goingp222to put you on as a bus boy at sixty dollars a month . The waiters will share their tips . Can you carry a tray ? " " I think so . " " I 'll put you on room service until you learn . If you want to learn , I 'll teach you . No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good profession to know . Many of our most prominent men got their start waiting table . " " I want to learn . " " Good . You 'll never regret it . " He sent Charles to the housekeeper , a doughy-faced woman with cold , suspicious eyes , for his white jackets , after which Charles found his way below to the locker room . The men sat about in their undershirts , smoking , talking desultorily . A few gambled with greasy cards on the dirty benches . They eyed him critically , without warmth . He felt like an intruder , a tourist who has wandered upon the ceremonial rites of a primitive tribe . He did n't know it was his manner that set him apart . At one glance they knew he was not of them . He had none of the extroversion the occupation requires . Inside he was taut with timidity . Outwardly he strove to show a hard indifference . Silently the waiters resolved to break him in ; none offered any assistance . He blundered about helplessly , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the humility to confess ignorance , ask questions . He 'd never been able to meet new people , be congenial in strange circumstances . He knew he 'd never like it here . Again he had the impulse to throw down his jacket and leave . Just quitting was always the easiest out . But his new feeling of responsibility to his parents held him ; he could n't quit . Silently he hung his coat and overcoat in a locker that was occupied , and donned his jacket . He did n't have a black tie . There was one in the locker across from him . He took it without asking and left the room . It was like walking through a gauntlet to reach the door . Upstairs he found the women checkers relaxingin their booth , drinking tea . He asked for Captain Jackson . They smiled at him . " He 's in the locker room . " " Oh . " He started to move away.  | " He 'll be up shortly , " one of them said . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose so . " " My name is Theresa and this is Marguerite  --  they call her Margy . What 's yours ? " " Charles . " He resented their kindness . " Where you from , Charles ? " Margy asked . " From ? " He did n't understand her . " Where did you work before ? " " Oh . I just went to school , " he admitted reluctantly . " I just graduated . " " Did n't you ever do this kind of work before ? " Theresa asked . " No . " " It 's really easy . You 'll catch on quick . " He looked skeptical . " You 'll like it , " she said . " I doubt it , " he said , but he had to smile . Their warm , outgoingfriendliness had encouraged him despite himself . He liked them . " I suppose the first hundred years are the hardest , " he grinned suddenly . " Look , he 's got dimples ! " Theresa exclaimed , her eyes dancing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your charm , " a soft , mellow voice said at Charles 's side . " He 'll be walking about in a daze soon enough . " Charles started guiltily , turning toward the tall , brown , asceticlookingman in rimless spectacles . " Oh ! Captain Jackson , Mr. Small told me to report to you . " " He did n't tell you to report to these young ladies , " Mr. Jackson said with a dead-pan expression . " No , sir , I was looking for you . I just stopped to ask  --  " " Do n't be so mean to the boy , Jack , " Theresa said . Mr. Jackson smiled . Charles relaxed . " These young ladies cause more havoc on my station than a four-alarm fire , " Mr. Jackson warned . " You must inure yourself against their charms , son . You wo n't be able to find the ele-vators. "  |p224The  young women laughed . " You know that is n't so , Jack . You could n't get along without us . " " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles followed he turned to smile at the two young women who smiled in return . Mr. Jackson took him into the small south dining room reserved for parties and assigned him to sortingsilver , folding napkins and filling salt cellars . It was dim and quiet . He worked alone . All of his nature rebelled against the job . He was the servant of servants , required to take orders from everyone . He felt helpless and trapped , knowing all the while it was too much emotion to expend on such a simple job . But he could n't help it . He was too ingrown to control the emotional impact of the place . Lunch was served . He went up on the elevators , entered the rooms of strangers , rolled out the wheel trays of dirty dishes . He stacked the dirty dishes in the big tin trays , the silver and the cups and saucers , the plates and coffeepots , rode the elevator down and carried the trays through the mad confusion of the kitchen to the dishwashers . The waiters shouted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Step lively , son ! " . . . " One side , punk , one side ! " ... They pushed him aside . He clung to his tray with his left hand , balanced it on his right . Once in the elevator a coffeepot fell off . Reaching for it , he upset his tray . Soiled china shattered on the elevator floor , silver rang . At the kitchen level he had to get broom and mop and clean up the mess . The two young women , a few feet off , smiled sympathetically . The waiters stopped to look at the debris . Some were angry at being held up , others kidded him cruelly . The bus boys jeered . His face flamed fiery red . He felt sick to the bone with infinite shame . Captain Jackson looked at him curiously . The dishwashers screamed at him when he brought the tray of silver and broken china . " Take it away ! Take it away ! Take it away ! " " Where ? " " Dump it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off . A waiter pushed him aside . Finally one of the older waiters said , " Take out the silver and throw away the broken dishes , son . "  |p225After  that he went about his duties with a mute antagonism . Ignorant bastards , they did n't like him , he thought . To hell with them ! He 'd finish out the day and never come back . To hell with that kind of job ! When it came time for him to eat he had no appetite . He dreaded going to the range and asking for his food . He picked at his plate in silence . " Kind of got you up a tree , eh , kid ? " one of the fellows said with a peculiar smile . He did n't answer . Then finally the day was over . He hurried to get away . " Good night , Charles , " Theresa called . He turned and found the two young women smiling at him . " Good night , " he said , smiling in return . " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he replied . His mother asked him how he liked the job . " I do n't like it . I do n't think I 'll stay . " " It 's just until September , " she reminded him . " If you stay on until then it will be a great help toward your expenses in college this fall . " " I 'll get something else . I do n't like that kind of work . " " You 'll get used to it , son , " his father said . " It 's strange at first . But when you get to know the fellows it 'll be different . " " I do n't want to know the fellows , " he maintained stubbornly . " You must learn , son , you ca n't have everything just as youwould like it , " his mother said sadly . " No , mother , " he replied with a tightening of the lips that made them look so much alike . " No , I ca n't . But there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it . " She winced from the hardness of his manner . All of the old worry and trepidation stirred in her again . " You just watch , " she warned . " You 're going to make your bed hard . " He looked at her with glinting eyes . " Sometimes it 's hard either way . " She let the subject drop . But that night , finding him alone in the kitchen , she tried again . " You must n't give up so easily , son . I know it is n't alwaysp226pleasant , but you must learn to stick it out . Your grandparents  --  my parents  --  started in life without a cent . When they were  --  " " I know , mother , I know all about it , " he interrupted rudely . " You 've told me about it a thousand times . " She lit the fire beneath the kettle to make a cup of tea , and sat watching him finish his sandwich and glass of milk . Except for his hair , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mused . But he did n't have Maggie 's push . " Has mother ever told you about your great-grandfather , Dr. Jessie Manning ? He was in the United States Senate before the Civil War . " There was the queer note of pride in her voice which he despised . " Yes , you 've told me all about all of ' em , " he said harshly . She was suddenly saddened by his attitude . Why could n't he realize his great potentialities ? Why could n't he be proud of himself ? " You must never forget it , my son , " she said in a tear-filled voice . " You children have the blood of conquerors flowing in your veins . " Looking up , he saw the age and disappointment in her face , and was instantly contrite . " I know , mother ; I 'm sorry I talked like I did . " " You must learn to surmount the petty obstacles that arise in your path , my son . " " All right , I 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry with her for forcing him to do something he did n't want to do . Everything was different the next morning . His initiation was over . He 'd come back . In the locker room , while he was changing , the fellows were friendly and helpful . They joshed him about dropping the tray . " You know what to do when you got a bear by the tail ? " " What ? " " Let it go , boy , let it go ! " He laughed . Now he felt more assured , less timid . When he went upstairs to report for work he did n't feel as if he were going to his execution.  |p227A  good-looking , brown-skinned boy approached him and said , " My name 's Roy . You 're gon na work with me this morning . " " Okay , Roy . Mine 's Charles . " " Roy stopped to chat with the checkers . He was a favorite with them . " How 's God 's gift to the teen-agers ? " Theresa greeted him , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy said . " I like my women tall , twenty and terrific . " " You like your women , period , " Margy corrected . They turned dazzling smiles on Charles . " We did n't look for you back this morning , " Margy said . He grinned . " Well , here I am " " My , such dashing wit . I bet you slay the girls with your clever repartee . " Charles had to laugh . " Hardly . " " You do it with your dimples , do n't you , Charles ? " Theresa said . " With his eyes , dear , " Margy amended . " With his long gorgeouslashes . Why do n't you give some girl those lashes , Charles ? It 's unfair . " " I wish I could , " he said , feeling the blood rise in his face . " Look , you 're making him blush , " Theresa observed . " Do n't pay any attention to us , " Margy said . " We 're just jealous . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll bet , " he said . " I 'll bet you got so many guys lined up they have to draw straws to see who gets a date . " " Listen to Charles ! " Theresa exclaimed . " Who said he could n't talk ? " Roy did n't like the attention Charles was getting . The waiters , dribbling past to their various stations , kidded him . " Roy 's getting some competition . " " He does n't like it , either  --  eh , Roy ? " " He 'll have the new boy treed ' fore lunch . " " Better watch it , Roy . You 'll lose your pretty home , boy . " The young women were delighted . They enjoyed their popularitywith the colored waiters . Their influence on Charles wasp228magic . It changed the face of the day . Now everything was pleasant . He made several trips with Roy and brought down trays of dirty dishes . The dishwashers shouted to him as they 'd done the day before . But he just smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog that was used in motion pictures had occupied that suite . He was smiling to himself when he brought down the tray . The young women noticed it . When he returned from the dishwashers , Theresa called , " What 's so amusing , Charles ? " " Share it with us , Charles , " Margy said . " Do n't be stingy . What happened up there . Some dame slip her peignoir ? " she asked jokingly out of the side of her mouth . " I was just wondering how a dog would look in a dinner jacket , " he said enigmatically . The young women exchanged glances , looked at him with raised brows . His laugh was infectious ; they laughed with him . The elevator door was ajar ; the light was out . He reached inside , feeling for the light switch , looking back at the young women with a secret grin , and they were smiling in return , feeling happy that he liked them , and he was already loving both of them without even knowing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he stepped was nothing . He clutched spasmodically with both hands , finding nothing . For a brief tight instant he was filled with the sense of falling . He was fully conscious of falling . He felt the sensation of his body going swiftly down through the darknesswith nothing to stop it . He was aware that he did n't scream . There was no time for fright or panic or the explosion of emotions in his mind . His senses were filled with the knowledge of his falling and he was rational . As quickly it was over . He felt the jarring impact of striking bottom . No instant pain engulfed him . It was an over-all crushing sensation , not localized , but absolute , which should have made a crushing sound . But he did n't hear anything . He was conscious . Immediately he tried to stand . It was a reflex action accompanied by the self-conscious humiliation of an able-bodied manp229who slips on ice . He put down his left hand to brace himself . There was a queer , funny sensation as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed it . Then fire lanced up his arm and shattered in his brain . A moment later he heard a tremulous voice as if from a great distance crying , " Help ! Help ! Help ! " His mind was like a spotlessvacuum from which all thought has been dynamited by one clean , clear blast . His first rational thought was of the darkness . He could n't see himself and felt at a great disadvantage . The voice was sharply annoying and he wished violently that it would stop . " Help ! Help ! Help ! " As yet he had n't realized it was his own . He gritted his teeth in annoyance . Again the white brilliantblast exploded in his head . Then there was light above him . The basement door to the elevator had been opened . Figures moved against the light like tribal dancers . Voices began penetrating his thoughts but the words had no meaning , as if they were all in a foreign tongue . He thought , " Now they 'll help me , " and relaxed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . But it was not frighteningnow that help had come . A light was flashed into the pit . His body was huddled in a grotesque position against the heavy steel guard supported by a mammoth steel spring rising two feet from the center of the pit to catch the elevator should it plunge out of control . The front of his white jacket was splattered with blood . He was looking upward , faintly smiling . Someone called above , " HOLD THAT ELEVATOR ! " A waiter and one of the garage attendants jumped down into the pit to lift him out . " Oh ! " he exclaimed when the garageman sought to shift him . " I think my arm is broken , " he said weakly . " Watch his arm ! " the waiter said roughly . The garageman was sweating . They straightened him out with infinite care . " We need some help , " the waiter called . Two others jumped into the pit . The four of them , two on each side with arms beneath his body , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armpits , the waiter at his foot , lifted him above where a number of others , lying flat on their stomachs , reached out and took him from the shaft . " Oh ! " he cried faintly as they handled him . " Oh ! " The blinding flashes were striking in his brain like April lightning . Some one had thought of blankets and they laid him gently on the basement floor . He looked up and saw the face of Mr. Small bending toward him . " We 've sent for the ambulance , son , and I 've sent for your parents . " His smile was gone ; the headwaiter'sface was furrowed with anguish and concern . " I 'm all right , " he whispered faintly . About him were the faces of many others , waiters and bus boys , chefs and many of the hotel 's guests , all marked with that morbid recognition of human helplessness . The two young women stood close , their bright , tear-filled eyes , enlarged with shock , against dead-white skin . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely carrying beyond his lips . He felt as if he were crying inside , the tableau held breathless by some powerful emotion , but there was no pain . Way underneath he was remotely pleased , and could n't help it , to be the center of this absolute attention . The hotel doctor and nurse arrived and briskly took command . " Clear away these men , " he ordered . " Give me the shears , Miss Tate . " While two of the remaining waiters turned his body , the doctorcut away his clothes . He moved his head to look down at his body , which felt so queer . His left arm , he noticed , was broken off completely just above the wrist , blood spotting the white jagged ends of the bones as if the blood were being squeezed from them , and his hand projected away at a right angle , held only by flesh and skin . He studied the fracture carefully without thinking . His eyes were dark with shock , of a velvet , liquid mindlessness , immense in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain had not come . Blood was seeping slowly from his chin , running down his throat . It felt as if he munched a mouthful of gravel . Only the upper part of his body felt coveredp231but he could see his legs were covered also . He tried to move his foot but it did n't respond . " Now , " the doctor said , lifting his right arm . He felt the sharp sting of the hypodermic needle . But he did n't feel it when it went into his hip . He did n't worry . He 'd given himself into the hands of someone and felt content . Almost immediately a drowsiness affected him . " Is he in much pain ? " " No , he 's still in shock . I 've given him sufficient morphine for an hour or so of relief . " He heard the voices as from a distance . The ambulance came down the ramp almost silently . " Carefully , boys , " the doctor said . The blunt-faced driver looked at him . They were professionals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The doctor instructed them to take Charles to a large new hospitalnearby . " And what 's your name , doctor ? " " He 's not my patient . He 's an Industrial Commission case . Instructthe hospital to notify the Industrial Commission . " The attendant looked disgusted . " We were called by the hotel . " " Bill the hotel then . But get on with the boy for God 's sake . " " As you say , chief , " the driver said , shifting into gear . Charles heard the conversation clearly as he lay drowsily on the stretcher . Just before the siren sounded he heard one of the attendants say , " What kind of goddamn crap is this  --  no doctor ! " He did n't worry . He was confident of being cared for . Underneathall else , consciousness that he possessed a father and mother supported his indefinable faith in the outcome . Now he felt the ambulance slow and turn and stop before the emergency entrance to the hospital . The attendants opened the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his head and saw a dark-haired young doctor step from the doorway and hold up his hand to stop them.  | " Ho ! What have you got there ? " He had dark , well-cut features and his hair was slicked like patent leather in the sun . " Accident ! " the driver said . He was a big , red-faced man with pug features and sandy hair . " Fell down an elevator shaft . " The doctor sobered . He wore heavy , dark-rimmed glasses . He came over and looked down at Charles with sudden interest . His expression went entirely blank . He turned back to the driver . " Where did this happen ? " " Park End . " " Who 's the doctor ? " " Commission case . " " Hold him , " the doctor said impassively , turning back inside . " I 'll see . " " Hold him ! " the driver exploded . " What the hell you mean hold him ? What the hell you got to see ? You can see ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell else you got to see ? " " I said hold him here , " the doctor instructed in a cold , controlledvoice . Sunlight glinted on his glasses . " You said ! " the driver shouted . " So you said ! Who the hell are you ? " The doctor closed the door behind him . " What the hell 's the matter with that son of a bitch ? " the driver raved . A moment later the young doctor returned with the resident doctor , an older man with graying hair , also of dark aquiline features . As he came , wearing a peculiar expression , he slowly shook his head , looking at the driver with confidential eyes . He carried a hypodermic syringe . " What do you mean ? " the driver challenged . The resident doctor spread his hands with eloquent appeal . " We ca n't take him . " Charles watched the red climb up the back of the driver 's neck . " What the hell you mean you ca n't take him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizing the statementwith spreading hands . " What the hell you mean no room ? In all this goddamn hospitalyou ai n't got no room for an accident case ? " " We have no beds , " the doctor said , closing his hands abruptly to end the discussion . " I 'll give the patient an injection . " 232 " You 'll give this patient not a goddamned thing . He 's had an injection . That 's all you goddamn bastards want to do , give the man an injection . " The eyes of the resident doctor glinted with anger . " Do n't call me a bastard . " " Yes , I 'll call you a bastard you bastard . You 're not only a bastard but you 're both bastards . What 's this , a goddamned private exclusive hospital , you bastard ? " The lips of the two doctors folded tightly in anger as they turned , without replying , and re-entered the hospital . For a moment the two ambulance attendants stood outside holding Charles in the stretcher and raved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastards 'll leave a man croak right outside their door . " The other one looked at Charles . " Let 's go , " he urged . Charles felt the sense of motion . He 'd been unaffected by the harsh exchange . It seemed vaguely as if years were passing . He wished they 'd stop somewhere so he could go to bed . He was taken to a hospital on Euclid where Negroes were admitted . The firm of doctors who treated accident cases for the Industrial Commission were notified . He was sponged and prepared for X-rays and given additional injections of morphine . Everyone was cheerful and efficient . He felt safer . But until his mother came he could only wait . She was out of the house that morning , shopping . His father was at work , and William was in school . So he went through it alone . They were there , anyway , as much as they would ever be . He had never gone to them in his deepest hurts , or shared with them any of his fullest triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given him birth , and because of this more than for any other reason he loved them with his life and would have died for them . And the fact that he was tied to them by being born of them prevented him from ever being physically alone . There had been many times in his young life when this had been important . It was important now . He needed the nearness and comfort of their physical presence more than he had ever needed it . But inside his spiritual being , where it was still empty of the emotions that would come  --  fear and panic and des/pair  --  they had never touched . His mother had come closest , but always she 'd drawn back from the intensity of his longing when it reached that point where he needed someone most . In that respect he 'd always been alone . Shortly , three doctors arrived and he was wheeled into the X-ray room . " How 'd this happen , lad ? " one asked . Charles avoided the bright blue , inquisitive eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctor chuckled . " That epitaph should adorn half the tombstonesin this civilized world . " The findings showed that he had three fractured vertebrae at the base of his spine , a compound fracture of the left arm above the wrist , a fractured jaw and twenty-two chipped and broken teeth . The extent of the internal injuries was indeterminable , but there was no indication of internal hemorrhage . He 'd landed partly on the elevator guard and partly on the concrete floor of the shaft . His chin , back , and left arm had struck simultaneously . He was given a local anesthetic and his arm set . They did n't think it was necessary to wire his jaw . His torso was wrapped in a cast . The vertebrae could not be set without endangering the spinal column . As far as they could determine , the spinal column had not been injured , although the bone pressing against it caused paralysis of the lower limbs . The purpose of the cast was to hold the vertebrae in place and give the fracture a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually adjust to the curvatureand the pressure be relieved , restoring movement to the lower limbs . His chin was dressed , his mouth washed , and he was wheeled into a private room . The rest was up to God . Lying quietly on the wheel stretcher , his huge , incandescent eyes drug-widened and remote , he seemed a disembodied spirit floating in a world of unreality . He heard the voices distinctly and watched with mindless fascination . As yet he 'd felt no pain . His mother was the first to come . She was carrying a shopping bag of groceries and her face , devastated as it had been whenp235William lost his sight , older now and haggard to the bone , was held stiffly from within by tremendous will power . " It 's mother , Charles . It 's mother , son . " Only her voice gave her away , so high and light and dead . Out of his drugged remoteness he saw the grief there again as it had been the night she came from the hospital with William and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , the tortured mouth , bent forward to kiss him , he braced himself as if against the kiss of death . All the kinds of mothers he 'd wanted her to be bloomed in his mind ; the tenderness of doing her nails , the soft delight of fingering her hair , the passion of her whippings  --  his beautiful mother disfigured with grief . It was not physical hurt but spiritual anguish that came up in him in waves . He closed his eyes as if shutting out the sight of her would dam the flood . But when her cold dry lips touched his forehead , tears made a sudden fringe beneath his tightly pressed lids . He began crying all down inside himself . " I 'm all right , mama . I 'm all right , " he said in his faint , indistinctvoice . " Do n't worry , I 'm all right . " She sat down beside the bed , holding herself from within , and tightly clasped her hands . She was struck by the immobility of his posture ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid out almost for burial , his soft , tan face pale as death . He looked final , permanent , as if he might never rise again . The one who 'd been so active , so physically assured , whose body had been more expressive of himself than all else , now broken . It seemed a sacrilegeagainst nature . Her baby , she thought , the last of all her sons , the one  --  . She did n't dare think it . And yet the loss to her , then , as she first suffered it , him lying there in such total disability , was everything , the final , bitter end of all her high and eager dreams . But desperately she tried to hold it , to keep it from her thoughts . If she once thought it she could n't hold herself . She tried not to think beyond the room . " Go to sleep , son , " she said . " Mother 's here . Mother will look after you . " Now there was this other thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work against his will . " Youp236must n't worry , son . " She stroked his forehead . " God always has a purpose and we must trust in Him . " But it would n't come that God had any other purpose but to punish her for her own incontinentvanity . " Do n't worry , mama , " she heard him saying in that faint , pebbly voice . " I do n't feel anything at all . " It was his saying that that broke her . All of her body began to cry , shaking . " Forgive me , son , " she cried in agony . " Forgive your mother . " He could n't bear it either , and turned his face away , crying toward the wall . A nurse entered . " You should n't disturb him . The shock should wear off grad-ually . " The spell of exquisite agony was shattered . Mrs. Taylor exerted a semblance of control . " I know . " She tried to hold herself in , turning to her son . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . " Her presence , the nearness of her , became uppermost now , and he gave in to her , ceased struggling against her grief , and the anguish slowly ebbed from him , and he became her baby , drowsilyin her arms . He went to sleep . When he awakened it was evening . She sat as if she had n't moved . His father and William were there now , dressed for work and school . In his father 's face , also , were the ravages of grief ; these two elderly people at this time in their lives having to carry the burden of his hurt because he was born to them . With William it was different . He sat silently , his face furrowed with an intensity of emotion , his head cocked in an attitude of listening . Over his shocked sorrow he felt a rage of protest . First himself and now Charles . It was unfair  --  unfair to all of them . It was as if he was hurt again ; and poor Charles , so dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was the first to sense that Charles was back with them . " Chuck ? " " Will . " " What happened , Chuck ? " " I fell down the elevator shaft . "  | " What 's the matter with your voice ? Does it hurt you to talk ? " " Naw , not much . I broke my jaw a little and broke some teeth . " " Then you ca n't eat anything ? " " Just liquids . " " He looked about the room . There was a great bouquet of flowers from the hotel and the waiters had chipped in and sent an enormous basket of fruit . Professor Taylor had stopped on the way and bought a bag of oranges which looked so pathetic beside the others . He noticed that his father was crying , tears slipping unobtrusively down his black , seamed face . " Do n't cry , dad , " he said impulsively . " Son ! " All were silent for a time . The sons were ashamed and embarrassed for their father , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't there a door or guard or something ? " William asked . " It had a door but it was open . " " Oh ! " " It 's a shame , " his mother said . " It 's criminal negligence . I should think Mr. Small would be more careful . " " It was n't his fault , " his father said . " They have an engineer who attends to that . " " I do n't care who attends to it . It was someone 's fault and they 're not going to get away with it . " William cut it off . " Is there anything you want before we go ? " " No , I do n't want anything . " They rose . His father leaned down and patted his shoulder . " We 'll go now , son , and let you rest . " " Mother will pray for you , son . " William became tense again . " Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grief was settling down into the soul , widening into worry , fear , horror . Selfblameattaches inconsistently , and the soul accepts full guilt even when no sin has been committed . If she just had n't forced him to go back , Mrs. Taylor grieved . She could n't rid herself of the conclusion that she 'd gone against God 's will . She 'd always tried to force him into doing things he did n't like , and now she knew it had been to feed her own ambition . On the other hand , his fatherp238mercilessly condemned himself for having sent his son to Mr. Small in the first place . He 'd known , even then , it was n't the kind of work the boy would like . But because he had had to do it , he 'd wanted his son to do it too , telling himself at the time it was for the sake of discipline . Mr. Small blamed himself for not having prohibited the elevator being used when it was first discovered that the door was faulty . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week before . The engineer blamed himself for not having fixed it immediately when it was called to his attention . The two young women blamed themselves for having distractedCharles 's attention . Both had gone home directly followingthe accident , prostrated with grief . They had seen him fall . Later that night , when Charles awakened in the dark , he felt abandoned and alone . But he was not alone ; no one can ever be hurt alone . Others are always hurt by the hurt of anyone . Had he known this , it would have made a difference . THE NEXT DAY REACTION SET IN . THOUGHT PATternsreturned and the discomfort of lying in one stiff position was now clearly felt . Doubt and fear began to gnaw at his mind , and pain , more imagined than experienced , came throbbingly into his consciousness . As he began to realize the extent of his injury , self-pity settled slowly over his emotions . He tried not to think of himself being a cripple , of all the things he might never do again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Our patient is blue , " she smiled . " Just thinking . " " Do n't think about yourself . Think of all your pretty girls and what good times you 're going to have this summer . " He tried to smile . But that was thinking about himself in the worst possible way.  |p239For  a time the visitors helped divert his thoughts . The doctor called early , glancing at his chart . " How is it today , Charles ? " " All right . " And then his mother came . " Is there anything mother can get for you ? " " Some cigarettes . " She tried not to appear shocked , but her silence revealed it . " Do you smoke , son ? " " Not often . " " Did you ask the doctor ? " " I do n't think it matters . " She sighed . " I 'll ask him and if he says it wo n't hurt you I 'll bring them to you . Is there any particular kind ? " " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cochran , called before noon . They 'd brought along a waiter loaded down with lunch , but he was not permitted in the room and the lunch was given to the nurses . The grip of tragedy still had its hold on Mr. Small . He smiled , but it was different . His poise was gone . " There 's no need for me trying to tell you how I feel about this , son . I could n't feel any worse if it had happened to my own son . " " I know . " He wished they would n't talk about it . " The hotel is at your disposal , " Mr. Cochran said . The tragedy had n't touched him as it had the others . " Thank you . " After a moment he added , " Thank you for theflowers . " And then to Mr. Small , " Thank the fellows for the fruit . " " We just learned you can only have liquids , " Mr. Small observed . " Is there anything you prefer ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedstand . " This is a collection the boys took up for you . " " There 'll be something coming from the hotel too , " Mr. Cochranadded . " I think you 'd like to know we 're going to continue your salary , and we 'll see to it that you receive the highest rate of compensation . "  |p240The  reference to money was meaningless to him . " Thank you , " he said again . " I 'd like to have some cigarettes . " " Right ! " Mr. Cochran beamed . This was something tangible , something he could do immediately . " What 's your brand , Chuck ? " " Any brand , sir . " " Right ! I 'll send them right away . " They stood , smiling , the smiles different , and Mr. Small made one last effort , " I 'll send one of the boys over with a thermos of clear turtle soup ; and perhaps you 'd like some eggnog and juices on hand . " " Yes , sir , that 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the two young women at the hotel and all afternoon the bouquets of flowers and baskets of fruit came from his parents ' churches , his Sunday school , the members of his club , and from people he could n't remember . News of his accident had been reported in the daily papers and all the people who had known him only vaguely felt obligated to send condolences . The members of his club came during the late afternoon and then his father 's relatives and afterwards his own family came and sat with him until the time for visiting was over . The small room overflowed with tokens and flowers were banked about the walls as if it was a florist 's shop . He 'd had no time to think . It was late that night , while the hospital slept , that the first blind panic shattered him . He was going to be a cripple , confined to a wheel chair , with a wizened , useless arm . He lit a cigarette , fighting a losing battle . He could n't bear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . How could one be brave , noble , gallant , without physical perfection ? He might never be in love , because it was of the flesh also ; might never know what it was like to be with a woman . That was the bitterestthought of all . He pulled the covers over his head to muffle his sobbing . The next day he was moved into a ward . His doctors thought the activity might distract his morbid self-obsession . There were twenty-three other patients . Something was always happening.  |p241Bitter  quarrels ensued between the patients and the orderlies over bedpans . Internes flirted with the nurses , strutted importantlywhen alone , fawned in the presence of the doctors , and condescended toward the patients with sage demeanors . The doctors came each day , bringing their tidings of good and evil . Food , baths and dressings helped while away the time . The patient to Charles 's right was convalescing from pneumonia ; the one to his left slowly dying from a gangrenous arm . Charles watched with morbid fascination the slow decompositionof the horribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm solution , the slimy fins of drainage tapes hanging from the rotten flesh like eels feeding on a piece of floating carrion . He shook with fear . Suppose blood poison should set into his arm . Extending from the bandaged splints were the fingers of his hand , waxen and atrophied as were a paralytic 's . He thought of the twisted , deformed limbs of beggars he 'd seen down on the Square . Tears squeezed through his eyes . Outside , the gray , dismal days of March 's end passed so slowly by the windows time seemed to be standing still . He kept his sight indrawn . From seven until eight each evening was the visiting hour . His parents always came . Sometimes they brought relief , more often not . His mother had struck up an acquaintance with the wife of the patient who was convalescing from pneumonia . Her conversationconsisted for the most part in denouncing the hotel . Charles was tired of hearing it . But the woman was a patient listener . One night she said , " My man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . Then I wo n't be seeing you again . " " I 'm afraid not . " " I know your husband will be glad to get away from here . " The patient looked up . " You can say that again . " Afterward he was restless , anxious for the night to pass . Charles loaned him one of his western story magazines . The cover held a lurid picture of gunfighting , and the stories were equally gory . Later Charles heard a weird , inhuman gasp and turned hisp242head . The patient , sitting half upright , sucked desperately for breath . His neck was stretched , elongated , the thin neck muscles taut as cables ; his hands clawed at his throat . " Nurse ! " Charles screamed . " Doctor ! " The other patients yelled . For a moment there was bedlam . The nurses came running and drew a screen about the patient . Then the resident doctor and his assistants arrived . Charles heard the low urgency of their voices , the rustle of swift movement . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor came slowly from behind the screen . " Sometimes it happens like that , " he said to his assistants . " Undue excitement . The heart ca n't take it . " The nurses retired . A few minutes later two orderlies removed the screen and wheeled the cot , on which the covered body rested , from the ward . Now in the empty space beside Charles 's bed , where a few short minutes before there 'd been a man going home next day , was death . A frightened silence fell upon the ward . After a time the patients talked intermittently in whispers . Shortly the lights were turned off for the night . Charles lay in the darkness contemplating death . It seemed to him then , in the wake of shock , as if death negated all life . All the splendid glory that life offered and people dreamed came to nothing in death . All the talk of good and bad he 'd endured throughout his life , everything that he 'd been taught , chemistry , Latin , religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing in the end but nothing anyway . Finally he slept and dreamed that he was falling . Three nights in a row he dreamed that he was falling . The death had softened his emotions , left them in a state of flux torn between fear and protest . He did n't want to die himself ; he did n't want to see anyone die ; he did n't want to think about it . But the patient with the gangrenous arm died , and death came again into his thoughts . During the day a blood clot had become dislodged and moved slowly up a vein toward his heart . The doctors gathered about his bed and worked desperately to dissolve it . Early in the evening , when the patient became aware that hep243was dying , he began reciting the Lord 's Prayer , over and over and over , and after the lights were turned off , only the night lamp left above his bed , the voice went on and on in the strained , rigid darkness . Doctors and nurses tiptoed through the ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the praying voice continued , indifferent to the fuss and bother , growing weaker as the night wore on . A shroud of horror descended on the ward . No one slept . When one dies prayerfully it is always infinitely more despairing to those who have to listen . Slowly , inexorably , Charles 's mind hardened toward the voice ; some defense had been erected ; his anger and resentment crystalized . After that he thought only of getting well , getting out , getting what he could and enjoying it while he still lived . He fought bitterly , desperately , against acceptance of infirmity . Inside he cried continuously . But outwardly he was cheerful . He learned to smile to hide his inner feelings . When the panic came and fear rose like bile from a ruptured bladder , he spread his lips so the dimples showed and widened his senseless eyes . He smoked incessantly to combat the driving irritation of his confinement . He laughed in quick , staccatobursts . He was so brave , they said . " And how 's our cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing the monotonous trays of juices and milk toast . " As ever , " he smiled . Only his mother could kill the smile . Slowly his heart turned against her . Now when she called he hated the sight of the grief that lived in her face ; he was repulsed by her bickering and denouncements . " Mother , will you please-please-please shut up , " he 'd say whenever she launched into a tirade against the hotel . " You 're as much to blame as anyone . " These outbursts cut to her heart . " Mother 's doing the best she can , son , " she 'd plead , tears brimming in her reddened eyes . She had tried to sue the hotel , but the day after the accident the hotel had filed for bankruptcy and declared itself insolvent . She meddled with the hotel employees , seeking those who mightp244testify to the hotel 's solvency . The tiny woman with rouged and powdered face , strange deep-set gray-green eyes glinting behind nose glasses , dressed in the old brown fur coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a familiar sight , incongruousand pathetic , somehow frightening too , at the back entrance where the colored waiters came and went . They knew her as Charles 's mother and greeted her courteously with furtive sidewise glances as they passed . She 'd become such a nuisance that Mr. Small had requested Professor Taylor to keep her away . " You 're just making a fool of yourself , " he charged . She flew into a rage . " You 're just as bad as they are . You 'd see your own son a cripple , broken and penniless for life . " " What you 're doing is n't helping any . Do you think you 're helping him to walk ? " " At least I 'm not just sitting down and letting everyone run over me . " " No , you 're just antagonizing everyone who might help us . " They began shouting at each other . The neighbors came to the windows to listen . One stepped out on the porch , debating whether to interfere . William sat in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen . " Dad ! Mother ! Please . That is n't doing any good . " The sight of him standing there , blind and helpless , his face shadowed in humiliation , quieted them for the time . But she could n't rest . She had to do something . She could n't bear the waiting , the praying , the hoping . She felt compelled to exculpate herself of blame . It was as if she believed that by some self-sacrificial act she could at once , restore her son , free herself of guilt and win him back to her . She called upon the district attorney to prosecute the hotel for negligence . " Do you wish to swear out a warrant , Mrs. Taylor ? " " They 're so full of tricks I do n't know who to charge . It 's your duty , anyway ; it 's not mine . You 're required to prosecute law-breakers . " " Our office has no evidence to act on , Mrs. Taylor . "  |p245She  was enraged . All evening she fumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " she informed her husband . " They 're not trying to get away with anything , " he defended them . " The Industrial Commission takes care of these cases . That 's the law . The hotel is paying the boy his salary . " But even as he said it he felt himself a traitor . Both suffered in their own individual manner . It robbed their efforts of all purpose , turned all the long years of struggle into bitter waste . They had no direction for their anger , no outlet for their hurt ; their emotions turned against themselves . Mrs. Taylor 's long and bitter fight was to save herself as much as anything . She did n't realize this . She thought of herself as doing what a mother should . And yet , in the end , she lost herself . Both lost themselves . She became mean and petty . And although Professor Taylor had been without a teaching post for four long years , he had still felt he belonged . Deep down he had still consideredhimself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside where it counted . He gave up . He lost his will to try . In many ways , the effect on this little black man born in a Georgia cabin , who 'd tried so hard to be someone of consequence in this world , to live a respectable life , rear his children to be good , and teach his backward people , was the greatest tragedy of all . Mrs. Taylor never gave up as he did . But she had to feel the world was turned against her to justify herself . In turn Charles was affected by the change in them . The essence of their defeat was insidiously transmitted to his consciousness . His confidence was shaken . The fact of having parents was no longer reassuring . He became frightened of the world . He dreaded their visits and wished they 'd never come . His mother 's eyes were always red-rimmed and something had happened to her face ; something was missing , some quality that had given it distinction . Two red spots of rouge stood out on her high cheekbones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for what they 've done to you , " she 'd say piteously . " Let it alone ! " he 'd shout . " For God 's sake let it alone ! "  |p246AFTER  SIX WEEKS SLIGHT ARTICULATION HADreturned to his fingers . " Keep kneading them , " his doctor instructed . " Pretty soon we 'll have those splints off and see how it looks . " One morning he discovered he could move his feet . He was afraid to mention it . For two days he kept his secret , wiggling his toes and finally moving his legs . " Look , " he showed the doctor . The doctor was amazed . " Wonderful ! " he exclaimed . He tapped the knees for reflexes . " Wonderful ! Wonderful ! " From then on Charles knew that he would walk again . Several weeks following , the splints were removed . His arm was slightly bent , terribly emaciated ; it was attached to a brown , atrophied hand . On the inside of the forearm , where a bruise had festered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and below the red serrated ridge of the scar where the bones had protruded . At first sight he was frightened , but the doctors seemed well pleased . They gave him cocoa butter for massaging and a ball of putty to knead . He followed their instructions zealously . For long hours while reading , holding the book with his right hand , he kneaded the putty with his left , unthinkingly . The strength came back without his realizing it . One day he looked outside and noticed it was summer . Three months had passed . He decided he would walk . Waiting until the ward was unattended , he threw aside the covers , inched his body to the edge and stood . He was exceedingly weak , his knees buckled and his legs felt numb , half-asleep . The cast cut into his flesh . But his back did not hurt at all . The nurse returned and caught him standing . Her face whitened . " What are you doing out of bed ? " He grinned at her . " I 'm just trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . She flushed with anger.  |p247Hel|p  him , Clyde . Do n't let him fall , " she called to one of the convalescents while she ran for help . Clyde came over and grasped him about the cast . " Steady , boy , steady . " " I was n't going to fall , " he protested , but by then he could barely stand . The nurse returned with the resident doctor , several interns and the orderly . " The army , " Clyde murmured . They lifted him back to bed . He felt a high , lightheaded exhilaration . Laughter bubbled from his lips . " How does the back feel ? " the doctor asked . " It does n't hurt a bit . " Excitement slurred his voice ; his face was flushed and his eyes were bright as fire . His own doctors were incredulous . They ordered X-rays and warned him not to move . But several mornings later they came in grinning . " We 're going to let you walk a bit , Charles . See how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ward and back . They looked at one another . " I fooled you , did n't I ? " Charles laughed . On the third of July , four months to a day , he was discharged . The cast had been removed . He now wore a strong back-brace with two steel bars flanking the spinal column and straps about his shoulders and thighs . His perceptions had sharpened . He felt things more strongly . Situations that had been commonplace were now stark and ugly . He was more easily irritated . His reactions had become hard , abrupt and violent . His world had filled with blacks and whites , harsh purples , vivid greens , blinding yellows . There were no shades , no tints , no grays , no in-betweens . His emotions were either intense or non-existent . He 'd thought how wonderful it would be back in the world of healthy people . But everything seemed strangely different , as if the world had gone out of focus while he 'd been away . He was struck by the atmosphere of animosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became insufferable . Before his accident those bitter family scenes had filled him with anguish . He 'd shared their suffering , longed for their happiness . But now he felt only a harsh rejection , devoid of any tenderness or concern . He did n't care whether they were happy or not . They were alive , and that was enough . Everybody was hurt . William was hurt  --  terribly , irrevocably hurt . He , himself , was hurt . Goddammit , one did n't have to cry and fight about it all the time , he thought . One did n't have to make a goddamned spectacle out of every emotion . It seemed as if he floated in emotion . He wanted to get away from them , so he would n't have to hear them , share in their bitterness and defeat , or even think about it . He still had only partial use of his hand and required his mother 's help in dressing . And the doctors had instructed him to sit for an hour each morning in a tub of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house only to return for dinner . He was self-conscious about the brace and wore a jacket even on the hottest days . It held him abnormally erect . His face was tight from the discomfort and frustration . His posture was mistaken for a sign of arrogance , his expression for disdain and condescension . He shrank from the antipathy in people 's eyes . He avoided going places where he was known . He never went to visit any of his former friends . When he began visiting the dentist he found temporary escape . He was a garrulous old man with a great curiosity concerning Charles 's background . He was fascinated by the stories of the southern Negro colleges . Sometimes they talked for hours . Most afternoons Charles went to the movies , sitting alone in the obscurity of the loges , smoking an endless chain of cigarettes , absorbing the organ music , watching the fantasies unfold on the screen . And for a time he felt safe from the prying eyes . Nothing mattered then but the emotion which engulfed him . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a time the members of his club came to visit . He and Harvard took short walks in the park . Occasionally they went together to a show . But the old intimacy was lost . He found him/self strangely intolerant of the fellows ' social life . He could n't bear to hear about the parties or the girls . There was little for them to talk about . Finally he realized he did n't like the people he had known . They stopped coming . He was relieved . He liked it best alone . He sat alone for hours in the park , half-relaxed , unthinking , just sitting there hidden from the world . There was a high , grassy knoll where no one ever came . He lay there , stretched on the grass , and watched the lake . He never tired of watching the constant ripple of the waves . It soothed him . In the big expanse of water , like the world almost , nothing was permanent but change . Strangely , he liked the thought of that . A wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it rolled its sixfootspan of life , and was gone ; another took its place . Like all the countless people of the world , assuming the various shapes of life and then death . He had always liked the night from the time he 'd first discoveredit . He had liked it then because of the difference in himself and in others too . Now he liked it because it hid him . At night no one could tell that he was infirm ; no one could see the back-brace bulging from his jacket . And he could revel in the various wonders of the night  --  the lighted marquees of the theatres , spilling magic on the flower-gardened people ; the long , amber necklace of the High Level Bridge across the inky Cuyahoga ; railroad trains with their thousand yellow eyes gliding down the dark lakeshore ; moonlight on the great expanse of water like ever-crumbling dreams . He was imbued by that moving , inarticulate awe of beauty given only to the very young . And from it all he had to come back and listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He began walking until late at night , going far from the neighborhoods he had known . He liked to walk among the dwellingsof the rich , past the old mansions hidden deep behind the night-black landscapes . Shaded lamps glowed cheerfully behind wide windows ; here and there someone sat in a cone of light placidly reading , guarded by the shrubs and evergreens  --  sentinels in the outside darkness . From afar they seemed so peaceful , **25;7787;TOOLONG me yet . " He had cost Harry a buck or two , but Harry alwayswaved back . He appreciated the chance for charity . Jake and Morris should get acquainted , those two , he decided . I 'll have to arrange it . They understand each other . Now , in these hours of early evening , there was no time for imaginings . Everyone came to talk with Harry Bowers ; the word travelled down Prospect that Harry was spending an evening on his property . Said Magyar George : " I began life as a brilliant young newspaperman , then I fell down , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never won and never was loved . I am very well educated , however , from Columbia University and other famous extension courses . " " Does n't pay to know things only to sneeze them into the napkin , " Harry said . " I was talking . Very well indeed did I get drunk , however , in those days when I was young . Thank you for listening , Harry . " Said Aunty Fred , his bald head perfumed , his cork-tipped cigaret blooming with menthol , colored pencils the latest thing in his pocket : " I like to please people , Harry . That 's what I live for , ever since the doctors gave me up for dead . My stomach , you know . Did you ever hear the well-known song , **28;7814;TOOLONG , sung by John Charles Thomas ? That 's what I live for , it 's my own little philosophy . Take care of yourself , sleep eight hours , live long . " " Ai n't much , but it 's yours , eh Fred ? Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sleep a little , die only a little . Look at Edison . Even look at Henry Ford , you got to give him credit after all . That way you 're still tight from the day before . It 's all right if it 's the way you like it , Fred . " If a man really liked it , well , then it was all right with Harry . " I love it that way . " He smiled lovingly at Harry , looked like Stanley Bowers , the son of Morris , for have-no-more/hunger food , rubbed his rear in checkered pants , said , " What ? I mean What ? " with the coy hope of the suburban girls who practice the piano an hour a day ( love me ! love me ! ) until the day they are engaged . " Well , goodnight , Harry , lovely to see you , "  --  and he slid by behind a cork tip , and smiling . Hump-backed Ferguson , fired by Bowers because age had made him incompetent and evil-smelling , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grudges but hoping for a change in a mind which moved but seldom changed . Said Ferguson : " Nothing ai n't lost in nature , y ' know . Cremation is right for old ladies . When you get old you get too much admirationin the head , but I know what I am . But these other men you got working for you  --  I ai n't mentioning names  --  they 're too young to be really loyal . They 're probably all hypocrites , every last one of them . No names . Me now , for example  --  I 'm just talking , Mr. Bowers  --  no more drinking and sexing to do , no more card-playing , no more bowling to do , no more nothing . I 'm ready to work any time you say so , Mr. Bowers . Far as I 'm concerned , you could go home to your pleasure right now . I 'm not hinting . I do n't blame you . You 're a healthy man , you want to live . " " That 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I always made as much for you as I could , Mr. Bowers . Now I ca n't get me another job . " " You only worked for me six months . I 'm sorry I had to let you go . But if you need something now , I can let you have  --  " " I was so sick that one time I thought it was my very end , but I stuck on the job . Indeed I did . I never even told you about it . Would five be too much , Mr. Bowers ? " Ferguson went away with his five and , what was more valuable , with his pride unaltered . Harry said , " Here , it 's better than making a living joining out the odds , "  --  that was pimping on Prospect , its word . Harry 's roar carried such conviction that old hump-backed Ferguson , too smelly for such a career ,  |p52nevertheless  felt that living off handouts was more worthy than joining out the odds . A shrewd mad beggar , lurking ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood silently by Harry 's desk behind the counter , knowing that the touch of disgrace was more useful than any pitch . Harry felt that alms disgraced both the giver and the beggar , and he too was patient . They waited in a contest of eyes . Harry won , and the beggar said : " I have boxed the compass by the white man 's grave . " Then Harry knew that he was as mad as his thin calculating face , though perhaps no further off than the others on the mad ward of Prospect . " Who told you to come to me ? Why is it every rummy on Prospect comes to Harry Bowers ? " No answer . The stick figure regarded him softly while the cunning of the face waxed and waned with inner decisions in the moon of evasions , decisions forgotten , then remade . What a beggar needs most is honor for his disgrace . Harry knew this . Harry , who valued only success , for the love in it , made the effort necessary to do honor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a rummy , you 're just in business . You 're a pretty good business man , your kind of business . " No answer . The beggar 's heliotrope hand shivered toward Harry of its own will . In Harry 's stomach a stalk shivered , the thrill of the power to say no to a suppliant . In defiance of yes , a perversion of his proper pleasure in generosity to himself as to all living beings , he waited although he knew himself destined to put pennies in the flowering palms of beggars . He said : " My business is me , not your troubles . What good is helping you out if it ai n't what I need to do ? I do n't mean I do n't wish you the best , the very best , but just tell me how to make it mean something to Harry Bowers and I 'll do it . Answer me that one , please .

Do n't fly right just for me , you can be as nutty as it makes you happy , but give me an answer when you talk to me . I like it straight . It 's better business that way , brother . Talk straight for the Bowers Better Business Bureau . " The beggar watched warily , now knowing that he could wait longer . " All right , " Harry admitted finally , " just say something and that 's all . Why do I always get myself in these boxes ? " His head and his hands jerked upward in an appeal to the pale green plaster walls of the Green Glade Hotel , his own place . " Sing me your pitch , I do n't care "  --  but he wanted to do honor to all men . " I 'll really listen , I mean it . " The palm came up . Harry did honor to it with a dollar bill . The palm came away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor that Harry yet knew . It was that call again : " The Manager ? Goodness , I 'm sorry to trouble you . This is Miss Farren . I 'll be a little late , but you will hold the room for me , wo n't you ? " Harry would . He made a special note of it and of Miss Claire Farren . He grinned , sniffing the ozone and oil off the switchboard , imagining the magic element of ozone just as he imagined now the dizzy smell of female parts , dizzier when on a man 's hand . His heavy solemn face with its heavy solemn grin moved in reprobation . As if to prove that this was his night , Jake staggered in . " What are you doing off duty , Jake ? " Bowers asked . " Night off , boss . "  | " Night to get drunk , eh Jake ? " " Night off , did n't I say ? All nights the same , but this one I 'm buying . " " If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake . Especially since I ai n't your boss even when it 's your night on . No hard feelings about that little trouble , Jake ? I 'd have given you the money , it 's just we got to talking  --  " " Forget it , forget it . That was a week ago . Little Jake does n't keep books . You play your game fast as you like , I 'll play my cards close . Then we 'll see , Mr. Bowers . " " That sounds like a fight , Jake . I thought we were friends . " " We 're friends , all right , but I 'll deal you down someday . Someday you might need me , Harry  --  " Jake was interrupted by Harry 's roar of laughter , then by Harry 's telephone . When he had finished , Jake was leaning on the counter , looking at him in a way which told Harry that Jake was sober , the way a lush gets for moments at a time when the adrenalin pours through his blood near an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is what wars are made of , Mr. Bowers . People like me and our profits . " " Where 'd you buy that kind of bottle , Jake ? " " I ai n't talking about no one in particular . We 're buying what we 're buying , we 're killing ourselves the way we can . We do n't know nothing about where we 're going . You act almost like us , Mr. Bowers , but you know where , you know what-for . I ai n't talking about you , Mr. Bowers . Not specially . " " All right , Jake , you 're talking about me , really me . I do n't know where either . All I know is , yeah , this is what the good and the kicks come from . Personally I go for the kicks , but it 's the good , too . . . That time I got mad , Jake , it was just from talking . Do n't worry about it . " " But what good is the kicks if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits , I mean . I do n't mean you , Mr. Bowers . I forgotp55all about that deal the other week . I do n't hold no grudges , specially against a guy like you . Why , I do n't even know what other week it was . By me you 're one hundred per cent . " " Out of cash , Jake ? " " No , just out , friend . " Harry stroked his thigh , squeezing it , saying : " Ai n't our fault . I did n't say we know what we 're doing . We do like we can , that 's all . If we did n't it 'd be worse . " " Fault , who 's blaming , Mr. Bowers ? " He played the chain of the register-pen through his yellow fingers , counted the beads , thought about this , his soft face tilted to the bulb overhead , and then murmured : " I like to con a mark myself , Mr. Bowers , you know that . What you do is your own business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I always say  --  and if I had a wife I 'd say it to her when we had breakfast , if we ate breakfast , I mean  --  that Harry Bowers , Mr. Bowers there , he 's the finest business man on Prospect . A high type and a regular guy . That 's a joke about the wife , I ai n't joining no broads that way , not me  --  " " What were you saying , Jake ? " Jake showed his teeth . It was part of good con to wander from the subject and then slide back , hand under the skirt , hand under the bean , hand in a pocket or wherever it knew itself to belong . Harry grinned , too . " You were telling me what 's wrong with me , Jake . I know what you think of me . " Jake was dirtying the blotter . He was writing Harry Harry Harry with the chained register-pen . " I really do , " he said , " all the time , Mr. Bowers . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to screw everyone , that 's what we mean by an honest dollar . That 's our game and everyone 's . That 's how we get our profit . We know it , only you know it better , that 's how you 're a big man today . " Again the oil of cunning spoiled his eyes ,  |p56the  childish blue polluted by deep habits . " That 's how you got to be the biggest man on Prospect , Harry . I really mean it . All the boys say you 're a swell fellow , too . " Finally impatient , Harry said , " Stop it . Stop it now , Jake . " He signed the pleasure in these words with his hand and his shrug . " Or slow down , anyway . I 'm no mark for you . Listen , Jake ca n't stop conning the mark  --  nobody can slow down a gash-hound . Your bearings are dirty , your carburetor is full of sludge , there 's no overhauling you . But slow down anyway , friend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  the drunkenness all the way back now . " I really stopped this time , I started something new . Want to hear ? " " Sure I want to hear . No , I do n't want it . Yeah ? Listen Jake , I know you . Do n't get your feelings hurt , I do n't know you better than I know me , Harry Bowers . If I started a tenant 's union , that 'd be new for me , but it would be operating for me the same old way . It would n't take a week , a month , and Klabber would be cut in on the remodeling , too . It 's the way I am about things . I like to remodel . I like to get paid for it . I 'm that way because I like it , that 's my pleasure , that 's why you and me is different as day and night from no-day and no-night . I get the good out of things and I know how to let other people get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all the same . You do n't get no kicks , you live for the con , the small con even , and that 's nobody . That 's nowhere . That 's nothing , it goes past the end . " Jake pulled back his lips again and said , " I guess you think you 're different , Harry . " " I think so , " Bowers admitted . " I ai n't explaining to you , I 'm telling . If I had breakfast on beer and whiskey I 'd get the good out of it I get from Post Toasties , if I really wanted it . " "  --  not a stiff like me , eh ? " " The good out of it , I 'd get . Different kinds of stiffs in thisp57world , Jake . That 's my opinion . So long , Jake , " he said as the man ambled out with his soft sodden sideways gait . What kind of game was that Claire Farren playing with him ? She called again to say that she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Harry Bowers ? You are the manager ? The owner of the hotel ? Pleased to meet you . Thank you very much . A girl like that could be trouble , a different kind of honeyvoicedtrouble from Harry 's brother , Morris , but trouble all the same . Morris had come by with his own sort of troubles for Harry , troubles of pity and weakness , troubles of envy , greed , and **34;7844;TOOLONG . With a gum eraser body and slivers of gray beard on a face like a child 's pouting snout , dirty with anger and eggs , he had the luck of a man who always sits in a train opposite a woman with a dry cough . Blame that on your brother , too , Morris . " I been looking all over for you , Harry , " Morris said . He should have been there to meet Jake . " You was n't by the Turkishbath , you was n't by Kornman 's . So I says to myself , maybe he 's by the hotel . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO WORSHIP A LIVING MAN IN AN AGE WITHOUTkings and gods ? Well , the kings and the gods still exist , but in another way for such courtiers as Morris Bowers . He worshippedhis brother , Harry , saying : " If my brother Harry wants a cock table for his living room , his front room , he buys it not builds it . That 's what Harry thinks . He pays somebody else , that 's how to get rich . " Morris liked to work in his garden and , secretly , to glue together birdhouses from scraps of wood . " You got it wrong , Morris , " Harry replied . " I congratulate you for it , Harry . I think the world of you . That 's all I mean . " " You got it wrong about how it is making money , Morris . " Patiently he explained once more . " You forget about the touch , the smile you got to have for it . You always get it wrong . " Morris shook his head to say No to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto no one else , although he looked like a hairy Harry . Where Harry was fat , shiny , bald , and stripped for action , his muscular jowls working like the essentialtrimmings of a steam engine , Morris , who stood with a similar stockiness in his double-breasted suits , waddled instead , his head messy with sandy grey hair , his beard splotched with a permanent measle , his body loose and soft in habits which strove to mime Harry 's heavy muscular ones . He gazed into Harry 's eyes with the sentimental longing of a pissing dog , trembling , steaming , unsolid on its three legs . " Jesus , Morris , what you want this time ? " Harry asked , warning himself : If you kick a pile of dogstuff , got to expect your feet to smell.  |p59Morris  waited with the sort of slyness which led him , when he wanted to see the front of a train , to wait until it rounded a bend instead of committing himself to poke his head through the window of his car . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft moat of vanity , which led him to write each year to the governor for an automobile license with his initials and age on it . ( The age diminished by three . ) The last time Morris had needed Harry for a little deal-on , a little property , he had hinted at the reason that it was a sure thing . " Do n't laugh , Harry , "  --  the mouth slack with the craft of a man waiting for his stroke . He had coughed with this mouth ; and explained that over-insured for fire increases the danger of fire . " You want to do it ? Please . I beg you . Do it that way if it 's the only way you know how . As much as you want . But I wo n't give you a red cent for it , Morris , not a nickel even . I do n't have it for throwing away on monkey business . " Morris had gazed piteously at him , frightened by refusal as if  --  always refused , even by his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there 's people in the world . There 's nobody . There 's only my brother , Harry , and he do n't like me . But he said for his brother , trying to tell him like a good brother that it was a sure thing but only making his insolence more shrill by the way he did it : " Who could know if I had maybe a fire ? I got my family to think of . A little fire for the insurance company ? " He had thrust his head at Harry with a nose of effrontery , squashed at the base , feather-sharp at the tip with its thousand-legged nostrils . " It 's only like a little idea I had , Harry . I 'm just farting around . " " Why do n't you learn to fart straight ? " Harry knew the pleasure of hearing himself laugh aloud , involuntarily , alone or with Morris , which was the same thing , at his own joke . He did n't need to be deferential before the dollar . Money was nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had added whilep60Morris turned his hat in his fat hands , " That 's not my business , Morris . I like to drive hard , but that 's all . Okay , so think of your family . That fire stuff , night burnings , Forced to Vacate , Penny Sale , and all the stuff like that  --  it ai n't my style . Sorry , Morris . " Now , during this summer evening when the traffic softly honked in the June air outside and the wanderers moved in and out of Harry 's sweet residential hotel , rooms also for transients , Harry Bowers watched his brother still pulling at his hat , sunk in the fat of his palms , sunk in the longing for what he had long ago ruined . Perhaps Harry had helped to ruin it . That was always the question between them . " This time I really got a deal on , " Morris was saying . " The sky 's the limit this time . I got a family to take care of , Harry . Think of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The sky 's always the limit , Morris , it 's just as close to you like to me . My brother Morris , he can cut his toenails while he walks , that 's how careful . He never found more than a dime in the gutter  --  that 's the kind of luck he makes . Better he should help his luck picking pockets , eh Morris ? " " You 're a kidder , Harry . That 's what the family always says , too . I mean Bessie , I mean Bella and Stanley always say it . They do , Harry . I do n't mind . " Bowers talked in the highest seriousness of adult matters with his brother , whose extremities had grown hairy in his middle years , whose skin never seemed clean , whose jowls vibrated with the greed and cunning loose in his character . He wonderedwhy Morris had never made a deal with himself , coming to an understanding of the uses of covetousness . It was the condition of life that the birds built their own nests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lovingly fashioned for them from fancy wood . He only wanted Morris to be happy , as he was , in the Americanp61dream  --  that moral trajectory toward love in power and all things in the dollar . " It was n't my fault about the hot rod supplies , Harry . I could n't help that one . . . . " He needed to know how to know that money is only money , even in America , and how to make his joys rise out of this nice material , come clean as principles , as ideals even , airy and relaxing as a Sunday 's drive to Chippewa Lake . " But I wo n't do that for you , Morris . Not that , not even for you . " Disagreeing , looking sharply at his brother , he suddenly found coming over Morris the grimace of terror and awe which his childish face had showed when he forbid him to be a tagalong . " You got a right to kid me , " Morris - was murmuring . " If it gives you pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry cried , anguished because he always did this to Morris . " What good would it do you ? You ai n't got a mind to mind , you . What do you want now ? " The scruffy head hung in its wilted collar . " Nothing , " Morris said . " Money ? " The head turned away . " No , " Morris said . " How much ? " The fat body shuffled its sloppy hams and sweated in misery . " Just a little to start . " " Start what ? A hundred ? " " I do n't need much to keep my head above water . The kids are almost grown-up , "  --  a squirming agility even in middle-age , saying to Harry , Love me ! love me again ! " A thousand ? Two ? I ai n't got it . It 's all tied up in the Green Glade . The bank got it . What you need it for ? " No answer from Morris . " Do I have to call up Bessie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! " Harry Bowers felt that it would be no good to fight down his exasperation , the impatience which he felt with no other living being but his brother , the desire to hurt which always came with the need to help him . " Stanley could do more good in business than you , he can talk at least . A little practice and even Bernice could do it . What 's the matter , you crazy ? " " You 're right about the family , Harry , " Morris said , " I got to take care of them right . I got responsibilities , Bernice wants a coat . I got things on my mind  --  Stanley should have his own car for a date , not the one I use carrying brooms to the retailers . You know that little concession I got  --  " Through a friend I got it for you , your little concession , Harry was thinking . All you ever got for yourself was pimples , and maybe some broad helped you there , too . Bubbles of pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in time of excitement . Clustered at the temples like ants carrying away sugar . " You do n't realize it like I do , Harry . You never had a nice little family , this one wants a coat , that one wants a car , the wife always nagging for a trip to Florida . You want to go to Florida , you just pick up and go . I got to figure things out . Sometimes it do n't figure for me . You listening to me , Harry ? I 'm telling you it 's tough on us family men , you do n't know what it 's like . " " I said how much , Morris . More'n two thousand ? " Morris softly insisted , playing his angles but captured by them himself . " Remember me , I 'm your only brother with a family . It 's hard to raise a family , you do n't realize . But at least the name of Bowers , it 'll go on after us . I saw to that . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick off ? Who 's going anywheres ? If I ever want a family I 'll have it , Morris , and I 'm as strong as Ip63ever was . What 's the matter , you crazy to talk like that ? Stronger . " " I know , " said Morris . " And what do you do , you 're married ? Drive through the suburbs on a Sunday looking at the houses . That 's a nice one . Hmmm . Look at that one , must of cost a fortune , a Spanish rancho . You plant tulips , they grow up onions . Bessie points her finger to the boys and says , Introduce my daughter Bernice please , the girl who made application to Vassar . Stanley coughs in your face and laughs behind your back , you know it , Morris , I do n't have to tell you . That your nice little American family ? " " I know , " said Morris with a narrow glint of triumph wedgingopen in his washed blue eyes . This meant he was getting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he made Harry angry enough . Harry had a conscience , that one did , Morris 's big brother with the conscience . " Your Stanley plays on the piano , Tea for Two , ' a hightypeall-American boy . Very sophisticated , a fraternity kid . Who paid the piano teacher , Mrs. Huntz , so he should be popular ? " " You did , Harry . " " How much you want now ? No ! I mean no ! I ai n't got money for your deals . " Harry jumped up , breathing hard , fast , his muscular face swollen by hatred , wondering only why Morris did this to him and why he let it be done . He strode back and forth and shouted once : " Your lousy deals ! " and then murmured softly . " Your deals , your stinking crooked deals , your lousy deals .... " Morris waited . This was his best time for patience , and this was the thing he knew best . He let Harry pace out the dimensionsof the office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should therep64have to be such idiots ? " Harry stopped suddenly and put his hand on his brother 's shoulder . It felt over-soft under the brown serge and he pulled it away , but gently now . " Tell me why , Morris . Why does it have to be like this ? Why ? Just ask God . He do n't answer , He only says , Look .... What do you need , Morris ? " Patience in humble grey flesh . This was the weapon hidden in the fatness before Harry Bowers , its double-breasted coat unbuttoned and flowering away down the weakened belly with its swollen guts and broken blue veins . Morris squeezed himself and tried not to breathe and waited . It worked with Bessie , it worked with Bernice and Stanley , but it hurt when it worked with his brother , Harry . " Three thousand ? More ? " At last Morris Bowers said , " I got a little deal on , Harry . I stand to do very good . I stand to fix everything up fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His voice grew hoarse and he hid his mouth in a handkerchief . " I really mean it , Harry , " he said when he looked up . " Think of Bessie , I got Bernice and Stanley to worry about . You ai n't married , you ai n't got troubles . I want to set this little deal up all by myself . I wo n't come around asking for advice this time , I promise , Harry . " " Advice ! Advice is free . " " I wo n't bother you for more money this time , Harry . Just the down payment , and then we 're partners like Bessie and me is partners . Fifty-fifty , Harry . Sixty per cent for you , forty for me . Any way you want , Harry , I know I can trust you . I really need it bad this time , it could be my last chance . I ai n't as strong as I used to be , I ai n't like you . You heard how the doctor says I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could be my old self , Harry . I 'm younger than you , there 's no reason why I should feel like an old man . Of course I got a family to worry about . You do n't have no family . Harry !  |p65You  can trust me , you know that . You know I 'm your brother . The other times was n't my fault . I never had the breaks . You got all the breaks in the family . " " I made my breaks , Morris . " " Remember how you used to tell me the carp 's head is the best part , the smartest part , back in the old country ? I was just a kid . I believed you because you were my big brother . You remember that 's what you told me . . . . " He paused while Harry strode away . He went on when Harry sat down again at the desk , the muscles laboring in his hard shiny jaw , but silent and listening now . His listening with such patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow angry . " You listening to me , Harry ? I 'm explaining . " " So explain . " " Just trust me one more time , Harry , this time I promise . I really promise . I wo n't bother you for nothing . Just you 'll get the payments on your investment . I 'll set up the corporation . I wo n't ever call you up even , say : How should I do this ? Like the other times , say : What should I do now ? I wo n't let you worry about a thing , Harry . I 'm giving you a brother 's word . " Harry was thinking : A brother should know I like to do things with my own head , my own hands . This brother do n't know from nothing . Aah , poor Morris , the poor ones are all alike , on or off Prospect . " You listening , Harry ? I do n't think you 're listening to me . Harry ? " " Listening . " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head . I 'll set it up . Morris Bowers , President , because it 's my own little idea and I 'm doing the managing , and I do n't even want to tell you what it is so 's I can do it by myself and surprise you , but you be vice-president , Harry Bowers , and treasurer , Harry Bowers . Want to be secretary too , Harry ? I 'll let you . Please , Harry , just listen to me . You can stillp66chase around , pick up a girl here , a nice little girl there in your convertible , you 're healthy and they like you . I got a family to consider . " Bowers lifted his hand to yell , " What , you crazy ? What does that have to do with anything ? "  --  but let it fall without speaking . " Listen to me . I 'm just talking , but I mean it , Harry . It could be the real thing this time . It 's my last chance , Harry . Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids and I was just a baby and you were my brother , Harry  --  " And suddenly his voice broke and this time he did not simply cough into his handkerchief and the pale grey flesh of Morris Bowers twitched and his face collapsed in the debris of hatred and he smashed his hand on Harry 's desk , screaming this time , screaming in his shrill sick voice : " Oh God damn you , Harry . You ca n't just forget me like you want to . God damn you to hell if you do . " Harry shrugged and waved his hand at a fly frightened and buzzing between them . " Okay , " he said , " I 'll do it this time . You got your corporation , but remember  --  this is the last time , the last of the last , no matter what . " And Bowers was thinking : Funny , how we never get mad at the same time . Always like that . Other kids at least knew how to fight it out , other brothers someplace , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bessie I said okay . She do n't have to worry . Tell her to stop aggravating . " " Harry ! " Morris squeezed the tears out of his puffy blue eyes , those eyes like the washed blue of Jake , like the absent sky high above the buildings of Prospect , and he nursed one soft hand in the other . " Oh , I hurt my hand , Harry . I 'm afraid I really hurt it . Do you think it 's all right ? I bet you could break a bone like that . I bet you did n't think I could get mad like that , Harry . It 's the Bowers temper . I got some of it , too , Harry . "  |p67Good  thing you only hit my mahogany , Bowers thought . I do n't mind how you hit it , just so it makes you happy . That 's why I got a good mahogany desk for , people can hit it and be happy , for my feet , too . " Okay , Morris , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My poor hand , Harry . I ai n't kidding about how it hurts . I must of really got mad at you , "  --  already this existed in memory , a sentimental thought to be confided to his elder brother . " Do n't worry , I said do n't worry about it , Moishe . If my desk can take it , so can your bones  --  my real mahogany , I mean . You maybe got Bowers bones in you someplace . " " Harry , I wanted to tell you about  --  Harry , I wanted to show you something here  --  see how it is , Harry  --  Harry  --  " He hurried and stammered to say : Trust me , I 'm grateful , I 'm yours and thanks . " I just want you to know  --  I 'm money-poor , whatever you think , Morris . It 's all tied up in this Green Glade . I bought it for wartime prices . " " Harry ! " Bowers turned away from him , suddenly very tired , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , slipping off as his brother talked . He picked up a tin letter opener , fiddled with it , a " souvenir gift " from Keener Coal . " All right , all right , meet me at the bank tomorrow , two o'clock sharp . You can tell me all about it then . I do n't want to hear now . The First Guardian Trust , two o'clock . " All this had happened fast , very fast , because Harry and Morris knew each other and the cues had been rehearsed for almost fifty years . Claire Farren , when she appeared at the desk , was not so late as she had predicted . Before Morris would be put off , he said  --  and he insisted on this as he eyed the woman walking toward his brother , his big brother Harry who had a shiny bald head and a hard bodyp68which lounged with its fat in a chair and moved with a bounce that spoke ownership of the Green Glade and of anything else he chose to own  --  " Bessie will love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his big Uncle Harry . " He uttered these promises because they were the ones of which his brother had no need . His eyes blinked at Claire Farren as he talked . " Bernice will give you a great big hug for it , Harry . I 'm doing it for them , Harry , not for me . " " Morris ! Do it for yourself ! At least do it for Morris Bowers and be happy ! " Two o'clock sharp at the First Guardian Trust , and do n't forget it.  |p69CLAIRE  FARREN WAS WALKING IN WITH EACH LITHE STEPdone up by high heels in a practiced click . She was a girl who meant to stay . The instant he saw her , he knew that she went with her voice , a stick of honey , smooth as all that . The imprisonedswelling at her breast moved secretly against her walk , was content for the moment to do nothing but deepen the fragrance she carried with her . She clicked and clacked ; her light tight breasts were secure from business in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Claire Farren meant trouble for him . His first thought shone out as a smile with teeth because he saw that he had a new trouble , although for once he did not predict the whole kind of trouble . She got an organization behind her . Course , that ai n't a bad organization in front of her , neither . Tall and slender and legs that knew they were nice and serious clever black eyes that knew they were not nice . She was well-organized . She was a Negro . " Are you the manager , a Mr. Bowers ? My name is Miss Farren . You gave me a reservation by telephone , "  --  smooth as clear comb honey , but they probably had a tape recorder at the phone when he spoke with her , three times it was , and confirmedeach time . He had it at his lips to flash the gold tooth , that pride which proved his worth in pay out of his own sweat , and to say : " I ai n't no Eff Ee Pee See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate . Now listen here to me , you 're too nice a looker to want to dust off my property values like this . What for and why ? I never done nothing to you . "  |p70Instead  he said : " Sure thing , Miss Farren . " And shuffled the cards : " Now let 's see , Room 317 . The finest in the house , with bath , three-fifty a night . " Amazed , he tilted his head to his own voice . He had not even charged up the room . The pleasure he always took in surprising himself brought out the gold tooth after all . He handed her the pen and opened the register . " You want to see it ? " " No , I 'm sure it 's satisfactory , thank you , "  --  her dark eyes wide and serious with a hidden laugh in them . The laughter was well hidden under the lashes and the liquid , the frightened cunning of these wide black eyes which had been bred away from trust . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a policy about " colored trade .

To be supple is the great thing , supple lawyers and accountants for the tax laws , supple desk clerks and managers for the " problem . " They had discovered that the famous Negroes , the musicians , dancers , and ball players , travelling in groups , enhancedthe allure of a cosmopolitan lobby and could actually prove an asset in the trade . Cocktail lounges ( a One World Room , a Town View Room ) grew crowded about them ; dining rooms grew respectfully hushed . Of course , you charge them heavy , but that 's business . The trade will bear it , and anyway , they 'll only throw it away on drink or sharp clothes if you do n't get it . You know their kind , fast-living types .

You do n't need to go to Cornell for a degree in beddy-bye engineering to see how it works . Your size is your protection , son , and nothing can hurt you . Now , in a quiet residential place like your Green Glade , now take your Green Glade property for example , it 's another matter . Let 's face it . Even in good times you 're on the edge . One colored , and half your permanent guests will be gone and burning the first day , and without waiting to find another room . The rest , okay , they wait till they get a place . You lose about one hundred per cent , more or less . That 's the theory , anyway , but when you work on a fifteen percent margin you ca n't afford to lose even twenty , even eighteen . If you take a chance you find the bank stepping in month after next or the month after that . Listen , suppose you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are their friends going to think if they come to visit ? They learn . Remember , take one in and you got a lobby full .

So you got a few smart college kids , maybe , they do n't care what the family thinks . You think you can live off them ? The first time they bring a girl to the room and she catches a look at the other boarders and backs out  --  away they go . I do n't care ifp72they keep a complete file of The New Republic . There 's one thing always comes first in the hotel business , first after a dollar , I mean , and that 's the play on those bedsprings . If there 's no play there , then the President of the FEPC himself is gon na move out on you . Look , I know you 're one of them independent operators , Harry . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idealist . I just mean you make your own rules , that 's all , Harry . That 's not an idealist . Take it easy . I 'm just giving you like some fraternal advice . I worked with this problem here , and I do n't like to see anyone get stung . We 're all members of the Association , ai n't we ? It 's our bounden duty to help out a brother , sort of . Okay , okay , do n't get hot . Then what about your neighbors ? Marrin 's Marine Restaurantdown the street , what about him ? He got everything tied up in that business . You know his wife and kids . She 's a sweet kid , that wife of his , too . What about Anthony 's DrivUr-Caracross the street ? And do n't forget , Anthony has connectionsat City Hall . No sense running down his neighborhood , is there , Harry ? Gil Leary  --  I do n't have to say about him . All right , suppose you dropped your marbles and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you really own your place , Harry ? I mean , of course you do , but what about the bank ? That bank holds mortgages on all us guys . How are they going to feel ? Think of your dear good friend , the bank . Do n't forget T. O. Handlin , vice-president , who rose from cashier and has the dollar bill framed over his desk to prove it . You been a success too , Harry , but only so far . Success stops cold when it stops , listen to me now , and that pretty little yaller gal can freeze it stiff for you . Dead-stiff , and into the street to take orders from some other guy who 's been smart enough to stay smart , think smart , be smart .

Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way . " " Just fine and dandy . Only the bank can hurt me . Go hurt the bank , Miss . You want to know something ? I think you just did . The bank has tender feelings . " Her long Indian-boned face coming to a pout made a mark of punctuation which , at the end of his sentence , said : I see . It was a mouth for both regret and determination . This downwardsglance , and then the bright dart of her eyes , stopped him . " Not that it makes any difference , " he said . " I see , " she murmured , looking straight at him . It was a shameless seeing . " It 's just the way things are . We hope that maybe some  --  " " We ? " It was easy to smile on this word . " Yes , we do . We hope that some of your people wo n't object to my stopping here . We 're hoping to show them something by this , Mr. Bowers . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate your difficulties , but we believe it 's worth doing . Of course , it 's an organization . There 's a question of law involved .

" I do n't mean just you , of course  --  " " I see , " he said , joshing her without her knowing it . We 're all seeing , he thought , and it 's black as that Tasty Shop coffee between us . " I guess you could say  --  I mean if you wanted to , Mr. Bowers  --  that we 're proving something by this . Please understandagain . We do n't have anything against you . " " Nothing , just a barrel at my head . " " Mr. Bowers , "  --  reproachful . " Nothing personal , Miss Farren. "  | " You seem to smile when you say that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skill in tan gabardine , in a lulling voice , in this job of hers . " But then you talk . " " I grew up  --  that 's all right , Miss Farren  --  with a gun at my head . You would n't know about that . You did n't put it there , did you , you and your organization ? I do n't mind . It 's kind of a reminder , anyway . " She studied him to decide if he were joking or not . I 'm a kidder , I am . She could not decide , and took what could almost have been a dance step to put other words between them . " Mr. Bowers , there is a book I could lend you  --  " " I do n't want to read a book . I read a book already . I 'll wait till they make the movie . " " It will show you how  --  " " I do n't have to be shown , me , or demonstrated either . I show myself things all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stay . Remain . I do n't care . Park yourself . I do n't care . Just do n't cook on the dresser . You want an outside room ? All right , an outside room . By the week , I do n't care . It 's only money . I thought I had it figured out , but I ai n't got it figured out yet . Why should I worry ? Then stay and be happy . You probably know more about it than I do . Is the bank going to give me a knock ? I do n't care . Stay  --  " " Maybe , " she interrupted softly , " you 're angrier than you think . Why are you talking so nice then , if you 're mad ? " " Just stay , that 's all you need to know . I like to talk nice to people . What 's it to you about my nice little hotel with its nice little mortgage ? " " Mr. Bowers , I 'm sorry . " " What for ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I said to stay , did n't I ? I meant it . I 'm saying it now . Bowers says stay , he means to stay . " " Whatever your reasons for it , I appreciate that , Mr. Bowers.  |p75It  makes things more acceptable all the way around , and especially since we have n't anything against you personally  --  " She smiled now in her turn . " Except that gun , of course . " And she saw that he paid no mind to the people passing by the desk and eyeing their slow discourse . " We  --  I appreciate it . . . . I appreciate you . . . . " " Nothing at all , nothing at all . " He considered this and agreed with himself . " Nothing at all . I 'm a free man in America . I can be irresponsible for a change . " " An odd notion of responsibility , Mr. Bowers . " " Yeah ? Mind if I put it straight to you ? " She nodded . " Fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored , excuse me  --  " " That 's all right . " " What ? " " It does n't make any difference . " " Which ? " " Either . We 're colored , we 're Negroes . " " What good  --  " and he sighed , heartened because this was someone with whom he could talk without words getting in the way  --  " what good does it do you if you drive me out of business ? " " No good at all , or not enough . That is n't the idea . There 's no reason for you to be driven out . You 're an intelligent man , Mr. Bowers . You can make as much money from me as from anyone else . I 'm as good as they are , and so 's my money  --  " " Better , " he said thoughtfully . " I got me a bunch of streetwalkingladies for my soft heart here . I got me a collection of small-time call girls when they got kicked out of the Stat for non-payment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light tan gabardine suit . " A Negro streetwalker pays her rent the same as anyone else . " " Jeez , what makes you think I said anything ? You andp76Morris with the insults . I did n't mean to insult you , Miss  --  Miss  --  " " Farren . " " Miss Farren . I remembered , I even wrote it down on my memo pad . I suppose I could play it for quick cash , like you say . You want to be manager maybe ? "  --  his memo pad said in green print : The GREEN GLADE , " One of Our Finest , " Harry Bowers , Prop . " I was n't being sarcastic , Mr. Bowers . " " Yeah , yeah , take it easy , laugh a little . I did n't mean nothing , but this time I ai n't apologizing . Jesus ! " He was fiddling with his paper , twiddling , deeply annoyed and angry with himself for this annoyance . Why fool with her ? Why fool with this ? He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these crazy tricks on himself . Always , before this , his investments had been the crazy tricks , and his quirky way of spending the crazy joke on himself , but now this was neither investing nor spending . This was a new joke . Nothing to do with Morris or Jake or the other rummies . He was stepping in a new store , a travelling store , and he did n't know where it was going or what it was selling . What he did know was this : that Bowers had been king on Prospect , and if they told him that it was not his domain , he would invent a way for himself to show them up wrong once more . The Green Glade was his own place , his crown . If Leary or Handlinor some other tool tried to tell him not to give a room to this organization girl , this Claire Farren  --  yes , this sweet little dark piece  --  he would ask them please to go screw in a pillow . You too , Gil ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the blood of high feeling which business meant for him : if money is the prize , then he wants money . He had got it . Afterwards he could throw it away in Miami , at the seashore , on Morris  --  and why not ? He had done all right . He had proved he could.  |p77But  if money meant the admission of limits to his honor , his art , his domain for invention , all those fine moments which were the glory of the waking day for Harry Bowers , then -- -gladly !  --  he would give up the cash . Straight off ! He slept by those things , too . He ate and drank and saw his little friend in Miami by them . He was Harry Bowers and the king of Prospect and he made up his own mind in his own way . Sure , if not that , then what else ? Being Bowers was enough for him . He would take his Green Glade where he went . Yes , he would even quote his lowest weekly rates to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , by God . She had been standing there and smiling at him while he felt his shifting , heard his inner footfalls , guessed at that parabolic Bowers orbit . He could n't say no to a human being who stood at his counter and said , See it from my side , please , Mr. Bowers . " What ? " " I did n't say anything , Mr. Bowers . I was waiting for you . " " Yeah ? Like I say , I do n't give a damn , I mean a care . Pardon me , Miss . I do n't owe nothing to nobody except the bank . Except that gun . It owns everything . I can afford not to have responsibilities . So I lose everything . That 's all right . That 's not what I 'm fighting for . I 'm not blaming you , Miss Farren , I was always that way . Look , you just tell me if the water ai n't hot enough or anything .... " " I appreciate  --  " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , ai n't it ? It 's my hotel , ai n't it ?  --  and the bank 's . " " We are grateful for your cooperation . " " Can that , can it quick . Been learning speeches lately ? " She smiled . That was nice of her . " Who are the rest of you , the appreciators ? " " We  --  well , I 'm acting for us . You know that . " " So we should all have a drink together some afternoon.  |p78Be  kind of crowded , though . The-rest-of-you hiding behind that nice Miss Farren 's skirts , the bank peeking in the pockets of Harry Bowers to feel when they 're empty . " She had opened her purse and was looking at herself in the mirror , just like other women . " What did you mean when you said "  --  touching her lipstick  --  " when you said , That 's not what I 'm working for ? " " I said that ? " he asked . " Fighting for , you said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pretty girl with high firm breasts out of the question under her jacket , just for that reason what he said to her now should have nothing to do with the way he wanted to look at her . Just for that reason . He spoke to her slowly and very carefully . " It ai n't the same thing , Miss Farren . That 's more like it , more what I like . Listen , I mean I already made money , and spent it , too . That 's because money ai n't what I care about . I know I can do that . I got other deals in mind . No , I wo n't say in mind , but there are some . There got to be . Listen , I do n't mind telling you , I ai n't an old man yet . I done only one thing  --  sure , I done it pretty well  --  but I 'm ready for lots of things . I 'm just a Harry Bowers looking . " " Looking ? " " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter with you ? " It was more and more difficult to hand her the judicious Harry Bowers line . " You got a room like you 're supposed to , what else you want from me ? Eating my heart out ? Sure , you got an organization there behind you , it ai n't my way . No . Of course "  --  and he winked  --  " of course certain kinds of organizations are all right , too . No offense meant , Miss . " Before she went up to bed , past the stares and the curiosity which were her business and for which she was prepared , she wanted to ask a question not included in her professionalp79scheme : " But why are you taking this risk of all that you have worked for ? " And he wanted her to ask it so that he could reply , him , the knowledgeable Harry Bowers : " I do n't know . " He would have said more than that . " How do you know what I been working for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and your organization , Miss Farren . Maybe just because I like it . "  |p80KNUCKLES  HARD , BOWERS RAPPED THE BRONZE NIGHT-DEPOSITslide of the First Guardian Trust at the corner of Prospect and East 26th Street , found it still gleaming as good as gold , paused at the Roman portico which led to 21/2% interest on savings and an Eversharp pencil if you opened an account now , snapped his fingers in a gesture of recall good only for the eyes of others , and went in . " Good morning , Mr. Bowers , " said Tim , the guard at this door ever since Bowers had arrived on the street , two boarding houses and a hotel ago . " And the kids , Tim , how are they ? " " Fine , fine , got eight of ' em now , my oldest got the biggest paper route on the West Side . Why do n't you get married and have yourself some kids , Mr. Bowers ? " " Ca n't afford it , Tim . Your boys already got the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great joke , the one in livery touched his holster . Bowers went in , displeased because this was such a nice job for old Tim . He was n't so old . Bowers did n't like to see that a pistol-and-salute job was right for anyone . Well , maybe he liked this kind of work . He could stand backed up all day against his cops-and-robbers dreams , and come to retirement still waiting to use that weapon . A good safe job , Bowers decided . The worst that could happen , he 'd be shot up by some bandits . They 'd never foreclose , reassess his property , or up the loan rates on him . With a deferent snappiness the teller clanged down his cage before a woman waiting for her Eversharp . He escorted Bowers into the office of T. O. Handlin , vice-president of the Firstp81Guardian , manager of this branch and Bowers ' special friend . Such deification did not separate Handlin from the world , that is , from the First Guardian office on Prospect . T.O . was proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time he caught a teller slipping twenty dollar bills into her shoes and limping out like an exhausted athlete . Now the partitions of his office were of glass  --  frosted glass , of course , so as not to disturb him in his reveries over loan , mortgage , escrow , and the mortuary rate of his superiors  --  but he could nevertheless study the jerkings in silhouette of employees and suppliants . Watching , he would touch the corner of his mouth to gather a bit of saliva and then bring the finger to moisten the rims of his eyes . A small dry man with calcified ears and a tufted nose , his sinuses pitiable from bank heat and his relation to others dried by financial emotions , he had learned to hold the lower part of his face in the malicious smile of a trapeze artist , a minor tax official , or a businessman who is obliged by his trade to kitchy-koo his clients ' children . He stood up to greet Bowers . An impeccable smile served to judge the schemes of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the desk with the heartiness he found appropriate to this man . " What can I do you for ? " ( The smile turned genuine in appreciation of his ability to deal with people . He had known Bowers for fifteen years . ) " Well , I 'll tell you , T.O. , I 'm a little pressed this week . Roofing repairs , loading up coal for the winter , you know how it is . " T.O . nodded to show that indeed he knew how it was . " I 'm playing my cards close with the Green Glade , T.O . You know that . " " Yes ? You always complain , Harry . I bet you 're still paying on that vacation to Miami , am I wrong ? Understand you had yourself a time . That 's from unimpeachable sources , what they call . " " Fact , " Bowers admitted . " You guessed it . Miami Beach ,  |p81the  Beach it was . I worked hard at enjoying myself , always have . Costs more to spend money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little saying on the desk ? You want an extension , Harry ? " " On the nose , T.O . " " Sure , sure , you know your credit 's good with us , good as gold  --  " " Good as gold certificates , eh T.O. ? " " Say , Harry , why do n't you ever drop by sometime when you 're not wanting something ? Just to talk . " This was the tuning pitch to the chant of farewell . " Say , listen , after fifteen years , "  --  last year it had been fourteen , and before that thirteen . He kept a good score , Bowers thought . Pays to have a Remind-U pad . Handlin was getting ready to put his hand on Bowers ' shoulder . " Listen , after fifteen years , we should have a real social visit . The wife always asks about you and says , Tom , ( that 's what she calls me ) , Tommy , why do n't you bring him home to dinner ? Come on out to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get much chance at home-cooked chicken , do you ? Though I bet you get your chicken someplace . " He chuckled and squeezed his nose to indicate that even a man in his position was not too important for pleasure . " Should n't lose the chance to make a friend of your banker , Harry . " " Thanks , T.O. , you do that . You ask me that again and I 'll be glad to come . First chance I get . " They had gone through this ritual for ten , maybe twelve years , and Mrs. Handlin was still plucking and seasoning the same abstract fowl . " But I 'm tied up in something right now . " T.O . Handlin chuckled and squeezed his nose , his face buzzing and sniffing and ticking until finally Bowers returned to the point : " It 's okay about the payment , eh ? My brother figures to borrow from me again . A week late , say ? " " Sure thing , Harry . You know me . You know me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our money . " He put his hand on T. O. Handlin 's and the First Guardian 's heart . " Your brother , Mr. Morris Bowers ? " " Yeah , the same thing again . " " Well , it 's your business , Harry . All we do is supply the money . As long as you 're good for your brother , he 's good with us . Sometimes I wonder , between friends I mean , but .. . Well . " " I know what you mean . I wonder about Morris myself . " " He 's certainly not Harry , that 's for sure . You 're one we can build to the future on . To the limit . " T.O . walked him to the door . " Nice we do n't have to worry about each other , " Bowers said . " I bet there 's lots of headaches in this business . I ask you and you always give it to me . " " That 's the way we like to do business , " T.O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're one in a million like you . " As long as you offer security , Handlin was thinking . As far as I could throw you , that 's how far I could trust you if I really needed you , Bowers was thinking . But you 're my pal for the buck , like everyone else . Like I 'm your bosom buddy and can miss the payment , so long as I got a buck in my bosom and the title to the Green Glade . " Come see me , Harry ! " " Will do ! " " I wanted to surprise you , but I 'll tell you how , " Morris Bowers was saying . " No , no , I do n't want to hear , let it do you good . You said already , so go on , surprise me . Do good , Morris . " Morris was shy and full of bliss . " I 'm glad you got faith in me , Harry . It feels nice . " " Faith . " Harry sprawled in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little it costs just to wishp84a brother well . He made a face for how much it was costing him . " I 'll be careful this time , really careful with the nickels , " Morris said . " I 'm not a dummy no more , Harry , I learned already . " In his youth he had had a runny soul , now hardboiled . " I 'm gon na be real tough on everybody , I 'm gon na crack down , that way I 'll pay you back quicker , Harry . I 'm gon na do it this time . " " Doggy dog , eh ? " " That 's right , Harry , doggy dog , "  --  his philosophy , pronouncedfast and trickily , dog eat dog . But Morris still , when he travelled , tied his keys on his inner coat pocket ; he was that innocent a doggy . Harry made the happy lippy lopsided grin he had learned by study , years ago , until now it was the natural way to show off his gold tooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh Morris ? " " That 's right , Harry , you said it that time . " " Aah , I do n't believe it . Good luck to you anyway , Morris , "  --  his bald head in a mock bow , the light gleaming off it . " The luck in the world . " Morris squeaked in protest , as if his throat and his brains needed oiling . He walked back and forth , threatening his own defeat . " Harry , do n't , do n't , do n't talk like that . It makes it hard on me . You know it only aggravates me . Believe me when I say this time I 'm telling the truth . I really am , I mean it , Harry . I 'm gon na do all right this time , Harry . You 're gon na get compound interest . " " That 's all right , do n't worry about it . I did n't mean nothing , just a habit . " " Compound interest compounded semi-annually . I 'll send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to you and show you . Just like this : Harry , here 's my check with the interest . Count and see if it 's all there . . . . You were just kidding , Harry ? "  | " That 's right , kidding . " " Oh , you 're a kidder , you are , Harry . What a sense a youmer . " The gold gleam diminished into the dark of Bowers ' mouth . " So how 's Bessie and the kids ? " " Fine ! Fine ! Come and see us now that , now that . . . " He meant now that their business was finished , but he meant also that he wanted his big brother , Harry , to come to the house . That he had received money from him meant that they were friends and brothers , did n't it ? You do n't give money to a brother you do n't like . You do n't give money to that big lummox , your brother , Morris , unless you like him a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game maybe . " Come on , aw , come on a little , you ai n't seen the family in I do n't know how long . Do you good to take a seat . Break the crease in the pants . Want to play gin ? Come on , play me some gin , Harry . " " You know I always beat you . " " Not always , Harry , "  --  one corner of his mouth drooping reproachfully , like the downwards folding of a mouth after a stroke , the same corner that , for Harry , lifted over the gold tooth . " Sure , Harry , I know , most of the time , but not always . I remember two or three times . " " What 's Bessie making for dinner ? " " Chicken , maybe chicken . Well , it might be chicken , Harry . I know you like chicken . I remember those things . Want I should telephone ? " " No , never mind , I 'll come for dinner . Why not see Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Green Glade . I think maybe we got a little trouble . " " Bessie 'll be tickled  --  wait till you see her . I bet she talks about you every day . That 's wonderful . Tickled pink to see you . You do n't come often like you  --  " " I never came much . " " Yeah , I know , Harry , you never came much , you alwaysp86had lots of business , but now you do n't even come sometimes . You know what I mean . " " I hope somebody does . Just do n't lose that check in gin at the Y. ' I do n't mortgage myself for a coupla gin rummy sharks in the Business Men 's Club . " " That 's all right , Harry , I 'm gon na give it to you with compound interest . I 'm on to myself this time , Harry , I 'm gon na do good . You 'll see . I caught on to myself this time . " Harry Bowers in all this remained surly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his good-money-afterbadkid brother , Morris . Morris knew . He understood one importantfact about Harry , that his deepest surliness arose from love and duty , and in this knowledge Morris flitted and flirted without regard for words or silence . He panted now with the exertion of his bouncings and squeakings in a soft plump body , dowdy in crumbs and the need for dry cleaning . I ai n't no Eff Fe Pee See , Harry was thinking . That Claire Farren was on his mind , but his brother had always been on his mind . Their lives had been like that , and he had met their appointment on time . He was willing to give Morris pleasure with his money . He was willing to try to eat Bessie 's greasy food and smile and be the big one in the family while his stomach turned with the thought : That Claire Farren and her organization . " Do n't talk too much , " he was saying to Morris . " There 's too many dummies in the world already . I ai n't saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just see what he got and count fast and good . Aah , you should know already , Morris . . . . Never mind about Bessie , I 'll eat what she got . I ai n't that special . " Money for Morris , money for interest , money for capital , money for everyone . Money for the bank , in and out . To lend Morris money meant simply that Harry sank up to his neck in the bank 's paperwork . One more inch and he would have top87keep his mouth shut in order to breathe . Yet , without explaining it to a brother who thought him rich , he gave him what he needed . By God , I am rich , he thought . I could be . If only Morris would n't keep blaming his failure on fate and the chain stores . " It ai n't my fault , Harry . I mean about the hot rod supplies . They had me there . I could n't do nothing . " If money was a happy pal to Harry , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fault of his surliness . He could have pulled thirty cents to the dollar out of those hot rod supplies , Western Auto or not . Morris and the dollar were faulty lovers . " Bessie and Bernice always ask about you , " Morris said , " also Stanley . Why do n't you , Harry ? " All right , after the bank , and before going back to the Green Glade to see what Claire Farren was up to next , Harry would visit his brother 's family . Why not ? " I 'll just call her up and tell her , yeah , you 're coming , Harry . It 's the polite thing to do . Maybe she 'll whip up something special . You drive ? Sure thing , I 'm sorry , you always drive . Sometimes I take the bus , the streetcar . This traffic gets me down , I travel in the rush hour . " Easy despite the busy fret of his brother 's talk , Harry slid behind the wheel . Ah , this was it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buick , but no money could give him more than the pleasure he took in it . The traffic flowed by , going their way , going the other way , swirling down the drain and spurting out the spigot . " A cold shower is good for the teeth , " Harry used to explain to his brother . " You open the mouth , the gums , and the ice water hits , see . . . . Blood to the tissues . Scientific fact . " What made him think of this ? The grease on his neck could be bottled for hair straightener . What made him think of hair straightener ? That Claire Farren did n't need it . What did she need ? Harry Bowers . Did he need her ?  |p88He  did n't need anything . Money and Harry and cold showers for the teeth were enough for Harry . That Morris , he talks . Brother of mine . " Brother of mine , " he was even saying aloud . " What ? " Morris was talking because afraid of space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid of his wife , of his children , of his brother . He was afraid of his responsibilitiesand afraid to be quits with them . He enjoyed his shivers ; they were what he had . Listen to him . " Harry ! Street exhibit today , what they call it . I saw this street exhibit . A trailer today . JAIL AND ELECTRIC CHAIR . EVERYBODY WELCOME . Special attraction , kamikazeboots . You see how it is , Harry , like I told you one time , everything comes from mental pictures . Afterwards there 's this here doc , this doctor , he says , Depressions is caused by bad mental pictures , folks , harmful ones . ' That 's true , Harry . He meant it . I heard him myself . You got to have a mental picture of Prosperity . That 's how I 'm sure I 'll pay you back . " That Claire Farren and her high firm flesh . " One thing , it 's good business . Other thing , I got a good mental picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heights , in the new Heights , you know what I mean . That new development out Warrensville . I figured something out from that doc , that quack , I know you 're laughing . Okay , laugh , go ahead . Hunch , female intuition , an extra brain like you got , Harry  --  who could n't use an extra brain ? Do your thinking for you . Turn your enemies into friends . Save your money while you just lie back and snooze  --  " " Good Christ , Morris , you sound like a nigger in one of them watermelon patches they call them  --  " " Watch out for the red light , Harry . I did n't mean to give you advice , but it was changing on the yellow . This is a busy corner . You 've gone far , Harry , furthest in our family , prettyp89far considering everything in Cleveland the days you got started down there on Central  --  this is a piece of my advice about mental pictures , Harry  --  " Having risen fast to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recalcitrant , Harry Bowers tried to listen to his brother while Claire Farren moved cosmetics he could not imagine on her table top at the Green Glade . Women were unimaginable . The future was only guessable . His brother , Morris , could not exist except in mental pictures . In his mental pictures Milt Widder 's column was whispering to him : " Harry Bowers ( the batch in real estate , the small hotel wizard ) has a certain person on his mind these days . What 's this about cupid at last for Harry Bowers ? He 's the genial prop of the Green Glade down on Prospect . " " Jesus ! " Bowers said . " Harry , jeez , you almost missed that truck . " " You mean hit it . Yah . Too many mental pictures , eh Morris ? Listen , Morris , I 'm going to put you in a cab . I got to get back to the hotel . I 'll owe you the cab money . Listen , say I 'm sorry to Bessie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Harry , but you said  --  I remember you said it , and Bessie  --  " " I got something on my mind . You got what you wanted , Morris , now get out . Get . " It was an order . " I 'll call you tomorrow . No , call me . I 'm sorry , Morris . Get out careful now . Yah . You call me , I mean it . I mean it about sorry . You tell the family . We 'll talk things over about that deal . I 'll be a kind of talky silent partner . You want to do it all by your lonesome ? You do n't want me to know ? Okay . Listen , why not ? Okay , step now , so long . Say sorry to Bessie . " When his brother wheeled the big car around , Morris , standing in amazement , had to jump his sagging bullfrog body to miss the bumper . He looked after Bowers , wondering what could be eating him . Bessie 's gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm insulted , too . I really am . She probably got the table set already , and now she 'll be mad at me . And he shook his head solemnly , because even that doe , that professional high-type quack , could n't figure out his brother : Mental Pictures do n't help me none with Harry.  | " HIYA , HARRY ! " He was among friends again . No more mental pictures . The group near his desk , however , made him think the word delegation . They moved away into the lobby as he approached , all but Miss Leah Russell , hair dresser . " Mr. Bowers , " she asked sweetly , " I understand you had a Spanish lady staying in here last night , "  --  a sly and gleeful frown cracking her pancake makeup . " Spanish ? I 'll look in the register . " Bowers ran one thick finger down the list of names . " No , I do n't see none . Unless . There 's a Mr. Cerino , but that 's probably Eye-talian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't see her myself . I only heard about it , Mr. Bowers . A trustworthy source told me . I 've lived in the Green Glade almost five years , Mr. Bowers , and you never heard me complain before , did you ? " " Give me the complaint . " " Did you ? Did I ever say a word ? " Miss Russell adored this moment . " You know the element I 'm talking about . Somebody said she was very well-dressed , but that do n't impress me . I have my principles , Mr. Bowers . " " I see your principles , Miss Russell , " Harry said , giving her the gold tooth . His moist eyes turned deliberately from her lemon-colored hair , frosted and spread , to her breasts tricked out by straps and lifts . " They 're showing , " he mused , " your principles . " So gentle and considerate were these words that , whether she wanted to or not , Miss Russell put her hands to herself and asked : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's showing , Mr. Bowers ? " " Your principles , Miss Russell . " Who would ever have expectedmental pictures from Miss Russell ? He shook his head over her goodbye-saying rotation as she pick-picked away on her heels . She squeezed herself by tightening the muscles of her rump . Women lead most often to death , keep your underlinen clean , do n't walk at night in dark streets ( morality ) or damp ones ( health ) , and look out under all circumstances for your ring , your watch , and your mother 's memory . This is the sort of advice a man appreciates ; most of us receive it at one time or another . Willy Morrow lived by it . He had come up from Dayton to make His in Cleveland . His what ? Just His . There 's almost always work for a skilled hand in Cleveland ; just learn a skill , take your choice . When Miss Leah Russell was certain that Bowers had understood , she retreated to give Willy the field . He had been chosen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Bowers , sir , you see , " he began . " That 's all right , Willy , "  --  he had never used the first name before , although he always thought it when he thought of Willy at all . " I just wanted to tell you , Mr. Bowers . You know , where my folks come from we think different . We come from Dayton , but we come from below the Ohio originally . The river , I mean . I mean , I just wanted to tell you where my folks came from , originally I mean , I come from Dayton myself . I just wanted to tell you how I think about it . It would be terrible if they found out . I do n't know how I could explain , Mr. Bowers . I just wanted . Well , I suppose you think different from us folks , we 're just plain folks , "  --  and he blushed with the effort of this . " No offense meant , Mr. Bowers . Personally , beingp93from Dayton myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wanted to tell you  --  " " That 's all right , Willy . I know what you got to tell me , Willy . " " All right , then , I just wanted to say , "  --  relieved and gratefulat not having to go through with his promise to the others , but simulating sternness . He felt for his pocket watch . It was still there . " If that 's the way you feel about it , Mr. Bowers . I told you no offense meant . " " That 's the way I feel , Willy . Check-out time at three pee-yem . " Mike Hattan was more deeply embarrassed . He really felt something for old Bowers ; listen , a man has to have something inside to make it the way that bird has . Hand over fist , they say , and always slow and with a big smile for everyone . Mike Hattan thought that Bowers was regular , but now he was going too far . Just because you got money  --  it 's not all luck , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reason for insulting your friends . Mike considered himself Harry 's friend . It hurt him deeply , and he said : " Hiya , Harry , how 's the boy ? " " You ? " " Me ? I 'm all right , but the old meat grinder 's acting up again . I 'll never go to that Popolouse 's whatzizname 's diner again , not on your life , steak , sweet potatoes , lots of butter , peas and carrots , you would n't think that could hurt . I had vanilla ice cream for dessert , maybe that did it . Jeez ! Butter pecan ! It was n't vanilla at all , it was peek , now I remember . I bet that was it . Listen , pal , I do n't have anything against ' em , but my daughter she comes to visit me here now and then , and if she ever saw one in the lobby . . . . Just if she saw them . . . . You know what I mean , pal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ulcers , those bums the docs give me up for dead . I should a been dead , sure , but I just would n't die . I just go on.  |p94I  'm that kind of guy . No hard feelings , eh Harry ? I mean about my moving up to the Strand . That place ai n't nothing but a old folks home , you compare it to the Green Glade  --  this here place is I mean lively  --  but I guess I 'm just behind the times . Set in my ways , that 's all , and my daughter 's scared of coons . You read what one tried to do last week in Boston , I think it was ? Not that I have anything personal against them , they got the right to live same as you and me . I could tell by the name , Booker T. Washington Jones , some coon name like that . Sex over the state line in New Hampshire and injections of marijuana . Listen , no hard feelings , eh Harry ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em like I see ' em . " " Always the joke , eh Harry ? Ha-ha . Calls 'm like he sees 'm . Well , do I owe you anything ? " " Maybe a telephone bill . I 'll look it up . " " Yeah , I been calling my daughter . All I live for is that sweet kid of mine . I tell you she got her third proposal already ? . . . I always paid my bill , Harry . I was a good tenant . " " So long , Hattan . " Go to hell , Bowers thought . Mary Farnham , sick , belly-faced , wheezing and coughing , said : " I live by pleasing people . I know how to make them happy . Sometimes they take me home , they accompany me , I 'm old enough to be his mother . He knows that . I mean the customers at the Merrytime . They really love me there . I ca n't show them this kind of dump , niggers in the lobby . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You say it out , Miss Farnham , " Bowers said , coming out of his chair . " I appreciate it . " " Nigger ? What do you mean , say it out ? " " The others talk-talk-talk . " " No , Mr. Bowers , let me tell you . They was afraid of you . " He gave her the tooth . " What about you ? " " I ca n't help it . I got a tongue like that . Everybody knowsp95me for it . If my tongue thinks nigger , then my tongue says nigger . " " Your tongue 's been doing a lot of thinking these days . What you got coming ? " " Nothing but a hard time out of life . I do n't see why you had to increase and multiply my troubles , Mr. Bowers . " " You pay by the month , do n't you ? I 'll refund what you got coming . " " That 's more than most places do , Mr. Bowers . We always got along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Course , most places would n't pull a trick like that fool one . After I lived here six years and everyone knows my telephone number . I brought you lots of girls from the clubs too . Off and on , anyway , whenever I could . They paid their bills and tipped the boy . You should n't have done it , Mr. Bowers . " " You got about fifteen dollars coming , Miss Farnham . " And thought : Pack up your vaseline , and goodbye . " I do n't see what you 're going to do , Mr. Bowers , not that it 's none of my business . But you had a good thing here , the way I figure . I 'm kind of a business woman myself and I know . I know a good thing . That 's why I 'm saying this . I do n't mean to be nosy . You tired of making money , Mr. Bowers ? It get on the nerves ? Come down to the Merrytime once and laugh it off . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye , Miss Farnham . " Smitty , foreman on the Auto Wash crew , recently promoted to the day shift for having never been drunk on company time , smiled winsomely in apology for weight and muscle , and jiggled his blond baby-hair eyelashes and eyebrows at Harry , as if to say , You 're a big fella , too . He said : " I drink too much myself , but never let it get the best of me . Just called my wife in Youngstown . Whew . Hot tongue and cold shoulder , that 's all I get to eat from her . "  | " No loin chops either ? " Bowers asked . " You 're a funny one , Harry , I 'll really miss you . " " You taking off too ? " " I guess so , Harry . " " Sort of surprised me , Smitty . I thought you were more the happy-go-lucky type , did n't take things to heart . Things like that , I mean . Thought you were n't afraid a nobody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right , but why else did I come all the way to Cleveland from Youngstown ? Do n't like trouble . Do n't want any part of it . Never did . Just go moseying along , like the song says , you know . My wife 's enough mix-up for me , and besides  --  " He leaned close to Bowers , his chin dropping in this intimacy . " It 's a fact , Harry , "  --  and Bowers was surprised that Smitty had bad breath . Such a healthy boy . Nice , too . But of course they had never had a confidential conversation before . " Fact , Harry , I know because I 'm telling you . I work with 'm . I been with 'm lots , and you ai n't . Answer me that one . Listen , Harry , but it 's in the blood how we just ca n't stand the smell , the body odor it 's called . " " Leaving right off , Smitty ? " " Today , I guess , Harry . Knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smitty . " Pink-haired Susie What's-her-name borrowed a newspaper at the desk . " Mind if I just glance at it , Mr. Bowers ? Excuse me , please , you know I 'm getting married . Wonder if my name 's in it . I 'd buy the paper , only I already read the morning paper and all I want to see if my name 's in the getting-married column . You happen to see it , maybe ? We 're thinking of takingout a license . My boy friend  --  he 's my hubby-to-be  --  wo n't want to call for me if he has to walk through a lobby full ofthem . " " That 's a nice outfit you 're wearing , Miss . " " Oh ! thanks ! "  --  pleased that he noticed and remembered.  | " I got it from that same place I was telling you about , Mr. Bowers . " She had shown him the mail-order leaflet from the Hollywood Novelty 10-Pay Dress Company , where she bought her nicest frocks , each with a separate glamorous name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear the Spingle-Spangle Cocktail Gown . Guaranteed Nevr-Stik Zipper for After-Dark N-Ter-Tayn-Munt . " Watchfully she had shown it to him , months ago , but he had not taken the friendly hint . When you mix business with pleasure  --  it was one of Harry 's mottos  --  you can never collect the rent afterwards . " I 'm so complimented and flattered , gee Mr. Bowers , I did n't think you would remember . You never said nothing before , if I 'd of only known . " " Do n't let it change your mind , Susie . Your boy friend would n't like it , you said . " The smile diminished ; the elbow slid back across the counter . " Well , my name ai n't in the paper yet . Maybe tomorrow . " " Yeah , we 'll look again tomorrow . Come and look at the paper any time at all . It 's free for looking . " Goodbye . . . . Goodbye . . . . So long , Harry . Bye , old pal . See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Claire Farren , to whom old man Bowers had rented a room . What 's itching him ? They fled from something . They departed . Now why 'd he want to do that , hey ? Most of them explained in some way , tried to tell something about themselves , because they liked Bowers , because they did n't know why he would want to do this to them , because they did n't know what was hitting them . He was n't hitting them . They came up and hit themselves and howled for pain . " Mr. Bowers , I do n't know why you want to do this . Not that I figger to tell you how to run your business , but after all ,  |p98say  , I lived here since you bought the place from the Trustees . I always got along fine with them , and I always got along fine with you , and I bought my own soap besides , but  --  " " The soap 's figured in . Do n't make no diff . " So long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiling to change Harry 's mind . Then in groups . Then they rushed out because he was already smiling and he answered their smiles with his ready gold tooth and it did n't change anything . The gold tooth behind the smile was not a niceness for them ; it was a smile for Harry Bowers and his idea , which was Harry Bowers , too . They were nasty ; they were judged . They hated his soft slow smile with the hard quick smile within it . He sat with his legs spread behind the desk and checked them out . They hated him for that easiness because they had once liked him for it . A few , of course , stayed . A few Negroes came , but the rates were too high for most of them . They did n't have the highpayingjobs , and the First Guardian had a high-paying charge on Harry 's principle . Claire Farren stayed , but she never said anything to give him a sign that she knew what was going on . He felt ashamed to speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing it for her , that she had anything to do with what he did for himself , Harry Bowers . Funny thing about the colored , though . Their jobs , even in a skilled work town , did n't pay well enough except for those up North for years , and these had their own homes . That was the funny part . Harry would rent to anyone who had the money . Is n't that the way a business ought to be run ? It should be that way . That 's the democracy of green stuff , now that we 're off the gold standard . Dollars and grass , everyone can have it for his front lawn . Some got creeping bent like a golf course , some got century notes . Say , if America 's gon na be made great , that should be the way.  |p99And  then some stayed , not to make America great and not just because they liked Bowers , but because they were too busy to bother . It did n't make much cliff to them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miss Rebecca Crawford , for instance , who lived off bonds left her by a dentist , now defunct , whom she had nursed through his sorrows with an unloving wife thirty years before . KissableAmerican Telephone &; Telegraph and ever-loving AnacondaCopper lived after him . They offered her enough for postage , the essential commodity of her life . She passed her nights in the composition of letters to the editor , her days in the reading of newspapers . She was writing one of her generalreports now : " Dear Editor , With too much abuse below and too much confusion above , things are very untidy  --  " This took care of the world situation . Someone else  --  oh yes , that beggar back in June  --  had said this to Bowers , and she had heard . Apart from an occasional flit and scratch of her ear against doors , she was too busy to worry about Harry Bowers and the doings in the lobby . A few others , sane ones , ones all there , did n't worry either . But Bowers found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and many seemed to worry . She came home at night , and others were troubled . Her motions seemed to cast a long shadow under the summer sky : for some they obscured the sun , and for some they set obscure itches astir . The neighbors worried first after the tenants , then the police , then the fire department , then T. O. Handlin , the banker , then the housing inspectors and strangers of all sorts . They came to worry Bowers . He stood in the lobby and said goodbye to them . Mr. Parsons came in from next door to express his deep concern . Bowers said goodbye to him , too . There was one trouble with the fire inspectors and their code in small print : They had him by the balls . There was the same trouble with the bank . It might be worth mentioningp100that there was the same trouble with the police and the insurance company . These worriers all had him pressed together and sweating in the summer 's heat . Making money had been easier than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was taking you with it . Bowers did n't know where or why he was going with Claire Farren , and so far she had n't taken him anyplace except to trouble with the building code . He hardly saw her . He was taking himself someplace . " Naturally , if you want to make trouble , Mr. Bowers , we can make trouble too . Naturally we prefer not to . Naturally , if you want to sell the Green Glade , that might be arranged . I ca n't promise anything . Naturally  --  " So long , all you natural worriers . You got mental pictures on the brain . Goodbye . It was lucky Pete Prior did n't worry . Funny , you could hardly predict a thing like that . It made things easier , anyway . Pete Prior , the day manager , who gasped and panted when he told a joke , who had once worked as a printer on a newspaper in San Francisco , who had travelled the rods and now settled down because he liked Harry Bowers , said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel tonight , I do n't want you to disturb me till the flames are licking my door . Then you can ring and say soft-like , Mr. Prior , please , there 's something at the door for you . ' That 's how tired I am . " " Okay , Pete , sleep good . " " Mr. Bowers , you run your business the way you know how , but you 're asking for a peck of trouble . You know I 'll stick , but we 're likely to lose our desk clerks . Sure , they 're a bunch of rummies , but that 's a fact anyway . We 'll lose them . They should dress better for the customers anyway . If you wear a clean collar , the marks do n't look at the mattress , that 's the way things are . I 'll take the shifts when they go , night or day , makes no difference  --  I 'm too old to sleep anymore , any/way  --  but I do n't know why you 're doing it . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Well , off to bed . " Bowers stood with his hand in his belt and pouted and frowned . " I ca n't explain it to you , Pete . I 'd like to , but I ca n't . " " I did n't want you to explain . You were never the explaining type , Mr. Bowers . " Harry looked at the old man and thought : Maybe that 's the trouble , but I always been enough for myself . " I 'll figure it out , " he said . " Listen , Pete , you 'll always get yours , I 'll see to that , and for any overtime , too . Do n't worry about yours . " " You got me wrong , Mr. Bowers , I 'm not a worrier . One thing I found out is do n't ask a man too many questions . That way you keep your job , especially if this here guy is the boss  --  the one you want to ask the questions . " " Thanks , Pete . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve any credit . It 's the system . My system , too . Goodnight , Mr. Bowers . " " Sleep good , Pete . Hey , wait a minute , what do you mean the system ? " " Have n't you heard ? That 's why we are the way we are . Those bastards take off because they 're afraid of the system . Me , I stay because you pay me . It 's nothing to worry about . Why else ? " " Sounds like Morris . Sounds like a lot of crap to me . " " Is . " " Well then , what you yapping about ? " " Works . " Harry showed him the gold tooth he had been able to pay for with his own hands , while he fed a lummox brother , too , and before he was eighteen . " Stop laughing in my face , Pete . " " Was n't laughing , was yawning . " " Thanks for talking , Pete . I needed someone to talk to . "  | " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way they are . " " Goodnight , Mr. Bowers . " " Goodnight . Goodnight . " Harry Bowers stood alone in the silence of the lobby , his hand still warm against his belly in the habit of a fat man . He took his hand out , bent to pick up a fallen ash tray , and then let it stay where it had fallen amid a debris of butts on the carpet . Jake idled by outside and came in to say , " No hard feelings ? You ever need me , Mr. Bowers , remember I 'm right here . I always remember my friends . " Harry gave him a dollar and said goodnight to him , too . Poor Jake . The rooms were less than a quarter rented . The board was full of empty slots . Is that all they are , worriers ? They were making trouble for him , everyone , the whole twitching world of them , the whole city of inspectors and money-men and customers with their skinny worried fists . Worriers ? What did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire Farren ? Where was the good in all this ? Burn , you goddamned worriers . Burn.  |p103SOMETIMES  HARRY BOWERS WENT INTO THE SAFE TO THINK . You think that 's a joke ? It gets stuffy in there . In his office there was a dull-green vault , the size of a collie , its top wrapped in green felt to keep it warm . Shut , it was a lithe narrow safe , agile and snapping to receive money . The door hanging open , it turned bellyish , squat and heavy , and the shadows of drawers and papers inside made the curtains of bookkeeping and the guts of financial digestion . I guess , when I say that Harry went into the safe to think , that it 's a joke after all . It was n't big enough . But he opened the door and pulled a chair up to the safe and leaned forward , his head in his arms , his coat hanging open as he hunched forward , just as the door of the safe hung open . You might have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his arms he peered inside to the compartments and shelves embracing deeds and receipts and bills and agreementsand cash . Upstairs there were lovers using the hotplate . He put his eyeshade on the desk and rubbed the red crease it had made across his scalp and pulled the Venetian blind which looked out onto the alley and turned down the fan and snapped on the light and sat on his chair looking into the safe . His bald head in his arms . The gold tooth lay sheltered and useless in his head , not even Bowers admiring it now . He asked the safe what he had gotten out of it . This was a question posed without the giggle of cowardice or a squirm of whimsy : they were not Harry 's way . He had a question for tempered steel and paper profits . The safe could not reply , although it was a Surety Two-Inch job , guaranteed against fire and dynamite within limits , its combination checked twice a year . The engraved guaranteep104did not apply to wars and other Acts of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . Well , he paid for it , did n't he ? What had he gotten out of this ? All it could answer was the combination , once forward , twice backward , once forward again . Well , what had he got ? Butter on the heart and corns on the feet . Money for the chiropodist and pills from the druggist . He had put down a good line of con . He was tired of conning himself . He swung the safe door and it squeaked ; it needed oil . It squeaked open again . It was something he could have said for Morris or for Jake , that night man at the G. Washington , too dumb to know that there 's more to being crooked than cheating every chance you get . " My brother got a line of con takes nobody , but he lives for it . Sleeps too much . Dreams himself out . Mental pictureson the brain . He ca n't con me , but I always get taken by Morris anyway . Say , he 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door shone with a steady glow of tested steel , and , dim against it , Harry Bowers made out the shadows of his face . He put his hands against his face , the stubby fingers searching , and touched the bristling places of his jaw , the thick high cheekbones , the hard knobs of his shiny bald head . He spread his fingers to make sure of the enormous square head . It was all there . It was still there , and it was in use . How could a man who did not trust the glow of his face on the inner door of his safe  --  ? Let me put it another way . How could a man who did not trust the reflection in a rear view mirror when he drove his Buick , because it was only a reflection and he had to crane his neck to see the possible accidents with his own eyes , give himself over to money and business ? How could a lover of things do this ? Sure , money and business are the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want from them you do inp105getting them and making your business grow : but still money is only money and business is only a way of con . You give the boys with the girls a room for their money ? You keep the sheets changed for them ? Sure , but you 're not thinking about the lucky boy or the girl either , and the sheets come out of expenses with a kickback from Calvin Towel Supply . How could a lover of things live like this ? As Morris knew , hot rod supplies were not only money , either . Begin in the facts of flesh and metal and weight and texture . These were Bowers ' kingdom , and his will be done . Remember that he was a metaphysician and a rationalizer ; that is , a man who figured his doings and gave credit for a job welldone ; a poet who judged and pinched with his two fingers , when it came to new curtains , and kept the other three limber ; a business man whose five fingers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furniture essential to Harry Bowers . Bowers felt now , not his face , but the image in the open door . What if the safecrackers came after him with fluid ? He could not hold water in his hands , with no kind of fingers , the meta-whatchamacallit 's , the poet 's , or the other fellow 's ; there was something further , beyond hands and pockets and Harry 's fat friendly smile and his agreement on pizza or eggrolls . Who was beyond Bowers ? The bulb in its green socket above his head flickered when someone above him used a hotplate . It was forbidden , a sign said so , and the maids reported them in the closets , but Harry never said anything . Why should he ? Let Morris make his money picking pennies where he found them . Harry swung the door on its hinges , but the safe resisted closing , and it leaned open toward him once more . Probably a fishfry on that hotplate , maybe only eggs . Harry wondered if it had come too easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was poorly adapted to money . He hadp106shaken off protection like rain . Maybe the love of risk only signified a yen for defeat . No , in the risks were victory , not only Miami Beach at the height of the season . But just supposing , eh ? Was that why , beginning to rise with the inflation in a good racket , he had rented to Claire Farren ? The protectedanimals , unwieldy at last , encumbered by their armor , perish . Okay , okay , this is what Harry Bowers was thinking : What does protection get you besides more protection ? It does n't pay , it only pays cash . Jake and the G. Washington outfitfound that out . Without armor , how could Bowers profit from the labor and weariness of others ? He had never needed armor ; he lumbered , sleek and speedy in fat , and got what he wanted . He won by looking at what was highest in color and flight at the moment , Harry and his options , Harry and his risks . Wars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you travelled light and fast with it . Not that he ever wished trouble on anyone but himself . Wars were far away , all those wars of men without safes in which to find their faces , without opponents in which to discovertheir faces , without Buicks and their lives easy to do away with and the options simple . The war he knew was the avid confrontation of one trader with another , sly , hearty , or brutal , and the direct responsibility of each act . Owed wholly to himself . That had been his knowledge of others . His voice had grown hoarse in it , and with the laughs in it . No , it was not enough . No , the soldiers knew no more than he did , but he did not know enough . In some way the Green Glade had changed him . ( The felons with hotplates hidden in their closets . ) He had never recognizeda suffering child after himself . No headline frightened him . The world had never pursued him into his privacy ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house dicks to go pummeling at the doors behind which girls with false namesp107stood in panties , maybe charging for it , maybe not . Something had altered for him , as something is altered despite themselves for the twist-and-twirls in pink panties and swollen nipples and the boys with high pride and mouth full of lies . Where was the woman that 's supposed to come with success ? That 's in the stories . Sure , he had found the tramps , plenty , and some pretty nice ones , but that ai n't it . Where 's the little woman ? It 's not easy to make the Buick good enough , even with a gold ignition key and a silver monogram for the door . Maybe he had opened the door to his privacy after all . Claire Farren was too busy . Anyway , what did she know about it ? She was an organization , that one . Bowers was all by his lonesome , the frontiersman on Prospect , the rugged individualist with palms sweaty at the bank . He had bought the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire Sale Today . But the dream had really dreamed itself on within Bowers . He had proved to himself that , if the gold was not in the streets , it was at least at the curbs . You had to scramble , sure . It 's always hot where there 's traffic . You stayed in business for blood and gold . For the blood of hunters and creators , for the gold of finders and makers  --  to be a lover of goods . Bowers had the fingers for it . He had the eyes . He liked it that way , even if business and Bowers together had left something out . Left out ? Then why not get out now ? Answer : You do n't so easily . Claire Farren had high breasts clefted between , but only the round of them swelled from the slit of her jacket when she leaned to sign the register . That has nothing to do with it . Her skirt is almost too tight when she walks down the hall . The tension of leg and leg against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to do with it . She 's not playing the game of those women who wear too many buttons and touch themselves while they glance at you . She does n't even think that way . She thinks about Bowers . She does . She 's a woman , all the same . No no no . Out of the question . When you 're in business for blood , you get out only with blood . When you burn for your work , you get out only aflame . She was mean to the Green Glade Company , but nice to him . She looked ugly to Harry 's Green Glade , but was all grace to him . He had never guessed that it could be like this . He had never thought of it . He was married to the Green Glade ; yet he wanted this hot , closely-held , wise-eyed girl . He had never dreamed that Business the Bride , after their long happy honeymoontogether on Prospect Avenue , could turn such a schemingface to him when he said , " Yes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for-instance you . " He shook his head into the safe because he had lived with it under false pretenses . Nevertheless , he loved his hotel . The Green Glade was still his , all his , and would never stop being Harry 's . He had said it : " He who eats fire shits sparks . " That goddamned light . What they doing upstairs , baking a cake ? Hotplates ! If the fuses blow , they can clear out , too . Probably that Mr. and Mrs. Franson , the ones who turned out to be married after all . Insufficiency unto himself : there was room for more , and he knew it . He learned this by listening at the doors of the rooms he rented . Not out of curiosity but out of hope that all was going well for their five dollars with bath . Perhaps he had begun to feel possibilities outside his business by wonderingwhat would happen to the Green Glade when Bowers was gone . By feeling hunger and not knowing the food to satisfy it . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . He had always enjoyed chanciness , the risk of dollars playing together , but this possibilitywas something different . He had always enjoyed laughing , too . This one was a laugh that used up the gold tooth . Why not rent to Claire Farren and her organization ? Was it for Claire Farren that a man turned around at the rise of his time and tried another way ? And he answered himself : Yes , a little bit , and for the honey in her voice , too , but it 's all for me . I got a surprise for everybody : I ai n't dead yet . There was the pleasure he took in showing himself that Bowers made his own way according to how he saw it . He laughed and patted his belly . He could still thin out if he wanted to , and , with this knowledge , slenderness was not necessary . " Bring the empties with you , dummy . . . . "  --  a voice in the alley . Harry put his head still closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open door gathered sound from the unmoving air , and he heard a murmur inside that must have been occurring upstairs . " You happy with me , honey ? " " Do n't forget the empties , you . " " You wo n't be sorry about anything , will you ? "  --  the voice whispering below the green felt in the safe . And the answer came : " Honey . " Mr. and Mrs. Franson had fancy dolls on their bed , fancy dolls on the bed of the newlyweds . The couple upstairs had the same use to Bowers as the dolls did to the wriggling pair . Harry wiggled and squirmed with himself , not satisfied by this and looking for another way . This would almost be infidelityon the terms life had set for him : the infidelity that comes of setting one 's own terms , and only these . Aah ! That flicker ! While they 're honeying each other , why do n't they turn off the hotplate ? They do n't think of the cost in electricityand maintenance.  |p110Hsst  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was electricity overcoming wiring . The fuse flashed out and he sat in darkness . Lovers ! It was that hotplate upstairs . Those lovers , they did n't need light . The safe door was open in the night , the green fire of money exposed with its metal strand and nothing else . Harry put his head down to touch it through the dark , and , in the great ear of the safe , heard the accumulated seawhisperingfrom upstairs : " Honey , honey .... " That was the lovers who did n't care about his fuses . But as for Harry , he needed to find his fire and to light up . Next day , Harry 's golf lesson . He has an appointment , and no safes or fuses or foolish insomnia can trick him out of an appointment . He took from a pro at the Sherwood Forest Country Club . " First we grip right and rectify our stance . That 's it , now you got it . We do n't worry about hitting the ball , Mr. Bowers . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aaata boy . " " Can I hit the ball now ? " " Not yet , Mr. Bowers . But you 're doing very well , "  --  the accolade from the hands of a fellow called Bob , once of the Duke University golf team , and a swell kid , too , in addition to being a grand golfer . Golf is the afternoon 's business . Bowers empties the pencils from his pockets , and the pieces of envelopes and the margins of newspapers on which he conducts his business . He divests himself of his armor , his business cards , his deposit slips , the clanking handful of change which somehow accumulates each week . He emerges from his apartment in the Morganstern Manor with clothes that should be as slim and empty as those on handsome men 's store dummies , but somehow , still re/membering , his coat sags with the weight of affairs and frowns across the back . Remembers to button the jacket . The moment afterward he forgets , unbuttons , and it flaps out again about the belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forest Country Club past real estate developments planned in the twenties , marked with happy signs  --  FINE HOMESITES ! CAREFULLY RESTRICTED !  --  andstill empty . Unswollen by the powers of his trade , his pencils and his notations , his suit loose on him , he sinks like a shriveled stick into the leather seat of his convertible . He puts up the top to hide himself from the rear view mirrors ahead of him , above him , surrounding him in his alert but retreated imagination . A bad business man , he is thinking , is not an idealist or anything else like that ; he is only a bad business man . A good business man makes money , has the hotel filled with paying customers  --  that 's what made America great . What the hell am I trying ? I 'm still a business man , and if I 'm not , then who is Harry Bowers ? A golfer ? A deep-thinker ? Sure , I 'll contribute to strike funds , but that 's because Irving Ferster the Accountant can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ? What got into me last night with the safe ? Those honeys upstairs and forgetting the hotplate was on . He thinks something like this : I was all miracled up , now I 'm only worried about what Bob the Pro thinks . He considers Bob the Pro and Jake , the night man at the G. Washington Motel , and then decides : we know what we are from the other guys . And reassures himself : But the measure of me is Harry Bowers . And moves his shoulders inside the pads . Drive-in . Gravel . Cocktail lounge . Men 's bar . Hiya , Bowers . Hiya , Harry . Place for idleness and the accomplishment of hiya . Locker room of the Sherwood Forest clubhouse . Combs hanging from chains and framed pictures of horses . Alcoholp112sting where someone spilled hair tonic . Piss and good fellowship . A habit is a comforting thing . Bowers puts on the uniform of sport . T. O. Handlin , the tea-loving manager of the First Guardian Trust , is on his way with a checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't even know how it happened that someone like Bowers got admitted to the Club . Even if the name did n't give him away , still . . . His pal Bowers . He might as well speak . " Drives down the property , Harry , " he says . " It is n't worth the mortgage now . It 's even worse the way you got it , mixed . " " It is to me , worth it , I mean . " " I 'm talking about financing , not what you like , Harry . Our bank does n't handle colored property . We 're known for that . We have the best reputation in town . The Green Glade is worse than nigger property now , and we do n't like it a bit . You put one over on me with that loan for your brother , Harry . The payments late like that  --  " " I did n't do anything new . " " Well , never mind , this is n't business hours . Let 's get out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sallow under the visor as the dregs of the tea cup back in the drawer of his desk . Bowers is in his underwear when T. O. Handlin moves out . Serious business if he had to say it in the locker room , off-hours like this . Well , what can you do ? Hell with him . All alike , friend in deed . Bowers covers himself with the clothes bought new for this purpose : to look stylishly old . There 's Bob the Pro , long blond face like a toothbrush . " Smile , Mr. Bowers . Take it easy . That 's right . Do n't tense up . Back in Duke University they used to tell us we were lost if we tensed up . On the golf team there . " Harry remembers when , as a young man with his first gold tooth , he had smiled to show the tooth to his friends . He had studied that smile . He had grinned with purpose in those days ,  |p113for  himself and his friends , to give them the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra eye . You need an extra eye , an extra thumb , an extra heart ? Sure , for winking , for counting money , for enjoying what you enjoy . You need that gleam , that smile which says something , that gold tooth . As an eleven-year-old boy , brought from Europe by an elder cousin who died soon after , he had carried a bag of down , his sole inheritance , goose-down , but had never married and never made a pillow of it . It was too soft for a bachelor workingmanin the land of opportunity , where you slept standing up and with a smile on the face . Only the dead lie down in America , he had heard . During your spare time you feel up girls in subways and elevators . Not Bowers , not this man  --  he took vacations . " Keep smiling , Mr. Bowers . That 's it . You swing from the middle and the wrists , and nothing else moves . Nothing . " " What do you mean , nothing ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play a nice game , Mr. Bowers . " " Nothing moves ? " His mother had told him to marry and to use the down she had plucked and saved for him . She had died during the first war before he could earn enough to bring her over . It was his sixteenth birthday when he got the word that she had been dead and buried almost a year already . Morris had gotten through . " Watch it ! watch out ! " " What do you want from me ? " " Do n't bend from the waist like that , Mr. Bowers . Grip your fist right , the way I told you . It 's all been worked out scientifically . " " I thought this is supposed to be a game . What 's the object ? " " You 're a kidder , Mr. Bowers . The object of the game is to win , is n't it ? "  |p114He  stands with Bob the Pro and practices his swing , thumbs tucked in , toes pointed in the approved manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hole-in-one universe . A storm , telling him that things are not all like this , comes up to stutter in his head . Thought and nonsense crackle that this is no place for him , that he is Bowers and does what he likes , that he is Bowers and makes himself . That 's the pitch the thunder gives him . " Well , relax a minute , Mr. Bowers . " " What ? " " Take it easy now . I can tell your mind 's too tense , I can see you 're working it too hard . Do n't pay just to be a fine golfer . Yeah , cigaret ?  --  Things are n't the way they used to be . Look , we use nigger caddies now . Ca n't get anything better . " " What do you mean , they do n't know how to pick up balls and carry sticks ? " " Sure , well , you know what I mean . Niggers I said . What a kidder . . . . But it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . I was one myself . Class . Not that the Club did n't try . " That Claire Farren coming and going , the Green Glade losing more each week , the interest payments on the mortgage coming out of operating expenses  --  what the hell was he doing here with a golf pro ? Habits are soothing . " You got to practice to learn , Mr. Bowers . " All his knowledge having come from need . No habits . " You got to really want to work at it . It can be one helluva lot of fun , Mr. Bowers , when you take that first hole . Some of the fellows bet as high as five bucks , maybe more . " All his work and his fun identical from the beginning , desire unconscious and buried in this meeting . Cool off , cool off . A shower . Handlin is dozing in a chair , naked , with a towel jammed between his legs . Goodbye , Bob ,  |p115see  you next week . Bye , Mr. Bowers , you 're learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of you yet , golf I mean . " " What kind of business is that ? " " I 'm a business man , too , Mr. Bowers , being the Sherwood Forest pro . I guess I 'm a kidder , too . " Bowers spins the tires of his automobile on the gravel lot and turns roaring out , slapping the gears and then the wheel , gritting his teeth and shouting : " He wo n't even let me hit the ball ! I got to grip my fist right first ! " No , but the object of the game was not only to win.  |p116IF  MORRIS BUYS A PROPERTY , HARRY WAS THINKING , IT GETScockroaches while he signs the deed . Maybe the mental picturesdo it . They come up out of the cracks in his shoes . All he has to do is talk to the lawyer and the short circuits start short circuiting . Harry was going to see Morris and his family because it was his duty , he owed him this at least , and because he wondered now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " One thing I believe , I firmly believe it . Everything has reasons . No one can tell me otherwise . What the reason is , that I do n't know . But the thing that struck me most , really hit me I mean , in that article in the Sunday paper , below the belt I mean , I 'll never forget how I felt when J read it  --  Well , I ca n't exactly remember how it went . " This was one of those summer days , stupefied by unbroken heat , when the postman crossed and recrossed the street with his pouch , alone with his decisions under the divided residentialsky . He carried the life of the street with him , his feet sticky with asphalt , his footsteps scuffing with fatigue . The side-by-side houses had given up their chance for sun , light , air , and space in favor of what is called " income purposes . " Each hall closet , however , was full of extra hats and mothballs ; each lawn bore its snakelike length of hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it green . It was a street of hopefuls . You could rise from a street like this and put out your elbows and say , " Look where I came from . " It was a street like thousands . After parking his automobile in the short driveway , it seemed to Harry that he had to wade through the family ,  |p117Bernice  , Stanley , Bessie , and Morris . They peeked from indoors , they squinted under the sun . His brother 's daughter , Bernice , came out from ambush while he still sat behind the wheel . " Uncle Harry , " she said flirtatiously , uttering sugared chlorophyll , " you ever see one of these purses hangs from the shoulderlike the girls in the newsreel ? The ones that vacation in Switzerland , at Lake Placid , at Winter Park , Col. , at a nice little resort there ? " " You want one , Bernice ? " " A purse ? " " A purse , yes , sure  --  but a vacation , one of those nice little Switzerland vacations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another mint . Bowers began to laugh , grunting as he slid away from the wheel . " Let me out , make room , Bernice . Where 's the folks ? You got me all wrong , Bernice . I 'd like for all Harry Bowers ' cousins , nieces , nephews , brothers , and night clerks to vacation off me in Atlantic City or Switzerland , but I ai n't no movie producer . I ai n't no stock broker . Maybe I should of been . Listen , interest on the loan , taxes , and expenses eat it up in real estate these days . I do n't say you ca n't make a profit  --  sure , you can get rich sometimes on the expense account alone , plus depreciation allowance  --  I do n't mean to make any misleading allegations . That would n't be fair to our form of government . You can get rich very nice . " " We 're based on the , profit system , " Stanley solemnly intoned . " Hello , Stanley , where 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Boy are we , ai n't it nice ? We 're based , we 're stuck , we 're up to our necks in the profit system  --  " " Or motive , " said Stanley . " That 's another way you could put it . " " Let 's go in the house . I appreciate you coming out to meet me. "  | " Uncle Harry , " Bernice asked , " did you see that wife-slayer fellow 's picture in the paper ? He sure is handsome to look at . " Uncle Harry , " said Stanley , " I been wanting to ask you something . That 's why I came out here to meet you  --  " " Oh , I thought you just wanted to say hiya , Uncle Harry , hello . " " Sure , hello too , but I just wanted to ask . Say , I might want to go into business myself when I get out of college . I need some information for that . How do you know when a propertyis on the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , how do you know ? "  --  Stanley 's note-taking face . " There 's not a property in the whole city I do n't know about . The whole city calls me up . " Stanley considered this , then found it inadequate . " But I mean is n't there some sort of marketplace , a journal , a way of informing the public ? " Bowers leaned against the sizzling fender . " Dave Ostrow comes in for instance , he do n't even think I 'm interested , just discussing , asking my advice . Sometimes I buy . I do n't always know . I surprise myself , but then when I think about it , it 's a good deal . I got the touch . I do n't ever admit it , why not say it to my own family ? It 's true . Fact . Judge Marcus calls me up on the phone all the time . He wanted me to go in on that Granada deal with him the worst way . He would do anything and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him ? " " Something terrible . Anything I say . The worst way , " Harry assured him , smiling inside , thinking : He 's got a face with real hand-tailored details . Never will amount to anything . " Why 'd you want to know , Stanley ? " " Well , I just wanted to be a success , too . I want to be able to take life easy . "  |p119The  smile on the inside of Harry moved to the outside with the gold tooth . Bernice was asking him , " Uncle Harry , why are you a bachelor ? " " I 'm not a bachelor . I almost got married once . " " Oh , we know , Uncle Harry , you lead a secret life . . .. " While they stood outside on the walk beside his Buick , Bowers looked at his niece and nephew and decided that for them the secret life , the inner life , was what happened when they lay in the sun on the beach after dinner . This passive hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rat , was the inner life . The word of Harry Bowers : There 's an inner life for you , a stomach one . The fleshy sprout of his ear quivered with gratitude at being Harry , not Morris . Thank the Almighty . Thank myself . He could rest , too , and he liked beds , for thinking in them , for sleeping in them , for squirming with a woman on a good-quality mattress , for jumping up into his shoes with the first appointment of the day already masteredin his head . Stanley Bowers asked questions in some dim wonder at his uncle 's vitality . His lank skeleton stooped like a question mark , asking flesh , a doubt of value in the world ; his head leaned on the long skinny neck like an eye at the end of a poisoned stalk . He was thin because his digestion was poor , but he had hardly any appetite except for oatmeal cookies . He knew that oatmeal cookies were good for him because he used to eat oatmeal for breakfast and it tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said contentedly , " only I 'm allergic to the grape family . " " What 's the matter , " Harry grinned , trying to use the words of the Morris family , " got a nervous stomach ? " " No , " Stanley pronounced with dignity , " colitis . You have to take X rays and barium . " Miming respect , Bowers swallowed air and touched his hand to his mouth , taking this as wit , laughing at his joke . The golf lesson was just a bad dream , that 's all . He would n't letp120a country club get him down . " Pat his back , baby drank too much milk , " he said , but he felt splendid in his linen shorts and hairy loins and fleshy stomach healthy under pants . Stanley watched him , wrinkled his nose , squinted to see the joke . Harry said : " Go ahead , sneeze , this is a free country . There 's no charge . You do n't have to put it in your budget . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited to make sure that Uncle Harry was sympathetic . Then he sneezed . " Stanley , you got a big future ahead of you , "  --  this because his future was known and therefore as meaningless as a sneeze and moved with him like his skinny paunch . If the future was ahead of you already , then it was no good . " Where 's your mother ? Where 's Morris ? Let 's go in . " Stanley rubbed himself where , as a child , he had been punished for rubbing and said , all surprised , " What ? " and asked : " Where ? " They went in , Bernice still talking . He left the car to turn hot in the sun . The leather of the seats could take it , though his back would stick to it later . He found his sister-in-law , Bessie Bowers , waiting with her mouth open . She told him that Morris was upstairs shaving . She sat him down , the closet door open to show just the edge of her Persian lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sipped a glass of iced tea amidst furniture which was Genuine Louie in one corner and Hand-Made Antique in another . Bessie , sly when it came to talk , had arranged that she could have Harry , the success of the family , alone for ten minutes . She could explain to him . He could spur the others on . A bachelor , he could take an interest in them . It was the nice thing to do . Later , if she needed tears , she could arrange for that , too . In the meantime , she would explain , and Bessie said : " I attend all the functions , I have a lovely kitchen with appliances , it 's the modrun thing to do . My boy he 's a good eater , but he forgets my birthdays . He looks a million in his horse/back suit with the jodhpurs a pair and knickers to go with . When I tell him , Get married already , I 'm tired of darning your socks , ' he says : " Whom ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even know who . He could even furnish a home in modrun  --  it 's the latest thing this year , they say  --  but first he has to get a nice little girl . She should be nice , that 's all . If you know the family is nice , successful , well-to-do , fine people altogether , you can be sure the whole city will say , Hm , hm , a fine catch . Otherwise the whole city laughs in its sleeve . She could be smart and pretty and a little manager type too , why not ? Just because she got a family in wholesale drugs , in wallpaper cleaner &; supply , it do n't mean she lays in the beauty parlor all day like my Bernice . What 's the matter with her own face , she got to get it lifted ? I remodeled her nose for her birthday , is n't that enough ? We always gave her elocution lessons , cod liver oil , ballet on the toes , nothing she needed was too good for her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state  --  I mean that sarcastic , Harry  --  so you got your choice . Either you buy the electric goods that does the work for you , a toaster , a washer , a dryer , a dishwasher maybe even , a grinder , a mixer , a televisionfor spending the evening with the family , or you hire a colored girl . You do n't need both . . . . " She paused to let this thought settle . " And serve her a nice lunch , naturally , you got to . With a girl you pay her and serve her a nice lunch , left-over chicken maybe , you ca n't give her frankfurters all the time , and you got nothing to show for it . With appliances , you got the appliances . Unless you buy it on time , Stanley says , but I say different . It 's practically an investment in safe-keeping , a Sunbeam mixmaster , a lovely fixture with pyrex bowls . " Now , Harry , that 's what I 'm getting to . I got trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . You could drum it into his head all day , he 's like a dummy  --  no time paymentsp122for him . And Bernice , she thinks beautiful is better than stay home and help out . Will you tell them , Harry ? Harry , will you show them how it is ? " " Bessie , listen , " Harry said at last . " What do you want from me ? " " Well , first I want  --  " Harry could not suffer politeness any longer . " Listen , Bessie , I ask you what you want . I got something on my mind . " This was a way of saying , Shut up . " Where 's Morris ? " He knew that Morris had been trained to wait upstairs , shaving and shaving , until his wife would finish . " Morris ! " she yelled . " Come on down , you sleeping or something ? " He popped out his head at the top of the stairs and said , " Hiya , Harry , "  --  imitating the movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Harry . " Want to play gin ? Come on , Harry , play me some gin . " " You know I always beat you . " " Not always , Harry , "  --  pouting reproachfully , the child caught in defeat . " Aw Harry , most of the time , but not always . I remember two or three times- " " Okay okay . What 's eating you , Morris ? " " Nothing . I got something to tell you , that 's all . Nothing . " " What 's up ? " " Do n't be mad already , Harry . " " Mad mad , okay okay , what is it ? " " How 's business at the Green Glade ? I hear things ai n't so good since you got  --  " " All right , Morris , get to it . " " Listen . Listen now , Harry . Do n't get me wrong . I 'm your sole brother , Harry , the only one . " He stopped , as if searching for the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to find them . He needed a haircut , and straggling grey hairs on his neck pointed to the ratty baldness coming , the spotted andp123freckled scalp . He sat in the chair opposite the couch where Harry sprawled with one shoe lightly resting on the edge of the coffee table . Harry respected both paid-up coffee tables and hard-earned feet ; therefore he rested his feet for recreation'ssweet sake , but lightly . Morris was opening and shuttinghis mouth as if he had indigestion . Finally he took out a match and studied it in his palm . It was a large kitchen match with a pop-eyed head . " I know the Green Glade is losing money now , Harry . What with the interest payments and all to meet . I know the bank 's going to get it if you do n't move fast . Do something fast , Harry . Sure , it ai n't your fault , it 's the system . Stanley is right . You 're still the best small-hotel man in the whole city . For buying and managing , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the niggers you got in there  --  " " Put up or shut up , " Harry said . " I do n't go for your line of goods . " Morris lit the match and said , " Bet you ca n't put it out by pinching it , Harry . That 's a little game I used to play with the kids . " Harry wet his fingers against his tongue and in one rapid gesture pinched the flame . It sizzled , sputtered , briefly died with his fingers still diddling it . The skin was blackened at his horny nail . He had kept his fingers against the sulphur although it meant a burn . But if you made a real fire , Morris looked at him . " I can put it out easy . What you think I got two fingers like this for ? " " But Harry , I ai n't saying , I just mean if you had a real fire  --  " " What ? " " If , just if , Harry . " The moment which passed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being alone with the safe . Bowersp124was looking into the darkness of his brother and seeing himself , just as he had hunched his head toward the bills and recordsand cash on the shelves back in his office . He almost heard the hotplate of the honeys upstairs . He squinted in disbelief at Morris . At last he said : " Yeah sure , I see what you 're thinking . You got little thoughts made of cotton soaked in kerosene , you got rags and oil what-you-call-em mental pictures , that 's what you got , brother . A fire in the hotel , no , that you would n't put out with no two fingers . No , that you would n't spit out , not even the insurance company . I see what you ai n't saying , brother of mine . I thought of all those angles when you was still peddling seconds in pullovers for stolen , when you was still telling ' em factory rejects was hot goods . Naw , Morris , that would be arson and fire-setting with intent to burn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do it , Harry ? " Bowers lay back , this time his heel flat on the coffee table , and roared with laughter through his anger , loose in the stomach with laughter , the flesh bouncy , only a dull tightness in his chest to let him know how different it was from the real laughter . Why was it that ideas always came while he pricked his brother ? Why could n't he just let his brother go , like the wives he never had , like the parents he had almost forgotten ? But he was not a destroyer . That was not Harry 's way . And what would he now be destroying ? Chance . He lived for hazard , the chanciness of hope . He let the laughter settle in his belly . He had two fingers , spit , and a tongue for more supple events than firesetting , which seemed to him a final thing , although the vistas of " with intent to burn " were new to him . " Can I help , Harry ? You 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubby fingers at Morris and Bowers let his heel turn on the coffee table and hisp125brother did not dare mention it to him , and then Bowers demandedto know what was up , what was eating his brother , and Morris told him that he had taken the money which Bowers somehow , for some reason , always gave him  --  only this time it was the bank 's money because the Green Glade was going bad fast , and when a hotel goes bad with interest payments to meet , it goes bad fast  --  the electricity and the heat and the maids and all the upkeep eat it up fast  --  and , yes , Morris had taken this here money , see , Harry , and he had made like a little investment with it , a placement , only not the kind he had talked about , because that other little deal had sort of fallen through  --  or anyway  --  but see , Harry  --  and this fellow had come at him with a proposition that seemed just right  --  and , like Harry had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seltzing about , Morris ? You got a handker-chief ? " Morris had bought a triangular corner plot of desolated land at an intersection in one of the industrial areas of the city . " It 's like a motel deal , Harry . There ai n't no motels or hotels or anything for miles around if a guy gets tired for a snooze , or he picks up a girl , see . You as good as told me about it . You said motels are the coming thing . " " What ? Sure motels are comers . So 's the atom bomb , does that mean you have to go out and buy one ? You did n't even get the finished product , all you got was the piece of uranium . I believed you again , " he groaned . " I thought you had your own good deal . That 's what you said . " But he knew that he had never trusted Morris , and had given him the money without trusting him . That was important to Morris . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Morris interrupted with his plump face illuminated by admirationand pleasure in his brother 's acumen . He pushed his body forward . " How 'd you figure it out , Harry ? How 'd youp126know ? That 's just what I had in mind , but then my partners  --  they thought pinboy trouble  --  and it 's defense-factory time again  --  " " You said you did n't even want to tell me about it . You said you wanted it to be all your own . " " Yeah , but this was mine , too . You only told me about it . Property ai n't your invention , Harry . Bowers did n't think it up . Just like atomic irradiation , like you said  --  " " Told you ? I said it was a good field , I said motels was , just a thing to get into , that 's all , if you 're a real estate man , a realtor I mean , and then I said they had this parcel up for sale , that 's all . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crandall Realty handled it . " " Yeah ! That 's right , Harry ! Crandall Realty , "  --  beaming his fat , close-eyed , you 're smart-saying smile . " Jeez , Morris , you crazy ? It ai n't worth the taxes . What you gon na do with it ?  --  a piece of property like that in the slums with garbage and smoke and you got to compete , supposing you even got the money to build , with palaces going up everyplaceelse , places like the G. Washington Colonial Motel-type , other places like that , looking glasses in the lobby  --  " " I thought it was motel property , " Morris explained . " Look , I 'll build myself a drive-in motel , you know , a restaurant , a bar , a television in every room  --  " " I ask you one question , what you gon na use for money ? " " You know , with that television in every room you get a good clientele , a quarter in the slot for every hour they play it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a no-good parcel . What you gon na put on it , what with ? You ca n't get a quarter in the slot for televisionwhen all you got is a pile of tin cans and chickweed and free dumping privileges . I ask you that one question . " " That 's just added income , Harry , the quarters for the television . You ca n't run a decent motel without it . I talked withp127a salesman , no , a sales manager . He told me . That 's just gravy , Harry , like an added attraction . Once you pay off the teevees , it 's honey in the hand , Harry . Course , you got to service them too , once in a while  --  " " What you gon na build with ? Ever heard of building costs ? You ca n't get half the stuff you need with pull and underthe-tableeven . What you gon na use for money to put under the table ? If you 're a business man , you got a plan , I suppose . Answer me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Morris seemed to shrink now after his happy dream of the quarters in the television slots . The retreat in his eyes said , as it often did , Goodbye , goodbye . Harry said more gently , calling to him in his sleep , " Answer me my question , Morris . I asked you . " Morris did not look at him , but studied the foot on the coffee table . " I thought maybe you and me , we was partners . .. . " " Me ! " The foot twisted a long scratch on the coffee table and the bald head flashed like a mirror to sun through the window . " Me ! You did n't even say nothing . Partners ! Never again . I 'd be partners only with my wife , if I had a partner . You did n't even say , Look , Harry , so I could get the chance to say no . No , I said it already , in advance . No ! I ai n't got no more money anyway for you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know it . They got me by the balls , you know it yourself , you even said it to me  --  " " Aw , Harry , that do n't make no difference , you 're still very well-off . Everyone knows that . You 're the type . You do n't have to be modest with me . One word from you , and ... . Harry , why do n't you invest in motels ? Come in with me , Harry . " He tried to explain in an explaining tone , the way one should talk to a younger brother for whom one had lived , with whom one was growing old . He tried to remember hisp128own deep-bellied laughter and he tried to keep his voice down there . " Do n't you understand ? I thought I told you already . I tell you , I ai n't got what to invest . If you do n't know already , the bank can tell you . Ask Handlin . I thought you was going to buy a piece of a business or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did n't . . . . " He stopped and wondered for an instant why it was that he never stopped to think how Morris would always do it . " Why , god damn it , why did n't you tell me before you threw my credit out with my money ? " " I wanted to do something on my own , Harry . " " Sure , and on your own you 're going bankrupt , and me too . No one to drag you out this time . We ca n't pay up that property , and the price you paid , we ca n't sell it either . Why did God and my mother have to give me a brother ? The best we can do is maybe get a little something back out of it , maybe , and only maybe , before the taxes eat it up . And more payments . Jesus Christ , Morris , you ever stop to figure why nobody bought it all these years ? The taxes , and that neighborhood'sdying . Jeez , why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it myself , Harry . I had a mental picture of it . " Harry stared with disbelief at his brother , his own face wet and cold with sweat , and saw his brother 's wet cold face with the tapioca lumps of fat under the chin and at the ears , and he wondered what there was left to do now . He had given him money , as he always did , yet never trusting him . What was Morris trying to get him to do ? Did he want him to say something more ? What could there be in it for Morris ?  --  so many foolishnesses , failures , crookednesses , bankruptcies , robberies faked for the insurance , so many runnings to Harry for help . What did he want Harry to admit ? How could this life dedicated to tearing down , to destroying , to pulling into lumpsp129and ruin like his face , be the life of his brother with whom he had long ago played in the snow and taught to skate on wooden runners and then brought to America ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for everything . Harry breathed hoarsely , carrying the flesh of his brother as the mother carries a nine-month baby . Morris said  --  and the cold jiggling of his resilient flesh meant stubbornness , meant another rehearsal of the old arguments  --  " Rememberyou told me about it , Harry ? " " Remember ? Goddammit , I said it was a good deal if you could build  --  you ca n't build these days , not with your kind of money . And not that property . You do n't have the contacts either . " " You said it was a good deal , Harry . " " I thought you had your own good deal . " " Yeah , it was a bowling alley deal  --  a partners  --  but this was your idea . " " My idea ! You piece of worm ! Who asked you to just put down my money , just throw away my money  --  ? " " It 's a loan , Harry . I borrowed it from you . All right , if you feel that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He closed his mouth righteously . " You 'll never get your money back out of it . You threw it away . You bought a piece of land from a shark . That 's not property . " " You told me real estate is a good business . You put the mental picture in my ear . Anyway , it 's business and I got to pay you back , so what difference does it make to you ? " " Mental pictures again ! You have to pay it back , again . That story for a change . Jeez Christ ! I ca n't get money from a stone , can I ? I never did before . That 's what you told me the last time . " " The last time was n't my fault , Harry . It was more the times . It was the competition , I did n't know about Westernp130Auto . You did n't tell me . You only mentioned "  --  reproachfully , pouting  --  " the last time , the other time I mean , how hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said . I might of overstocked on bumper lights , little monkeys for the dashboard , compasses , a few little jiggers like that , but it ai n't my fault if Western Auto opened up on the same block and took away the trade . I could n't help it if you ca n't sell that stuff on time . Reclaim it , what have you got ? Foreclose on it ? A slightly used monkey to hang from the dashboard ? Nothing . They might as well stop the payments . Well , so we got out of that one  --  " " And the time with the gum machines , the stamp machines ? " " How could I know the public would rather go to the post office than get nice clean machine postage stamps in a piece of cardboard , in the drugstore where they get everything else ? How could I know ? " " Someone else made a good thing of it  --  " " Maybe they had publicity . Maybe they educated the public , who knows ? I was the pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did n't get anything out of it . Nothing but heartache . Then all those germs from after the war , you know , infantile paralysis , polio , psychoneurosis , fungusinfections  --  " " That 's right , Morris , the stamp machines people advertised the diseases . That 's how they made a go of it . " " That 's right , Harry . " " Morris , Morris , what an outfit you are . " Tea ? a cookie ? goodies , anybody ?  --  Bessie or Bernice passed through the room , poked their heads at the wrestling brothers , went away without an answer . Stanley hid from his uncle 's wrath . Naturally Morris lost his money . It was Harry 's money , but naturally he lost it . It was the way of the world . It had alwaysp131been that way with Morris and Harry . " It was n't my fault , " he said , whining as he had when a snot-nosed boy . " I ca n't help it . Listen , you did n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , with what you did with the Green Glade . What got into you ? You know nigger property always kicks you in the face . " " That 's my business , Morris . " " Sure , you done all right , sure . But you would a done better without the niggers . You could a done better someways . " " Stop nagging me , Morris . I ai n't married that I need you to nag me . " " I ai n't saying you 're not one of the biggest hotel men in the city , Harry . One of the biggest of the little hotel men , I mean . One of the fastest-rising , I mean . I 'm just saying you should get to the top , but you stopped climbing this way , Harry  --  as a brother I 'm just saying this  --  " " All right , Morris , just shut up as a brother . " " Just giving you friendly advice from my mental picture of your situation , that 's all . " Bowers began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on him . The stifling heat of this family , his being stuck in it like some responsible furniture , made him dizzy . He lived for fact and event , the responsible texture of buildings and money , but somehow always the mental pictures of others were put upon him  --  Jake 's and Gil Leary 's and those of Morris , Claire Farren 's , and even those friends of his , those nice people who liked his jokes at the Green Glade . He blew his nose and wiped his scalp and forehead and cheeks with his handkerchief . The sweat started again . It did n't help . He said to Morris , slowly at first , then faster : " In business you expect responsibility , but there 's a limit to everything . At least I know what I 'm doing . Let me ask you one now . Why should I have to carry my brother 's chin on my shoulder around with me ? Ip132got a little dent on the pad of my shoulder pad in all my suits . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just talking a little man to man .... " " From that ! From your chin ! Why ca n't he be a man like other people ? "  --  looking in appeal to the furniture of the room . No answer from furniture . No answer from lint in the pockets . " Other brothers do n't come whining around , suckingaround to gim me this , gim me that , it 's only a loan , lend me this , borrow me that , I 'll give you six per cent . It 's just like business . Just like . Morris , I been yelling at you all my life , leave me alone . File this away in your mental pixies . This is all I been yelling at you : Just leave me alone , Morris ! Please . I brought you over from the old country , should n't that be enough ? " " That 's enough , Harry . " " I found you a wife before I found myself one . I ai n't done it yet . Should n't that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went myself . I  --  " " Please , Harry , " Morris said , " that 's enough . They can hear you . They 're listening . " " I gave you money to pay the teachers , and why ? So you could tell me about mental pictures , you heard it on the radio . I found an apartment . Is n't that enough ? You wanted kids , all right , I practically paid for your children  --  " " Enough , Harry , "  --  warningly , the fat brother shrinking tight . " Please , I 'm asking you . " " You want kids , Morris ? Okay . I practically said that . You want kids ? Okay , I 'll fix it . Is n't that enough ? I practically got behind you and Bessie and pushed  --  " " Harry ! "  --  and bellowing this like an animal , Morris leapt at him . The sound did not come from his mouth , it was in his body 's spasm . " Harry ! "  --  now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighting him , carryinghim down , stifling him with its overfed smell of over/heated rooms and overcooked meat . Harry squirmed , his musclescontracting with revulsion , and he shook off this brother leaning on him and pounding him with soft little fists . Did this body resemble his own ? ' Was this inert weight the flesh of his flesh in America and the bone of the bone of his mother and father , dead faraway ? He pushed it off and it slid down onto a bare space beside the rug . That was enough , Harry . Suddenly Bernice and Stanley were there . Where had they come from ? Prying at the door ? Listening ? " Uncle Harry , did you do that ? " " Pa ! Look at Pa . Get up , Pa , you 're all right . " Harry , swaying and dizzy , stood while Morris rolled wailing on the floor . Why did n't he move onto the nice soft carpet ? " Ohh , ohh , my own brother Harry did this to me . " " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginary watcher over her shoulder . Harry looked at the rug onto which Morris now wiggled and thought , He should n't dirty it , I paid for that rug . He felt weak himself . It was all the sickness in this house . He did n't want to throw up now , he did n't want to do that in his brother 's house , even if he had paid for it . Morris was saying , " You 're not a real success story , Harry . No , you 're not a failure , I ai n't saying that , but you ai n't got more than me , a failure , got . " Weak , Harry Bowers rushed out , the tears choking him inside while he refused to let them speak their apology for what , yes , he had done to Morris . Inwardly they spoke to him and turned like frozen sins in his throat : My brother Morris did this to me , so I must have done something terrible to him . His heavy feet creaked on the loose boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Harry ! Uncle Harry ! It 's all right , wait a minute  --  "  | " No ! No ! " He ground the gears in starting off , and roared away in second . She ran for a moment along the curb by the side of his automobile , but he would not look at her . " I 'll explain it to you , Uncle Harry , " she was saying . " It 's like this  --  " All his life , all his love , Harry Bowers had been worrying about what he must have done to his brother . Bernice did n't have to hide it from him . She did n't have to tell him , either . He pulled into the center of the street so that , if she fell , he would not hit her.  |p135As  BOWERS HAD PREDICTED , HIS FRIENDS THE NEIGHBORS CAMEto nag and quack . Goldman came , McCormick came , Rasmussenvisited him . Crosset telephoned and gave him a piece of the Crosset mind . Anonymous letters warned him , and even threatened fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Glade Hotel could be a homemade stick of dynamiteattached to the starter of his Buick . It was possible , despite the gold key . It was mentioned , despite the silver monogram . Bowers did not worry . The bank came to worry about their loan and their mortgageand to inform him of their changes in policy toward him . They used the ritual words and the gestures of abstract financialcaution . Without worrying , Bowers grinned and let them play their charade . The bank was good at leaving everything out . The fire department inspections only took time . Sure , they demanded impossible conditions of the wiring . This meant money , and money that he did n't have . That was a thing to worry about , but later . First the solution , then the worry . The hell with them . Nothing he could do with the fire escapes or the electrical circuits or the pipes or the water of the drainage or the wiring could satisfy those who did not want Negroes in his Green Glade . That was a little game they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then there were the inspections of his books and licenses . And then there were the well-meaning talks by friends who only wished his own good and the good of the property values of all.  |p136And  Harry listened and grinned with his gold tooth and sucked his cheeks and said to all these worries : Later , later , friends . First look , then we 'll see . Jake too needed to have his say . Everyone knew  --  " Listen , the whole city knows "  --  that Harry Bowers was caught in a funny if not a monkey business . Jake remembered that Bowers did the relief once a week on the night shift . One coin Harry still held in his pocket to jingle on his new journey : the strength to embark . He could still sleep fast when he slept , and he could do without sleep when he needed the wakeful night . " Come out for a smoke , Mr. Bowers . " Jake figured what he would say . " I never see you on the street no more , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . The tree behind an iron fence on the lawn of the Old Folks Home across Prospect creaked on its roots , the wind droning in its branches as they fluttered before the blind windows . The old folks wandered or coughed aloud in their sleep , and one senile watcher crouched shivering on the fire escape , brushed by a bough from the elm . Down Prospect Avenue , the lights of the bars followed the lights of the hamburger joints in quitting for the night . Tires rolled by , pulsating quietly , each making its soft noise on asphalt as if crushing thousands of ladies ' watches laid out to be broken . Nice watches , nice ladies  --  the best . Bowers remembered when Audrey Sin , the fan dancer from the Merrytime Cafe , threw her watch into the street when her Smitty from the Autowash came home drunk with a female impersonater . And her good watch she threw , Harry recalled with approval . Scarzinski was her name , shortened to Sin ; Bowers called her a fan dancer because , old-fashioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stand on the curb with me and have a seegar , " Jake was hoping to be able to say . " Light up with me . I 'm offering . "  |p137Lovers  ' love on Prospect found preliminary doorways ; lovers ' quarrels found street lamps ; the long black avenue cooled under the moon . To the south , at the Flats , the sky reddened and darkened again with the somber false dawn of the blast furnaces . To the north , past the office buildings betweenProspect and Lake Erie , the lights of lake boats hung like beads at the horizon . To the west , the stores and the Public Square lay like dead ones at this hour . Up east , high on the first foothills of the Alleghenies , the lovely heights  --  Cleveland Heights , Shaker Heights , University Heights  --  housed the smooth ones of Prospect , and their wives smelling of Persian lamb , and their kissable daughters bored with piano lessons , and their sons wondering what comes after the shopping-center-gothicof Shaker High . The chimes from the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this too would pass . It was three o'clock in the morning . " No more hard feelings , Harry . This time I brung the smokes myself , " Jake was mumbling in rehearsal . Jake came ambling sideways to look for Bowers . He sniffed the air wafted all night from the fan at the entrance to the Athens Lunch . He pinched his own chin , taking pains to caress himself , the bruised flesh rewarded . His shadow , more long than his thoughts , stretched to the door of the Green Glade and past it . He went in . Bowers had not yet eaten the lunch brought in a bag by Jerry himself after he switched off the lights except for the anti-fly bulb and locked the front door of the Athens . Bowers had not touched his thermos , these things out on the desk before him . The bulb over his head illumined the scalp , taut as the green felt of a billiard table , and probed the tired flesh , tired especially at the cheeks and under the large moist eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couches and the lovely chairs going to waste . He stared toward his fixtures ; that 's the word in trade and at auctions . He did not move whenp138the screen door creaked open and shut , giving just enough space to admit Jake . " Never see you on the street no more , Mr. Bowers . " " Hello , Jake . " " What 's new , Harry ? " Bowers squinted up at him now at the sound of his first name . That was all right . " A few things , Jake . " " Gim me a frinstance , say . " " One or two things . " Bowers smiled for the first time . " Frinstance how this time you did n't come for money . That 's new . I got a sixth sense for seeing it . Frinstance I do n't think you came to loan from me . " " I did n't come to pay either , Harry , " Jake said mournfully , wanting Harry 's sixth sense to keep its credit . " It ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " They smiled easily at each other . Jake tilted his head and studied Bowers , measuring the bulky shoulders hunched over the desk . " What 's the matter , you do n't eat ? " he asked . " You 're losing weight , Harry . I 'm supposed to be the skinnen-bones around here . " " Not from calisthenics , golf , what you call . " Bowers motionedhim around the counter . " Sit down , take a load off . Listen , I got more sandwiches than I know what to do with . Have one , have a couple . " " Thanks , I 'm eating again . Do n't need it , thank you kindly . " I 'm doing all right , he wanted to make the jut of shaven skin say for him . " Sit down anyway , Jake , just for the sociability of it . What you eating ? How ? " " That 's an exaggeration , tell you the truth . I say I 'm eating with the mouth , bite here bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's just the same old thing . Gradual-like getting used to not eating . Well , that 's better if you go for it . " He eased himself into the chair . " I live off air and my old pals . "  | " This September breeze is sure nourishing , " Bowers agreed . " You and my brother Morris . So sit down and have a sandwich , eat . " For the first time Bowers permitted Jake behind the counter . He had unfolded a card chair for him . They scattered crumbs together on the table in front of the switchboard . There were no calls . There were no visitors in the lobby . A few rooms rented , in the others only the worn furniture settled and creaked . " Good sandwich , " Jake said . " Thanks . Passes the time . Passes the time . Jerry made it , the Athens Jerry . " " You tired , Harry ? " " No , thinking . " " That 's tiring , very fatiguing . You taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In business you got to , at least once in awhile . " " Passes the time ? " Bowers showed the tooth . " Me , personally , I do it for the pleasure these days . All I get out of it . " And they swallowed heavily and finished eating . Bowers poured coffee into the thermos cup and gave it to Jake . He drank directly from the jug , hooing with the heat . Good , even on a night like this . Hoo  --  and he wiped his lips with the back of his hand . Claire Farren , regular as the bank , was sleeping in the small dent on a hard mattress one floor above them . She was light and more slender than the bank , Bowers decided . Jake was saying : " What you gon na do about it , Harry ? " " What ?  --  what ? I 'll let you know . About what ? " " I hear the bank 's going to take the place away . " " I guess they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do first off ? Got their nippers onp140it ? Right away ? I got news for you , Harry . Kick out the coons , that 's what  --  " Bowers shrugged . " Who cares what 's on their mind ? Meanwhileit 's Harry Bower 's Green Glade , one of our finest . It 's mine . " Jake nodded to say , I know , 1 know . " So tell me what ? " Jake tried to tell him what . " You know I always liked you , Harry . That 's why I always done business even when I thought you might of cheated me by accident . By accident , I always knew you did n't mean it . I said by accident . " First Bowers thought : he 's hired . Then : no . No , if the real estate men , if the merchants , if the bank , if the Prospect gang wanted to find out , they would have sent a vice-president of something , they would never have thought of Jake . They would have sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reason in a briefcase and the bright glint of delegated power in the eyes . It would be much smoother . No , it would n't be Jake to discover if there were a secret price or a way in so much foolishness from that Bowers . He was just finding things out on his own , being useful to himself . " Glad to see you , Jake , " Bowers suddenly smiled , and clapped him on the back as he stood up , sat down again , leaned his chair back and rested his broad neck against the counter . " So you do n't think I ought to have colored , eh Jake ? Worried about the property for me , yah ? " It was nice to know two people like Morris and Jake who lived only for use , but there must be more like them . The world was full of them . It was reassuring to know of no one whom he could trust ; it was purifying to find Prospect and the world so pure . " You know it , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to do business with , a nice fellow . Gives a guy a boost now and then , a fin when he needs it . "  | " Sure , we did business together . " " You insured , Harry ? " " What ? " " Hurricane-flood-and-fire ? " Bowers liked this part , the part about not trusting him . " You been talking with Morris ? " he asked . A complex negotiationcould always wake him up . " Where you get your mental pixies ? My brother Morris ? " " Yeah , met him once . Knew him by smell once , but I never did business with him , Harry . Listen , sometimes a fire is a good way , sometimes not . Like any other business , depends on the setup , Harry . I 'm telling you straight now . I think you got the setup for it . Never talked business with Morris , though . " " All right , all right , Jake , do n't push , "  --  and Bowers tried not to smile with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't good business to smile , except before you start and after you finish . He frowned and smacked his lips and said : " I get my own ideas . " Jake , leaning toward him , grinned through his yellow lips . " I think , me , you already got this one , Harry . " And , with a deep tact , he fell back in his seat and lit the cigar that he had , after all , accepted from Bowers , and closed his eyes as he breathed the smoke , and made as if to forget their talk . The smoke swathed him in the heavy air . With the habit of night and the habit of confidence , he spoke of himself to Bowers . " I got a pa still alive , I 'm tired waiting for him to see things my way . Used to expect an inheritance , now nothing left . Nothing but old clothes , too wore out for hocking . The old bastard spent it all . Now he wants me to send him money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , Harry ? My ma used to have to sneak a quarter out of his pants for me . Sure , maybe if she had n't kicked off , sure ... " " What ? How ? " Arson , Bowers was thinking , the thoughtp142planted by Morris , being decked out and plumed by Jake . But only because I think about it , Bowers promised himself . " So how many worries you got , Jake ? " " He did it to her , he did . . . . " Jake squinted and watched him . " You could kill a pa like that , " he droned on . " Now he 's no bettern the Old Folks . You could piss him full of holes . You could burn him down with a fast swipe . " " Listen , Jake  --  " " But now it 's no good anymore . It 's too late . Too bad . The cash all leaked away anyway . " Bowers tried to master the shivering within himself  --  it was summer , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much of a business man , Jake . " " Aaah , come on , stop thinking at me . Lock up , Harry , want to go for a walk on Prospect ? I like this here street . Ai n't healthy to be mad at my pa . It 's a nice cool night out on Prospect . " " I 'm in business here , this street was a good deal for me . How can I lock up the place ? " He locked the cash drawer anyway , doubting that anyone would come in now . The timeclockwas set for the first riser at seven . Bowers remembered when the clock had buzzed at three for a short-order cook , Balcomb his name was , began with a B , and it kept on buzzing until the last steno was splashing herself out of bed . His Green Glade was almost empty now , Claire Farren insulated from the others by a row of empty rooms . Empty around her and empty around him . She was doing her job by sleeping alone . Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had business , tidied up before leaving the desk untended . He would never have done this before . He would have fired the clerk who left the desk for a smoke on the curb . " You should go maybe in the girlie business here . You got the nice location for it , " Jake said . He studied the ceiling critically . " The paint'sp143peeling off . Must of blistered from the pipes . Had the same trouble at the G. Washington . " " Okay , I 'm ready , do you want to go ? " " So what about the girls ? That 's another way of pulling yourself out of it . Some people like the twist-and-twirl business . There 's several ways . I can round you up a stable . " Bowers did not answer . It was an odd surprise to emerge suddenly from the electric night of his office into the chill pre-dawn of early September , remembering the heat of the day and this memory keeping him warm in shirtsleeves . They strolled along the walk . The leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell crisping like spent bills on the sidewalk about them . Jake accepted another cigar and lit for them both . Bowers relished the first lungful , then said : " You never mentioned your pa is still alive . " " Never asked me , Harry . " " What line 's he in ? " " The retirement business . Did it years ago . Used to peddle candles in West Virginia , long time ago , Harry , but he still blows off how he works for the biggest candle manufacturer in the country . Old prick . " " Is n't it ? " " Sure , maybe it is , but who uses candles anymore ? I could have the biggest saddle shop in Cleveland and it would n't be much to brag about . They do n't even put'em on Christmas trees anymore . Church candles is another line . " " That must have been a good business once , " Bowers pointed out , " before Edison muscled in . Those candle men were n't on their toes . They should of bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Edison , I was saying . " " Yeah , I suppose you 're right . During the war the army bought 'm again  --  candles . . . . " Jake huffed , appreciating the cigar . He hummed and spread his legs with pleasure as hep144strolled . " One of them great men , I think he was a philosopherI read once on the night shift , he said you got to learn to like your parents . Now you can take that any way you please , Harry . " " I never had any to remember . I left them behind . I rose fast because I only had to learn what I needed to rise . " " What ? " " You 'd think , the way I gab , I still had a full house , would n't you ? The Green Glade empty as the pint in your pocket . " Jake hee-hee 'd deliciously . " Yeah , you know when I read it , long time ago ? One night the G. Washington and your Green Glade both had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The feet sounded together on the sidewalk , and a nail in Jake 's heel caught against the cast iron trap which led to a gas main below . Street lamps above them flowered in the night sky , but the air was of morning ; the silence was of the hour just before morning in September . No , said Bowers to the Old Folks Home across the street , no , I got no children , I got no family but Morris , but no anyway , you 'll never get Bowers . Jake 's heel caught and  --  deliberately ?  --  he stumbled . Bowers held him by the elbow , but quickly let go . " Thanks , Harry . I burned your sleeve . " Bowers brushed the whitish ashes from the hair of his forearm . " That 's all right . " " You 're strong . You got big hands , Harry . You really caught me , right here . I can still feel your fingers . Thanks , Harry . " " That 's all right . We young fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brotherhood of Prospect , eh Bowers ? " Bowers pressed his lip with the gold tooth . " Cain and Abel were brothers , Jake . " " What hotel do they run ? " They strolled past a row of darkened stores , above them ap145single floor of apartments : above the shoe repair , the Athens Lunch , the Gaines Cleaning and Tailoring , the Novelty Shoppe which was the local collection agency for the numbers , the Used Magazines , a Nickel &; Up . A cab whooshed by with a woman sunk alone on the seat , a sly tilt to her head concealing what might have been a smile  --  one glimpse they both had as the cab took her downtown . " That one , she has her pleasure from men , " Jake said . What pleases her now so much alone ? Bowers wanted to ask . What pleases , say , Miss Farren ? Jake stopped and pointed to a dim light coming from behind a black shade . " Know who lives up there ? " " Sure , Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ai n't he ? What a brother-in-law . " " That 's what I 'm telling you , Harry . The hotel business is okay , but even normal circumstances you got to combine it . Notch house is the coming thing . Larry knows , he 's in on the bottom  --  Ginnie 's bottom , Jill 's bottom , Fat Sarah 's bottom . " " Ai n't exactly a little original enterprise like they write up in the Reader 's Digest , like growing mushrooms in your base-ment . " " Basic industry , I do n't care . There 's a real market on this street . Listen , Harry , working together , I guarantee we can clean up on the bachelor 's wives . I 'll shovem in , all you got to do is keep the girls happy . You can do that little thing , Harry . Everyone likes you , everyone loves you . All right , maybe you did n't care for this angle long as the Green Glade was making money , but now who 's asking you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't like renting rooms to niggers . Long as you pay off , hatch . But that comes out of the receipts . Like a commission . . . . " " Jake , you got your mouth full of snow . " The record player in Larry 's apartment , where he had three girls , three rooms , and a good business , with the customers , the clientele , the patients waiting in the hall to get thep146clap , was playing sweet music old by ten years . Get outahere .... " Snow in my mouth ? " Jake was saying . " What color ? Sure , I 'm snowed all right , but take your choice . Pick . Step right up and hold my hands , I 'm sticking by you , Harry . The way I figgered it , if you do n't like fire , this is your only out , Harry . " " You want to go into business with me , Jake ? A partners ? " Like the other men do ... . " We can work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had stopped , touching each other in discussion , prodding fingers , arguing under Larry 's window with the music soft in their ears in the four o'clock air . You got ta do right . . . . The rumble of a bus on Euclid reached dimly to the inner ear , but they leaned and whispered together in a doorway . Jeez , what we look like , Bowers suddenly thought . " Aaah , old Jake , what 's the matter with you ? " " It ai n't your line ? " " It ai n't my line , Jake . " " You do n't want it ? " " Listen , I do n't like it . Listen , you 're not a business man , you do n't know what you want from this line , Jake . I know you already . You just want to see where the legs grow from . " " Okay . " It was Jake 's turn to shrug and let his finger fold back into his fist . " I already told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only wanted to be helpful , Harry . " " Thanks for suggesting . " The record was played over and over again , suggesting from Larry 's place what Jake was suggesting down on the walk in the cold glimmer of a street-lamp : Why doncha do rightLike the other men doooGet outa hereAnd get me some money tooop147The music was aged and softened through pulled blinds and on the walls imperceptibly crumbled and softened by the night air . " Okay , okay , " Jake said as they moved on out of hearing . " You 're a pal anyway , my buddy . I do n't care . I 'll get you out of this anyway . We white folks got to stick together against the coons . " " What the hell does that have to do with it ? " " I heard how that college girl from the Association got you over the barrel . You do n't have to have secrets from me , Harry . Listen , they 're always pulling these tricks . Ever try to walk downtown ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Push Tuesday , Eleanor Day , all those tricks they got ? Okay , maybe it ai n't true , but I believe it anyway . Everybody got ideas . They 're in it for what they can get . " " Why do you keep telling me you 're my friend ? " " I am , I 'm a true pal of yours , Harry . " " Why ? " " No kidding . Do n't hide things from me  --  that dirty broad , I heard all about her . I 'll stick with you , Harry . " " Why ? " " I need you , I did n't say I was friends with anyone for nothing . I 'm in it for what I can get . " " That 's fine , fine , " Bowers said . " Now I know how come you 're my friend , we can get on back to the hotel . Something might be ringing . " Jake did not answer this time . He had caught a head cold and he snuffled . Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicker of orange light from the flats was giving way now to the cold gray glitter of dawn . The morning was really coming this time , coming gray , then coming yellow . When they passed Larry 's place again , the light was out behind the shade vibrating in the morning breeze , and the music which told them to do right , like the other men do , had gone to sleep with the girls . Maybe Larry was counting the cash on ap148bed in the dark upstairs . Maybe he was watching from the windows . Bowers did n't like it and did n't care for the life of Larry , getting his profit from legs other than his own . The street was clearing from the sidewalks up , it almost seemed , from the black asphalt up , and soon the street lamps would blush away . The day was coming to Prospect for the unsteady feet in rubbers of the women who did n't know what they wanted , for the hard adventuring heels of the fellows at the " Y , " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy perforated Florsheims of the commuters who came to Prospect for what they could take away . They could play up the spiritual angle , like the recruiters for Alcoholics Anonymous , or tell the truth about it , as Bowers was trying to do . The hotel business could be the truth about everything , he was thinking , but then you got to discount it , too , and not just ten days after the first of the month . Already , deeply agreeing with Jake , he was prepared to listen to him . Jake had been speaking of fires he had known : " Personally , you might almost say , " he grinned , his own sharpie shoes grating against eroded cement . " You know how to do it ? "  --  not trusting Jake , wanting to inflate his risks in tribute to a time of inflation by not trusting him , and then trusting him anyway . " Otherwise I got some friends can get the niggers out for you . Nothing on the premises . Just persuasions , Harry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm glad , Harry . That 's a dirty business , anyway . Really glad . I 'd rather settle it this way . Fires are clean , a little cotton , a little alcohol , better still a little film scrap , not much more . " " You can do it ? " The sideways wiggle and the shyness spread in the widening flaw of dawn . This was only for him , for Harry , out of the best of feelings . " I 'm practically a pro at this thing , Harry.  |p149I  done it already , a little job or two , Harry , but I ai n't telling you where . I 'm clever that way . One thing you can be sure of though , I 'm not a rich man today  --  you know that  --  and it shows how honest and aboveboard I am . I never blackmailed nobody yet . I could of many a time . " " You 're too nice a fellow , eh ? " " That 's right , and I 'm smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Jake did n't throw away the dead butt he carried in his mouth . " You 're a wise one , Jake , " gaining time by this  --  " only you ca n't help yourself . " " That 's why I need you , Harry . You got the business sense , I got the know-how . We can work together . Help yourself , please . " Jake had put his hand on Bowers ' shoulder with a long shy smile in his butter-crumb face , a smile which held the cigar stump . Harry shook off the hand , but made as if only to be walking away . " You can do that ? " he asked . " What ? " " What we been talking around . Make a fire . " " Never been caught at it yet , Harry . I 'll need help . " " Well , just supposing . Just supposing for the sake of conversation . There 's me . " " Okay , okay , "  --  efficiently and abruptly in charge , and the ingratiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night crawler lay lost in its expedition from a sewer grill . Jake did not see ( Harry did ) how his shoe smeared the worm . " Okay , " Jake was saying , " all right , so you 're good enough in lots of places , but I need more than that . I 'll need somebody else . Hate to work alone , too nervous . We got to get somebody who maybe had experience , who wants to learn the business , who wo n't talk . We  --  " We , he was saying to Bowers , who had always been partnersonly with himself and his idea of himself and his enjoy/ment of himself , a real partnership because the Harry Bowers and the idea and the pleasure all really existed for him . " Wait a minute , " he interrupted . " Wait . I 'll let you know , Jake . " It was practically arranged . They were beginning to set it up . Bowers liked more talk , a drink , a bite to eat , a chat or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement was made . The September morning flamed up in violet and orange along the buildings to the east of Prospect . It was really day , and there was no retreat to the illusions of night anyplace along Prospect . Larry 's girls were probably sound asleep , and the record player cool by now . " Wait , wait a minute , " Bowers was saying . " I 'll need somebody else . We ca n't do it alone , or at least we wo n't like it . " Harry took a long breath as they turned up the steps to the Green Glade . This last free breath was held below , in the night of his lungs , so that it came whistling out , already old , to be dissipated in carbon dioxide in the sky above Prospect , in the rose-colored morning clouds married to the spume from the mills of Cleveland . " I can get you Morris , " he said.  |p151HARRY  HAS TAKEN THE LATE SHIFT AGAIN SO THAT THE NIGHTman can try out a new bed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't sleep no more anyway . Like this it 's relaxing from my cares and aggravations , the way Morris says it . " There has been good news today . Smitty , chief of the Autowashcrew at the Driv-Ur-Self , has come back to the Green Glade out of friendship for Bowers and because he could n't find a nicer place on Prospect . Of course , this is not a sign of anything but Smitty 's love of comfort and Harry 's jokes , but good news helps the week along anyway . He goes on at eight in the morning , and now at two A.M. he 's asleep in his room when Audrey Sin comes in to see him . Her hair fans out down her back like a broom sweeping this expanse of flesh , and her muddied eyes , amorous of herself , are lost in cheeks orange with stage makeup . Her eyes try to take something from him but ca n't , eyes sooty with insomniaand mascara , the pupils swelling like barnacles fattened against the brain . She does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's where the sailor boys come off the docks , and that 's where Smitty met her . Next year she wo n't have it so good . " Smitty , please , " she says to Bowers , lifting her head and her purse with the authority of love . " I ca n't ring him now , Audrey . He 's asleep . " " Tell him it 's me . " " Sorry , Miss Sin , "  --  Bowers managed not to show his gold tooth at her name . " He left instructions . " " Just connect me to him on the phone . " " I ca n't . Why do n't you call in the morning ? "  | " It 's morning now . Put him on the line . I 'm lifting the re-ceiver . " Bowers shakes his head slowly . She makes a little mouth with her big one and wiggles her head in response . With tipsy care she shakes her head closer to his over the counter and studies him as he takes up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little-girl voice , her breasts like Monday'smelons at the supermarket . " I 'm sorry , Miss Sin . " Her head moves pityingly , shedding perfume as she says , " What a guy . " " Why what-a-guy ? Who ? " " Yes , why ? " " I asked you to say , Miss Sin . " " You I mean , Mr. Bowers . " Still with the same pout and wheedle , she says : " I wan na speak to my hushban , please , you filthy nigger-loving son of a bitch . He is too waiting for me . " " I 'm sorry , Audrey , but he 's unavailable for comment . He hit the sack at ten o'clock , instructions not to be disturbed . There 's a blue plug in his hole in the switchboard . " Miss Sin leans pensively on the register and reaches one exquisitelypink hand across the counter . " There 's a blue plug in his hole , " sings Audrey Sin . " **42;7880;TOOLONG . Take the plug out , please , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You mother-loving bastard you . " Bowers reasons with her , lifting his shoulders and palms to explain . " I 'm sorry , Miss Sin , but look at it this way . He works all day and a man needs his sleep . He asked me , he said , Mr. Bowers , I do n't want no one to disturb me for nothing . That 's final . Not for anyone , he said , not even my mother that loves me truly . " " Did he say me ? Did he mean me , I ask you ? Did he mentionAudrey Scarczinski by name ? "  |p153Harry  tries to be fair . He considers . " I do n't know , but he might of . That might of been in his mind . " She starts to cry . He feels as if he were in a movie where one actor suffers from the heat and another is powdered cool . The sweat makes creases in Audrey 's face ; the tears run in streams with the creases ; he feels his own skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom collides softly with the hotel register as she sobs . " I 'm sorry , Miss Sin , " he says , pretending not to have noticed the slip which gives away her real name instead of the stylish Merrytime one . " Sorry , you think you 're sorry , " she weeps . She wails , curses , sobs : " All I wanted to speak was with my hushban . He promised we get married soon 's he gets to be chief of the crew . " After awhile Harry has to put her out . He has to say , " Get outa here , move , Miss Sin , " and he has to stand up to throw her out . It hurts him to do it . It hurts him to interrupt his evening like this and it hurts him to hurt her feelings . He has to do it because her tantrum is turning the alcohol rancid within her , and there is no living with her at all . Not that Harry wants to live with her . He guides her gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back tomorrow , Audrey . I 'm sure he wants to see you tomorrow . " Smitty , who has been hiding behind a couch in the lobby , crawls out on his hands and knees to say , " Thanks , Mr. Bowers . I really appreciate it . " " That 's all right . I did n't see you there . " " I snuck up . " " That 's what I figured . Dust off your hands , they 're dirty . The maids shovel all the dirt behind there . " " Naturally , when I heard something I snuck upstairs from downstairs . "  | " Figured that . " Smitty stands up , flips a toothpick out of his mouth , and offers Harry a fresh one . " No ? Okay , I give up cigarets , that 's why I pick the teeth . Picked the teeth all the way sneaking up . Listen , Mr. Bowers , I can wash a whole car every three and a half minutes at the Minut Auto Wash Department , Driv-UrCar , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that out . I 'm not so smart . Look at me and Aud honey . I never should of got mixed up with show people . I admit my mistake , Mr. Bowers . They stay up so late at night . " Bowers catches a glimpse of Audrey on the sidewalk , her arms triangled to her blue satin gown , her wrists pressed against her hips and her hands dangling to make punctuation twitches of indignation . " Better get your mistake below , " he says , " she 's coming back . " " Jeez , show people , I 'm gon na lose my strength one of these days , " Smitty murmurs , disappearing . Harry watches the muscular lope around a corner , readying itself for sleep , loosening its belt in anticipation , secure against intrusion while Bowers meets Aud honey for him . " Okay , where 's Smitty ? " she asks . " Not to be disturbed . " " I 'll give you one . " " Do n't do that . Thought you went away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't do that either . Remember how you broke the watch ? " She throws her purse . It falls to the floor , Harry dodging with the heavy agility of the healthy fat man . He grunts and bends to pick up the lipstick , compact , nail polish , cards , change , mirror , keys , and other details which spill out . " Give me my purse , " she orders him . " Do n't throw it at me , Miss Sin . I 'll give it to you if you promise to be a good girl . " He stops himself and wonders howp155she could fulfill the promise . He does n't want to discourage her . " Promise not to do that again , " he says . " Who gave you the right to keep my personal purse ? I 'm a citizen , ai n't I ? " " Just a minute , I 'm picking up your stuff . Why do n't you leave the picture album at home ? Promise you wo n't throw it again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still alive . Give it to me . " A sly squint takes her eyes . " I promise , " she says . He hands her the purse . " You bastard , " she says , and heaves the purse at him . This time he is ready and catches it . " Okay , I 'll give it to you tomorrow , " he says . " Give me my purse , I want my hushban , " she says . " You ai n't got the right . You lousy mugger . You purse-snatcher . " " Miss Sin , I 'll keep it till morning and then give it to you when you 're sober . Like this I 'll get hotel maid 's knee from bending down to pick up your stuff , I do n't care if it 's your father 's snap . " " Tell you what , give me the purse , it 's my bag , and I promise to go away if you call my hushban . Smitty , Room 104 , please . " " Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll write your name on the purse in the cash drawer . On a little piece of paper . " " Ring twice , please . He do n't hear so good when he 's sleeping . Works too hard at working . " " Just come and ask for it tomorrow , the manager will have it for you . " She decided to try a more advanced bargaining with him . " Give me my purse , you purse-snatcher , you mugger , you nigger-loving  --  " " Just a minute , Miss Sin , I want to ask you a question . Listen . "  | " You probably got my Smitty shacked up with a high yellow , and I can have you arrested , bet you did n't know he 's my hushban . Bigamy 's a crime . Bet you  --  " " Listen , by God , Aud honey ! " She composes her face primly and remarks , " I 'm listening . Ask me one . " " Did you promise me , yes or no ? Did you promise me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning thought passes over the soft flesh . " That 's two questions , " she cries . " You 're trying to take advantage of me . Help ! help ! Gim me my purse , my bag . " Harry shakes his head , picks up the telephone , and begins to dial the police number very slowly , hoping that she will calm herself . " Look , Audrey , you 're making me do this . I do n't want to see you hauled away . Why do n't you sleep it off someplace else ? If you have to do it in jail , it 'll cost you a couple days ' pay . Okay , Aud ? " " Give me my purse , " she says , " you bastard , give me . " They stare at each other over the counter , both waiting for the police car . Here 's another night when he wo n't have time to read the paper . While they wait , Smitty suddenly pops his head into the lobby . " Hiya , Aud honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By this time she has almost forgotten that she had come to see Smitty the Hushban . " Mr. Bowers took my purse , " she says . " He wo n't give it back , so I called the cops . " " Come on downstairs , " Smitty says . " Do n't worry , Mr. Bowers is a good guy . He 's one swell fella for my money . Come on , Aud honey , I 'll take care of you . " " No , " she says . " Why not ? Hurry up , the cops are coming . " " He got my purse , " she says . " That 's all right , come on . We 'll pick it up tomorrow . " She blushes . " Ca n't , " she explains.  | " Why not ? " Lisping and turning on the toes of her pale blue slippers , she says : " Mr. Bowers has all my equipment in his cash drawer . I carry it in my purse , so to speak . " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Get on your roller skates , the squad car just pulled up . " " Thanks for the bag , " Aud honey calls back over a pink vista of shoulder . By the time that the two policemen had entered the lobby , their clubs swinging at their too-tight desk-cop pants , Audrey and Smitty were gone and Bowers was reading the newspaper . " Where is she ? " one asked . He lay his club on the counter . " Lit out , " Bowers said . " Sorry , boys , she took off when she heard me call you . Like a cork in the bottle . I jiggled her too much . It 's all right , she was only drunk . " The other policeman , a small man with steel-rimmed glasses , weak watery eyes , and quiet ways , leaned his elbow on the desk pen and broke the point and articulated carefully , " Where , is , she ? Either we take her in or we take you in . " He squeezed a sick tear from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bowers asked . " Now boys , that is n't nice . I 'm going to have to buy a new pen . I ca n't help it if she sobered up all of a sudden . " " She 's in one of the rooms , Bowers , lead us to her . We know this broad . We had her before . " " What do you mean , had her , Officer ? " " None of your cracks , Bowers . We know about you , too . " The other said : " You called us for her , now we want her . " " Otherwise it would practically be obstructing justice and we 'd have to take you in . Lead us to her . " " What if she left the Green Glade ? " " But she did n't , Bowers , " said the small nasty one with the steel-rimmed glasses.  |p158The  two policemen gazed piously at each other 's caps and waited . The small one tilted his nose up to see better . It 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then : Well , if I let her get away with this now , she 'll never believe me . He remembered the Code of the Hotel Manager : If You Make a Threat , Fulfill It Through . He shrugged : So it was n't his fault . He was n't soft-hearted enough to be soft in the head . " Okay , boys , " he said , and they followed him down the hall and then to the half-floor below to Smitty 's door . Grimacing happily as if it were a head instead of a door , the one in glasses struck the door with his club . " Open up , " he said . Open ! the club said .. " Awright , " came Smitty 's thick voice . The door opened and started to yawn . Thinking better of it , he clopped his mouth shut . " Who 're you ? " " Name , " said the other , " rank , and serial number . " " Huh ? " Smitty asked , reluctant with jokes . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small shy voice from deep in the darkness of the room : " He 's my hushban . " The hushban then said , " Smith , William Everett . I did n't do nothing . " " Switch on the light . " Bowers interrupted . " Look , boys , let 's leave them alone . Everything 's quiet here now . Let 's not look for trouble , what do you say ? " " Listen , Bowers , you preferred charges  --  " Harry knew his out now . " No I did n't , Officer , I never preferred charges . " " You called the station  --  " Be reasonable , Officer . I complained about a noise , a littlep159disturbance , but now the noise is gone , listen yourself , so how can I say ? There ai n't even a mouse-peep . I never preferred no charges . " The weak-eyed one said , " What you mean is , Bowers , we ca n't pick her up unless you identify her . " " Yah , I do n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be mighty ornery if we made this trip for nothing . We left a little game to come to see you , Bowers . We were just talking about you with our little game . You better speak up . " " I apologize , Officer , I 'm satisfied now . I do n't have time to go to court , they keep you waiting all day . I 'm just in business here . Why do n't you be too ? " The two policemen looked at Harry , and he noticed with surprise that they were breathing heavily , their tunics stained at the armpits and the spots spreading , their wishes itchy and vindictive behind their policeman faces . Smith , William Everett , still standing in the doorway , scratching himself , lookingfrom one to the other , asked : " Can I go back to bed now ? I got to get up in the morning . " One of the cops shut the door while Smitty stood there , not moving until it clicked against the jamb , and then Harry was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face , he guessed that Smitty had walked over to spit in the wash basin . If I ever burn the place , Bowers thought , I 'll have to make sure everyone gets out . God , I hope Smitty wo n't be drunk . Through the door , now shut , the three of them heard the sobs of Miss Audrey Sin . She must have bent to the keyhole to weep through it , " I 'm no good for nothing , Harry . Smitty can tell you , but you know it already . I 'm sorry , Harry , I know I give you a lot of trouble . You ca n't hide it from a hushban . I 'm not a bad girl , but I 'm no good either . " She blubbered and choked , bending like that , and Harry imaginedp160her soft fat rump high and rotating with her sorrows as she called to him : " I 'll make it up to you , Harry . You could keep my purse , that 's for a start . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodnight , " Bowers said . " I forgive you and you got your bag already . " He led the two policemen back down the hall , the taller one tapping his club against the doors , sounding them , the weak-eyed one in steel-rimmed glasses lagging in meditation of how to get back at Bowers for pulling them away from their little game and for making his own private little game . At last he wiped the crudded corner of his eyes with his pinkie , kept clean for this purpose , and said : " About how many niggers you got here , Harry ? " " What do you mean ? " " I mean rough count . You got figures , ai n't you ? " The other chimed in rhythmically : " Oh me , Harry Bowers , he do n't know the difference . He 's color blind , that Bowers . " " Nothing wrong with trouble with the eyes , I got them too . You know , just give us an idee , Harry-man . We just want to know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to check my register ? Looking for anyone in particular ? The house is just about empty tonight . No transients . " He noticed with interest that the cops , who had always called him " Mr. Bowers , " or at the most familiar , " Bowers , " now addressed him by saying : " Hey , Harry , I bet you got a good deal here . Got yourself all fixed up ? Let 's see your papers , license , the other licenses , too , register , receipts . You taking numbers on the side ? What about it , Harry ? " And he answered : " They 're all there , Officer . " The two policemen knew that Bowers would not complain , although what they did was illegal . It was worse than illegal to complain ; it was bad business . Whatever he was , he was n't stupid , that Bowers . They went systematically through hisp161records and files , upsetting , dirtying , scattering . They did it for the pleasure in it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it coming after being in right for so many years , because Bowers was a nigger-lover . They really saw life in their line of work , and he had no right to fool with things  --  that Bowers , though he was hot one time . The telephone slips , the laundry receipts , the room cards , the cancelled checks , the duebills , the tax records , the ledgers ,  --  all the official papers which Bowers took pleasure in handling himself in a neat tongue-wetting hand which was a surprise to those who knew Harry 's lazy ways . Even the stationery and envelopes . Could Aud honey have been in on this ? No , she was a nice girl , a sweet kid . It was their own idea , and they did n't need an excuse . It was what the Green Glade and Harry Bowers had coming all the way round now . He had put himself on the outside . Once his own and everybody 's pal , he was no one 's but Harry 's now . He showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , who had a purse for daytime and a bag or two for dress-up . He watched them without blinking , remembering in his large moist eyes , and only talked softly to them as they worked . He discouraged them as much as he could . They could n't help hearing him : " I always kidded on the square with you fellows , and now you do n't even hear me asking for a warrant . Not only are my books in order , Officer , but I paid off to the big policemen'sfunds and all the little policemen 's little turkey funds . Listen , did Howie send you down here ? Captain Fransky ? It ai n't legal at all . I do n't even rob a little on the hotel taxes anymore , does n't pay . Listen , I used to do fine without it , and I would n't do good with it today , the way conditions are in the Green Glade . Listen , if Captain Fransky sent you  --  " They were dumping his files . " Listen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish Bath . Only yesterday , no , the day before , he was telling me I got the smoothest feet he ever saw  --  not a callous on them , not a bunion anyplace  --  and today he brings me this kind of trouble . A fine friend . It ai n't even legal , much less justified , what you 're doing there . Listen ! Lay off the cigarets . We got a machine if you want a smoke . When Fransky lent me his towel in the showers , it was only pretending , he 's not a friend . Look what you 're doing to my change drawer . " Hotel Registry , Cash Sheets of Green Glade Hotel , Room Cards , Receipt Book . " They all say the same thing , boys , only some say the price and some say what time to wake them up for work . " And some were for the government . Bowers always reminded himself when he forgot . When they had finished , leaving one , maybe two days work cleaning up behind them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses said : " Find anything ? " " Nope , you ? " " Nope . Not even the picture of a coon . " " Jeez , you smell anything ? Smells bad in here . " " Sure , smells like hair straightener to me , what do you think ? Well , so long , Harry , "  --  and wiped away another thick sick tear . Bowers waited for them to go . They strode out to their patrol car , their legs tight with pride in their blues , their backs erect and unwearied by this satisfaction . He knew it was no use to complain . This was official . If he had n't called them tonight , they would have come anyway tomorrow or the next day . It was a special detail . Howie Fransky would n't lift a finger . Poor Aud honey , she did n't want to do this to him . Bastards . Let them burn . Bowers reached in the cash drawer and took a pull from the bottle he kept there . It was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They used to want his account.  |p163There  was no smell of money in the drawer tonight , but the drink swished good in his mouth and felt even better going down . Let them all burn , except Smitty and Aud , maybe . I ca n't afford to get mad , Harry thought , but I can save it up . I can pile it up.  | " HEAR THEY REALLY LANDED ON YOU LAST NIGHT , " JAKE SAID . " How 'd you find out ? " " The whole street knows . Fat Sarah down at the notch house told me . They 're awfully sorry , Harry . They really like you down there . " " Aah , this 'll blow over . I been in business before . Wait a sec till it blows over . " " Harry , let me advice you something . This ai n't going to blow . The girls do n't care , frinstance , but that Larry does . Hurts business . Runs down the neighborhood . " " They can soak the colored just like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to explain . " Yeah , but it ai n't all money . It 's the principle plus the angles . There 's always angles . Frinstance , even if the girls do n't mind , it ai n't good for the stable . That 's different , Harry . I do n't know how to put it  --  espree the corpse , like I read one time . Now take Ginnie , she 's from the north or south Carolina . She ai n't particular , she 'll take on a polite nigger when business is slow , so long as he knows his place  --  " " Between the legs , " Bowers said . As if he had not heard the interruption , Jake went on explaining the facts of Prospect to Harry Bowers , who had almost invented this street . He had been on it that long . " So long as he knows his place and pays a twin extra . But it 's ver-ry del-i-cate to understand . The girls figger it out . You can take on a coon once a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something special you want , but that 's the limit . And no round the world . No fancy stuff . " " But you charge him fancy . "  | " Natch , Harry . Jeez ! This is business , ai n't it ? Like you said , Prospect is zoned for business , ai n't it ? " He squinted sideways at Bowers . " Say , Harry , how 'd you ever do so good ? Now I do n't see it . That 's what I wanted to know . " " I changed my mind , Jake . " Bowers was shaking his head and repeating this : " I changed my mind , but that 's how I did so good . But now I changed my mind . " Jake cracked his knuckles and looked at Bowers . " I just do n't see it anymore , " he said with a long happy smile . He squirmed and squinted at the Green Glade 's desk , his skinniness mitigated by enlarged joints : knuckles , knees , elbows . He exercised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped and crumpled away . Constantly tired , his body twitched in faithful movement , gyrating and jiggling for Harry 's pleasurewith the weak gestures of vice . They took their walk again this evening . It was a habit . Jake understood that Harry was waiting , was figuring , was finding him out . " Ever talk to that nigger gal of yours , Harry ? " " Claire Farren ? Knocked on her door . " " Let you in , eh ? " Bowers moved off the porch of the Green Glade and breathed the heavy wet September air of Prospect , hot with asphalt and sun , wet as the backroom of a laundry . He looked to the flats and the constant ebb and rise of flush in the sky over the mills , and the hum of fire beneath in the furnaces along the Cuyahoga River . The boil of this city , this September , was a skilled-work boil , paint factories , tool shops , clever manufacturings . Some of the plants were moving east and south to glass brick homes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **33;7924;TOOLONG , paid for out of high-tax dollars . But the docks could not be transformed , nor the boats , the heaps of ore , and the smell of the flats . Still , this city was moving . ( " Hey , Jimmie , " a kid was yelling to another with a crippledp166cat cornered against a curb of Prospect , " lemme fracture her skull , willya ? " ) The Bohemians were getting used to Yank Yankovich and his polkas , the Negroes were getting used to holding Baptist services in the synagogues of twenty years ago , the Jews were forgetting Sunday bagel-breakfast in favor of brunches as they moved into the comfy Heights , the Hungariansof the South Side were sending advance parties among the Irish and Germans of Lakewood , the Russian Orthodox churches were finding their picnics deserted for the A. F. of L. clambakes , the cocktail hour at the Carter brought foremen from Jack &; Heintz among the graduates of Case Institute of Technology and the Western Reserve Law School  --  speedy Cleveland was on the move . So were Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , eh ? " Jake repeated . " Who ? " " Ai n't you listening , Harry ? Want to do something else maybe ? We was talking about that nigger gal . " " I told you she did n't . I do n't bother her . " " Did n't even let you in ? " " No , she talked to me . " So what 'd you find out from that , Jake ? Bowers asked himself as the man squirmed by his side . He had the insisting fidgets , that Jake . He twisted and danced as if he wanted to pee . Claire Farren was n't his business . The Green Glade was not properly his business . And yet , Bowers had to admit , Jake had somehow managed to make Harry his business . It was because he wanted to  --  look at his sideways wiggle  --  just as Harry had wanted to own a hotel , a real nice one , not a scratch house or a bull pen , and so had captured the Green Glade . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold tooth  --  the world 's got to give it to you . It 's the lucky way things are . Look what that Miss Farren got from him for nothing . Everyone was like that . Desire , like money ,  |p167is  nice ; desire , like money , is irresistible when the squeeze is put on by clever hands . Soft coaxing hands like Claire Farren 's , twitchy hands like Jake 's , heavy demanding hands like his own . Even look at the way that cop last night squeezed the juice out of his eyes . The mental pixies of Morris , and only these , rode no hands and skinned their knees around the corners . " We 'll have to pick up the celluloid scrap , " Jake was saying , " but I can do it . " " What ? " " Just thinking . You got sharp ears , Harry . I 'd of sworn you was dreaming , but you never sleep . What 's the matter you never sleep ? " Bowers chuckled and pulled back his shoulders and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I just never had time to get a pillow . From the old country I brought a bag of down my mother saved up for me , goose feathers , soft stuff , you know , and that was all I ever got from them . My ma got killed in the first war , I think . I carried those feathers , that goosedown , I mean , around with me for years , but I never made a pillow from it . Then I left it in Indianapolis one time . It was too soft for a working man . This is the land of opportunity , Jake , and who needs pillows ? " " We need celluloid , " Jake replied , " because it 's bettern gasoline and bettern cotton soaked in alcohol . It do n't leave no trace . Me , I can get it thout no questions . " " Tell you what I mean when I say this is the land of opportunity , Jake . Take the stock market , for instance . Know how , you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even say how-do-you-do to a customer , just folding it in and foldingit out and reading that paper , whatcha-call-it , The Wall Street News . " " What kind of joists you got in the basement ? Plaster over it , Harry ? We ought to get to work one night now , eh ? "  | " Journal it is , not News . Listen , not that I think that 's the good way to make it , but it 's easy if you know how , they say . Personally , I like smelling an unmade three-fifty bed now and then , and I tell the housekeeper , Make up No. 126 , please , Miss McCollom , we got a party coming over . " " You 're not listening to me , " Jake complained . " You ai n't paying no tention tall . Tell you what  --  " He lit his cigaret as if he wanted to protect the match from the eye of the wind and the sight of the flaming eyeball of the September moon over the flats , squinting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself than with the wind and the moon . He let Bowers take the first step over each crack in the sidewalk , breaking his mother 's back again , crossing on it , braving the ill luck ; and over the edge of shadow , also , and past the sight of a darkened window or a closed-down storefront , which are known to bring bad fortune . His eyes , soft and squeezed when he did this , leeched themselves to Harry 's fat gaze . " Tell you what I 'm gon na do , Harry , " Jake said . " I 'm gon na show you some relaxation before we talk business . Everybody needs some relaxation when he makes up his mind . I got a friend she runs a circus over in Little Hollywood on Hough Avenue , in a kind of rooming-house-type zoned house she got over there . I used to send the kids at the G. Washingtonover for the show . The brats , I mean . Nancy does a nice job over there . Makes a nice living out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , Jake . Never knew there was a circus in town . Nancy What ? " " You have to know her last name to get your licks in at a circus ? Come on . " " I do n't know , Jake . . . . Always thought those stag parties was free-lance stuff , not contract booking . Not benefit performance . Never particularly went for it personally , but naturally I could see  --  " Jake whistled and flapped his arms like a scarecrow . " Cab ! "  |p169The  taxi slid to the curb and the door came open . " Listen , Harry , Nancy 's got a good business there . Runs a company store with it , too . Worth looking into , Harry . Maybe it 's the instead for the celluloid and the wood shavings , and I could be your runner . Do n't you think you owe yourself something at least to see how a good business runs ? " Harry did n't even stop him at the nudge . He had come pretty far along already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry . Always a shortage . " That about the business seemed to convince Bowers . Business was a value in America , a good thing , and profitable business was respectable even if it were a circus , the marks a dozen verts with their dead hopes hanging out while a house girl and a pimp limbered up for them . Why , with that kind of business , a man could settle down in a nice home in the Heights , a lawn for the gardener and a sled for each of the kids in the garage , wall-to-wall carpeting inside . If he were married , that is , and if he had a wife . Personally , Bowers liked a business with more work and show to it . A different kind of show . The gimmick in the circus business was that you did n't show what meant anything and went someplace . You kidded them along with what did n't . Jake was humming in the cab , humming happily under his breath a song that Harry recognized : You got ta do right Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake , you like this kind of stuff ? How queer can you get ? " " Pretty queer , Harry , pretty queer sometimes . " " You kid-simple ? You like it that way ? " " No , why ? Interested ? Listen , I can get you  --  " " Never mind , Jake , just asking . " Jake grinned . " You 're no kid , Harry . "  |p170Bowers  answered his smile with the gold tooth in the rich darkness of the back seat of a taxi , saying : " You 're no painted Willy , Jake . " This was the area of Cleveland  --  " The Forest City , " " The Convention City , " " City of Homes , " " The Best Location in the Nation , " " Where Coal &; Ore Meet , " the friendliest city in the mid-west  --  which was known as Little Hollywood , a land of bars and drunks and love on the run and love lost forever and fast love , too , and free money and fast money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Even the drug stores , their windows illumined for spell-it-backwards remedies and wine-to-go , jittered with the dangerous happiness of a carnival stall . In the swelter of Indian Summer , the kids skated under the streetlamps around the negotiators of all commodities now holding conference : the men selling stolen sweaters or sweaters they called stolen , the girls selling themselves , the boys selling the girls . " Feel this gen-u-wine nylon , feel it . Soft ? Nice for the girlfriend ? "  --  just one spark could turn the girlfriend into a torch . The policemen , keeping order , scowled at the kids playing handball against the building which was the place of business of Nancy 's Garfield House . The rhythmic plop-plop-plop of tennis ball against brick disturbed the more profitable and widely shared rhythms inside . Swooping mockingly on roller skates over asphalt , the younger kids waited for the cops to yell , " Scram ! Beat it ! " Then they would unsling the skates and vanish down an alley , the phalanx at one mind on pleasure  --  leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes in an open window on a fire escape , capturing a girl and taking her into a garage . In the meantime , a chorus sang before Nancy 's place :  |p171Jack  Armstrong never tired of it and neither will youPause . For the benefit of Bowers and Jake , they hawed and punched each other in the ritual laughter of children . They tried a sly syncopation : So just tryyyy WheatiesThe best breakfast food in the landThe circus  --  ' exhibition ' to the entertainment directors of men 's clubs , peepshow ' to the prosperous farmers from southernOhio , spectacle ' to the slickers from east of Erie , Peeay , circus ' to the businessmen and ladies of love  --  was a specialty trade in this neighborhood which produced excitement on an assembly line , from money to liquor to tease to roll-around to sleep-it-off , finito , the very end . The circus was a short circuit . The circus went past the end . The circus was something refined , according to Jake : " That Nancy frinstance , she 's the very end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get to know her . " " But in the meantime ? " " The very end , Harry . " " She a friend of yours , Jake ? " " Par-tick-a-lar . Listen , did n't I tell you how I love every-body ? " " Come to think of it now , Jake , you mentioned it one time . " Bowers showed the tooth . " Specially the suckers . Specially the suckers , Harry , that 's why they trust me . They feel it inside . " " Always the commission man , eh ? I do n't trust you , Jake . That 's why I 'm stalling . " Jake huffed through his cigaret until the ash tipped off . " I know , Harry , I know , but it do n't worry me none . It ai n't thatp172you 're not a mark  --  you are , friend  --  but I really like you , you used to be a businessman yourself , you used to be with it and for it . That makes all the difference . Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have to tell me that . You 're a friend . I like you so much I do n't need reminders . " " I was just going to , " Bowers grinned . They were standing with the kids , and although they sang , joyful carolers in September , of how Jack **26;7959;TOOLONG , he heard the first song he had sung with Jake : You got ta do right Get outa hereAnd get me some money tooo " You do n't understand , Harry , I 'm rilly a soft-hearted john . " " I understand , you got a heart like a whore 's belly . A mark yourself sometimes . " " That 's right , Harry . You see right through me like I was the transparent lady . Sometimes I cry when I pull the wings off a fly , that 's how soft I am . " Like some other men d000 . . . . If he thought Bowers was through with business , well , he had another little think coming . The moon , inflamed by urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above them in the street . The mood was for loitering , for the to-and-fro tide of a southern square . From all over town pleasure-seekers swarmed like fish baited into a trap , and they lay in all attitudes , gulping out of water , their fins torn by the nets , a promise of evasion slipping from the eye of the streetwalker to the eye of the lathe man from the Cadillac tank plant . The street gave them only the street show  --  bar noises , cruising patrol cars , bare-legged quiff , the frozen faces of those just passing by and thus provoking the hails of the kids who never disturbed the ladies , the pimps , the citizens of Little Hollywood in Cleveland , Ohio . The show that Jake wanted to let his pal Bowers in on  --  for sweet relaxation'sp173sweet sake  --  was another show , the refined and delicate one which made you respect it by sneezing into your handkerchief instead of into the gutter . Jake marked it with this esteem , and found it sly and subtle . " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You 're not a paid guide , Jake . You do n't have to tickle me . I can tickle myself . " " Ticklish , Harry ? " Foolish talk , but Bowers found himself once more with the purity of his calculations . The building would have been a good buy on Prospect at thirty-forty thousand , he estimated . Here , who knows ? Prospect is steady at least . Four stores , let 's see , and two front suites upstairs , two back ones . A drug , a shoe repair , a delicatessen , a bar-and-grill . Unreliable tenants , but say , what can you do these days ? And Nancy probably paid double . And you could maybe insure it for fifty . Jake led him to the stairway in the middle of the building , while Bowers thought : This could burn any time at all , nothing but dirt holding up the walls , wiring like they got . Plaster caught in the cobwebs off the beams , two hits on it . A fat man , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to shake their hands . Jake had a word with this fat man lounging in the dark and ruck of hallway , happy among the nibble of rats and the soft decay of hidden garbage , a man with the pleasant habit of a fat man , his left hand inside his belt and his belly arched like that of a child . He took Jake 's hand softly in greeting , but held it without looking at their faces , while he estimated their feet and their ears for the news of the policemen and payoffs gone astray . " I 'm Jake , you know me , from the G. Washington . I sent you lots of them . You know me , do n't you ? " " You 're the greedy boy from the G. Washington , hey ? Listen , Nancy says no more high school kids , and that meansp174you . Had to turn the last batch away , "  --  and his face sorrowed for the youngsters , fat folds of pout gathering about the crease in his upper lip . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tough on the kids . Ruins their evening to be insulted like that . What could I do ? " " Yeah , yeah , "  --  hastily  --  " can we go up now ? I called already . " " Who 's your friend ? " " Just my buddy . " " Glad to meet you , buddy . Pay Nancy at the door , she do n't like to ask , hurts her feelings . Okay , go ahead now , save your breath till you get upstairs . " Slowly moving his hand about under his belt , he sighed and leaned against the wall . A buzzer sounded far away . He must have used the other hand . Now look at it this way : The hall 'd funnel the flames up the staircase . It 'd come down in about ten , twelve minutes at the most , the whole shebang . You have the policy in your safe . Not to hold and to cherish , not for work and profit from that , not for the pleasant slow burn of possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coal calendar over the desk : this other calculation was a new way for Bowers to enter a building . Jake , that steady friend , was teaching it to him . Just a pal , eh ? Two eggs on a plate . Despite the rats ' paws and the settling of old wood and old food , they could hear the fat man 's hand scratching at his belly . When Bowers looked back at him , he nodded them up the stairway with , for the first time , a shy smile on a face like the frightened behind of a sheep on the run . Pass , friend.  |p175THEY  KNOCKED . FROM INSIDE A SCRATCH REPLIED . THE UNCOVeredpeephole showed two slanting , heavily-mascara 'd eyes with a single crayoned line and many upward strokes of fixed grimacing at their outer corners . " That 's Nancy , " Jake said , " introducing Nancy of Nancy 's Notch House . " The door opened and , with the usual expectations , the man with the mascara 'd eyes said , " That 's right , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers and a light-blue silk shirt with heavy sleeves puffed out under the forearms . Bowers did n't have to finger it to recognize the genuine worm 's silk , not rayon or nylon . " We do n't have to pay , " Jake said , raising his voice and glancing at Bowers with the proprietory glance of the man whose treat this is . " It goes on my account . You remember me , Jake , the G. Washington Motel . I been sending ' em to you . " Nancy nodded . " He tell you about the kids downstairs ? That all settled ? All right , glad to see you boys . Make yourselfat home . " The stern squeeze of mouth after the nip and bow of welcometold them to pass out of the vestibule into the parlor . There was another pair outside the door already . Nancy was busy . " That 's the chirrup we call Nancy , " Jake said , " me and his friends . Surprise ? Nice , ai n't he ? Sweet ? He 's tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is he very strict ? " Bowers asked in a hoarse whisper , bendinghis great bald head , holding to the grin and his tooth . They heard Nancy 's voice , behind them , interrogating thep176suppliants . " Excuse me for asking , but we have our little rules . Who sent you ? Otherwise we lose our reputation . We like to know for the guest list , that 's all . " A mumble . " Sorry , ca n't let you in without . " Another mumble . " That 's the rule , sorry . " Nancy shut the peephole . " He wo n't forget to deduct it from my account , either , " Jake said , " not that Nancy . " Bowers , that sociable fellow , felt uneasy in the parlor , nervy and nervous . All he had in common with the other guests was the severe Nancy , and it was not enough for easy conversation . No one met anyone else 's eyes , and each guest spoke only with his companion . Even these pass-the-times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on Nancy . This was his world ; these were his subjects , not citizens , not even clients . Patients , perhaps . Nancy came in and clapped his hands once . " Your attention , please . " They all looked up . With a practiced sincerity , he welcomed them all to Nancy'sCircus . " Only one ring , but we do our best in a small way .... " Snickeree . " I truly hope it pleases . " Sadly Nancy admitted that visitors seldom gave their real names , such sad untrustworthytimes were these , but that he wanted them to get to know each other , and would christen each of them . He used the word " christen . " He went the rounds , only Bowers followingwith his eyes while the others , passive now , waited . " You 're a cute fellow , you , Junior , "  --  a middle-aged man , worn and brown , with a brown suit and brown socks , maybe a salesman comparing the sights of Toledo and Detroit with those of Cleveland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was with , who might have been his real wife , scared but brave . The next couple was young , maybe college kids with money , the boy grinning at Nancy , the girl dutiful at his side . Nancy tapped the boy on the shoulder . " Faust , " he said . He made as if to pinch the girl 's cheek , but tactfully did not . " Margie . " " All right , who 's next ? Gaston ? " Gaston might have been ap177Cleveland celebrity , a disc jockey , a ball player , the son of a General Motors franchise . His friend , a girl with the enforced slenderness of a photographer 's model , water and salt prohibitedin her diet together with too much love , was also important , maybe a singer someplace , maybe a television personality ( sponsored ) or starlet ( unsponsored ) . " Alphonse , " said Nancy , " do you mind ? It 's usually a boy 's name . " " What you looking at , you , Baldy over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fellow for a little fellow , "  --  it was the head that did it . " Call you Samson . " " Okay , " said Bowers . Nancy glanced up in surprise at this first word from the customers , but did not answer . He passed Jake by . " Jake , " he said , " that 's good enough . " Jake was gazing with a thin smile of envy at the possessions of this parlor , a living room containing enough objects to signify permanence and status to a man on the move . Electric fireplaces , bricks painted on the wall . Book club selections behind glass doors . The Bible Designed to be Read as Living Whatchamacallit on the coffee table  --  that must have been Nancy 's idea . The weight of the room was at the end toward the window , where a studio couch , opened and prepared , was made up with pink sheets drawn tight . Stage . The window was hidden behind heavy drapes . Odd to have it near the outdoors like that . Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have teevee yet , " Nancy explained , " waiting for color . . . . " Chairs lined up about six feet in front of the couch . All this cost . The censorship of money : a better class of trade at Nancy 's than outside on the street . Nancy studied them , his hands on his fancy corduroy hips . " Well , I never , " he said to their shyness before each other . He clapped his hands . Past the swinging door which led to the kitchen came a blond girl in red shorts and no other clothes but a bandaid on one knobby knee ; she was carrying a tray ,  |p178bottles  and glasses . A high school kid working after school as a carhop , no , younger than that . A nice touch , the clap of the hands , Bowers decided . The little girl did n't even wear makeup . Nancy greeted her with a tap on the rump , but the child dodged out of the way and carried a glass to each of the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's fun , it 's free , it 's on Nancy . It 's included in the price of admission . Give me a laugh , everybody . " The tourists giggled . " Thank you . But this is one place you do n't get in . " No laughter . The girl blushed . Bowers held her hand steady while she filled his glass . Nancy waited until everyone was served . " In-tro-ducing .... " The couple filed in from the bedroom , the manbehind the woman . They must have just been sitting there , quietly waiting . " In-tro-du-cing , " said Nancy , " the stars of the evening , our own little dance team favorites , Amos and Andrea . Direct from the Chandelier Room of Nancy 's Notch House . They do n't sing , they do n't dance , they do n't play charades , but they just love to be here . Givem a nice little round of applause , folks . " A solemn , frozen-faced Negro with heavy black glasses but the soft walk of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hard-muscled hips under her gown . Bowers looked from her to the child in shorts . They must be sisters . The couple undressed without formality , as if behind a curtain . The man folded his trousers and lay them across a chair . Bowers was surprised that he wore neither shorts nor undershirt . He took off his black shell glasses and put them on the table , folding the wings carefully and pausing a moment to make sure he would remember the place when he came to look for them . The woman 's clothes slipped into a pile next to his . She seemed to be in a hurry . She could n't have been cold there . The heat of all their bodies and the heavy curtains which blocked off the breeze from outdoors would keep her from getting a chill.  | " Take a bow , A 's , " Nancy cried out , and slapped his small dainty hands together , just the fingertips touching , as if too polite to make more noise than that . Too modest . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not applaud . With pride Nancy said : " They do n't use any trapeze , no artificialaids of any kind , friends . Now I want you to watch closely . They do it all by artistry and will power . " The man and the woman , now without clothes , glanced at each other and then looked to the maestro for a signal , tense , worried , determined to do good and to please . That was the sense of the hunger in their look . Never mind us , we just want to please you . Brown bituminous haze in the room . Or maybe it was the liquor Bowers had been pouring himself , helped by the child in shorts . Or the smoke from the mills under weighty urban clouds . Cleveland was busy these days . He caught Jake 's soft yellow face turned on him in a grin , turning away , still grinning when he glared after it . While the couple warily approached each other , like wrestlers , Nancy took his place beside the couch , watching the watchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script , Bowers thought . Just like that Toscanini fellow , he knows the music by heart . By heart . By heart . " Ladies and gentlemen  --  " And the couple fell like acrobats into position . The wife of the salesman , the one Nancy called " Sissy , " ran into the kitchen , choking . That must happen sometimes , Bowers thought . Like at a movie , too . Nancy did not blink . " Notice that teamwork , organization . I taught them everything they know , folks , and tell your friends about it . Be careful who you tell . . . . All right , you ready ? " The girl spoke for the first time , saying something to her partner in a soft lisping voice . Bowers did not listen . " Tell me now , we all enjoy ! " Nancy cried . Silence . Bowers could hear the muffled plop-plop-plop ofp180the kids ' ball outside . Sometimes they played stickball in the alley alongside his Green Glade . He knew the game . The man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see why they had to hire a nigger . I 'd of done it to her free . " " Quiet , " Nancy said sternly . " Watch your language , Junior . " Bowers drinking , getting drunk . Thinking : This was not thelife he had missed , this was the one he had chosen . Goodfellowship . The business . Efficiency in all matters . " It 's a knack , that kind of thing , " Jake whispered . " Look how they keep going , Harry , just like nothing was happening . I could n't do it in a million years , maybe more . It 's a trick . " " That 's what it is , " Bowers said thickly . " Jeez , you coming corned on me ? They 're really good , Harry . They could make millions on television , I mean , if they could . If it was allowed . I mean it 's real entertainment . Just watch it with one of them commentators  --  " " You got to be a pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered , his voice rasping with the liquor . " That 's the only way you make anything . " Jake 's quick grin : " What 'll you do with the money afterward ? "  --  inhis soft yellow butter-crumb face . " What I 'll do ? " " Yeah , the money , the insurance , you know , after you piece us off , I mean . " " The money I get ? " " What do you mean , the money ? Course the money , why else ? Yeah , you know  --  go to Florida , find yourself a cute number , booze around , you know  --  " " The money from burning down my Green Glade ? " Jake winced with surprise . He had made him say it . " Yes , Harry . " " I do n't know . I did n't think about it . Maybe I 'll build something . That 's what I 'll build , Jake . Something . "  |p181Jake  studied him with the smile-lines scraped hard in his face , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Bowers ? " Sh ! The man was breathing hard . The girl was breathing hard . Nancy was watching them now , swaying and clapping his hands . Hush your mouth ! " I do n't think you listen to me , Harry , " Jake complained . " You do n't pay me no attention . " " Now ! " Nancy cried , and a howl went up from the watchers , all of them , Bowers included , and he knew it because he felt it in his chest and throat . Nancy had earned this howl . They had all paid for it . It came from their bellies , deep for an instant , then shrill along their necks , and the woman crying in the kitchen joined them . The child in shorts was trying to comfort her . Bowers could hear the child saying , " That 's all right , it 's all over now , that 's all right , that 's all right  --  " Nancy strutted with accomplishment , the corduroy of his legs zipping one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of applause . Thank you , thank you . Please hold your places , "  --  expectancy , as if this were not all , while the performers put on their clothes . The man found his glasses . They were a neat couple , slightly tired , making precise little steps . Economical . Nancy was grinning and Jake was grinning because they both knew . The real climax came now , and Nancy was proud because he was giving the customer 's at Nancy 's Circus a run for their money , and Jake was proud because he was showing Bowers a real good time . The peak of tension and chagrin occurred when , standing together but not looking at each other , the couple moved from one to the next and shook hands with each visitor , murmuring , " Thanks for coming . Thank you . I hope you enjoyed it . Thank you . " The woman had come in from the kitchen , white-faced , holding the crinkled cloth over her stomach . She offered her hand , and they shook hands withp182her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with Bowers . He was afraid of hurting the small , dry , hot one of the girl . The man 's hand was also dry and hot and small , but it was a man 's . Although small , it could be expected to take care of itself . But the girl 's was narrow and a woman 's . Someone had to take care of her . " Thank you kindly , " she said to him . He let the hand go . " Come again , " said Nancy . Nancy too had a small hand . " We 're working on a new show . Next month , no , month after next . Next month is vacation . " Bowers leaned on Jake . He was drunk . The touch of a shoulder made him think of Morris , and he thought he heard , " It was n't my fault about the hot rod supplies , Harry . I could n't help that . " No , that was n't Morris , he was drunk . Jake was helping him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sad for himself , sad for Amos and Andrea , sad for Nancy with his purple corduroy and his evasions , yes , and sad for Amos , too , because he lived in fear of losing his glasses . Sad for Jake . Everyone lost . Sad for his brother , Morris . That Claire Farren , she can take care of herself . Small hands . Out of touch . Out . " And on behalf of everyone , "  --  the little girl in shorts sleepy but standing next to her sister . Nancy was rustling his silk sleeves and saying , " On behalf of everybody here , thanks for coming , folks . " Out.  |p183HE  LEANED ON JAKE 'S SHOULDER TO KEEP FROM FALLING . YOUcould knock the head like that . He did n't like leaning , no , Harry Bowers did n't , Bowers of the Green Glade , the hotel man , but still it was a pleasant thing to do for a certain Harry , yes , Jake 's Harry , and besides , he could n't help himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clever smiles which Bowers had never received full in the face before . Punks . Well , he did n't care . They needed a taxi . A nice cab with four wheels , say  --  nice soft seats , warm enough inside for the wizard of Prospect . " Good thing I did n't take my machine , " Bowers said . The small hotel magnate in a small way . The bald scalp was tight to the bursting over the skull . It never occurred to him that Jake could drive . " What do you think of it , Harry ? " " What you talking about now , Jake ? " " Nancy 's . " Bowers stopped and made him stop too before answering . He halted him with a hand on his forearm . He turned swayingto Jake . Under the streetlamp a kid waiting and whistling moved off at their pause . The light made Bowers blink himselfalmost sober for a moment before the lightened blood took him off again . He said : " The trouble with this kind of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes you itch inside like dirty underwear or a sweaty hatband , it gives you a headache in the temples where it hurts Morris , it 's like the barber left hair all over the neck , it makes the crotch sore . Did n't mean to drink like that , Jake . Apologize to you . Hold me up , I do n't like falling . " " I wo n't let you spill , Harry . "  | " Who said I was going to fall ? Never did that before . That Nancy , you might as well buy a new Stetson for a hat , "  --  the spit on the ground of a fine orator . Jake held his forehead . " Do n't worry , ai n't throwing up , Jake . I just got out the bad taste . " " Got it all out , Harry ? " " Not yet , not yet , it gets blacker . Burn it out with salts . " " You fall , friend  --  you 'll splash out the fire . That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited while he tumbled into bed , his flanks hairy on sheets changed by a maid he never saw . He shut his eyes at once ; he lay still . Jake pushed a newspaper onto the floor and sprawled in his clothes in the armchair . He had already dozed when Harry suddenly spoke from the sheets : " Do n't let me smoke in bed , Jake , it 's dangerous . " Jake 's talent as a night man was to awake quickly . Without moving , he said : " Did n't know you were afraid , Harry . " " Not . " " You like it ? " Jake asked . " You like friendship , Harry ? " " What you trying to get out of me ? Yeah , me , I guess I 'm going for it . " " Up in smoke , Bowers , that 's where you 're going for it . Well , I like it too . " Silence and breathing . This time Jake was deeply asleep , beyond his talent for watchfulness , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll meet at Morris 's place . I 'll let you know . " " What , Harry ? " " I 'll let you know when . " Their breathing , the heavy noise of Bowers ' slow rise and fall , the skinny catch of Jake 's uneasy sleep , rubbed together in a way Nancy would have recognized . They both dreamed of the zip of Nancy 's quick legs in corduroy , united in truth by a faulty trunk , the thighs joined all the same . Sh !  | " Good morning , " Bowers said to Jake . " I say good morning to you because it 's morning already . " " Think so ? "  --  flopping against the other arm of the chair . He lifted a hand against the hot bruise of the morning sun . " Suppose I should have offered company the bed , " Bowers said . " Just did n't think of it , Jake . " " I 'd of taken it if I wanted it . You would n't of known the difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean ? Was I sick ? " Jake made clopping noises , reluctant lippy sounds . " Roll over , go back to sleep . " " It 's morning already , Jake . Get up . That 's the way it looks . " " What do you mean , it 's dark out , "  --  despite the shaft of sun . The springs jumped with Bowers ' movements . He rubbed his hands together briskly . He took the cardboard out of a new shirt . " I 'm pulling up the shades . I can tell it 's day out anyway because I 'm hungry . It feels like morning . Come on , friend , we 'll get me some breakfast . " " What about me ? Maybe I eat in the morning too , Harry . " " Did I say no ? Come on . " " I 'm not hungry , but I 'll come , " Jake said , clopping his mouth and stretching out of the chair . Outside , they climbed into Harry 's Buick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you for your chain , and kept the other for reserve at home in the medicine chest in which , because he was never sick , he kept no medicine . The gold key was soft ; sometimes it bent when he turned the ignition ; Bowers could always bend it back . Jake admired his lumbering backward out of the apartment garage , clearing the overhead doors and the posts in his " machine " like a crafty animal out of a trap . Harry had a diner he liked , one where " The Finest Folks in the World Eat in This Diner , Inc. 1927. "  |p186They  made their way slowly through the bumper-to-bumper gleaming of automobiles toward the city in the morning , in the evening gleaming the other way toward the lawns of the suburbs . Bowers grinned . " It 's butter on the heart , a Buick , " he said . " But you can keep that hydromatic . It 's my machine , I want to shift it . Not like that Nancy friend of yours . " " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to attend to Bowers now in daylight . Bowers glanced at the soft yellow butter-crumb face in the mirror , at this skinny head , delicate and distraught in the morning , the long unlovely body slumped on the leather of his front seat . " You ought to eat better , " he told Jake . " What do you mean , not hungry in the morning ? It 's good for you to be hungry . Like Morris says , the inner fellow , but I say , Eat ! Norwegian sardines  --  I just give you an example . It tastes better . " Jake excused himself . " My pa was well-built , really built , Harry , like you . I guess I take after my mama . Never had much of an appetite for food . " " Got it for other things ? Did n't notice . " Notice then , Jake 's quick turning to him said . But said aloud , " Never need much food . Things came easy , almost , you might say . Never was hungry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even cry . That 's the way it was . " " I bet your mama and daddy liked that . " " He was n't around . He took off that time , but he came back for awhile later on . " The World 's Finest Folks , Inc. 1927 , were wiping the egg from the corners of their mouths when Jake and Bowers entered . The orange juice on the counter was being absorbed by the World 's Finest Rag , which had been thrown into the puddle . The juice machine had sprung a leak , a narrow spray of sugared liquid piddling on the counter . The clatter of fork against plate and the sick sweetness of the world 's finestp187genuine imitation of maple syrup was beginning to subside for the morning . A fan , coyly shifting , blew the effluvia of eating back into the kitchen . Bowers rubbed his hands and smacked his lips , not his lips against each other but his tongue between them . " Morning , Harry ! " the counter man called over to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore ? It 's nine-thirty already . " " Hiya , Harry , work nights now , " Bowers called back , and explained to Jake : " His name 's Harry too . Funny , ai n't it ? " " Check ! Check please , mister ! " the other Harry yelled , hurdling the counter after a man who seemed to have forgotten to pay . " There 's an easier way to catch them , " Bowers observed with disapproval . " You run like that , they run too . It 's bad for business . Course , you ca n't lock up their baggage here . " " I beat a few checks myself , " Jake said . " You got to embarrass them quiet , or you got to forget about it . Do n't pay in business to aggravate the stomach about a deadbeat . " They took one of the tables instead of the counter . Jake was coming awake and , with his hands , he pushed the slack yellow hair back off his forehead . Take a table meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell about Bowers . You did n't know when he would talk , or how much . You did n't know how much it needed to decide him or to find how decided he was . Funny customer . Then Bowers was grinning and joking with the waitress and she was grinning and joking and liking it right back . He had had a good night , and no hangover , and nothing left behind , and nothing upset about Nancy . It looked that way . Maybe he just did n't have a memory . Jake , who had considered the evening a success , had a sick sour ball tipping in his stomach . He watched with disgustover his black coffee as Bowers scraped the plate clean of scrambled eggs and called for more . A bald-headed baby bang/ing his spoon . The issue before Jake  --  he was summoning his energies for it  --  was to try the resolution of Bowers in the daylightand see where it took them . " Do n't like to waste it , " Bowers was explaining . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go bad . Would n't want that to happen to my friend Harry , "  --  and he showed the gold tooth . Jake could n't see why another man 's being named Harry should seem funny to Bowers . " Besides , I 'm hungry . Flossie ! More toast . " Jake waited now . " When you going to get those sardines again ?  --  the ones with the little eyes like Jakey here . The ones in that pickling , that tomato sauce . It was good , " Bowers decided , wiping his mouth . " Finest Breakfasts in the World pass out of this diner . I always get an appetite for breakfast , best meal of the day . " " You 're lucky if you can eat in the morning . " " Ca n't you , Jake ? Never ? " " I ai n't lucky like you . " " Poor Jakey . Well , luck is catching , Jake . Stick around . " Poor Jakey , eh ? Jake decided to put the con on him now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You mean bad luck is catching . There ai n't no way to get good luck except make it , you said that yourself , Harry . You think the lightning 'll strike your Green Glade just because you need the insurance ? " No answer . Put it in straight and hard . " You think some firebug 'll just fly down your chim-i-ney for the flying of it ? A earthquake like the newsreels ? A nice convenient bomb ? You think the rats ' ! ! sharpen their teeth on the matches ? Safety matches these days , Harry . You want to count on acts of God , not me ? " He waited . Bowers was giving him the gold tooth again . Grin , you-go-on , it 's your turn . There was toast and jam in Bowers ' smile . " Well well , I got to get to work , Jake . Drop you some/place ? Got to see how many sheets the maids are stealing this morning . Always look in on the Green Glade about now . They found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , I might as well get off here . . . . See a fellow ... . Listen to me , Harry , you believe in lightning luck or do n't you know what you want ? I 'm putting it to you straight now . " " You could n't be more crooked if you was made of pretzels , Jake , that what you mean by straight ? Well , sure , " Bowers grinned , " sure I believe in lightning . I met you , did n't I , Jake ? Lightning boy . " " You mean it now ? I do n't like this kind of stalling . " " Let me make up my mind , Jake . You 're not first choice , you know that . Please , I got better ideas than you . You think your Nancy 's a convincer ? Morris likes monkey business and mental pixies . Me , Bowers , I like the right deal . I got nothing against you personally , but first I want to smell around . Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored secretaries or something . Or a deal like that . I bet they got residence halls too , just like white people . For the single girls , I mean . " " You listen to me , Harry , they got nothing but spitework . That 's the code of the Negro . Everybody says it , even if it ai n't true . Eleanor Day , Push Day , that 's their holidays . " Bowers pushed the dishes away from him . " Just like my brother Morris you talk , " he said . " Crazy nuts . " " Harry ! Where are you going ? " " Got to get to my Green Glade . Miss it this time of the top of the morning . It 's my own property , you know I like to look into it . " " You ai n't going to finish our business , hey ? " Harry tapped him on the shoulder , a big friendly smile on his face , the gold tooth gleaming in the great round head , sweetly breathing egg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business is business , Jake , not a way of sitting down . Let 's go to work . " And he left Jake sitting . He put a bill next to his plate so that , when he left , Jake could call for the Finest Change in the World.  | " LISTEN , MR . BOWERS , I BOUGHT SOME OF THIS MYSELF . IT'Sbound to keep on climbing in today 's market . They make the best line of equipment in America . " " What kind of equipment ? " " You know , equipment , supplies , general stuff . And they got their own outlets . They handle it themselves . " Bowers ' eyes strayed to the sleepy but tense lineup , the uneasy dreamers on the chairs before the clicking and ticking big board of the brokerage office . They squinted at the tape magnified on a screen . The old folks slouched with their chins deep in their palms , blinking like turtles as they lost an eighth of a point , picked up an eighth , maybe lost it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at customers , telephones , or recalcitrant slips of paper with the crackling flaps of carbon underneath . " I 'm glad you came to see me , Mr. Bowers , " Mr. Stanley was saying . " Let me tell you , you got one fine little reputation in this town . That 's why I been calling you . Many a bigger man would give his right eye teeth to have a reputation like yours , I do n't mean you 're not big , Mr. Bowers , I just mean longer established , names , the papers  --  " " Yeah yeah , " said Bowers . " I mean it straight , Mr. Bowers . I mean I already heard about you many a times from strictly reliable sources . " Bowers submitted to giving the broker his pound of politeness . " Well , I always made mine  --  money , I mean  --  by doing something for it . I been in a couple things , but property 's a good business .

People like us and experienced business personnel like yourself . Let me tell you something you probably figured out yourself or you would n't come to see me . You ca n't make money by working for it anymore  --  sure , you can make what to eat , what to drink , but I mean money . That 's what I want to say . We 've progressed a good deal in this country of ours . You got to ride the currents , be smarter than the next fellow .

The lure of gambling in other men 's work , an evasion of the real risks . Nancy in corduroy and mascara 'd eyes aslant . Bowers paused , breathing heavily . He wanted to say something to express an uneasiness never before felt in the stunts of money-making , but he could not find the words . He shrugged and let his mouth drop shut . " In my own business , " he said , and stopped again . " Let me express it for you , " Mr. Stanley suggested , " it 's one of our many services to institutional and private investors alike . I know what you mean . Perfectly . A little rise in the market , and there you are . We live in a great little country , Mr. Bowers . " And his eyes piously swam upward in their sockets to come knocking to rest against the bone of his forehead , fixed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board . " Lots of men like you , Mr. Bowers , been working and wasting their valuable time  --  "  | " I did n't waste any time . I did n't . I did something . " Bowers could use his gold-toothed grin on Nancy 's invitation but not on this one . He wanted things to be clear with Mr. Stanley . " My property was n't a waste of anything , " Bowers said . " Nobody in the whole city could of done it better . " " Mmmm , " Mr. Stanley said soothingly . " You married , Mr. Bowers ? " He explained . He pointed out the different types of investments , arranged according to the personalities he serviced . He asked the questions and answered them . The head of the office occasionally strolled through , pensive and stately , the burden on his shoulders and no Swiss Guards to support him . He gave them his benediction with the five swollen fingers of promotion . A switchboard operator presidedover the abstract connections between men and money . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a moment , please , for Mr. Norton .... " Mr. Stanley spoke more rapidly now . " All right , you do n't want Am Sanit &; Sew , then I tell you what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to sell you some Canadian Oil . They made some big strikes up there , going to make itself felt in dividends soon . That 's our anticipation . I bought some of this oil myself . " A smart salesman , Bowers was thinking , would save that line until he smelled the kill , then drive it in with the personal touch , the sharing of risk . " I do n't like oil , " he said . " What about airplanes ? " " Do n't want to bet on that . " " Railroads ? " " No . " " What do you like , Mr. Bowers ? " " Something gives me a quick profit , same time a regular income , fair rise in the flation , safe . " ' Mr. Stanley nodded sagely . " Escalator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dig me up something like that and I 'll buy inp194myself . But in the meantime , you want to try something a little bit speculative , a little bit keeping your hand in , here 's a little deal I heard about last night . Mind you , I 'm not passing out tips , that would n't be ethical , but this is just a hint to the wise . My son 's just in from Harvard Business School , flew in for the weekend . Boy , are his arms tired , ha ha . " He spoke his laughter once more : " Ha ha . But he 's a fine boy . Really a hunnertper cent . Finishing up at Harvard . Well , now he rooms with a fellow , he 's the son of the President of General Tongues , that 's shoe tongues I mean . They make the leather part , there 's another company makes the felt you put underneath . Got to cushion the instep of a well-made shoe , you know . Well , this roommate of my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Business and Finance , he says there 's a good chance of amalgamation between the tongue company and the felt people , and if this goes through , well , I do n't have to say anything . You see what I mean right away . I put in an order for a piece of this myself . That 's not a tip now , it 's just what my son was telling me , my own kid . Personally , I 'm not in the tip line . This is only background information , research stuff . Only it 's more reliable if you know the fellow . I was telling a doctor friend of mine about it over the telephone , he always calls me from his office in the Uptown Medical Building , you know , uptown there , and he bought a couple hundred . Just like that . Kind of a little investment , a chance you like to take once in awhile . Eye ear nosen throat . Say , what can you lose ? " " Only money . " " You sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only money , he says . But I mean really , why not ? " " Well , I do n't know . " " You want to diversify , do n't you ? A true diversified portfoliotakes a risk , too . Otherwise it 's not a true diversified portfolio . You 're not a college or a foundation , everything'sp195got to be gilt-edged . Suppose the Harvard team kept bucking the line , buck buck buck , never took a chance on a long pass ? My boy was telling me just last night . Well , they 'd never get anyplace . It 's the same way in business . It 's the same thing in the investment business . If you want to get rich , you got to go out for a long pass now and then  --  " " You think I should buy shoe tongues someplace away out in the backfield ? " " I did n't say that . It 's only the Curb , "  --  reproachfully . " I do n't say shoe tongues , I do n't say soybeans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that 's a high-type local concern has n't missed a dividend in ten-eleven years , and I own some of it myself . I just say you should invest in something with a future , maybe . General Motors and Bell Telephoneare for old men . " " You do n't like General Motors ? " " Sure I do , who does n't like General Motors ? They 're a very likeable outfit , fine people . Bell too , could n't be nicer . Got a new report on them just the other day . They 're great for the long pull , that 's what I 'm doing . I 'm just talking about new baby business , the ones with the real growth potential . You got to have faith in American growth potential , apart from the excess profits tax , Mr. Bowers . Otherwise it 's no use . That 's the way everyone gets security and prosperity . " " Is that what I 'm going to do ? " " That 's what I 'd do in your position . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividend since ' 47 , and that 's a good sign . Let me explain you something . We in the investment business know how that 's a good sign . We get the confidential reports of our research department . You see , once they declare an undeclared dividend , well , there 's no telling what will happen . You can double , triple your money . I got lots of people did that , did that to a couple fellows here just a few weeks ago . Fellows in your position . Came in justp196the way you did . " He paused to consider Bowers ' shoes and lifted his eyes to the assault again . " You know , it seems to me your case is just the same , and this soybean is hiding a whole series of undeclared dividends . Personally , that 's one thing I 'm building up on myself . My own portfolio . " " I do n't know , though , I mean if this is just what I need  --  " " I 'm glad to have you explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps me . We Suit the Security to the Man : That 's a little saying of mine I made up . For instance , we got clients want to lose money on the short haul . Income tax purposes , you know , course that 's a temporary thing  --  " Bowers watched one of the turtles gaping at the big board rise stiffly , take his coat , cover his mouth with the yawn of the gambler grown old in this sport , and leave for lunch . " Well , " he said , " that 's very interesting . Learning a lot . I guess I 'll take these reports with me and think about it . " " That 's fine , that 's right , shop around , you do that . Course , the market will probably rise while you 're thinking , but that 's all right . I always prefer to let a client make up his own mind and feel right about it and maybe make a little less , than I should decide for him . A little saying of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the cornerstone is independentjudgment . " " Thank you , Mr. Stanley . Maybe I 'll be back . " " Thank you , Mr. Bowers . " He stood up to shake hands , " Pleasure , " he said . Bowers , ashamed of his procrastination , wanted to make it up to him . " What about that Canadian Oil you were telling me about ? You really think it 's a good thing ? Why do n't you give me that report too ? " Still standing , Mr. Stanley talked and pumped his hand . Bowers stared over his shoulder and let his hand be moved and watched the pretty , harried face of the girl at the switchboard , her ears crushed pinkly by the headpiece . He heardp197the broker 's voice again : " I bought some of that stuff myself . " " What ? Yeah , goodbye , Mr. Stanley . Sorry to use up so much of your time , " Bowers said , trying to move backwards . " Mr. Bowers , you do n't understand . I enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's uplifting in my line to meet a careful investor like yourself . It 's sound business tactics . That 's what I stand for . " He sat down . " Excuse me , I have to call one of my doctors . He wants some more dope on that Federal Catering . Lots of weddings and other celebrations this year , you know . They 're as steady as oils and soybeans , some say more steady than shoe tongues . Sit down a minute and I 'll tell you about it  --  " " Listen , Mr. Stanley , this ai n't my line . I ai n't saying it smells , but the smell of paper and the smell of property ai n't the same . Listen , you need property to flavor the money , otherwise it 's just duebill paper . " " Listen  --  " But Bowers was on his way out . So that 's not the way you settle money and other problems . Another Nancy in corduroy , this time for the pleasure in telephoning and the exultations of tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the money passing through hands , further removed from it than even he was , and nothing to burn but paper . Jake 's way was better than this ear-banger 's . Even Morris , who could buy into an idea how to keep the wind from blowing , the expert on bankruptcyand mail-order opportunities , who grew mushrooms in his cellar and moss in his ears , had better ideas than this one . At least he made them himself , and suffered his own trespasses . A man had to investigate his prospects , did n't he ? He only thought he would see . Then he returned to the Green Glade on Prospect Avenue . Bowers was trying everything . He thought that another loan might pull him through ; it could hold him until thingsp198got settled at the Green Glade . It was n't just that he hated to waste the fine job of plastering , inside wiring , and structural steel . It was that he liked it better that way , pulling his money straight out of the property , not adjusting with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handlin , the tea-drinking banker who kept his cup in the drawer of his desk . " Advertise it , maybe put in a little club , let the colored people know , " Bowers explained . " I can make a go of it , you know that . I always been good for it . " " Yes , Mr. Bowers , but you have never before put yourself in such a position . " He stood up , frowning . " Position , position , all I need is time . This might of surprised me , Mr. Handlin , but I do n't mind surprise and I can make a go of it . " " Our policy "  --  cool word , for this was no longer the voice which had asked him to come out and meet the little wifey  --  " Our policy is not to give second mortgages on colored propertyand not to loan above the value of the property . I do n't care how good your credit is . I let you miss a couple payments already . That loan you made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , but we did it because you had a reputation in this town . Now  --  " He shrugged . " We were wrong about you . You kidded us , Mr. Bowers . You put one over . I understand , that 's your right . But there 's nothing we can do now except wait to get out of it . " " You mean you 're just hot about Miss Farren , eh ? " " Who ? What ? " " The colored girl . " " Ah , " said T. O. Handlin with a nod and smile , " she 's got a name . That 's her name , eh ? Our investment men advised not getting involved in mixed holdings , what we call . I mean we 're against restrictions now that the law is passed , but I mean just in business . You understand . I have nothing to say about it . "  | " And you just want to get me out , eh ? " " Personally , Mr. Bowers , you know I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait ? " " The way you describe it , Mr. Bowers , we wo n't have to wait long to be called in to clean up your affairs . Under the circumstances I can not recommend an extension . Beats me how a man like you can go so fast . " Bowers leaned forward , breathing heavily , careful not to tip the teacup with his elbow . He saw that Handlin swiveled back in his chair in order to avoid being too close to him , but he went on anyway . " Listen , I always been good for it , Mr. Handlin . In twenty years I never overdrew my account , I always made my payments on whatever it was  --  " " I remember , Bowers . " He looked at the telephone as if ordering it to ring . The conversation was closed , and he talked about Bowers already as if he were not there . " As I said before , it beats me . You 're not an old man , and you 've been building up a position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always spent it fast , but I made it fast , too . " " Spending I understand , Bowers , but your business sense . ... We thought you had it , and now  --  " He made a pouring gesture with his hands into the wastebasket . He emptied the dregs from his cup . Bowers admitted himself to her room with his pass key . He waited in the shadowed space for Claire Farren , sitting on her bed and grinning to himself because he thought of it as hers although he recognized the bed as one which he had bought from the Sterling in the sale Siegal ran for them when they redecorated . The grin passed ; he sat hunched there , growing familiar with himself after many occasions of sitting awake in the dark . It was none of her business ; she had nothing to do with it . He tried to insist on this , but his imagination keptp200returning him to the thought of her clothes and under her clothes and the long honey-colored limbs and the smooth-ashoney-voice . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the smile ? The shapes of the room closed him about , moved by the faint scent of her soap , her perfume , herself . She entered , snapped on the light , and exclaimed : " Oh ! " Bowers came to his feet , apologized , was ashamed . Even if it were still his hotel , it was her room . Even the law said that . Shame  --  but always the fact of being Bowers had given him rights . She asked what he wanted . " Nothing , nothing . I do n't want nothing . . . . To talk with you , "  --  frightened by the hoarseness of his voice . " Would you rather , Mr. Bowers , that we step out someplace for that ? "  --  both of them smiling and embarrassed because his tenderness was echoed in her reply . " Yes , yes , yes , that way , " he said . He asked her to have dinner with him . He went out her door backwards and waited downstairs . But they ate together like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer friends . There was too much to say ; there were no words to say it with . He was grateful at least because , although she knew of the jump on Prospect if he were seen with her , she moved in this as in an ordinary occasion . At dinner in a chain restaurant at the downtown end of Prospect , they were seated near the kitchen , near the stacks of trays and silverware , near the dumbwaiter and the backroomsmells . Far ahead , at the window , the last watery light of the Prospect day filtered through , and they felt like the slowest and the deepest sea life in the aquarium . They spoke very little , but he managed to say : " Lots of people in here . "  |p201And  she managed to reply , " I 'm used to it . I was raised on Lenox Avenue . " " You 're a New York girl ? " " We used to spend the nights burning orange crates at the curbs . We used to burn whatever we could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up , Mr. Bowers . " " Me , I got out of New York . I rolled cigars , then I pressed pants , then I got out . " " We were jammed together down there , but if we stood in the middle of the street and looked straight up on a clear day , we could see into Morningside Park and Columbia University like a temple on the mountain . Mr. Bowers , I do n't suppose you 've ever seen how people live off Lenox Avenue  --  " " You went to that school , Miss Farren ? Columbia Univer-sity ? " " Yes . " " Like I say , I was an immigrant . Not native . I never went to much school , " he said , but was thinking : It must have been terrible on you . And she was looking at him to say : I know , I know , I did n't mean to say we do n't all have our troubles . It had n't been known as trouble ! Bowers insisted to himself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were both saddened by this difficulty , and after dinner , with great politeness and tendernesson both sides , they walked back to the hotel and said goodnight . She had almost , but not quite , been able to tell him about herself . He had nearly been able to tell her about Morris and Jake and the Green Glade , but he could n't do it to her . They could not say what was in their minds ; they made no small talk , but they minded each other as they touched briefly going through the door . He said goodnight to her in the lobby , and that was all for then.  |p202IT  WAS THE SORT OF THING THAT SURPRISED BOWERS . ALWAYSbefore , when Gil Leary had business or a hot tip for him , he had come darting into the Green Glade 's office . Why , the last time Bowers went to see him at the printshop , it was just after Gil 's old man kicked off . Nice fellow , old man Leary , you had to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contact with St. Theresa 's , the Father over there , their announcements , someone 's born , someone died , such things . You need a lot of printing to keep God well-informed . He do n't read the papers in this town , just the announcements . Well , too bad a nice old fellow like Leary had to have that wise-guy son of his . What can you depend on in the lottery ? Who knows if the nurse did n't change children ? No , but Gil had the old man 's large ears , thick at the top , bent almost double , flapping out from his new slick head . It was what spoiled the look of a dandified rat . A rat has neat pink little ears . The telephone call from Gil had been smooth and silky , but it had said : " Come on over , Harry , I want to talk to you . " Bowers was surprised . " I do n't know if I can make it , "  --  a rising hook in the sentence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric voice whispering into the telephone one door away had continued easily , " Come and see me in my office , Harry , I got something to say to you . " " So ? Tell me . " " Ca n't talk to you in your place . That 's my feelings now . Step next door , wo n't you ? " Bowers remembered Leary 's claim that he could n't standp203the smell of a Negro , even the smell of a room where one had been , ever since that lounge-bar in Dayton which had taught him the truth about Race and Blood . It was important . Gil did not raise his voice or argue ; he just repeated that he had to talk to Bowers . Gil was good on the telephone . He could indulgehis voice when he forgot about the paperdoilie body . Bowers allowed that he would maybe drop by , hung up and decided not to go , and then slipped on a jacket without a tie and ambled heavily across the lawn in front of the Green Glade , swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge which separated him from the printshop 's alley . It had occurred to Bowers that Gil wanted to turn his printshopinto the Green Glade Lounge Bar only because he was ashamed of the beaverboard cubicle which served him as office . Bowers called out a greeting to Frascatti , the press assistant , while one small press stamped out calling cards . The rest were idle , lined up in the shanty which had been expanded year after year by Old Man Leary . Bowers opened . Gil was on the telephone . " Hiya , Harry , " he said , and then into the telephone : " Goombye , honey , see you tonight . Got that business I told you about . " He grinned into the receiver . " Keep smoochy , huh ? " Stretching , Bowers settled into the single extra chair . On Gil 's jerky , self-importantface the pencilled mustache made a twitch of annoyance . Bowers knew that a yawn would do it : Make him come to his business fast . Gil stood up , bouncing on his toes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Association . " You knew my father before he died . . . . That time I was in Europe . . . . " Outside , the press was clack-clacking ; there was the stench of ink and the buzzing of the fat sick flies above a gluepot . Frascatti , bored with Leary , did not even listen at the beaverboard partitions . " Had to come all the way back from Parisfrance , and missed the funeral anyway . Even if youp204was n't the guy who shot the bull with my poor old dad , I 'd be a real pal of yours . You know that , Harry , even though you never wanted to do business with me . That Lounge Bar really was an idea . I meant it with all my heart , I like you . We could still swing it , once things cool off , once you get the goddamn coons out of here . " Bowers spread his legs and slumped back in the chair and waited . He did not stand up because he did n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up-down . " Why , why , my little woman she wo n't even come near the shop anymore . Fact , Harry . Just because it 's next door to the Green Glade , she calls it That Black-and-Green Glade . " Bowers pursed his heavy lips sympathetically . " Jeez , that 's tough , Gil . Never noticed her around much anyway . " " She always used to come on my birthday . Without fail . Surprised me . She did n't even come this year , Harry . " " Well , " Bowers shrugged , palms out , " so what can you do ? That 's life . " " How do you mean that ? " Gil was getting hot , jumping in the stuffiness of the shop , the steady beat of Frascatti 's press pounding at their heads in the stillness around the cubicle . " Do n't mean anything special , " Bowers said solemnly . " Just mean that 's life , a man do n't like to be reminded of his birthdaysanyway , gets to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of mine , so I would n't know . " " Let 's get down to business . Reason I called you like that . . . . " Gil 's face was hot , dry , and twitching , but he was enjoyingthis . As President of the Prospect Avenue Businessmen 's Association , all those grand fellows with whom Bowers so often had lunch at Kornman 's , Gilbert Leary had a painful duty to perform . He had the kind of voice which needed clearing , but he was too nervous to do it . He just let it go . " The organization , " he said . " The organization  --  the boys  --  the fellows  --  the street  --  "  | " All of them ? Jerry from the Athens Lunch too ? " Bowers asked at one point . " Jerry did n't come to the meeting , but everybody else  --  " Reproachfully : " Nobody told me about the meeting . " " But Jerry knew about it . Everybody on the Street knew about it . You were n't invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ourselves . It 's a question of for the good of the district , the Street , our Prospect , Harry . We do n't have to tell you it 's yours , too . " " Sure , sure . " Leary turned his angry face on him , ran a comb quickly through his hair , wiped the grease off the comb with two fingers and shook the fingers toward the floor . Bowers listened patiently , slumping on his spine and feeling the organization , all those pals , against him now . If those luncheon pals can go so fast , that 's just another reason for going on himself the way he was coming to like . Most of them had never even caught sight of Claire Farren . It helped a little to hear that Jerry did n't come to the meeting . But Jerry had n't told him about it . Jerry had been afraid of Gil 's friend Scardini and all his friends , just like the rest of them . Gil was talking . Leary reasoned : " Is it money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy out the Green Glade . We formed a little syndicate . Personally , I 'd like to set up a little lounge-bar to go with it . I 'm President . I 'm authorized , just you say the word . " " Nope , " said Bowers , " I run my business like I see it . I do n't sell just because you do n't like how I run it . " " We 'll give you a good price for old time 's sake . Everybodysaid you were a grand guy , Harry . " " Who ? Who said that ? Everybody but Jerry and me , we was n't there . " " What would you want for it , just supposing ? " Leary asked . " Just talking it over , say . "  |p206Bowers  grinned but did not answer . The business was his ; he made it . What did they think it was worth on a hot day in a printshop with this squirt trying to shove him around ? President of the Assosh . Bowers first wiped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief . Leary pleaded : " All right , if it is n't money you want , you just wanted to be stubborn a little while . Okay , you been stubborn . You had your way . Now think of the rest of us . " " It 's my business , my Green Glade , my little hotel . " " Think of me , how I nearly threw up . Why , if my dad did n't die , I 'd of come back early from my trip anyway when I saw the coons in Parisfrance . They import them straight from Africa . You would n't want that , Harry . They 'll start to bring them over here from there once they get the power . I know . I have lots of time to read , Harry . I thought about the ques-tion . " " The Green Glade 's my own question , the way I see it . That 's American enterprise , ai n't it , Gil ? " " Come on Harry , have a heart . What 's eating you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth , and spreading his legs over a creaking chair . At last Leary , this paperdoilie man , this sharp snappy dresser who liked to buy heart-shaped boxes of candy for his wife on Sweetest Day , got to the point of all their talk . He cleared his voice at last , making both Bowers and Frascatti beyond the beaverboard feel a little better about the shrillness . The pleadingturned gradually to threats . " Please , Harry , we do n't want trouble . " " So who wants trouble ? " " Sometimes trouble 's the only way . I 'm like a friend to you , Harry . You remember the dry cleaners ? " Bowers leaned forward and said , as soft and sweet as he could , " You crazy , Gil ? " Leary felt that he had taken hold . He was pleased . " Oh no ,  |p207Harry  , that was n't me . That was some other association . That business attaching dynamite to the starter , oh my , I would n't do that stuff . Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then do n't talk so much . " Bowers had crossed his legs . Leary gave him thirty seconds to uncross them . " We got our ways , you should know that , Harry . You should know I hate to use them , much as I hate the colored and a guy who does n't stand by the Association . Practically a traitor to Prospect . We got all elements here , but they stick together . I do n't want to talk big and scare you , but this is for your own good . You should make up your own mind . Making your own decision is the American way . One thing , though , Harry  --  if you need help cleaning ' em out , the coons I mean , we can give it to you . By the way , how many you got in there now ? I have my contacts , too . " " Otherwise , Gil ? "  --  the thick legs came uncrossed . " Otherwise my contacts wo n't like you , and I ca n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so much , used to talk about you , thought you were a real businessman . Had the real touch for it . " Bowers began to laugh , letting his stomach relax under the pummelling of laughter within , letting the bubbles come up through his chest and mouth . It felt just as good as it had felt to tell Leary , No , I do n't like your ideas . Not just because they ai n't a good idea , just because I do n't like them . Course , they ai n't a good idea neither .... Now he said : " I do n't like the way you talk , Gil . " " It 's not nice to be like that after you had all our confidence , Harry . " " That what you wanted to say to me ? " Gil considered , abstractedly opening the package he carried out of consideration for his special girlie and lighting one of her red-tipped cigarets . He tried to explain it in another way . He took nervous draws , not noticing the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider how it is and be careful , Harry . We have to take preventative measures . I 'm just talking friend to friend like I never even heard of Scardini , say . Like I have n't had many a deal on with my friend , D. Scardini , the former dry-cleaning executive who did so well in 3.2 beer and such . Well , between friends and neighbors , Harry , let 's try to leave him out of this . " " Scardini ? " Bowers grinned . " I already forgot about him , who 's that ? Sells a line of personalized match covers for you ? " " Okay , Harry , that 's all right . " " So ? " " But we might have to take our preventative measures , " Gil blandly repeated . The gold-toothed grin as Bowers climbed out of the chair  --  " You threatening me ? " He had hoped not to take it that far . " We got to look after ourselves , Harry . " " I do n't like the way you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Everybody , Harry . " The little man smiled modestly . Bowers blinked and looked . Bowers watched the nervy pigeon-breasted Gil , son of his old pal Leary , standing calm and in control and saying everybody to him , Bowers . Why did he have to say that word in a way which signified only Scardini ? Bowers put his large , heavy , sun-burnt face down to Gil and said softly , blowing his breath to make sure that Gil caught the smell of garlic : " I got news for Everybody . You take down the message . You go tell Everybody , "  --  Gil was tap-tapping a pencil against his knuckles  --  " You go tell Everybody they can go screw theirself . " Deliberately Bowers knocked the glass ashtray off Leary 's desk , a souvenir ashtray from his trip to Europe , and it went tinkling to the floor , sending up a fume of ash . What kind of a thing was this , fussing with the President of the Prospect Boys like he was Morris ?  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed the door ; it flapped back against the partition . Gil had waited , and then the paperdoilie voice followed him shrilly . " Try to think about it .... Knock some sense into your head . . . . " Frascatti had turned off the press . Gil was down on his knees , gathering up the pieces of the ashtray . " You been warned now , you bastard Bowers  --  " Bowers turned , his shirt twisting about his middle , drawing him below , and then turned away once more . He could have gone back and thrown Gil through his beaverboard , but what the hell ? Gil Leary , son of his friend , the Old Man Leary , was not Morris . His mental pictures did n't make no extra difference . Why start an extra fight with him now ? Harry Bowers is on the telephone . " Jake ! Okay , Jake , I think you convinced me , yeah , I 'll talk to him . Yeah , Morris is in on any monkey business , that 's what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , do n't order me around . I 'm still Harry Bowers . I 'll tell you when . We 'll go out to Morris to talk it over . Do n't worry , I 'll talk , I 'll line him up first . He 'll do what I tell him . He got a place in the Heights . No one can hear us . Okay okay , if you like it you 're the boss . But remember me , I 'm still Bowers . . . . "  |p210IT  WAS A GOOD DRY NIGHT FOR BURNING . On this evening of the first day of October , Bowers walked up the alley alongside the Green Glade , behind it and across the parking lot , forward down the littered space between the east wing of the Green Glade and the Sterling Printers . He stopped at the streetfront under the sign : Green Glade Hotel . Without neon : " Efficiency Apts. by the Week or Month . " And again down the alley . He walked around and around as the night came on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's domain , and workingto learn how to say goodbye to it . The rooms , dark and empty against the walls , made him think of the lettering on a monument . He paused near the foundation in the alley , so close that he had to throw his head back to catch sight of the eaves against the violet city night sky , and felt his hotel on his shoulders , a headstone keeping him from getting out . He had pulled the Green Glade in over his body . He knew a way , he thought . Remind me to have it in my will like this : " Cremate me , please . " Claire Farren 's room was lit . Maybe she was n't there , maybe she was just wasting electricity . No , she was n't the type . She was careful , she knew about electricity . Maybe she was out dreamy on the bed , sleeping with her legs apart under the bulb , just maybe .... No use guessing . It 's easy to guess about things when you 're alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see what kind of clothes she is or is n't wearing , what kind of material . You ca n't see clearly enough to do anything that lasts . The moon turned up over Sterling Printers , bleared withp211watching the fires of the flats , sick with the fumes of industry blown from the mills near the river and in the valley . Harry thought : That janitor got to clean up around here . I 'm not running no flop . What about that Claire Farren 's light ? Maybe she was only peeing . Reading ? You should n't have to guess about things like that . You should have the gasoline and the cotton ready . Otherwisewhy bother ? Like this , it 's only a game , and Bowers preferredserious games . At the incinerator , the third time or maybe the fourth as Bowers walked around , a scuffle and shuffle warned him . They had rats , sure , what hotel did n't have rats ? Even the Stat . But this was no rat or mouse or cat or dog or swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at the incinerator , sitting there how long he did n't know , watching him when a man does n't like to be watched , during the momentswhen he thinks no one can see him ; and Jake deliberately let him know by scuffing his shoes and drawing on a cigaret until it illumined his face . " Okay , I see you , so what ? " Bowers asked . " Go away . " " Just sitting , that 's all . " " I did n't ask what you 're doing , sit all you want . What do you want ? Just go away and leave me alone . " " I just wanted to sit awhile and maybe ask you something . " " Money ? Here , how much ? Just do n't hang around all the time . " " I guess you 're not happy to see me , Harry . " " Go away , I did n't have no appointment with you . " " Okay , okay . . . . " Jake hunched with his hands hanging between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth , setting up a glow of spread sparks . He snorted . He stood up , taking a long time to unfold the long soft body . " It ai n't nice to be nervous , Harry , " he remarked . " It 's nicep212to be a little bit nervy , Harry , but it is n't nice to be too nervous . After all , you could almost say we 're business associatesand friends . " When he stood up , the glare of Bowers on the soft wilful butter-crumb face turned sideways toward him , and as Jake took himself out of the shadow toward the alley light some of the irritability passed . What cliff did it make ?  --  this question in Harry 's burly waiting . Jake with his screwed-up eyes could n't see the inside of his head ; Jake could n't see inside his own head . Even Morris , that mental pixie , could n't see inside heads despite all his heavy Sunday morning reading in the telepathists of The American Weekly . " What you asking , Jake ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Bowers . I know , I know , a fellow like me . I had an experience with people once or twice . Listen , I just wanted to ask you something . Just one question . " " So ask . " Jake looked at him across the alley debris as if he had forgotten the question , then drew back out of the light and said , " That brother of yours , what you said about him all the time . Can we trust him in a touch-off ? You told me a lot of funny things about him . " " After all the monkey business I seen you in , think I can trust you , Jake ? " Jake put his mouth together to show appreciation of what might have been a joke . " Okay , " he said . You could n't tell about Harry . " Okay , I mean there 's rewards from the insurancecompanies , stuff like that . I mean , sure , he 's your brother , but  --  " " Why not ? Why not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth in the moonlight and knew that he was to grin in answer . " Sure , I guess so . Maybe you can trust him as far as me . " He put his tightened face close andp213made Bowers put the tooth back . " But you know better about me , Harry , " he said , " you know it . You know I 'm on the up and up with you . " " So what about Morris ? " " He 's dumb . He 's a natural mark . He 's got larceny in the heart . A guy like that got no relatives , no pa , no ma , no brothers ay-tall . A dumb mark can do anything . Only tell him to do the opposite , then he 'll do what you want . Maybe . You can never trust them to hold penny-one for you . Just keep their wet fists around it . He 's stupid . " " Maybe so , yeah . . . . " Harry shrugged and brought his palms up in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental pixie and that 's all . Sure , he 's dumb . " " Like I said , Harry , listen to me now  --  " Jake was wanting to say how close this made them , how this man could be trusted and that one not , how they were bound , Jake to Harry , from the thought of fire onward . This gave Jake the right to speak and to have thoughts . Now Harry would be his , that prize he had wanted for so long : " Harry , listen to me now  --  " But the palms were coming down again , and they slapped the heavy thighs as Bowers leaned to Jake in the alley . " So what ? That what you came to tell me ? About Morris ? " he demanded . " Listen , you got to be smart to be a brother ? Listen , I sit around a table with him since I was a baby and have a piece of corned beef with him , and for that he got to be smart ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only family I got . I do n't count his family . " Bowers fell silent with his mouth open , awry , suddenly bearing with him a tired and an old man 's mouth . " What ? " Jake hurried him , fearful of this waiting . " They make me mad sometimes . " " Who ? What ? You say something , Harry ? " Bowers did not answer . Tenderly he touched a brick of hisp214Green Glade and brushed this resisting element with the pads of his fingers . He was able to work the cement into sand , and it tumbled from his hands to the rubbish at their feet . His mouth was still moving , that they make him mad , the family of Morris and those others , but he did not speak and went on caressing the brick of the Green Glade , his work , Harry Bowers ' own sweet place . He had always wanted to fix a garden for it , a hedge , a place for the birds , a couple dollars worth of pacchysandra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blooms all the time , exactly like the Garden of Eden back there in the Old Country . That was also a nice place , good management , but they had themselves some trouble out there . It was a marvel to Bowers how , under his stern stroking of the cement , it resisted , ruffled his flesh , abruptly fell to dust . " Talk up to me , Harry . " Bowers was shaking his head and moving his mouth and touching the brick which he had loved and tended for what it was and because it was his place on Prospect . " Okay , okay . " Jake waited until he thought Bowers had said his say . Then he waited another moment to be sure , because he felt it in the chill and in the slow stroking of the wall with hands that this was a difficult time for Bowers in this alley . Then he said : " Okay about your brother , if that 's what you 're worried about . I was only asking , Harry . I was saying how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need a guy knows the score , got just enough larceny and not enough to turn talking bird  --  " Harry put his head next to Jake 's in the gray alleylight and shouted , " Go away ! Get ! Goodbye , Jake ! Leave me alone . I did n't tell you to come here tonight , meet me at such-and-such a time by the garbage , I did n't ask you nothing . I do n't want to see you . That 's the truth . Go away . Go away . " Jake was looking . " Get ! "  |p215When  this fury had passed and the millwork sparkle in his head had cleared , Bowers found that he was talking to no one , poking his finger at the caved-in chest of no one , jabbing and sporting and mad for no one . It was enough to make you sorry you were a bachelor . The humid night air of Prospect dripped from a faulty pipe and rattled in the spout , but the man who had been grinning at him was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It felt better . That helped . Down the street , across from the Athens Lunch , he found the diminishingsideways amble , that spume of the autumn night , passing under the street lamp . One thing about Jake , he was n't dumb . He knew when to bother , and then how much , a hard thing to know when it did n't do good anyway . But you had to bother sometimes for the benefit of a soul . For the good of Jake 's immortal soul , too , just like anyone 's . Bowers knew that neither of them were used to having friends . It 's not easy . A good friend , that Jake . He knew when to bother and then he knew when to leave alone . The fast high clouds were skating across the moon , and suddenly both the sky and the street were darkened . Look at Claire Farren 's window . Why did she bother to keep the light on ? He wiped his eyes with his sleeve . What did she want him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her step was honey and the look she had for him was a good one , but there was nothing to do for it between them . He felt better for the reminder of her despite his bruised fingers still clinging to a lump of cement , and let it fall . He could n't catch her at the window , that coiled black hair and the neat tan suit , no , beige it was , so what the hell ? This the hell . He opened the door silently , having already oiled and unlockedit from the inside in the hard workday light of afternoon . He had siphoned the gas from his tank . Now he **27;7987;TOOLONG meal but Mike said , " All right , girls , beat it . " They nodded obediently and went downstairs . I must have looked disappointed , for he said , " It 's silly to keep geishas at your table when you have a girl joining you . " " I did n't know a girl was eating with us . " " Did n't you see Fumiko-san @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bridge ? " " Yeah . Fumiko-san . She gave me the high sign as she passed on the Bitchi-bashi . " " What 's this Bitchi-bashi ? " " Bashi 's Japanese for bridge . We call the one where the girls pass the Bitchi-bashi because there is so much lovely stuff there and you ca n't touch the merchandise . " " Look , Mike , " I said . " I do n't get this special approach . You know the girl . Why do n't you just go up and ask her for a date ? " Bailey 's jaw fell and he said , " A Takarazuka girl is n't allowed to have dates . " " Why not ? " " Well , in the old clays theaters had a lousy reputation in Japan , so the railroad decided to keep Takarazuka what you might call impeccable . " " Whitt railroad ? " I asked . This whole resort grew up as a place for excursion trains from Osaka and Kyoto and Kobe . Started with a hot springs , then a zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean a milroad still runs this ? " " Sure . They do n't stake a nickel on the town or the theater , but they do a fabulous business on the railroad . Everybody comes out to see the show . Fifty lavish scenes , a hundred beautiful girls  --  gorgeous , gorgeous , gorgeous . " " And none of those girls has dates ? "  | " Immediate dismissal . The railroad combs Japan for these kids , spends a lot of dough training them . They 've got to behave . I considered this for a moment and asked , " But if the girls ca n't have dates , how come you 're dating one of them ? " " Like I told President Truman , Harry , you was wrong when you sold the Marines short . ' " He started to jab me with his lung finger when he stopped suddenly , scrambled to his feet and hurried to the door . " Fumiko ! " he cried with real emotion . The delicate actress seemed entirely changed from when we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a kimono and hurried toward Mike in little running pintoedsteps that made her exquisitely charming . Her kimono was a powdery blue and at her neck at least five undergarments showed , each folded meticulously upon the next so as to form a handsome frame for her golden face . Her hair was not fixed in the antique Japanese manner but hung nearly to her shoulders , thus forming the rest of the frame for her slender and expressive face . She wore white tabi socks , white cork zori instead of shoes and an enormous sash tied in a flowing knot in back . When I rose and extended my hand she barely touched it with her own , which seemed impossibly gentle , and I was amazed at how graceful she seemed , how young . Mike Bailey had passed the point of amazement . He was drooling and arranged her cushions and plates as if he were a French headwaiter . Then he pinched her ivory-colored cheek and said , " It 's murder trying to see you , baby . " She laughed at this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child playing with dolls . When she sat with us the tiny restaurant seemed to thrust back its walls , our talk grew more expansive and Makino , tucked away in his corner , started to fry the fish . Mike saidp72generously , " This American is Ace Gruver , Seven MIGs . " He showed her how jets fight and when she started to admire me perhaps a little too much he tried to change the subject , but she said , " I meet Gruver-san already . " Mike did a double take and Fumiko-san laughed again . " How you like me in Swing Butterfly ? " she asked him . " You were wonderful ! " he cried . " But I 'll bet if you 'd put that show on while MacArthur was here he 'd have thrown you all in jail " I asked why and Fumiko said  --  I ca n't explain bow she talked or exactly what she did with English and Japanese gestures , but she made me understand  --  " Swing Butterfly make fun of American sailors who falling in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here she grabbed a butter knife and performed the ritual . " If you like laugh , if you not too proud , you enjoy Swing Butterfly , I think . " " Did you like it ? " I asked Mike . " Anything this babe 's in , I like , " he drooled . " What 's she play ? " " I geisha , " Iunil:o explained . " I fight off whole shipload American sailors . " With a deft twist of her shoulders she demonstrated how she played the role and Makino and two men in the restaurant roared and suddenly I did n't like being in that little upstairs room . I did n't appreciate having a fat cook laugh at Americans . I did n't like being hidden away in a corner with a Japanese girl , no matter how pretty , who ridiculed our men . In fact , I did n't like anything I 'd seen happening in Japan since GeneralMacArthur left and I did n't want to he a part of it . I found to my surprise that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , who ( lid win the war , anyway ? I said to Mike , " You probably want to be alone . I 'll blow . "  |p73He  got very excited and cried , " Hey , you ca n't , Ace . " I stumbled awkwardly to my feet but he pulled me back down . " Ace , " he said . " If any Takarazuka snoopers broke in here and caught Fumiko alone with me . Much trouble . " " What good do I do ? " I grumbled . " You are in the way , " Mike admitted , " but it would be a lot easier on Fumiko if it looked like an innocent dinner for three , would n't it , lady ? " I turned to see if Fumiko agreed and saw to my astonishment that she had turned pale and was trembling . For at the entrance to the room stood three Takarazuka girls , tall and shatteringly beautiful . Two of them wore the Takarazuka green-skirted costume but the girl in the middle did not . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tie and slate-gray cap . She was obviously disgusted at catching Fumiko-san seated with two Americans . In three decisive steps she stood over us and spoke harshly to Fumiko-san who scrambled away in disgrace . I remember looking up at the strong face of this intruder . She was extraordinarilybeautiful , yet strangely cold . I felt curiously insultedby her and cried , " Are you the boss of this outfit ? " but she spoke no English and snapped at me in Japanese . Then brusquely she turned away and led Fumiko-san to a table where the four actresses ignored us . I started to get up but Makino , the cook , grabbed my arm and translated , " She not angry . Only she say very dangerous Fumiko-san walk with Americans . " " She was n't walking , " I cried . " She was sitting here . " " Please ! " Makino protested . " I not speak good . Trouble too much . " Now Mike started to join the Takarazuka girls but Makino pleaded with him , " Soon you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no trouble . " He whisked away the dishes fromp74which Fumiko-san had been eating and Mike and I sat glumly staring at our mess of tempura . It galled me to be sitting on the floor , Japanese style , while the Takarazuka girls , by whom we had been rebuked , sat at a table , American style . I said , " Let 's get out of here , " but before we could leave , the leader of the girls  --  the one in slacks  --  came over , looked me gently in the eye and spoke softly . Makino translated , " She have no English . She most sorry but Fumiko-san young girl from famous family in Japan . Supposeshe get fired Takarazuka , everybody lose face . " The lovely actress looked at me beseechingly and said , in Makino 's interpretation , " Very difficult to be Takarazuka girl . VJe got to protect one another . " She smiled at me , bowed graciously and returned to her table . I felt lots better but now Mike began to boil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A man or a mouse ? " He pushed Makino 's restraining hand away , strode over to the table , reached clown , grabbed Fumiko-san by the chin and kissed her until she had to struggle for breath . Then he bowed politely to the girl in slacks and said , " I 'm mighty sorry , too . But us boys also have to protect one another . " Then we left , but at the door we looked back to see the four Takarazuka girls sitting primly on the chairs , staring at their plates . When we got back to the barracks Mike said , " I do n't blame the girls . They 're under strict rules . If they get caught with an American soldier they 're fired . But that snippy babe in slacks sort of got my goat . I asked , " Why do you bother with them , if you ca n't date them ? " He put down his towel and looked at me in amazement . " Since when does a man have to have reasons for chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even talk with her ! " " Son ! " Mike cried . " Did n't you read when you was young ? Did n't you stumble upon them there fairy tales ? Where the prince fights his way through the wall of fire ? The more rules they put up against you the more fun it is . " " But she 's a Japanese girl . " " Drop the adjective , son . She 's a girl . " " When you kissed her . . . It looked as if you could really go for her . " " Son , when I come to any country I want to do three things . Eat the food of that country , in this case sukiyaki which is horrible . Drink the liquor which is also horrible . And make love to the girls , which in the case of Fumiko-san would be delirious . " " Even though there 's no chance ? " " I hate to be stuffy about this , son , but you Air Force men would n't understand . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even with those girls ? " " Son , when I was in New Zealand in the last war , waiting to hit Tarawa , there was a pretty barmaid in town and all the boys tried to make her . I did n't bother because there was also a very wealthy and famous gal who lived on a hill and you 'll find as you grow older and wiser in the ways of the world that they 're the gals to go for . Because they got everything : power , position , the mad acclaim of the world . . . " He dragged his hand back through his hair . " But there 's one thing they ai n't got  --  l'amour . " I started to ask why he was so sure they were lacking l'amour but he interrupted me and said , " Same with the Takarazuka girls . They got fame , wealth , their name in the bright lights . . . " He started to sob and concluded , " But it 's all like ashes because they ai n't got l'amour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none different from that there gal in old New Zealand . And I 'm the guy who can bring l'amour into even the drabbest life . " We went down to the shower room and while Mike was yammering away I had the stifling premonition that I ought to get out of Japan . When we returned to the hall Mike headed for his own room but I said , " Come on in a second , " and we talked for a long time . I said , " I had the strangest feeling just now . I wanted to get out of Japan . I was scared , I think . " I started to tell him about my bad luck with Eileen and he interrupted . " Do n't tell me ! The general 's wife started to throw her hooks into you . I sized her up when she tossed a girl like Fumiko-san out of her third-rate club . . . " He shook my hand warmly and said , " Son , when you escaped Mrs. General Webster , you escaped horrors worse than death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I wanted to marry Eileen and have a wife I could be proud of and a home somewhere and a good life in the Air Force . Everything was arrangedand I lilted it all . " " So now what ?  --  " I had the craziest feeling , Mike , that I was back in St. Leonard 's . " " Where 's that ? " " Prep school . I went to St. Leonard 's . I was all set to take the exams for West Point , but there was a teacher there who loved English literature and he got me a part in the school play . It was by a I lungarian called Molnar , and all of a sudden I did n't want to go to West Point . I did n't want any part of it and my mother , who 's written a couple of damned fine stories for the Atlantic , came to school and said , We 've always expectedyou would go to the Point , like your father and his father . ' I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of a conyp77pletely different world . ' At that she started to cry and talked pretty incoherently , but what I got was that if you ever once experienced that vision do n't let anything stop you . She would n't come right out and say I should n't go to the Point , because her own father went there and became a pretty famous general . But I could see that that 's what she meant . " For the next two weeks I went through hell . Everybody at the school was just swell . They did n't rave at me and say I was ruining my life if I gave up the appointment to West Point , and the English teacher would n't say that if I did go to the Point I was selling out . But then Father flew up from Texas and he was like a breath of sea air in a Kansas drought . " " He put you straight , eh ? " No . Father never rants . " " He 's a general is n't he ? Then he rants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just because a couple of generals fouled up Koje-do , you take it for granted all Army generals are horses ' necks . " " Right animal , wrong anatomy . " " If you ever meet my father you 'll meet the man who justifieshaving generals . He looked at me that day and said , If you do n't want to go to the Point , Lloyd , do n't . Unhappiest men I know are those who 've been forced into something they have no inner aptitude for . " " That was a noble start , " Mike said , " but what did he use for the clincher ? " " What do you mean ? " " How did he apply the screws ? How did he force you to go to the Point ? " " He did n't . We just talked and he flew back to Texas and I went on to the Point . And up to this very night I 've never once been sorry . But tonight that old sick feeling came over me and I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Air Force and buck for a star . Maybe I did n't want to marry Eileen and mess around with her silly old man and cantankerous mother . " I put my hand against my forehead and said , " Maybe I felt my whole world crumbling under me . " Mike grew serious and said , " Boy , do I know ! I watched my old man go through the depression . I watched a world really crumble . That 's why I do n't put much stock in the permanent security of worlds  --  of any kind . But what hit you ? You do n't just decide a thing like that for the hell of it . " " Well . . . I 'm almost ashamed to tell you what hit me . " Mike had a very quick mind and he said loudly , " Fumikosan ! You took a good look at Fumiko-san close up . Well , son , she 'd put anyone off his rocker  --  anyone , that is , but an old hand at l'amour like me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so simple . I could duel you for Fumiko-san in F-86 's at 40,000 feet . But the other day I was best man at a marriage between a G.I. and a Japanese girl . Boy , she was no Fumiko-san , but she impressed me powerfully . Like a chunk of earth in the middle of a cheese souffle . And tonight , seeing that other part of japan I wondered . . . " Suddenly I clammed up and could n't say it . " You wondered what ? " Mike asked . " You certainly do n't want to snatch the enlisted man 's wife . " sounds silly but I flew down here ready to marry Eileen . When she and I started to hesitate about that , I started to wonder about everything else  --  even about staying in the Air Force . I know it 's ridiculous but that G.I. and his dumpy Japanese girl . . Mike stared at me in slack-jawed horror and asked in a hushed voice , You mean you 're ponderin ' life ? " He mussed his hair down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it all mean  --  the eternal struggle  --  sex  --  the New York Yankees ! '  | " All right , louse it up . But suddenly I felt as if I were in a world of swirling darkness where the only reality was this earth  --  this earth of Japan . " " My God ! " Mike cried , clutching his head . " A new SigmundFreud ! " I had to laugh , and while Mike phoned down for some cold beer I asked , " Do n't you ever get crazy ideas like that ? " " A million of ' em . They never hurt anybody . " " But to have an idea like that suddenly bust open your whole world . . . I thought I was back in prep school again . " " I think it 's easy to explain , " Mike said after his second bottle of beer , which gave him added authority . " You 've been fighting like crazy up in Korea and you get this big idea about comin ' down to Japan and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me she was coming to Japan . " " Do n't let details mess up my theory . Then when you see the battle-axe her mother is ... " " She 's not really a battle -- axe . " " Who threw me out of the Club with Fumiko-san ? " The question awakened all of Mike 's animosities and launched him into a tirade against generals ' wives and he never did finish his explanation . But next night we were at the Bitchi-bashi watching the stately procession of Takarazuka girls as they approached us through the evening dusk to vanish into the deep shadows . I was deeply moved by the passage of these quiet figures and they appeared to me as members of a military group dedicated to their rituals and promotions the way I was tied to mine . They lived and acted with a sense of their military responsibilitywhile I was conditioned by the rules of my army . They were not free and I was not free , for I believe that no man who flies a plane against the enemy or steers a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by certain convictions and restraints that other men never know . I was pondering this when Fumiko-san came by . She was accompanied by the actress in men 's clothes who had reprimandedus the night before and when the bobby Boxers on the Bitchi-bashi saw this tall girl they made a wild dash to surroundher and demand autographs . The actress coolly shoved them away but other little girls took their places . I said to Mike , " She must be somebody . " He asked a Japanese girl who the actress was and the girl broke into horribly confused giggles . She did , however , summonanother girl  --  she could n't have been more than fourteen  --  who spoke English and this child said , " She  --  is  --  Hana-ogisan . Number one girl ! " I repeated the name and some children near me , giggling furiously , began to chant " Hana-ogi-san ! Hana-ogi-san ! " and the beautiful actress stopped for a moment on the bridge and looked our way . Mike bowed very low and blew a kiss off his thumb to Fumiko-san @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night shadows.  |p81I  had to miss the Monday night procession at the Bitchi-bashi because General Webster sent a message ordering me in to Kobe to report on how my work was going . I knew what he really wanted was to ask me why I had n't been around the Club . No doubt Mrs. Webster had commanded him to find out and I wondered what I would tell him . It was difficult for me to explain even to myself . It had something to do with the fun of living with a gang of men that you can never explain . The relaxation , the freedom of running down the hall in your shorts , the common interests in a common problem . I remember how my father used to glow when he came in from a six-day exercise with his foot troops . I was a kid then but there was something enormouslyreal and rugged about my father on those occasions . True , he was a fine man about the house  --  I think a good many other families , mothers and kids alike , would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were times when he insisted upon living in a man 's world and I think that much of his resolute determination to follow the camp fires rather than the bridge parties had been deeply ingrained in me . I had always liked aviation meetings like the ones at Itami . I liked evenings in Bachelor Officers ' Quarters . I liked going with Mike to the little fish restaurant . And I liked getting a gangp82together on the spur of the moment , racing through the dark Japanese night and winding up at some American movie in Osaka or Kyoto . Most of all I enjoyed working at the air strip when somebody I knew in Korea boomed in with the latest hot scoop . For example , one day a big Swede who flew an Air Force C-47 as a taxicab from one Korean air base to the next arrived in Itami and we had a long night of laughing about some of our experiences in that dismal country . I especially remembered the time he was ferrying a bunch of us into Seoul on a rainy day . The cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which you could descend to the island in the middle of the river where the air strip was . We got tied up behind a Marine pilot who had never flown into Seoul before and he was being extra cautious . He missed the first hole through the clouds , he missed the second and damned if he did n't miss the third . The Swede piloting our plane began to get irritated and he shouted to the tower , " For Christ sake , tell junior to land that kite . " When we landed the Marine was waiting for us and demanded to know who had called him junior . We looked among us to see who was tallest and a six-foot-four Air Force man stepped forward and said , " I called you junior . You were screwing up the procession . " The Marine looted up at the big man and said , " I 'm new around here . I was looting for the island . " rI'he real big man said , " I 'm glad you found it cause we damned near ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute it looked like a fight and all the rest of the time we were in Korea whenever we saw a Marine plane some wise guy would yell , " There goes junior . " I told Mike Bailey about this but he did n't think it funny . Living with these pilots again I honestly did not want to go into Kobe and sit around a fancy officers club and try to explain to Mrs. Webster why I was n't courting her daughter.  |p83But  that 's what I had to do . In his office the general asked me a lot of trivial questions he could n't possibly have been interested in and then led me down to the Cadillac . At dinner I looked for Eileen but he said she was in Kyoto visiting a museum and would n't be able to join us . I looked at Mrs. Webster eating her shrimp cocktail and lost my appetite . It was a chilly meal and after dessert the general excused himself to do some paper work and I observed silently , " If my father ever becomes Chief-of-Staff I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intelligence , because he sure telegraphshis hand . " Mrs. Webster did n't bother to telegraph hers . When we got to her apartment she asked bluntly , " What 's wrong between you and Eileen ? " " I 'm sure she must have told you . " " Lloyd , do n't be evasive . You have n't seen her in more than a week . " It was obvious that this was one time when I 'd better stick to the truth . I said , " We had a quarrel . She told me .. " A quarrel ? Whatever about ? " I gulped and said , " She 's afraid I 'm too much like my father . " Mrs. Webster started at my honesty but made no move to stop me so I finished . " And I think she 's  --  too bossy . " There was something in the inflection of this sentence that betrayed clearly the fact that I thought Eileen was too damned much like her mother . But Mrs. Webster never batted an eye . So I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ridiculous , " she snapped . " Mark found you this job because there was n't any work attached to it . " " If that 's why I got it . . . " I began with standard dignity . . . . you 'd sooner be back in Korea ? " she concluded . " Yes . " " Lloyd , do n't be silly . It 's obvious to everyone in Kobe thatp84you are an extremely brave young man whom General Websterbrought back to Japan so that you could be with Eileen . There 's nothing dishonest about that  --  if you plan to get mar-ried . " " We planned that for a long time  --  sort of . " " How do people get married  --  sort of ? " She was sitting on an expensive lounge purchased in Paris and she leaned forward , repeating the offensive words : " Sort of ? " " I mean there 's nothing definite . Has Eileen said there was anything definite ? " " Of course she has n't . She has n't talked with me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The whole hotel . . . " I knew Eileen pretty well and I was sure she did n't give a hoot what the hotel thought . But Mrs. Webster did because if we did n't get married it would make her look ridiculous . I said , " We wonder if we 're the right people for each other . " " At this stage ? Why , you 've known Eileen for years . Same backgrounds . I do n't see . . . " " But that 's what Eileen said when she started this fight ... " " A fight ! Lloyd , this is just a lovers ' quarrel and it has no more significance than that . " " Maybe it did n't at the start but Eileen 's questions and some of the thinking I 've done made me wonder if perhaps my whole idea of life is n't wrong . " Now 1 had struck something serious and Mrs. Webster acceptedit so . She spoke very deliberately and at the same time fidgeted nervously with a lace handkerchief . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of military service he 's lost . Believe me , Lloyd , I 've seen it many times and it 's the worst thing that can happen to you . From your baby days youp85were cut out for the service . You 've never known anything else . " I could have contradicted her and said that for two weeks  --  a long time ago  --  I had imagined another way of life but that would have raised too many questions which I could n't have answered . It was one thing to confide such a secret to an easygoingmind like Mike Bailey 's . It was quite different to give the idea away to Mrs. Webster . In three questions she 'd have you undressed and you 'd stand there naked to the world , just as stupid and silly as you were back at St. Leonard 's . I said , " Would n't it be better all around if your husband sent me back to my outfit ? " " In Korea ? " " Yes . That would settle my doubts . " To my surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it would be wrong for two reasons . It would make Eileen seem ridiculous . Could n't hold her man . And it would be the cowardly thing for you to do . " " Eileen does n't need me , " I said . " You 're absolutely right , Lloyd . She 's asked to parties every night . But not by Army men . By civilians in Army suits . Supposeshe falls in love with one of these civilians ? She 'll settle down as a druggist 's wife in Chicago and that 's not for Eileen , believe me . " I found Mrs. Webster a lot too tough for an airman twentyeightyears old to handle . I said , " I 'll drop in and say good night to the general . " But this woman kept hold of you like a steel trap . She said , " And there 's a third reason why going back to Korea would be wrong . Because you would be running away from your fundamental problem . " I wanted to shout , " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running away from your daughter because she 's so muchp86like you . " But a man can shoot down Russians and still be afraid to shoot down his commanding officer 's wife . I said , " I 'll call Eileen tomorrow . " She said , " Good . I know Eileen and I know she wants to marry you . Do n't let lovers ' quarrels keep you apart . That would be foolish . " She tucked the handkerchief into her sleeve and added with powerful emphasis , " And do n't let a temporary uncertainty tease you into thinking you 've made a mistake on your whole life . You 're an Army man , Lloyd . You were bred to it . " I found General Webster in a workroom lined with books . He indicated them with a wide sweep of his hand and said , " The colonel who had this suite three years ago got these books together . Practically any subject you might be interested in . I said , " I suppose you know what Mrs. Webster and I were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you sent me back to Korea . " The general drummed his fingers and said , " Better , maybe , but it would be so damned obvious . That 's what 's wrong with military life . Every move can be so easily interpreted by the enemy . But damn it all , Lloyd , what 's wrong between you and Eileen ? " " Nothing 's wrong , sir . It 's just that we both feel uncertain about our getting along  --  ultimately . " " Very sensible . " He poured me a stiff drink and said , " You 're not much of a man unless you 're scared silly by the prospect of marriage . Take me . Night before my wedding your father had o get inc blind drunk to keep me from sending a Western Union messenger to my wife 's house . . . . Father was Colonel Keller  --  got into that serious scrape with the Persian Ambassador . They called it Persia then . " He related in his rambling way the case histories of halfp87a dozen military marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding or after had wanted to funk out on the deal . " But in the long run , " he assured me , " marriage is the best thing for any man . It was the making of me . And j'your father ever tell you about his classic wedding ? He was engaged to your mother , Lieutenant-General Himmelwright 's daughter , and two days before the wedding he fell in love with another girl . Just about went mad from indecision . But supposehe had gone off his rocker and said he was n't cut out to be a general . By God , twenty years later America might of lost Guadalcanal . " He poured us a couple of more drinks and said , " Look at it this way , Lloyd . What the hell were you put in this world for ? Be one of those washed-up old fuddies with no home of his own , sitting in a club somewhere yakkity-yakking about China ? " I guess the whisky made me brave , for I said , " Ask Eileen if she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the general cried , whamming me on the back . " I ordered my wife not to speak to you on such a subject . Humiliating to Eileen and all that . But Nancy said there came a time in every girl 's love life . . . Is n't that a horrible word ? " " I 'll call Eileen about twelve , " I said . General Webster tossed off an extra one and said , " I feel ten years younger . If you have children , Lloyd , have boys . " As I went down in the elevator I saw a new sign which read , " Officers of this command will not appear on the streets of Kobe walking with girls of the indigenous personnel . This order also applies to officers when on the streets of Osaka and Kyoto . Signed , Mark Webster , Commanding . " I thought , " Oh , boy ! The general 's wife is really determined to clean up all Japan , " and then I got to laughing because here the Amer/ican Army was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Takarazuka army was forbidding its girls to be seen with American men . I was still chuckling when the elevator doors opened and I heard my name . It was Pvt . Joe Kelly , wearing a service revolveras big as a cannon . He yelled , " At last the Air Force gave me a break . Transferred me to the Joint Message Center . I got the best job in Osaka . " He waited for an officer to sign a receipt for important mail , then joined me . His Ford was at the curb . " Where can I drop you ? " he asked , unstrapping his artillery . " Look , I work at Itami . " " So what 's the difference to me . ' The Army pays for the gasoline . " " And I live at Takarazuka . " " I 'll go that way . " We piled in and he reported on how things were going with him and Katsumi . " We found a nice house . . . . Say , Ace ! It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? " Iie was so energetic and I was so interested in him in the way I had explained to Mike that I agreed . He barreled the Ford along the Kobe-Osaka road and I tried to observe exactly what this ancient and historic Japanese road was like . I saw the little paper-windowed houses stretching mile after mile , with never a sign of countryside . I saw the open-front stores that did business all night and the thousands of people moving along the road in the twilight and of how a single lamp lit in any of the houses seemed to light up the whole section of road near it . But pretty soon 1 stopped thinking about Japan and asked , " How fast you driving , Joe ? " " Sixty-eight , " he reported . " Do n't the M.P . ' s ever pinch you for flying so low ? "  | " They all know me . " " I 'll bet they do . " " First thing I did was invite ' em over to the house and Katsumi fed ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car came along . Then he leaned way out and shouted some Japanese insults at the M.P . and everybody roared and Joe said , " Great bunch . " As we entered Osaka he bore to the south until we came to a road which dropped down beside one of the numerous canals . Soon it petered out and four Japanese kids assumed guard over the Ford while we hiked up a narrow alley down which two men trudged with wicker baskets of enormous size . As they passed each house light from the paper doors shone on them for a moment creating an impression of deep warmth . At the far end of the alley stood an inconspicuous onestoriedshack made of wood long since weatherstained to a blackish gray . The porch was outlined by concrete blocks which confined the center of packed earth . The roof was of orange tile , laid in Chinese fashion with a slight swoop upwardat each end . In the States we would not have called this a house at all . With its sliding paper doors it would have been a shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but when Joe slid his doors back , there was Katsumi in a kimono , cooking the evening meal . Promptly she took my shoes and offered me a cup of bitter green tea and said in lovely , stilted English , " It is fine to see you among us to  --  night . " " She 's been takin ' English lessons , " Joe said proudly , " andI study a little Japanese . " He rattled off a few phrases andKatsumi beamed at him as if he had written an encyclopedia . " It 's nice here , Ace , " Joe said expansively . " Two rooms , the canal down there , a good job and good food . Ace , I'mlivin ' . For the first time in my life I feel like a human bein ' . "  |p90He  showed me where to put my shoes and how to prop myselfup with pillows as we sat on the tatami mats . He said , " I grew up in an orphanage but I was sort of adopted by a family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I blame ' em , I was a stinker  --  so I went back to the orphanage and then to reform school . I tried to enlist in the Army for the last war but they trapped me into tellin ' my real age and I wound up in Chicago and then the Air Force . Now I 'm a family man . " He looked at Katsumi with glowing approval and asked , " Notice the big change , Ace ? " " I like the kimono , " I said , for Katsumi was one of those ordinary Japanese girls who in flowing kimonos become almost attractive . " It ai n't the kimono , Ace . Watch her smile ! " In Japanese he commanded his wife to smile but when she did so I still did n't catch on , so Joe cried , " The tooth , Ace ! The tooth ! " Then I saw . The big gold tooth had been removed and in its place some Army dentist had fitted a trim porcelain crown . Katsumi really did look attractive in kimono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " It 's a miracle , " Joe sighed . " And she do n't giggle no more , do you , Babe ? " He dragged Katsumi toward him and kissed her on the cheek . " Because I told her that if she ever giggled again and stuffed her fist in her mouth I 'd break her arm off at the wrist . " Ile gave Katsumi a solid wallop on the bottom and she giggled like mad , stuffing her hand into her mouth . " Sometimes she forgets , Ace , but this is livin ' . " 1 Ic explained to his wife that I bunked at Takarazuka and she spoke in rapid Japanese which he interpreted for me : " A hell of a fine idea , Ace . We 're goin ' to Takarazuka tomorrow to see the new show . Join us . " " I 'd like to , but I have a dinner date in Kobe . " " So what ! Show 's over by six and I 'll race you right in top91Kobe , no stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train whistle . " It 's a deal , Ace , because with Katsumi you 'll really enjoy it . She knows all the actresses and can tell you what 's goin ' on . " He gave Katsumi a command in Japanese and she went to a chest where she kept her prized possessions , appearing shortly with a magazine in bright covers . It started at the back , the way Jap books do , and she showed me the photograph of a dazzling stage set . I asked what the magazine was . " Fan magazine for the Takarazuka shows , " Joe explained . " She subscribes to three of them . " He shuffled a pile of colorfulmagazines and I could tell from the devoted way in which Katsumi put them back in order that she had once been one of the enchanted girls who stood each night by the bridge to watch the great stars pass . Now she had become the typical housewife who still treasured autographs of the leading ac tresses . " I suppose she belongs to a fan club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke in Japanese again and Katsumi returned to the chest from which she handed me a stack of photographs . Apparently they went far back in time to when Katsumi had been a child . I asked , " Does she have the picturesof the girls who were in last month 's show ? " Katsumi immediately shuffled through the pictures and assembledthe entire cast of principals and explained what each did . She even sang two of the songs and I asked , " Does she know all the shows as well as this one ? " Joe patted her arm affectionately and said , " She never misses one . Has n't for years . " " Then it 's a date for tomorrow . But you promise to get me back to Kobe for dinner . " He did n't have to because when I called Eileen next day she played hard-to-get and told me abruptly , " I 'm having dinnerp92with a Marine . " I said , " That 's too bad , how about Friday ? " and she said Friday was booked too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough luck . I 'll call you later . " But neither of us would have bet much money on when that later would be.  |p93FUMIKO-SAN  : " When Japan know America win , my father kill himself  --  honorable  --  Japanese style . " Actually , when I went to the theater that afternoon I was rather relieved . It seemed to me that Eileen and I were pretty well washed up and I did n't have to worry any more about Mrs. Webster . I said to Joe , " I 'm sort of steamed up to see this show , " but I was hardly prepared for what Takarazuka did to Madame Butterfly . At any moment they might run in a scene unconnected with anything that had gone before or would come after . There were old Japanese dances to please the classical fans , jitterbugging to represent 1890 America , wrestling , microphones , a dance hall sequence , mutiny aboard an American ship , twenty stupid Japanese cops and a fire . But running through this burlesque of a great opera there was one solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that Mike Bailey 's girl , Fumiko-san , was terrific as a ravishing geisha holding the American fleet at bay . Her fine long face and expressive movements made her hilarious when wrestling with a drunk G.I. on leave in Tokyo . There was nothing really offensive with her pantomime but you felt that all the Japanese in the audience were egging her on because they had had a bellyful of Americans . But the star 's performance was quite different . The girl in slacks who had reprimanded us in the restaurant played this part and her Lieutenant Pinkerton was blatantly ridiculous.  |p94He  was arrogant , ignorant and ill-mannered . Yet at the same time the actress herself seemed more essentially feminine than any of the other girls on stage and it was this that made her version of Pinkerton so devastating . She was all Japanese women making fun of all American men . One act of such petty nonsense was enough for me . I did n't think I was stuffy , but I could n't tolerate people making cheap fun of men in uniform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . When the Act I curtain fell I got up to go , but Katsumi put her hand on mine and said , " No , no ! Now is the best ! " From a side entrance the star appeared dressed in old-style samurai costume , pursued by two villains . They attacked her , and in the highly ritualistic dance which followed I for the first time fell under the spell of Japanese art . I can not tell you what there was about this dance that captivatedme . It might have been the haunting music , for now the Western instruments like violins and oboes were silent and in their place were three horribly weird sounds : the hammeringof a slack-headed drum , the clicking of wooden blocks thumped together , and the piercing wail of an Asiatic flute . Or it might have been the dazzling curtain before which she danced , a vast gold-and-blue-and-red affair with eight gigantic embroidered irises standing in solemn Oriental perfection . But mostly it was this remarkable woman I had seen in the restaurant , this I-Iana-ogi . She wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and it was principally her feet that impressed me . She used them as a very great athlete might and slowly I became aware that I was watching one of the greatest dancers in the world . Silently , in the Japanese manner , she wove back and forth between her assailants . Instead of a sword she used the traditional symbol , her right hand held vividly upright , and as I watched this hand it traced a won/derful pattern against the gold curtain . I had never before seen a dancer like this , one who could fill an entire stage with her authority . The scene came to a frenzied close with Hana-ogi stamping an unforgettable rhythm and weaving that bright hand through the darkness . The crowd burst into applause and I whispered to Kelly , " Tell Katsumi I 'd like to meet that girl . " To my surprise Kelly said , " That 's easy . Katsumi knows ' em all . " But when he spoke to his wife she became grave and Joe reported , " Katsumi says that your particular girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? " " We hung her brother as a war criminal . Killed her father with our bombs . " I sat back in my seat and , strange as it may seem , felt exactlythe same kind of relief I did when I heard that Eileen could n't have dinner with me . I had the distinct sensation that I was back in St. Leonard 's engulfed in important decisionsthat I simply could n't make . At that moment I desperatelywanted to be in a jet plane rousting about up around the Yalu . Up there I felt safe and here in Japan I felt dreadfullyloused up . As if I were coming back to earth from another world I looked at Joe and thought , " Jesus ! What am I doing ? Lloyd Gruver , West Point ' 44 , propositioning an enlisted man to arrange a date with a Japanese girl ! " I said to Joe , " Let 's get some air . " Joe said , " Why not ? We 'll blow and Katsumi can come home by train . " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cried , " No ! I did n't mean that . I want to see the rest . " Then I asked , " How does Katsumi happen to know an actress like that ? " Joe laughed and grabbed his wife 's handbag , rummagingp96through it till he found half a dozen pictures . They were all of the dancer , showing her in some of her famous roles . She was a Spanish bullfighter , a Venetian gondolier , a Broadway playboy and a Japanese samurai . She was always the man and she always looked devastatingly feminine . Joe explained , " Katsumi organized a fan club . Osaka girls who idolized Hana-ogi . " " What 's her last name ? " Joe asked Katsumi and said , " Just Hana-ogi . It 's a stage name . My wife is crazy about her . Until Katsumi married me she was a real moron . Used to stand in the rain to see her goddess . " " But why ? " " Look , Ace . Suppose you were fat and dumpy and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tall slim beautiful girl who 's famous all over the country and makes a lot of dough . One actress like Hana-ogi proves what a girl can become . If you ever break into our house you can steal the pots and pans but do n't steal these photographs . Katsumi worships them . " Katsumi understood our conversation but said nothing . Quietly she recovered the photographs , restored them to some preferred order and replaced them in her bag . Then she explainedin broken English the story of Act II , which she read from one of the magazines which Takarazuka mailed out to its faithful patrons . It contained a large picture section , which I leafed through . I saw some sixty excellent photographs of the Takarazuka girls off stage . They . were knitting , or skiing , or promenading , or going to a symphony concert , or strolling . Gradually I began to notice a curious pattern . Alwaysthe girls were in pairs or larger groups . Never were they alone and never with men . The photographs portrayed a rich and successful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise man always looks for love in that kind of world , because , as Mike so eloquently pointed out , such women have everything but l'amour . I felt this especially when I saw the three photographs of Mike 's Fumiko-san . She was perhaps the most striking of the Takarazuka girls , for she wore her clothes with dazzling effect and her pictures were additionallyinteresting to me because in each of her photographs she was standing with Hana-ogi , the star of today 's performance , and Hana-ogi invariably wore men 's clothing  --  yet it was Hana-ogi who looked the more feminine and desirable . Act II was an amazing experience , for Hana-ogi proved that she was much more than a mere dancer . She had a fine clear singing voice , striking power for dramatic scenes and a wantoncomic sense . I leaned across Katsumi and asked , " Joe ! Do you think this girl could get by in New York ? " He whispered back , " I never been to New York . " But Katsumi heard my question and she realized even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , so in the darkness she touched my hand and said , " After , we go on flower walk . I speak you to Hana-ogi-san . " When the final curtain fell on Butterfly I started to leave but again Katsumi whispered , " No , Ace-san . Now everybody so beautiful . " Quickly the curtain opened and there was the entire cast of 120 standing in glorious kimonos , singing a farewellsong . A runway reached out into the audience and the stars came down and posed right above us . Our seats were such that Hana-ogi stood very near me and for the first time I saw her in woman 's clothes . She was adorable . True , she was also proud and combative , nervously excited at the end of an extremelylong performance . But above all else she was adorable in her triumphant moment . Her kimono , I remember , was green and white . Katsumi now led me through the crowd and we came top98the flower walk and the tiny little gate through which the Takarazuka girls passed on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applaud them as they appeared and dozens of round-faced little girls pressed tight against the gate , hoping to touch the great actresses , and as I looked at the girls it seemed incredible that any of these pudgy figures might one day grow up to replace Furniko-san or Hana-ogi . Now the lesser Takarazuka girls appeared , then Fumiko-san and the dancers in green skirts and leather zori . At last the leading actresses came through the gate as the crowd pressed in upon them and above the clamoring heads I saw cool Hana-ogi . We looked at each other cautiously , as if testing to see if either had been offended , then slowly she moved toward me through the great press of people and I think my mouth fell open slightly , for on this day , fresh from triumph , she was a glorious woman . Katsumi broke the spell by catching Hana-ogi 's hands and gabbling away in Japanese . Finally she said to me , " Hana-ogisanhope you like her play . " The tall actress looked at me over Katsumi 's shoulder and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American sailors . " Katsumi reported this and Hana-ogi blushed and said something which Katsumi was reluctant to translate . " Go ahead ! " Joe insisted . " Hana-ogi-san say Americans to be funny . Not bad . " She pressed her hands into her stomach and indicated laughter . " It was n't funny , " I said . Hana-ogi caught my meaning and frowned , so I added quickly , " But Hana-ogi-san 's dancing was wonderful . " I imitated her fight with the villains and she smiled . Hana-ogi 's other fans now pressed in upon us and I said awkwardly , " Why do n't we four have dinner ? " But whenp99Katsumi translated this , Hana-ogi grew very angry , said somethingharsh and passed abruptly down the flower walk . I now entered upon a week of dream sequences . The Korean fighting must have exhausted me more than I knew , for my sudden relaxation on the make-believe job at Itami permitted my nerves to find their own level . It was n't high and I felt as I had once at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain I would louse up the works . At other times I imagined I was back in St. Leonard 's totally confused about whether or not I wanted to attend the Point . Sometimes at night I would wake with a start and believe myself to be in a falling jet fighter up at the Yalu River , and I would struggle to regain control both of the plane and of myself . Then , as I lay in the dark Japanese night I would see hurrying across my midnight wall that lone , exquisitely lovely Takarazuka girl I had seen on the Bitchi-bashi that first day and I would try to hurry after her and find her name . But in all these imaginings I was kidding myself and I knew it . For inevitably I would think of Hana-ogi-san and I would see her dancing and I would follow the subtle curves of her adorable body and I would see her oval face smiling at me , ever so small a Japanese smile , and I would wonder how a man could be so tossed about by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to her . I knew nothing of her character or her personality , but almost willfully I was hypnotizing myself over this strange girl . Much later I would recognize that I was creating for myself the image of love and that without this image a man could well live an entire and empty life . So each evening I fed my delirium by standing at the Bitchibashito watch Hana-ogi pass by and if , during the preceding hours , I had by chance begun to question whether she really was as lovely as I imagined , one sight of her dispelled that heresy . She was even more desirable . On Friday I returned top100see Swing Butterfly and at the final promenade I applauded so loudly that Hana-ogi had to look at me , but she betrayed nothing and looked quickly away . Saturday night I was really jittery and Mike Bailey dragged me along on another secret date he had with Fumiko-san and I spent most of the evening questioning her about the Takarazuka girls , hoping that she would speak of Hana-ogi . Fumiko-san said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No money no hope for me . I read in paper Takarazuka seek new girls . I brush my hair each night , study dance , shout with my voice . I chosen and one year I work ten hours each day and think this my one chance . Supervisor like me and I go Moon Troupe with Hana-ogi-san . She kind to me and I act parts good . I live dormitory with other girls but best time when Moon Troupe go Tokyo . " I said , " You in love with someone in Tokyo ? " " Love ? How I love someone ? " " Are n't you going to get married ? " She looked at me quizzically . " I Takarazuka girl . What else could I want be ? " Her answer so amazed me that I did an impulsive thing which astonished me as much as it did Fumiko-san . I took her hands in mine and said quietly , " Tonight , when you go back to the dormitory you must speak with Hana-ogi-san . Tell her that I am in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew her hands and said in dismay , " Never hoppen ! I lana-ogi-san never speak men . And with American ! Never hoppen ! " " You tell her , " I repeated , for I was convinced that no one could dance as passionately as Hana-ogi without knowing the outlines and purpose of love . I knew that she could not refuse to see me . The next afternoon Joe Kelly drove out to Itami and saidp101abruptly , " Wife says you 're to be at our house for supper at seven . " I ca n't make ... " " Be there , Ace , " the sawed-off squirt said ominously . " I 've already ... " " Be there , Bub . Hana-ogi 's comin ' . "  |p102I  can not remember how , exactly , I got to Joe Kelly 's house that night , but when I finally turned up the alley from the canal , when at last I saw the little wooden building and the sliding paper doors my heart was hammering like thunder . I slammed the doors aside and rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Katsumi were horsingaround and cooking food . They told me to sit on the floor and from that position I watched this couple in love and it occurred to me that I myself had never lived in a house where love was . My parents loved each other in the required way and I am quite sure that General and Mrs. Webster loved each other , but it was always love for some ultimate purpose : army advancement , social position in Lancaster , children . Here I was visiting the house of love itself . " Joe , " I asked as we waited for Hana-ogi , " what was it you told me in Korea ? American husbands talk about country clubs and getting junior 's teeth fixed ? " " Yeah , but if they 're married to Japanese girls they talk about love . " " Suppose you went back to the front now . . . " " God fabbid . " " What would you talk about ? " Joe held Katsumi off at arm 's length and said , " Topic for tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm satisfied withp103what I got . " Then he spoke to her in Japanese and she burst into an uncontrolled giggle . She started to jam her hand into her mouth but Joe gave it a terrific belt and said , " Honest to God , Ace , it 's easier to train a dog . " As he said this the door opened and Hana-ogi entered . Softly and with infinite grace she slid the doors closed behind her and slipped out of her zori . She was dressed in a gray-blue kimono and her hair was rumpled . She stood so silently that Joe and Katsumi did not realize she was there ; so while their backs were still turned I stumbled awkwardly to my knees and started toward her , finally gaining my feet . She laughed at my discomfort and the sound of her voice was so gentle that I was compelled to reach down and take her hands to my lips and try to kiss them , but as I did so she instinctively pulled them away and I noticed with indescribable emotion that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pass and said , " I am so glad you came . " She did not understand my words but even so she nodded in acknowledgment and I thought that she was less irritated than she had been when I tried to kiss her hand  --  and for my part I knew that she was twice as beautiful as I had ever seen her on the stage when she was dressed in men 's clothes . Katsumi now hurried forward and embraced the actress while Joe greeted her in broken Japanese , at which she laughed heartily , and I got the distinct impression that she was not at all the remote and glamorous girl I had stared at on the Bitchibashi , for her gentle good humor was exactly what you would expect from a good , happy country girl working in the city . But I had seen only two aspects of Hana-ogi and she was infinite , for when I asked Katsumi what her last name was and when Katsumi blushed and said she would n't dare ask that question I insisted , and when Hana-ogi heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatp104was happening but Katsumi , blushing a fiery red which showed through her yellow cheeks , said , " Takarazuka girl never tell her real name . " " What do you mean , her real name ? " " Her name not Hana-ogi . Only stage name . " " What is her real name ? " I insisted . Katsumi spoke to the actress and the only word I understood was America and Hana-ogi grew very solemn and spoke harshly , after which Katsumi said , " She will not say her name . Even I do n't know that . " Joe interrupted and said , " That 's the way with all professionalgirls in Japan  --  geishas  --  whores ... " " Wait a minute ! " I cried . " This girl . . . " I reached out to take her hand , but she drew away from me and Katsumi said , " More better we eat . " It was a pretty formal meal . I asked a half dozen questions , none of which Hana-ogi really answered and it was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was any real animation . Then the two girls spoke in rapid Japanese , laughed a lot and sang bits of songs from the famous shows Hana-ogi had starred in . Finally the ice thawed a bit and I learned that Hana-ogi came from the north of Japan , where a woman in a nearby village had once seen a Takarazukashow in Tokyo . This woman had suggested that Hanaogiapply for the examinations . Her father had been killed in the B-29 raids on Tokyo . Her brother had been hung for what he did to American soldiers in a prisoner-of-war camp . Hana-ogi 's willingness to tell of her family encouraged me to speak and I said Iliad a good start in the Air Force and with my background I surely ought to become a colonel and from there on it was the roll of the dice . I said that if I did become a general I hoped I would be as good a one as my father . She asked his name and when I said Hot Shot Harry Gruver shep105grew silent and Katsumi said , " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal again . Hana-ogi rose and indicated that she must go . I was deeply agitated at having seen her , having talked with her  --  even though it was in translation  --  and I did not want to have her go . I said , " Katsumi , please ask her to stay . " Hana-ogi replied something sharp which Katsumi refused to translate . When I insisted she stood stubbornly silent , so I appealed to Hana-ogi , who looked at me in a quiet , submissiveJapanese way which betrayed no emotion but which dared me to budge her one inch . Softly , as if she were a child of seven , she said , " America . . . no ! " I could sense in her gentle reply a finality of hatred and steel , but she bowed slightly , smiled with an infuriating complacency , and looked back at me from the sliding doors . " America . . . no ! " she repeated softly , but long after she had gone I recalled the graceful way she bent down by the doors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she arranged her kimono , so in spite of persistent apprehension that I was headed for trouble , I determined that no matter what she thought of Americans , no matter what orders Camp Kobe handed down regardingJapanese girls , I was going to see her again . For the next two nights nothing happened . I posted myself at the Bitchi-bashi to watch the procession of girls and when I saw Hana-ogi , her hair in the wind , step upon the bridge at the opposite end , my heart actually hammered like one of those riveting machines you fix airplane wings with . God , she was like a medieval princess walking out from the palace . She was so straight and proud and sure of herself . And her black eyes shining out like fires from her golden face . . . " Son , you got it bad ! " Mike Bailey warned me on the secondnight . " I 'm going to see that girl . Tomorrow . "  | " Son , are you taking this seriously ? " I turned to look at Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you take Fumiko seriously ? " I asked . " Who started this , anyway ? " " Fumi-chan ? " he laughed . " Son , a Marine has to be involved with a pretty girl or he is n't a Marine . But who could get serious over a Takarazuka girl ? They got sawdust for hearts . " " What is this ? " I asked . " A little while ago you were telling me . Mike scratched his head and said , " I had a cousin once who came to stay with me right before a big high-school basketball game . I looked at the ugly little squirt and said , Hell , he ca n't be gettin ' measles . ' But he was and I was quarantined . Son , I think you 're gettin ' measles . " I said , " Tomorrow night I 'm going to storm that Bitchibashiand I 'm going to have a date with that girl . " " Son , " Mike said , " you ca n't have measles but , by God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the bridge on that third night and as the first Takarazuka girls crossed I felt my heart hammering again and soon there was Hana-ogi , accompanied by three other stars , and I stepped right into the middle of them and took Hana-ogi 's hand and brought its yellow knucklesright up to my lips and kissed it . Then I said , " I have got to see you , " but none of the girls spoke English and Hana -- ogi drew her hand away and started to leave , but I no longer gave a damn so I grabbed her by the shoulder and swung her around and kissed her on the lips . We kept our eyes open and I remember that in this crazy moment I could not tell whether her eyes were slanted or not , but they were very black , like the sky at night . She pushed me away and crossed the bridge and I heardp107behind me the muttering of Japanese men and I thought , " Oh . damn , a public mess and I 'll be court-martialed , " but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing and one old fellow with a load of wood on his back pointed at some more Takarazuka girls approaching on the bridge and made motions encouraging me to kiss them too , but I hurried back to the Marine Barracks , where Mike Bailey greeted me with a pair of field glasses and the crack , " It looked good , son . The subtle approach . Grrrrr . " I said , " I promised to see her tonight . I did . " He said , " Ace , do n't let this thing get you . If you want to make a play for a pretty actress  --  O.K. But do n't let it get you . Frankly , you looked silly as hell down there on the bridge . " In a few minutes a Japanese boy appeared with a message for Mike and he said , " Fumi-chan wants to see me in the restaurant . She wants you to come along . " When we got there Makino-san , the cook , had already heard of my behavior and he gave me hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much wrong , Ace-san . " " What did I do ? " I demanded . " I kissed a girl . " " A Takarazuka girl , " he said with reverence . Before he could argue further Fumiko-san appeared , extremely beautiful and very feminine . She did not cry but she did plead with me and said that something like that could ruin a Takarazuka girl and that if Hana-ogi ever lost her job her mother and her younger sisters . . . " She very poor , Hana-ogi , " Fumiko told me . " What do you mean ? " I asked . " You Americans not know what poor is . Hana-ogi never tasted meat until she came Takarazuka . Never had one nice clothes . Ace-san , you not speak her again  --  please ? " She told me that Hana-ogi 's only chance in life  --  her one opportunity to escape from terrible poverty  --  was Takarazuka.  | " I know this girl , " she said solemnly . " Before she come for examination not eat for three days to get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent wave . She said there was already a likelihood that Hana-ogi might become one of the rare lucky ones  --  kept on at Takarazuka forever " as teacher of the dancing " when her days as an actress were over . " Here is good life for Hana-ogi-san . There is no other . " I asked Fumiko why she risked seeing Mike Bailey and she laughed . " I not great actress . I not poor girl . My family making lots of money again . " Then she pleaded , " Do not come to the bridge again , Acesan . Please ? " I wanted to see Hana-ogi , I wanted to see her eyes close to mine and her golden face pressed against my lips , but I said , " I promise . " To my surprise Fumiko-san kissed me , her beautifulJapanese face leaning across the table , and she said , " American men so good . Even when Hana-ogi-san come home tonight and say , American men no good , ' I speak her they all right . " But although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant nothing , for the very next morning Joe Kelly wheeled up to Itami Air Field and said with real joy , " Dinner again tonight , Ace ! " My heart must have bled out through my eyes , for he laughed and said , " Yep . Hana-ogi came into Osaka late last night and talked with Katsumi for three hours . " " What did she say ? " " How should I know ? " And he rattled off a jumble of Japanese . I wish that throughout the rest of my life I could occasionallyknow the excitement that captured me that night . I shaved at Itami , polished my shoes and set out for Osaka . Ip109went nearly crazy in a tiny Japanese taxicab . The driver was all smiles and said yes , he understood just where I wanted to go , but we wound up in hell , I think , and in desperation I had to get a little boy to lead us back to the main station and I went to Joe 's house on foot . I thrust back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " But she was not there . Katsumi was alone , singing to herself as she prepared dinner . I sat on the floor and watched her time-christened movements over the charcoal stoves that Japanese women have used for centuries . For them there were no can openers , no frozen foods . Each item was laboriously prepared by hand and as Katsumi did this ancient work she hummed old songs and it seemed to me that she grew lovelier each day  --  but how truly lovely I was to learn in a few minutes . For little Joe Kelly came busting into the house trembling with anger . He threw a package on the floor and cried , " This son-of-a-bitch of a colonel ! " I had heard Joe sound off against officers before and I tried to tone him down , but this time he had real cause . " This bastard , Colonel Calhoun Craford ! He rides me . Every damned day he rides me . " I happened to be watching Katsumi at the brazier . She never looked up , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her ankles , in their white tabi socks , trembled slightly and I knew she was desperately afraid for her man . For I had heard of this Calhoun Craford , a tough guy who hated colored people . Joe said , " Every guy in that outfit who 's married to a Japanese girl goes through hell with this bastard Craford . " Katsumi , aware that Joe 's trouble had been caused by her , now left the charcoal brazier and came into the middle of the room . She pushed Joe down onto a pillow and took off hisp110shoes . " You not to come on tatami with shoes , Joe , " she said softly . She brought him a tiny cup of hot sake wine and when he had drunk this she led him into the other room where there was a Japanese bath and soon I could hear tensed up little Joe Kelly , the dead-end kid , sloshing about in the tub while his patient wife soused him with cold water and rubbed his back . After a while they joined me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him . He said , " To hell with Colonel Craford . Look what I got ! " And he produced a bottle of Italian wine which Katsumi took . Then , as we heard the soft click of zori on the alley stones , we all fell silent and I think Joe and Katsumi were as excited as I , although their hearts could n't have been pounding as hard . The paper doors slid back and there was Hana-ogi in a green-and-gold kimono , her lips slightly parted in a smile , her brilliant eyes glowing from her night walk and her jet black hair mussed by the wind that blew along the canal . She started to speak but I caught her in my arms and kissed her . This time we closed our eyes , but when we finally drew apart  --  for she was kissing me too  --  she passed the back of her hand across her forehead and I think she knew then that for a girl dedicated to Takarazuka and a man dedicated to American military life love could result only in tragedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed her zori and sat down on the tatami and spoke quietly to Katsumi , who spoke to Joe in Japanese , and all three of them fumbled around , not knowing how to translate what Hana-ogi had said , so she held out her hand to me and invited me to sit upon the mats beside her , and finally Katsumi said , " She not mad no more . " After dinner Katsumi said , " Joe , we take walk . " Hana-ogi did not protest and as soon as the fragile doors slid shut I took her in my arms . We sat upon the mats unable to say a word . I put my fingerp111on her wonderful face and said , " Nice , " but she could not understand . She gave me some instructions in Japanese but all I could do was shrug my shoulders , so she laughed and grabbed my big toe and pulled my cramped legs out straight and patted my knees , indicating that I must be stiff from sitting Japanese style . Then she made a pillow for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our meaningless conversation on the tatamis . It was apparent to each of us that we would meet many times , but that when she passed me on the Bitchi-bashi she would look straight ahead and it was also apparent that she intended us to be lovers  --  but not on this first quiet night  --  and that as the days went by we would postpone one decision after another until finally some external force , say Takarazuka or General Webster , intervened to make the climactic decisionsfor us , but as she looked down at me with calm eyes , as her wonderful hands held my face and as her slim , graceful legs stretched out at last beside mine on the tatami mats , one question at least was answered . I had often wondered how a self-respecting American could get excited about a Japanese girl . Now I knew . When it came time to leave , Hana-ogi refused to be seen with me on the street and caught a train back to Takarazuka . Joe drove me over to Itami , where I took the bus to Takarazuka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because when I got to my room and looked out at the Bitchi-bashi , there was Hana-ogi crossing it in the April moonlight . I rushed down to speak with her but she passed proudly by , her creamcoloredzori going pin-toed along the railroad track to her dormitory . I did n't sleep much that night because when I got back to my room I found a letter which had been delivered by special messenger . It contained a routine reminder of recentp112orders issued by Camp Kobe and along the foot in capitalletters I read : ANY PUBLIC DISPLAY WHATEVER OF AFFECTION FOR A JAPANESE NATIONAL BY A MEMBER OF THIS COMMAND IS FORBIDDEN . OFFICERS SHOULD NOT EVEN APPEAR ON PUBLIC STREETS ACCOMPANIED BY WOMEN OF THE INDIGENOUS PERSONNEL . I knew that I was entangled in a ridiculous situation , for I could not walk with Hana-ogi in the city and she could not walk with me in the town . If General Webster caught me datinga Japanese girl I would be disciplined and if the Takarazukapeople heard of Hana-ogi dating an American she would be fired from the Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in at St. Leonard 's . Then I was a prince trying to prevent my niece from marrying a penniless schoolteacher . The kid who played the schoolteacher was a miserable drip in real life and I remember that on-stage I becamepretty outraged , but now it was happening to me , and Mrs. Webster riding herd on me and the Takarazuka railroad company protecting their investment in Hana-ogi were going to be a lot tougher than a Ruritanian prince played by seventeen-year-oldLloyd Gruver . For about two hours that morning as I lay awake  --  from three to five  --  I decided the whole affair was too damned silly , but toward dawn I began to see Hana-ogi dancing along the wall of my room and her classical postures , the stamping of her feet and the gestures of her right hand allured me so that I could think only of her tight and disciplined body . My thoughts were filled with the grace of her movement and as the sun rose I fell asleep knowing that somewhere within the triangle of the three cities we would meet.  |p113It  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for Hana-ogi at the Bitchi-bashi but she did not appear and disconsolatelyI wandered down to the railroad station to purchasea ticket back to Itami , but as I approached the cage I saw Hana-ogi standing off to one side , holding a ticket in her hand and impulsively , even though we were in the heart of Takarazuka , she came to me and we went to the ticket cage together and we bought two tickets for a small town at the end of the line , and on this lovely day we walked for the first time through the ancient Japanese countryside . Hana-ogi , unable to speak a phrase of English , and I quite as dumb in Japanese , walked along the rice fields and across the little ridges that ran like miniature footpaths beside the irrigation ditches . We nodded to old women working the fields , laughed at children , and watched the white birds flying . Hana-ogi wore her green and white kimono and her cream zori and she was a bird herself , the May wind catching at her loose garments and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went the land was crowded . Where in Texas there would be one fanner here there were forty . Where the footpath in New Hampshire might be crowded with three people , here it was overwhelmed with fifty . There were nop114vacant fields , no woodlots , no mossy banks beside the wanderingstreams . On every foot of land there were people and no matter how far we walked into the countryside there were always more people . More than any day I ever lived in my life I treasure this day because I discovered not only Hana-ogi 's enormous love but I also discovered her land , the tragic , doomed land of Japan , and from it I learned the fundamental secret of her country : too many people . In Korea we used to joke about enlisted men who bought Japanese girls of sixteen or seventeen  --  a man could buy a young girl anywhere in Japan  --  and we thought it a horrible reflection on Japan , but today I saw that it would always be possible to find some Japanese farmer who would be eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stayed at home and had to fight for her share of the skimpy rice in the family bowl she could never do as well as if she went off with a man who could buy rice for her . All the problems we used to laugh about as being so strange  --  so unlike America  --  I saw explained this afternoon . The Japanese were no different from us . Their farmers loved their daughters exactly as Iowa farmers love theirs . But there was not enough land . There was never enough food . I thank God for that May evening walking among the rice fields while the crickets droned at us , for if I had not seen this one particular old man tending his field I am sure that when I finally learned the terrifying truth about Hana-ogi I could no longer have loved her ; but having seen this old man and his particles of soil I loved her the more . He stood where a trail turned off from the main road , leavingin the joint a thin sliver of useless land that in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Japan this tragic triangle was a man 's field , the sustenance of one man 's large family . On this May night he was bent over thep115ield , digging it to a depth of fourteen inches . The dug soil he placed reverently to one side until his tiny field was excavated . Then , as we watched , he took each handful of soil and gently pulverized it , allowing it to return to its bed . Pebbles he tossed aside and sticks and foreign things , and in the two days that followed this man would finger each item of his soil . Not for him a plow or a harrow , but the gnarled fingers and the bendingback . It is difficult for me to report these things , for I can not explainhow Hana-ogi explained them to me . By pointing , by gestures , by little pantomimes with the old man she explained that he was like her father except that her father 's field  --  before the American bombs killed him  --  was slightly bigger . But her father had nine children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the distant hills that in terribly crowded Japan Hana-ogi and I were seeking a place in which to make love . There was now no thought of Japanese or American . We were timeless human beings without nation or speech or different color . I now understood the answer to the second question that had perplexed me in Korea : " How can an American who fought the Japs actually go to bed with a Jap girl ? " The answer was so simple . Nearly a half million of our men had found the simple answer . You find a girl as lovely as Hana-ogi  --  and she is not Japanese and you are not American . As we walked into the twilight we drew closer together . She took my hand and also took my heart and as dusk fell over us we searched more urgently from side to side . We were no more looking at the white birds or the old men bending over their fields . We were looking for a refuge  --  any kind of refuge  --  for we were desperately in love . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , but they were houses , for random trees were not allowed to growp116in Japan . Again Hana-ogi pointed to a barn , but it was occupied . In Japan there was not even spare land for love . But at last we came to a structure that was familiar to me , two inclined massive poles with two more set across them at the top like an enormous capital A , flat at the point . It was the timeless symbol of a Shinto shrine and here there were trees , but as always there were people too . We watched them come through the towering A , stand silently before the shrine , clap their hands three times , bow and depart , the torn white paper and the rice ropes of their religion fluttering quietly in the wind above them . Hana-ogi took my hand and led me past the shrine until we came to a grassy bank partially protected by four trees . Villagers passed ten feet from us and dogs barked nearby . Across the mound we could see the dim lights of houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in America . There was no place where there were not people . But at last we had to ignore them and it seemed to me as I sank beside Hana-ogi in the May twilight that we were being watched by the million eyes of Japan . I remember vividly two things that happened . I had no conceptionof a kimono and thought it a kind of wrap-around dress but when we embraced and it was clear that Hana-ogi intended that we love completely , I tried to undo this gossamer dress , but it led to another and then another and to still more and although we could not speak we fell to laughing at my astonishment . Then suddenly we laughed no more , for I was faced with the second vast occurrence of the day , for when in the fading light I at last saw Hana-ogi 's exquisite body I realizedwith shock  --  even though I was prepared to accept it  --  that I was with a girl of Asia . I was with a girl whose completebody was golden and not white and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fear , for shep117caught my white arm and held it across her golden breasts and studied it and looked away and then as quickly caught me to her whole heart and accepted the white man from America . We returned at last to Takarazuka and as we approached that lovely place we went into separate cars and I waited long till Hana-ogi had disappeared across the Bitchi-bashi before I appeared on the streets , heading for the Marine Barracks . Mike Bailey was in the shower and when he heard me go by he yelled and brought me back to military life with a fearful bang . He said , " Mrs. Webster saw me in Kobe today and asked me a lot of questions . " " About you and Fumi-chan ? " I asked , nonchalantly . " Do n't play coy , son . About you and Eileen . " " What'd'j tell her ? " " It is n't so much what I told her as what she asked . " He waited for me to press the point , but I called downstairs for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were going with a Japanese girl . " I sort of gulped on my beer and Mike said promptly , " Of course I said no . You are n't , are you ? " I took another drink of beer and pondered a long time what I ought to say . Then the pressing desire to talk with someone overcame me and I said , " I 've been walking with Hana-ogi . We must have walked for five miles and I 'm so deep in love .. . " Mike was a fine character to talk with at a time like this . He laughed and said , " I feel like a traitor , Ace , getting you into this . Hell , I 'm the one who 's supposed to be in love . " I said , " It hit me like a propeller zinging around when you are n't looking . Jesus , Mike , I tell you the truth , I 'm desperate . " Mike laughed again and said , " No need for a guy to be desperate in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's an actress , there 's always the Tiger of Takarazuka . Better men than you . . . " I started to say boldly , " But we . . . " My voice trailed off and I ended lamely , " The stars came right down and knocked me out . " Mike looked at me quizzically , then said without joking , " Look , Ace , I know better than most men around here how sweet a Japanese girl can be . But do n't get involved . For the love of God , Ace , do n't get involved . " " I am involved . " " Mrs. Webster said the M.P . ' s have instructions to pick up officers seen holding hands with indigenous personnel . That 's a lovely phrase , is n't it ? " " I just do n't give a damn , Mike . To hell with the M.P . ' s and to hell with Mrs. Webster . " " I agree with you , Ace . But while I was talking with the general 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good look . For Christ sake , Ace , that girl 's a ravin ' beauty . Why do you have to mess around with a Japanese actress if this Eileen is on tap ? " I put the beer down and stared at the floor . That was the question I had not wanted Mike to ask . I saw Eileen as I had known her at Vassar , bright , eager , a wonderful sport . I saw her that winter in Texas when her father was a colonel at San Antonio and I was at Randolph Field . Why had n't I married her then ? Why had she turned down the other young officers and insisted upon waiting for me ? I felt like the announcer who asks the burning questions at the end of each radio programabout breaking hearts , but I knew that you could turn my radio on the next day and still not get the answers . I looked up at Mike and said , " I do n't know . " He asked me directly , " Are you afraid of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " He said , " I 've been over here a long time , what with one thing and another . I 've watched lots of our men go for these Japanese girls . . . Hell , I wo n't be superior about it . I do myself . Frankly and all kidding aside , Ace , I 'd a damned sight rather marry Fumiko-san than Eileen . But I just wondered why you felt that way ? " " I do n't feel that way . At least if I do I do n't know about it . But why do you ? " " With me it 's very clear . One thing explains it all . You ever had your back scrubbed by a Japanese girl ? Not a bath attendantmind you . That 's simple . But a girl who really loved you ? " " What 's back scrubbing got to do with it ? " " Ace , either you understand or you do n't . " " What are you driving at ? " " I 'm trying to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along together . Some of the ways work in Turkey , some work in China . In America we 've constructed our own ways . What I 'm saying is that of them all I prefer the Japanese way . " He laughed and saw that I did n't entirely understand , so he banged his beer down and shouted , " All right ! One easy question ! Can you imagine Eileen Webster scrubbing your back ? " It was a crazy question , a truly hellish shot in the dark , but I could immediately visualize fat little Katsumi Kelly the other night , taking her sore and defeated husband into the bath and knocking the back of his neck and getting him his kimono and quietly reassuring him that her love was more important than whatever Lt.Col . Calhoun Craford had done to him , and I saw runty , sawed-off Joe Kelly coming back to life as a completeman and I had great fear  --  like Mike Bailey  --  that Eileen Webster would not be able or willing to do that for her manp120Oh , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lt.Col . Craford , or she would take a job and help me earn enough so that I could tell Lt.Col . Craford to go to hell , or she could do a million other capable things ; but I did not think she could take a wounded man and make him whole , for my mother in thirty years of married life had never once , so far as I knew , done for my father the simple healing act that Katsumi Kelly had done for her man the other night . Mike said it for me . He laughed and said , " There are all kinds of things wrong with Japan . But Japanese women are n't one of them and their view of love suits me fine . " Then he added , " But I hate to see you be the one to take it all seriously . Because the Air Force would never let you marry a Japanese girl ... " " What would the Air Force have to do about it ? " " You 'd see . You 're one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures to bear . . . " " Who 's talking about marriage ? " Mike sighed . " That 's better . The way you started , you were talking about marriage . " " I said I was confused . " " I 'd be confused too if I was involved with two women like Eileen and Hana-ogi . " He grew thoughtful and added , " It 's very strange . I 'd never have picked Hana-ogi . She 's always so mannish . Come to think of it , I 've never seen her in girl 's clothes . Have you ? " I thought of her rare charm and started to speak reverently but this scared Mike and he said , " Ace , I know damn well you 're thinking about marriage and it 's going to be tough . Son , it 's going to be tough . " I insisted that I did n't know what I was thinking about , but my problem was solved for me in an unforeseen manner . Katsumi and Joe dropped by the air base the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We have find house for you , Ace . " " A house ! " I drew her toward a wall where no one could listen . " Yes , one small house . " " What do I want with a house ? " " Where else you and Hana-ogi-san stay ? " " Wait a . . . " " You not love Hana-ogi ? " " Sure I love her , but . . . " I appealed to Joe , who grinned and said , " When a Japanese girl loves you , Ace , it 's solid . How you suppose I got my house ? " I said to them , " Hana-ogi could get into trouble . .. " Katsumi looked at me incredulously and said , " When Hanaogicome our house to see you it mean she love you . When she walk to Shinto shrine it mean same thing . Where you two make love ? Here at Itami ? I do n't think so . ( She pronounced it , " I don ' sink so . " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takarazuka ? No ! " I was about to call the whole affair off when Katsumi handed me a map showing that the house was not far from hers . Then she said , gravely , " Today Hana-ogi-san number one girl at Takarazuka . She work very hard for this . You be good man not tell anyone you love Hana-ogi . She make very dangerous come Osaka for you . " If it 's so dangerous ... " " But she tell me all time she work hard she think some day she meet . . . " Katsumi blushed and could not continue , so I waited until she gained courage , whereupon she whispered , " Hana-ogi tall girl . Not little fat girl same me . Long time she dream she meet tall man  --  same you . " I must have shown my disappointment at being chosen because I was six-feet-two , so Katsumi said , " She meet manyp122tall men but no one brave like you  --  no one brave to stand at bridge many times to see her . " That was Katsumi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come your new house tonight seven o'clock . " I was now overboard in the slipstream where things happen so fast you never get your parachute open . I was tumbling about and all thought of General Webster 's orders , my promotionin service and my early ideas about the Japanese enemy were swirling in confusion . But of one thing I was determined . I would go to that house in Osaka early in the afternoon and I would clean it and I would stock the shelves with food and I would make it a home . But at three-thirty I was called into an urgent meeting and it was nearly seven when I reached Osaka . I hurried up the main street to where my canal ran off to the right and I passed along the narrow footpath until I came to a little store , where I bought an armful of things to eat . Then I took a deep breath and walked out into the May twilight . As I approached my house I saw that the sliding doors were open and from them came a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny cloud of dust followed by the merest flick of a broom . Hana-ogi had hurried to the new house to clean it for my arrival . I dashed into the room , threw the food on the floor and took her in my arms . I kissed her wildly and pressed her golden cheek next to mine , but instead of the flood of kisses I anticipatedshe pushed me away , pointed to my shoes and cried , " Oh , Rroyd-san ! " For a moment I was bewildered and then she knelt down and started to untie my offending shoes . Quickly I prevented her from doing this , so she picked up the food I had dropped and when she placed it on the shelf I saw that with her own money she had already stocked the kitchen . There was a pot cooking over the brazier and I looked in ,  |p123then  turned quickly to find Hana-ogi cleaning my shoes and placing them in the corner . I took three steps , lifted her away from my shoes and carried her into the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hana-ogi laughed and with her expressive head indicated a closet which I kicked open , releasing the bed roll . I spread it as well as I could with my feet and gently placed Hana-ogi upon it . She closed her slanted eyes for a moment , then looked up and smiled , pulling me down beside her.  |p124In  the days that followed I often recalled the stories I had read about American and English sailors who had fallen in love with island girls and of how idyllic it was . But these damnable stories invariably ended with the big kiss and it had not occurredto me that after the big kiss these island lovers must have had things they wanted to talk about . But how did they talk without any language ? How in hell did they talk ? I do not think that those who have always stayed at home can understand how terrible a thing language is , how dependentwe are upon it . During the tremendous weeks that followedwhen May flowers bloomed along our canal there were times when I almost tore at my throat trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all right to gesture at a girl 's eyes and indicate that they are lovely but if you feel your heart expand at the very sound of her quiet approach along the canal  --  if you feel the earth tremble at night when she brings your soft pillow to the bed roll while beside it she places her canvas pillow filled with rice bran  --  then you feel that you must speak to her or perish . I knew exactly four Japanese phrases . Ichi ban meant numberone and I used this interminably . When I first saw Hana -- ogi undressed I gasped at her amazing beauty and cried , " Ichi ban ! " When she cooked a good meal it was " Ichi ban . " Whenp125she saw President Truman 's picture in the paper I said , " America ichi ban . " And once when she suggested that her breasts were too small I protested , " Ichi ban ! Ichi ban ! " I also knew Domo arigato gozaimasu , which meant thank you . I used it all the time and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to us . We were deeply indebted to each other , for we had undertaken unusual risks , so there was an extra tenderness about all we did . When I spread the bed roll I would say , " Dom ' arigato " but more often I used the full phrase . I was in a land of courtesy where great courtesy had been extended me . Of course I knew the universal Japanese words takusan and sukoshi for much and little . Every American in Japan used these words as his final comment upon an infinity of subjects . The words look strange to me as I write them , for in Japanese the letter u is not pronounced in connection with k and it was taksan this and skoshi that just as it was Ta-ka-raz-ka and skiyaki rather than sukiyaki . I remember once when I was moved to great depths by something Hana-ogi had done and I pointed to my heart , put her golden hand above it and cried , " Takusan , takusan ! " And I indicated that it was for her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years . And finally I knew that strangest of Japanese phrases , Ah , so desu-ka ! It was usually abbreviated into Ah , so ! and meant exactly what it would mean in English . It was also shortened to Soka , Soda , and Deska and I used it for everything . Often I would hear Hana-ogi and Katsumi talking and one of them would be narrating something and the other would repeat over and over in the most mournful way , " Ah , so desu-ka ! Ah , so desu-ka ! " We all laughed hilariously when Joe found an American newspaper item in which a famous woman journalistfrom New York said that even the Empress of Japan was5p126becoming Americanized because she spoke a little English . " All the time I talked with the Empress she nodded her head and whenever she agreed with me she said clearly , Ah , so ! ' " Hana-ogi , on her part , had acquired just about as much English . Like all Japanese girls her favorite phrase was Never happen ! She could say this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might be trying to make , but once when I said that some day she would see New York she said with great finality , " Never hoppen . " A second phrase she used a great deal was one she picked up from Katsumi and it too was common all over Japan : I do n't think so . Hana-ogi had trouble with th and this phrase of classic doubt usually came out , " I don ' sink so . " But if Hana-ogi had difficulty with th , her conflict with I 's and v 's and f 's was unending . She had acquired , from her Takarazuka shows , a few American phrases which she loved to use on me at unexpected moments , but they were so mangled because of the limited alphabet of sound in the Japanesetongue that I often had to think twice to detect her meaning . Once , at the end of a long night when we stayed up to clean our tiny house she caught me in her arms and cried , " Oh Rroyd , I rub you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion and her pronunciation and for one dreadful moment I almost laughed and then I looked down at her dear sweet slanted eyes and saw that they were filled with tears and we sat down on the tatami as morning broke and she told me in signs and kisses and strange half-words that she had never thought that she , Hana-ogi  --  dedicated to Takarazuka and knowing else would ever discover what it was to .... She stopped and we had no words to finish the thought . Then she jumped up and cried , " I make you cawhee . " And she took down the coffee pot . It was true that not being able to talk made our physicalp127love , there on the tatami mats , more powerful , but when that was past , when you lay there on the dark floor and heard feet along the canal path , you yearned desperately to talk of ordinary things , and once I thought of what Joe had said and I wished to God that I might be able to talk with Hana-ogi about the country club or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like the news that Katsumi-san was going to have a baby . I wanted to talk about that baby , what it would be like , would its eyes be Japanese , would it live well in America , but all I could do was to place my hand on Hanaogi'shard flat stomach and whisper , " Katsumi-san takusantakusan . " And she kept my hand there and said back , " Maybe some time Hana-ogi takusan " and we looked at each other and I think we both prayed that some day Hana-ogi would be takusan . The matter of praying gave us some trouble , as it did Joe and Katsumi . Joe , being a good Catholic , was repelled when Katsumi established in their home a Shinto shrine , complete with symbols to be prayed to . There were some heated words and the shrine came down , but I do n't think Hana-ogi would have agreed to surrendering her Shinto faith , for one day I came home and found that she had erected in our home three separate shrines : Shinto , Buddhist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the three , but she said she was willing to be all of them for me . I asked her why she honored both Shinto and Buddhism and she said that many Japanese were both and that some were Christians as well , and she found nothing curious in tending the three shrines faithfully and I noticed that she paid just as fair attention to my one as she did to her two . It became so imperative that we converse with each other that we looked forward with sheer delight to the visits of Joe and Katsumi and I was glad whenever Katsumi sneaked awayp128from Joe 's surveillance and came to our house to pray to her Shinto gods for her baby to be a boy and strong . Whenever she appeared Hana-ogi and I would unleash an accumulation of questions about the most trivial things . I would say , " Tell Hana-ogi I like more salt in all my vegetables . " Imagine , I had been unable to convey that simple idea accurately . And Katsumi would reply , " Hana-ogi want know , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that what she was trying to ask ? " and I would repeat the word octopus and Hana-ogi would tell me what it was in Japanese and thus we would possess one more word to share . But the hoard of meanings grew so slowly that I used to look with envy upon the G.I. 's I saw who had mastered the language . Once buying groceries I met a tough Texas boy with his Japanese girl and they were having an argument over some apples . Finally he asked in disgust , " Hey , whatsamatta you ? " The little Japanese girl caught her breath , grew trembling mad and slapped the Texas G.I. right across the face . Then , hands on hips , she demanded , " Whatsamatta you , you whatsamattame ? I whatsamatta you first ! " The G.I. laughed and picked up a box of candy , saying with a bow , " You my gal friendo ichi ban . I presento you . " The little girl put her arm in his , cocked her head on one side and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He kissed her and cried , " You 're steky-goddamned-ne , baby . " I envied the couple , for they had created a language of their own and it permitted them to convey their affection accurately . Like young children who refuse to be bothered by language , they ignored both Japanese and English and inhabiteda delightful world of their own . I returned with my purchases and asked , " Hana-ogi , what steky-ne ? " She thought for a moment then put my finger onp129an especially attractive design on her kimono and said , " Stekyne . " I thought she was referring to the needlework and I pointed to another part of the kimono and asked , " Steky-ne ? " but she shook her head . I was perplexed , so she thought and took my finger and outlined her wonderful oval face , leaving my hand at her chin , asking , " You think  --  steky-ne ? " And then I realized what the word meant and I kissed her warmly and whispered , " Steky-takusan-takusan-ne . " But as the days passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was impossible to exist as passionately as we insisted without better communication of ideas , so I started to learn a little Japanese and Hana-ogi  --  who despised Americans and what they had done to Japan  --  reluctantly joined an English class . She bought a little conversation book which she studied each day on the train back and forth to Takarazuka and one night she volunteered her first complete sentence in English . Screwing up her courage like a schoolgirl reciting Milton , she swallowed , smiled at me and declaimed , " Lo , the postillion has been struck by lightning . " The shock of these words was so great that I burst into uncontrolledlaughter and I saw Hana-ogi slowly freeze with hatred . I had laughed at her best intentions . I too was an American . I rose quickly from the floor to apologize , but when she saw me move toward her she ran away . Grabbing her English book she tore it to pieces and threw them at me . Those pages which fell at her feet she trampled upon and screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands and kissed her . I held her head to mine and when she started to sob I could have torn my tongue out . This cruel inability to speak was killing us andp130we were becoming lost people in a void of ideas . . . We were lovers who could not love and when Hana-ogi had sought to bridge this gap  --  humiliating herself and surrendering her hatred of the enemy  --  I had laughed at her . I realized then that words must no longer be permitted to keep us apart . I lifted Hana-ogi to the bed roll and placing her beautiful legs toward the fire , I held her head close to my heart and burst into my own words , whether she could understandthem or not . That night I said , " Hana-ogi , Hana-ogi ! I love you with all the heart and mind within me . I 've been a barren desert . . . I 've been a man flying a lost plane far in the sky and I have never before known a human being . Now I 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've met you and taken you away from these people and brought you to a tiny house and you have made a shred of heaven here . Hana-ogi , if I 've hurt you through my ignorance you ought to lash me through the streets of Osaka , for my heart is in your care and if I were to hurt you I would be destroying myself . Whether you understand or not , these words are for you . " And I kissed her . I believe she comprehended what I said , for with her face now pressed to mine she spoke softly in Japanese and I think she unburdened herself of the accumulated passions that had been tormenting her word-stricken heart . I closed my eyes and listened to the wonderful sound of her voice as she uttered the strange , angular syllables of her native language . She said one word which sounded like hoshimashita and I looked up and said it and she laughed and kissed my lips to keep them still while she completed her statement . She did not use one word I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and we knew that we were more deeply in love than ever before.  |p131From  that night on Hana-ogi and I talked with each other a great deal and we discovered that in love what is said is far less important to the person spoken to than to the one who speaks . If I wanted to tell her that the days were growing longer and that I first noticed this during the year when I was a young boy on an Army base in Montana , I said just that , and it was marvelous for me , for then I remembered how I felt as a boy  --  the great cleanness of life and the bigness  --  and I had a larger heart with which to love . And Hana-ogi spoke to me of her childhood and of how she dreamed of going to Tokyo and of how , when she got there , it seemed so much smaller than she had imagined . I understood only a little of what she intended , but one thing I understood with amazing clarity : when she had talked of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever imagined a woman could be . In those long nights of talking , there in the bed roll on the tatami mats , I think we came closer to sharing with complete finality two human lives than will ever be possible for me again . Forbidden the use of words , we drove our hearts to understanding , and we understood . In the morning after Ilana-ogi tore up the English book I gathered the mutilated pages to burn them , but in doing so I noticed that her book had been published in 1879 by a brilliant Japanese scholar who had apparently been bowled over by English during those first wonderful days when Japan was opening her gates to Western learning . This gentleman 's first sentence " for young ladies to use when starting a conversation in public " was Hana-ogi 's epic " Lo , the postillion has been struck by lightning , " and although I am sure the ancient scholar never intended it so , that sentence became the gag line of an American-Japanese home . Whenever trouble appeared in any form Hana-ogi would declaim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the book and smoothed out some of the other pages which yielded gems like " The portmanteau of my father is in the room of my mother . " Hana-ogi asked me what this meant and I tried to explain , but the more I endeavoredthe sillier it all became until we were convulsed with laughter and I remember thinking , while Hana-ogi tickled me in the ribs , of the G.I. booklet on Japan which said : " The Japanese have no sense of humor . " But the phrase that quite captivated me was the very first one for use at a formal tea " where the participants are not well acquainted . " The professor advised loosing this bombshell : " The camel is often called the ship of the desert . " It seemed to me that this sentence was the essence of japan : few Japanese had ever seen a camel and no one could care less what a camel was like than young ladies at tea , but the stubbornfact remained that the camel had sometimes been called the ship of the desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opening salvo as any other . I tried to explain to Hana-ogi how ridiculous the whole thing was but she went to great pains to explain , with gestures , how the camel strides over the sand and seems to be a rolling ship and how the beast can go for many days without water and how there are two kinds of camels , one with one hump and the other with two . I tried to stop this flood of information , but she grabbed me by the hand and ran me down the alley to Katsumi 's , where the two girls fairly exploded Japanese and Katsumi brought out her treasure chest and Hana-ogi ran through the magazines till she found one with her picture on the cover and on the inside were a half dozen pictures of her as a noble Arabian bandit in a desert extravaganza called The Silver Sheik . Then she commandedKatsumi to translate and Katsumi said , " But the camel really is called the ship of the desert . " I bit my lip andp133pointed to a picture of Hana-ogi in flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but Hana-ogi studied it and shook her head no . She pointed to another and said , " Very nice , " ( " Berry nice , " she called it ) and this one showed her in better profile.  |p134From  time to time during this long spring of the year I used to reconsider Mike Bailey 's question : Did I love Hana-ogi because I was afraid of American women ? At first the question had seemed ridiculous . True , I was afraid of the incessant domination of a mother-in-law like the general 's wife , but I was certainly not afraid of Eileen , except when she imitated her mother , and so far as I knew I had never been afraid of American women in general . In fact , I had always liked them very much and so far as I can remember there was never a dance at the Point or at any of the Air Force bases that I did n't attend  --  and almost always with my own date . I decided that American women did n't scare me . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again so sure . I had noticed that for some days Katsumi-san had been trying to speak with me alone and I guessed that she was hoping I might know some special way whereby she could get into the United States . Since I , could give her no help I tried to avoid discussing the doleful question , but finally she caught me and asked , " Major , you my friendo ichi ban ? " " Yes . " " Then maybe you buy me weekies ? " " What are weekies ? " " You go P.X. Pleeze , Ace , I not able to buy weekies. "  | " Why not ? " I demanded . " All wives get P.X. cards . " I remember that Katsumi held back , as if not wanting to report Joe 's troubles , but under my questioning she said , " Colonel Craford not give me pass . Not give any Japanese wife pass . He hate us . He hate Joe for marrying Japanese . " This made me sore , so I started out for the big avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the alley . " Katsumi , " I yelled , " what in hell are weekies ? " She slid back the paper doors and tried to explain but she was promptly overcome with embarrassment and said only , " Pleeze , Gruver-san . I want to be same like American girl . I want to make Joe takusan happy . " So I set out . At the P.X. two tall guards shrugged their shoulders when I asked what weekies were and I would have given up the job except that I was disgusted to have a gentle person like Katsumi pushed around . So I found one of those super-efficient Japanese officials who sit at desks and always seem to know everything . When I consulted him he frowned noticeably and said , " Fifth floor , frame four . " He spoke slowly , wrestling with each difficult letter so that his reply sounded : " Hihth hroor , hrame bore . " I took the elevator to the fifth floor and found to my uneasinessthat it contained women 's wear . On the whole floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their girls . But there were nearly a hundred American wives and when they saw me in this department they were unanimouslyoutraged . I was obviously another American man shacked up with some cheap Japanese girl and I had come here to buy her nylons or a dress or some other gift as part of my purchase price . I started to blush as stares of disgust followed me and mumbled to myself , " You 're out of your depth , squarehead . " But that was before I knew what weekies were . I stepped up to the stocking counter and a pert Japanese girlp136said briskly , " You are not allowed to buy nylons , Major , unless you have your wife 's card . " There were a half dozen officers ' wives at the counter and they smiled indulgently . I said quietly , " I did n't want nylons . I wondered if you could tell me where the weekies are . " The American women started to laugh outright and I was grateful when the Japanese clerk said , with exaggerated politeness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame containing silk underwear while the women behind me laughed again . It would have been simpler , I suppose , if I had cut my throat right then . Certainly the stares could n't have been any tougher or my confusion greater . But I walked as inconspicuouslyas I could to the lacy counter where , as if by prearrangement , the clerks waited on everybody else first . So as I stood there , trying to look at some indefinite spot on the wall but always hitting brassieres or girdles , I became aware of the conversation around me . It was intended for me to hear . The first officer 's wife said , " I suppose many of our men get trapped by these girls . " The second said , " I never see them fighting very hard to stay free . " The first replied , " I can understand enlisted men and Japanesegirls . Probably never knew any decent girls in America . " You could tell from the emphasis that unquestionably the speaker was decent . The second agreed , " But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uniform . " Fortunately a clerk appeared and I said , " I 'd like some weekies . " The American wives broke into laughter and the clerk said , in the sing - song professional voice used by Japanese girls , " Small , medium or large ? "  |p137I  gulped and asked , " What are weekies ? " This caused a real flurry of laughter in which the Japanese girl joined . She reached under the counter and produced an open cartoncontaining a bunch of pink nylon panties . Grabbing one she dangled it in the air and asked , " Small , medium or large ? " Now more women gathered about the counter and there was an outburst of uncontrolled hilarity . I figured that nothing else could happen so I said , " I 'll take that one . " At this there was hysterical laughter and the Japanese girl popped her hand over her mouth for a moment , then showed me the band of the panty she was holding . " Major , weekies are one for every day of the week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frantically I indicated the entire pile and said , " I 'll take them all . " But the clerk said , " These sample only . Small , medium or large ? " In despair I tried to think of how Katsumi looked . My mind was an aching blank and I pointed blindly at another Japanese clerk and said , " Her size , I guess . " Behind me one of the women whispered sweetly , " He does n't remember how big she is ! " I looked around me at the faces of my countrywomen . They were hard and angular . They were the faces of women driven by outside forces . They looked like my successful and unhappymother , or like powerful Mrs. Webster , or like the hurried , bereft faces you see on a city street anywhere in America at four-thirty any afternoon . They were efficient faces , faces well made up , faces showing determination , faces filled with a great unhappiness . They were the faces of women whose men had disappointed them . Possibly these harsh faces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sur/rounded each day with cruel evidence that many American men preferred the softer , more human face of some Japanese girl like Katsumi Kelly . As I paid the clerk I overheard the first officer 's wife say , " All little Jap girls who live with G.I. 's are crazy for anything that will make them seem more American . " The second turned to watch me go and added , " Including American men . " But as I left these tough , bitter women and walked through their circle of bleak and unforgiving faces I saw near the elevator an American girl who could have been Eileen Webster . She was beautiful and fresh and perfect and I almost cried aloud with pain to think that something had happened in American life to drive men like Mike Bailey and me away from such delectable girls.  |p139Since  I now knew that the secret of love is communication , I wish I could tell you exactly how Hana-ogi and I learned to talk in those exquisite days of early love , but I can not recall how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask Hana-ogi what her name meant . I was barefooted and wearing the cheap blue-and-white kimono so common in Japan . I sat with my back against the fragile wall , my feet awkwardly out upon the tatami . I tried to convey the idea : " What does Hana-ogi mean ? " but I did not succeed for the only two words she understood were what and her own name and she naturally suspected that I wanted to know what she wanted . So with tiny gestures and much pointing she indicatedour small house of great love and said that all she wanted was to be here with me , that she wanted to hear me splashing in the tub , that she wanted to cook our meals over the glowing fire and that when she slid the paper doors shut in the evening she wanted to lock us in and the world out . Quietly I sat against the wall and tucked my kimono tighterabout me , relishing the delicate thoughts she had expressedfor both of us . But then I tried again and this time she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yes , Rroyd-san . I tell . " It is here that I wish I could explain , but I ca n't . Knowingalmost nothing of my language this extraordinary girl never/theless told me the following story , while I scrunched against the wall , my knees against my chin . Some of the passages she danced , some of them she pantomimed , and some she spoke in such expressive Japanese that I could fairly guess their meaning . And this is the story she told me : Once upon a time in a small village near Tokyo there was a girl of great beauty . No one knows her name , but she was to become Hana-ogi , the most renowned prostitute in the entire history of Japan . As a child she lived with her widowed mother but it soon became apparent that her only possible future lay in the green houses of Yoshiwara , the ancient walled quarter by the marshes of Tokyo , where the unwanted young girls of farmer families were trained to become glowing and cultivated courtesans . The old mother sold Hana-ogi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years this girl , always more beautiful , waited on the established courtesans of Ogi-ya , the green house which she would later make the most famous in all Japan . While she still wore her obi tied behind with its long ends signifying that she was virgin , the older girls taught her the skills of their trade and on her fifteenth birthday Hana-ogi discarded forever her real name , tied her obi in front , and took her first customer . He was a young man from Odawara and he fell so desperatelyin love with Hana-ogi that he used to haunt the steps of Ogi-ya even when he had not the money to come inside . In perplexity he watched Hana-ogi become the most prized woman in Yoshiwara , and there were more than four thousand there at the time . She became famous for her poems , exquisite sighings of the heart and delicate memories of farm life when the early dew was on the rice fields . Priests in the temples sometimes told the worshippers of this saintly girl who took no thought of buying her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to her old mother . On holy days Hana-ogi went to a Buddhist temple that was known as the silent temple because it had no bell to record the great days and one evening Hana-ogi led a procession of thousands from the Yoshiwara bearing a bronze bell for this silent temple . It was her gift to the priests who were poorer than she . Her fame became so great that visitprs from China came to see this glory of Nihon . ( My Hana-ogi rarely called her countryJapan , never Nippon . ) Poets wrote famous songs about her . Men close to the Shogun came to talk with her , and above all the painters of the passing world , the wood-block artists who lived along the edge of the Yoshiwara , made many portraitsof her . Today , in the museum at Kyoto , you can see maybe three dozen famous paintings of Hana-ogi . When I see them , said my Hana-ogi , I think that this immortal woman is speaking to me across the years and I take courage . Now all the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-famous painters were with Hana-ogi , the young lover from Odawara was watching , too , and one spring as the cherry blossoms were about to bloom he abducted Hana-ogi from the green houses . Where they hid themselves , these two happy people , no one knows . Whether they had children of their love no one can say . The years passed and bad luck fell on the house of Ogi-ya . No more did the rich men and the painters come there and no more did the priests of the nearby temples receive gifts from Hana-ogi . The portraits of this unforgettable girl were sold in great quantity , for everyone wished some memento of the loveliest woman Japan had ever produced . Then one day there was a burst of glory . ( Here the real Hana-ogi , my living grace , assumed a kind of cathedral beauty as she simulated an incredible procession . ) Hana-ogi had come back to the green houses . She was thirty-four years old , morep142beautiful than she had ever been , more stately . Young girls walked before her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Two men held umbrellas over her head , and she was dressed in an exquisite blue kimono with rich flowing robes of purple and the geta upon her feet were eleven inches high . Within five days the greatest artists of japan had issued magnificent pictures of her joyous return , and we can see them still , the stately processions , the rare , wonderful woman coming back to her strange world . It was the golden age ! In those days there was singing and long talks and beautiful pictures and fine women and Nihon was never so joyous . And queen of the golden age was this country girl , Hana-ogi . She never explained her absence , she never told what had happened to her lover , but people guessed that like all Japanese men he had grown tired of her and had abused her . She lived at the Ogi-ya for many years and when she was too old to serve the visitors any longer she disappeared one day and no one ever again heard of Hana-ogi . My living Hana-ogi folded her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an ending to so powerful a story and I cried , jumping to my feet , " No ! No ! What happened to Hana-ogi ? " It took some time for me to explain myself and then my beautiful Japanese narrator stared up at me in surprise and said , " In Nihon many girls . Every time new girls in Ogi-ya . " I shouted that I knew that , but what had become of Hanaogi ? My adorable oval-face on the floor looked up in confusion and said , " Hana-ogi become old girl . " ( She pulled down the lines of her face and indicated that a tooth was missing . ) " She old , she go . " " But where ? Where did she go ? " My living Hana-ogi shrugged her shoulders . Then , sensingp143my disappointment , she formed the sign of a Buddhist temple and made believe to ring the bell which the ancient Hana-ogi had bought with her few coins and she indicated that no doubt this most glorious woman of Japanese history had been thrown out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had possibly taken a position near the steps of the temple to beg alms . There was an overwhelming ache upon my heart and I knelt upon the floor beside my Hana-ogi , who had fled her prison for her lover and whose future was as uncertain as her predecessor 's . There was an enormous bond of tenderness between us and that was the definable beginning of my determinationnever to surrender this rare woman , this tender and gracious miracle . The consequences of such a determination I did not then foresee , but they were explained to me in part by an event which occurred three nights later . Like any husband and wife we ultimately felt even our perfect home confining and we wanted to go to a movie , but this was no easy trick . Hana-ogi knew that I might be arrested if I appeared on the streets with her and I knew that she would get into serious trouble if she were seen with me , so she left our paper doors first and in five minutes I followed and we met inside the darkened theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having evaded the chaperones . But our luck did n't hold because this movie concerned the French Foreign Legion attacking a desert outpost and across the screen lumbered a long convoy of camels and Hana-ogi whispered , " Ships of the desert ! " and I fell to laughing so hard that finally she clapped her hand over my mouth and cried , " Rroyd-san . Somebody see us . She was right . People did stare and two women recognized Hana-ogi as the great star at Takarazuka , so that when thep144lights went up these women choked the aisle and begged an autograph and soon Hana-ogi was surrounded by young girls . We hurried out a side door and she fled alone down a back street and I ambled up the main street and when I got home I found her sitting dumb on the floor , her head bowed . She told me that she had always known that some time we would be found out and that she was not frightened . She would have to leave Takarazuka but she might find a job in pictures . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . She said , " I not scare . But Takarazuka I like very very much . " ( She said , " I rike berry berry much . " ) I suggested at once that perhaps she should leave me and return to Takarazuka dormitory and endanger no longer a brilliant career but she kept staring at the floor and said quietly words which meant this : " I always planned to act till I was past forty , for I shall grow old slowly , and when my days as an actress were over I intended to take the place of Teruko-san , who was the greatest dancer Takarazuka ever had and who now teaches us the classical steps . But when I came here , Rroyd-san , I knew the danger I ran and if tomorrow were yesterday I would come here again . " I think that 's what she intended to say and I was deeply troubled by the responsibility I had undertaken and by the resolve I had made never to desert her , but when she saw my silent fears she put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time only time I be in love . I not stop our love one day before . . . " She made a great explosion with her hands as if the world had fallen in . She embraced me and we fell back upon the bed roll and I undressed her and her slim yellow body shone in the moonlight like a strand of gold that had fallen across my pillow , and she started to whimper and said , " I not speak true . Oh , Rroyd-san , I afraid . I not want to leave Takarazuka . I not want to sit by temple  --  begging  --  old woman  --  teeth broken away . But if I go you now , I never find courage to come back . I never love nobody no more . Never , never . ( She pronounced it , " I nebber rub nobody , nebber , nebber . " ) I not want to be alone . I want to sleep here , with you . " Beside my head she placed her hard , tiny pillow stuffed with rice bran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as so many people must , that the ways of love are often terrifying when the day is done and one can no longer avoid studying the prospects of the future . But next day she gave me proof of the courage she said she did not have . We were eating cold fish and rice when our doors slid back and disclosed beautiful Fumiko-san . A curious change came over Hana-ogi and it seemed that she was no longer in our little house but back on the stage at Takarazuka and I appreciated how desperately a part of her that theater was . Fumiko had come , she said , to warn us . An Osaka newspapermanhad seen us at the movies and had informed the Supervisor , who had not reprimanded Hana-ogi that afternoon because he hoped she would come to her senses before he was forced to take official action . Fumiko-san implied that he had asked her to speak with the brilliant star who had so much to lose if she persisted in her indiscretion . Hana-ogi was deeply disturbed by this news and I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of mutual protection and that they had always stood together as a team against the difficulties and defeats of their profession . Earlier Fumiko had found an American who had imperiledher career by kissing her in public and Hana-ogi had protested . Now it was Fumiko 's turn to sound the warning . The two exquisite girls talked for a long time in Japanese and I judged they were assessing the various risks in the situation but Fumiko 's arguments did not prevail and she left withp146tears in her eyes . When she had closed the doors Hana-ogi said simply , " I stay . " I discussed with her the possible results of this choice , even at times coming close to arguing on Fumiko 's side , so that Hana-ogi stopped short , stood facing me , and demanded , " More better I go ? " When I cried no and kissed her , she closed the discussion by saying , " I stay . " There was a fineness about her mouth when she said this and I was surprised , for I had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was best in the Japanese woman : the patient accepter , the tender companion , the rich lover , but when Hana-ogi displayed her iron will I reflected that throughoutthe generations of Japanese women there had also been endlessly upon them this necessity to be firm , not to cry , not to show pain . They had to do a man 's work , they had to bear cruel privations , yet they remained the most feminine women in the world . Now that I knew them , these strange Japanese women , I saw the contradiction everywhere . Katsumi was having a baby when she had n't the slightest idea how it would be cared for or under what flag , yet it was she who bolstered up the spirits of her family . Hana-ogi had placed her career in jeopardy for a few months in a tiny house along a canal with a man who could never marry her . The young girls I saw with their American soldiers , the little women bent double carrying bricks and mortar to the ninth story of a new building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , and the young wives with three children , one at breast , one strapped on the back , one toddling at her heels . I concluded that no man could comprehend women until he had known the women of Japan with their unbelievable combination of unremitting work , endless suffering and boundless warmth  --  just as I could never have known even the outlines of love had I not lived in a little house where I sometimes drew back thep147covers of my bed upon the floor to see there the slim golden body of the perpetual woman . I now understood why ten thousand American soldiers had braved the fury of their commandersand their country to marry such women . I understood why there were supposed to be many thousands of AmericanJapanesebabies in the islands . I understood why perhaps a half million American men had wandered down the narrow alleys to find the little houses and the great love.  |p148On  this night I could not sleep . I was agitated by Hana-ogi 's problem although as events turned out , I should have been concerned about my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman whose mere presence beside me in the dark night made me both complete and courageous . Toward four in the morning I hammered my pillow in confusion and Hana-ogi wakened and felt my forehead and said , " Rroyd-san , you sick ! " And she leaped up from our bed and tended me as if I were a child and I had n't the fortitude to tell her that I was in a trembling fever because her picture of an old woman huddling beside a Buddhist temple had made me nightmarish . She cooled my head and wrapped dry sheets about us and I went to sleep assured that somehow we would escape from the inevitable consequences of our acts . But when I woke I was shivering again , not from fever but from outrage . For Lt.Col . Calhoun Craford , a paunchy red-faced man who hated every human being in the world except certain Methodists from his corner of a hill county in Georgia , stood over our bed . His round florid face looked like a decaying pumpkin as he stared down at us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' mighty fine down there , Major . " He kicked at the bed roll and Hana-ogi drew a sheet about her neck . Then Lt.Col . Craford got purple in the face and shouted , " You get to hell up here , Majorp149Gruver . The Giniral 's gon na hear about this . " He muscled his way about our tiny room , knocking things over , and I leaped from bed , but before I could do anything he threw my pants in my face and grunted , " Fine spectacle you are . A giniral 's son , shackin ' up with a nigger . " With an almost premonitory sense I recalled Joe Kelly 's violent threat one night when he had come home beat : " Some day I 'll kill that fat bastard . " I felt that if Lt.Col . Craford said one more thing in that room I 'd beat Kelly to the job . I think the colonel sensed this , for he looked contemptuously at Hanaogihuddled beneath the sheet and stalked through the paper doors . They trembled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to General Webster 's office in Kobe the old man minced no words . " What in hell does this mean , Lloyd ! " He was much more profane than I can repeat and he had all the details . " A fine , clean , upstanding man like you ! The son of a general in the United States Army . Shacking up with some cheap ... " I stood there and took it . He never mentioned Eileen , but it was obvious that he was bawling me out on her behalf . She had been held up to public ridicule . His wife had been made to look silly . And I had outraged the military decencies . He shouted , " Did you sign that paper we sent you acknowledgingmy order about public displays of affection with indigenouspersonnel ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then you know what 's in the order ? " " Yes , sir . " " But you defied the order ? " " No , sir . " He exploded . " What in hell do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been guilty of public affection with a Japanese girl . "  |p150Lt.Col  . Craford stepped forward and said , " One of my men saw them in the movies the other night . He followed them along the back streets . They were holding hands , " he added contemptuously . " You 're a liar ! " I shouted . General Webster rapped on the desk . " You be still , Gruver . This is serious business . Now Craford , what actually hap-pened ? " The repugnant colonel coughed , pointed at me with disgust and said , " He flagrantly broke the order , Giniral . Made love on the streets with a Jap girl . Set up housekeepin ' with her . We 've checked her record . A cheap whore . " " You . . . " I sprang from my position at attention and rushed at Craford . General Webster astonished me by reachingout and shoving me back . " So you say you were n't seen with her ? " " That 's what I do say , General Webster , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low voice , " What do you call living together ? Do n't you call flagrant cohabitation a public display of affection ? " " No , sir , " I said . " Not in terms of your order . We were never seen on the streets . " The general lost his composure and said harshly , " I 'm goingto court-martial you , young man . You 've broken every law of decency . You 're under house arrest . Understand what that means ? " " Yes , sir . " " Watch him , Craford . If he does anything , throw him in the stockade . " " I will , sir , " Craford wheezed . " Furthermore , " the general said , " I 've cabled your father . " I gulped and he saw that that one had hurt , so I recovered by saying , " All right , sir , but I wish you hadn't. "  | " I wish you had n't made an ass of yourself . Craford , take him under guard to his quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I was the son of a four-star general , and he made quite a flourish of depositing me in my informal prison . He marched me into the lobby of the Marine Barracks , up the short flight of steps leading to the elevators , and down the hall past all the open doors . " This is it , nigger-lover , " he growled . As soon as he was gone I called the motor pool to see if I could get hold of Joe Kelly . After the fifth call I made contact and he whispered , " Ca n't talk , Ace , I 'll be over . " He arrived around noon that morning and slumped into a chair , " Jeez , Ace , the fat 's in the fire . " " What happened ? " " Old Blubber-gut sent a bunch of strong-arm boys to search your house . They photographed everything . I hope you did n't have any Air Force papers you should n't have . Anyway , they wrecked the joint and boarded it up for good . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she slipped out right after you were arrested . Katsumi watched Blubber-gut 's men tear up the house . Then she hurried out to Takarazuka with the news but Hanaoginever batted an eye . " " How can people take things so calmly ? " I cried . " You learn , " Joe explained . " When you 're a Japanese woman or an enlisted man , you learn . " It was that evening that my real torment began , for when the performance of Swing Butterfly ended I looked down from my prison and saw graceful Hana-ogi , moving like a goddess down the flower walk and across the Bitchi-bashi and through the vegetable stalls and onto the path that led to the dormitory and long after she had disappeared I could see the image of that slim and graceful girl disappearing into the shadows  --  andp152I became more determined than ever that I must not lose her . On the third evening after my house arrest began , I was sitting before the dismal meal of Marine food brought to my room by the waiter , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a detective , then motioned down the hall . In men 's clothes , looking like a would-be janitor , Hana-ogi slipped in to see me . Mike made a hasty sign of benediction and tiptoed out . I can not describe how joyous it was to see Hana-ogi in my room . Not only had I been tortured by my longing to have her beside me in the bed roll but  --  as I realized now  --  I was even more hungry to hear her soft voice chattering of the day 's events and I believe my heart actually grew bigger as she told me of the little things : " Fumiko-san say I crazy . When Colonel Craford smash house two kimonos rost . " " What do you mean , rost ? " " Men take . I no find . " I became so incensed over the lost kimonos that I realized that I had reached a new meaning of the word love . I was engaged in a heavenly contest with Hana-ogi to see which of us could give most to the other and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and frightening in its implications . I was already thinking vaguely about the future and a perplexing problem popped out as a blunt question : " Hana-ogi , how old are you ? " She counted thirty on her fingers and I felt as if a basket of icicles had been dumped over me , for a woman of thirty and a man twenty-eight seemed abnormal . I had known several officers married to women older than they and it always turned out badly . I was suddenly glum till I remembered that a Japanesegirl is considered to be one year old at birth so we figured it out that Hana-ogi was really only twenty-nine and that furthermore during eight months of each year we would bep153the same age . It was extraordinary how much more beautiful she seemed at twenty-nine than she had been at thirty . Toward morning she dressed and left my room , asking , " You have dinner tonight  --  Makino 's ? " I explained what house arrest meant and said that I had pledged my honor as an officer . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have pledge the honor of my mother and the food of my two sisters . " Then she kissed me and left . So that night I put my honor way down in the bottom drawer among my socks and crept through the alleys to Makino 's and as I climbed the stairs to the little room where I had first seen Hana-ogi my heart beat like the throbbing of an airplane engine and I thought , " God , that I should have become so involved , " but when I got there Hana-ogi in green skirt and brown blouse was waiting for me . Old Makino made us tempura and to my surprise I found I was getting to enjoy Japanese food . We talked of many things and Hana-ogi saidthat soon Swing Butterfly ( she always called it buttfry ) would close in Takarazuka . Maybe it would go to Tokyo . The news was terrifying and I had n't the courage to discuss what it might mean to us but she said , " I no go Tokyo . I stay here and wait for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up Takarazuka and I said , " Hana-ogi , you ca n't . " Before she could reply Makino came running in and cried , " M.P . ' s ! " Ashamed of myself I crowded into a cupboard and heard the heavy tread of Lt.Col . Craford 's polished boots and in that moment I understood what an ugly thing fear was and why we had fought the last war against the Germans : we were fighting the tread of heavy boots . And then like the wind on a stormy day I completely changed and felt disgusted with myself , an Air Force officer breaking my word , hiding in a closet with a Japanese girl who should have hated me . It wasp154the low spot of my life and when Lt.Col . Craford stamped down the stairs I stepped out of the closet and said , " Hana-ogi , I 've got to go back . " She looked at me closely and asked , " When M.P . come . . . " She pointed at the closet and asked , " You sorry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did bring a blush to her cheeks and she did act out my shame . " Yes , " I said . " I gave my word . " But as I turned to go a flood of terrible longing overtook me and I grasped her face in my hands and cried , " Do n't go to Tokyo , Hana-ogi . Wait here . I can not let you go . " Her slim , straight body grew limp and she whispered to me in Japanese , something which meant , " Not Takarazuka or my mother could take me away . " I kissed her hands as I had done that first night . There were a hundred things I wanted to say , but I was choked with confusion . I walked boldly down the stairs , marched openly along the street to the Marine Barracks . Hana-ogi , aware of the deep shame I had felt in the closet and sharing it with me , marched just as brazenly beside me in her distinctive Takarazuka costumeand kissed me good-bye at the barracks . " Rroyd-san @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takusan much . "  |p155When  I entered the barracks , my father and General Webster were waiting . My father looked down the street at Hana-ogi walking bravely back to the dormitory and said , " Pretty girl . Almost pretty enough to justify an officer 's breaking his word . " General Webster started to bluster but Father cut him short . He took us into the manager 's office and let me have it . My father is no puling one-star general ordered about by his wife . He said , " You idiot . You poor , bewildered idiot . " I have never heard my father swear . He chews gum when he 's mad and makes the muscles in his jaw stand out and right now he looked as if he could beat me up . I stood at attention and looked straight ahead . " What are you gon na do ? " he asked contemptuously . " Dishonoryour uniform , humiliate your friends ? " He walked around me then snorted . " Some officer ! " General Webster said , " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be court-martialed . " Father cut in and asked , " Well , what are you gon na do ? " I said firmly , " As soon as I get out of here I 'm finding anotherhouse . " General Webster gasped and Father stormed . " That youp156wo n't do ! There 's a night plane to Korea . Get on it . I had some orders cut . Take them and get out . " I said , " All right , and when I come back it 'll be to Hanaogi . The effect of this strange name on my father was startling . Apparently he was unable to accept the fact that Japanese girls actually had names and that American officers might love those alien names and the curious creatures to whom they belonged . He shouted , " Ruin yourself over some common whore ! " I had taken a lot these last few days and I 'd had enough . I hauled back my right fist and let my father have one below the left ear . He staggered back , got his footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were all trembling and furious but Webster spoke first : " By God , you 've struck " Get out of here , Webster , " my father snapped . " I 'll handle this . " Frightened and dismayed , General Webster retreated and while we watched him go , I had a moment to steel myself for the brawl I knew must follow . Four times in my father 's career he had dragged colleagues into a boxing ring where in the anonymity of shorts he had massacred them . Before our fight began I thought in a flash of how strange it was that I had belted my father for saying far less than what Lt.Col . Craford had said and I experienced a dizzy sensation that when he turned back to face me I would see my enemy and my friend . I shook the dizziness away and cocked my fists , but when he turned he was grinning and chomping his gum . " I take it she 's not a prostitute , " he laughed . I started to say , " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and pulled me into a chair beside him and asked , " Son , what 's this all about ? " Again I started to explain but he said , " I flew out here fromp157the Presidio to knock some sense into you . But you 're not in the market for sense , are you ? " I said , " I do n't want any lectures . " He laughed and chewed his gum and said , " Son , I would n't respect you if you had n't swung on me . She seemed right pretty and you say she is n't a tramp ? " I told him who she was and he said , " By heavens , Mark Webster must have dropped his drawers when he heard about you having a house . He drove me in to see it . Say , they do n't build very big houses in Japan , do they ? Say , tell me how you promoted a house ? " I started to tell him about Katsumi and Joe but he said , " Lord knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good family , staunch military background . Mother 's a bit of a bore but in service you can always get away from her . Say , have you heard the news that really galls Webster ? His daughter'sserious about a real-estate salesman from Seattle . Major , I think . Webster 's furious and is rotating the fellow back to the States . " He sized me up carefully , chewing his gum , and said , " Y'know , son , if you still wanted Eileen you could have her . Wait a minute ! Do n't underestimate that kind of marriage . Right now you 're all boiled up about sex , but a man lives a long life after that fire goes down . Then you appreciate having a woman you can talk to , some one who knows military life . What do you and Madame Butterfly talk about ? " He waited for me to speak but as soon as I started he said , " Let 's get back to Eileen . You ever know any officers married to women who disliked the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't been what you might call romantic lovers . . . " He slapped his leg and burst into real laughter . " Could you imagine your mother in a shack along a canal ! Butp158anyway we 've always been able to talk . We want the same things . We want the same things for you , Lloyd . " He paused and I thought I was back in St. Leonard 's on anotheroccasion like this . My father was saying , " Your mother and I want the same things for you , Lloyd , " but even then I knew for a certainty that Mother had never wanted those things for me and I had the strange feeling that if she were in Japan right now  --  if she knew the whole story  --  she would be on my side and not Father 's . He said , " I suppose you 've figured what your present course would mean to things like life plans . " " What do you mean , present course ? " " Well , getting married to a Japanese girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He chewed his gum real fast and then said , " You mean you have n't thought about marriage ? You mean you think you 're the smartest guy on earth . Can shack up with a girl , have children even , and never think of marriage . " " I was n't thinking of marriage , " I said weakly . " I know you were n't , " he roared . From the other room GeneralWebster stuck his head through the door and asked nervously , " Everything all right ? " " Get out of here , " my father commanded , and I thought how rarely men like him could respect men like Webster or men like the one I seemed on the verge of becoming . " Squaw man , " the Army would have called me in the old days . He walked up and down the room flexing his head muscles and then turned sharply , speaking in machine-gunlike tones . " Do n't you see what 's gon na happen , son ? You 're gon na work yourself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . So suddenly you hit on marriage ! You 'll marry the girl and that 'll make everything just dandy . Good God , son ! You 're twenty/eight years old . Why did n't you marry Eileen that summer in San Antonio ? " Softly , with the mention of Eileen 's name , that first dreamy summer flooded back to me here in Kobe and I said , " I never really understood , Father . I guess it must have been that bachelorparty . " " What party ? " he asked suspiciously . " What'ja do ? " " Not what you mean . Remember when General Hayward 's son was marrying Della Crane ? " You mean Harry Crane 's girl ? " " Yes . Her father had been killed at the Bulge . . . . " " Damned brave man . We could use a few men like Harry Crane in Korea . " " So Mark Webster 's wife was more or less arranging the wedding . Very formal . But the night before a gang of us younger officers took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutes late for the wedding . Everybody thought it was very funny except Mrs. Webster . After the wedding she gave us a terrible tongue-lashing . It was n't that we 'd spoiled Della and Charley 's wedding . It was that we 'd spoiled her plans . I 've always been afraid of Eileen since then . " " Afraid ? " " Well , sort of . After the ceremony the four of us who had gotten Harry drunk drove out to Randolph Field . Nobody said anything and we drove very fast and once when a Ford truck almost socked us one of the men said , That would be the secondtruck that mowed us down today , ' and we all laughed and got drunk again and for the rest of that summer I never really seriously thought about marrying Eileen . Then Korea came along . " But you have thought about marrying Madame Butterfly ? " " No , " I said . " A son does n't bust his father , Lloyd , unless he 's thinkingp160pretty deeply about something . Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm on the selection board and your name comes up . I 'd pass you by and if I was n't on the board I 'd advise the others to pass you by . We do n't want officers with yellow wives . And where would you live in America ? None of our friends will want you hanging around with a yellow wife . What about your children ? Y'ca n't send half-Jap boys to the Point . " I thought it was very like my father to assume that all his grandchildren would be boys who would naturally attend the Point . I was going to say something about this , but he kept talking . " Son , Mark Webster was blustering . I 've talked him into forgetting your court-martial . When I was sore I asked him to cut orders sending you back to Korea . Even yet it 's a great temptation for me to approve those orders and tell you to get back there and fight this thing out . But you 've had Korea . Say , how are those Russian jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Y'think that Russian pilots man those planes ? " I said I thought so but we had n't captured any . " Those Russians are bastards , " he said . " Real bastards . " I said , " We 've been able to handle them so far . " He banged the chair and said , " Son , do n't take sex too seri-ously . " I said , " What should you take seriously ? " He said , " A whole life . " He chewed his gum furiously and said , " A whole , well-rounded life . " I said , " Promotions and place in society and things like that ? " He looked at me quizzically and said , " You pulling my leg , son ? " I said , " Like the way you married a general 's daughter ? " He said very calmly , " I ought to clout you . I just do n't un/derstand you sometimes . In ten years you 'll be fighting the Japs again . " " Maybe . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer get mixed up with a Japanese girl and take it seriously ? " I said , " Look , Pop . This gag worked once . This man-toman . He looked half amused and asked , " What do you mean ? " I said , " Remember St. Leonard 's when I thought I wantedto skip the Point and study English or something like that ? " " Long time ago , I 'd forgotten . " " No you did n't , Pop . All the way out here from the Presidio you tried to remember what trick it was that convinced me then to do what you wanted me to do . " He blustered a moment and said , " Son , let 's not obscure the facts . I 'm here because you 're my son and I 'm very proud of you . Believe it or not I 'm even proud that you had the guts to ignore Mark Webster 's stupid order and find yourself a house in Osaka . But I do n't want to see a decent American kid like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our men marry German girls and French girls and even Russian girls . Invariably , if you know the man , it 's a sign of weakness . They 're all pantywaists . Strong men have the guts to marry the girls who grew up next door . Such marriages fit into the community . They make the nation strong . In your case and mine such marriages fit into military service . Leave it to the poets and painters and people who turn their back on America because they 're afraid of it to go chasing after foreign girls . " He chomped his gum and said , much more slowly , " I ever tell you about Charley Scales ? Resigned his commission and joined General Motors . Said he 'd make a lot of money and he did . Some years later he came to proposition me about joining him . Lloyd , that was in 1933 when the Army was the garbagep162can of democracy but I did n't even think twice . I 've been tempted in my life but never by Charley Scales . Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 'd you rather be , Charley Scales or me ? " It was a childish trick but it had a great effect on me . In my mind 's eye I could see Charley Scales , a big , happy man of some distinction in Detroit and the world . But to compare him with my father was ridiculous . Father said , " You talk this over with your Madame Butterfly . You 'll find she agrees with me . " I said , " I will . " He said , " By the way , where 'd she learn English ? " I said she did n't speak English and he cried , " You mean you 've learned Japanese ? " I said , " No . " He stopped chewing his gum and looked at me . " You mean  --  you have no common language ? French , maybe ? " I said , " Well , you see ... " " You mean you ca n't talk together ? " " Well , on a really intricate problem she . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , but I felt that Father would n't understand . But he surprised me . When he realized that we shared no language he became unusually gentle . I can not recall his ever having been quite as he was at that moment . He put his arm about my shoulder and said reassuringly , " Son , you 'll work this thing out . " He called for General Webster and said gruffly , " Mark , I was wrong . I 'm tearing up these orders for Korea . This kid does n't need Korea . His problem is right here . " General Webster said , " That 's what I told him and look now . . . " " Mark , do n't blow your top at this kid . "  | " Why not ? Disobeying an order , breaking his word , striking a superior . . . " Father laughed and said , " Now you and I know , Mark , that it was completely silly to issue such an order to a bunch of healthy young men surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get sore at Lloyd . " " Why not ? " " Because he 's going to be your son-in-law . " " He 's what ? " " He does n't know it yet , and Eileen does n't know it yet but if you want to do something constructive , keep real-estate salesmenaway from your daughter . Because sooner or later she 's going to be my daughter , too . " The two generals stamped out of the barracks and in three hours my father was on his way back to the Presidio.  |p164If  Father thought that the tricks which had defeated me in prep school would still work he was misled , for now I knew my mind . I had met a delectable woman , one whom I could love forever , and I simply was n't worried about fathers and generals and Air Force rules . Here on this earth I had found Hana-ogi and by the time my father arrived back in California she and I had things worked out . We made a deal with Joe and Katsumi whereby we took one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as warm and loving as two human beings have ever known . I would come home from the airfield to find Joe and Katsumipreparing the evening meal . They would tell me what had happened that day and I would exchange military gossip with Joe , but it would be a nervous time , for I would be watching the door and finally we would hear Hana-ogi 's soft steps coming up the alley and Katsumi and Joe would slip away for a moment to gather wood or buy things at the store . The door would open and there would be Hana-ogi , a glimmer of perspiration on her soft golden cheeks . Like all Japanese she carried her books and bundles wrapped in a bright silk shawl tied cross cornered , and when I think of her at the sliding door of that little house I see her kick off her saddle shoes , drop the silken bundle , run her hand through her hair and hurryp165across the tatami to kiss me . At such times I would catch her in my arms , swing her into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the room . There she would swiftly slip off her Western clothes and slowly fold herself into a brocaded kimono . She was lovely ; beyond words she was lovely . But I must not imply that the warmth and wonder of that house came solely from Hana-ogi , beautiful and complete as she was , for I think that I have never seen a more satisfactory wife than Katsumi Kelly . She organized her house to perfectionand kept it immaculate , even though Hana-ogi and I were apt to be careless . She could cook , she could sew , she could talk on many subjects and as her pregnancy advanced she gave promise of being an even finer mother than she was a wife . Sometimes I used to watch her and I recalled with embarrassmentthat once in the consul 's office I had almost refused to kiss her because she seemed so clodden and repugnant with her giggling and her big gold tooth . Now she seemed to me one of the most perfect women I had ever known , for she had obviously studied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work so that the end result would be a happy husbandand a peaceful home . I asked Joe about this once and he said , " Ten years from now in America there 'll be a club . Us fellows who married Japanese girls . Our password will be a suppressed giggle . Because we wo n't want them other lugs down the street to discover what gold mines we got . " I asked , " Are all Japanese wives as good as Katsumi ? " He said , " I admit I got somethin ' special . But you do n't hear the other boys kickin ' . " We wrapped our kimonos around our legs and sat back to enjoy one of the sweetest moments of the day . The girls were preparing supper and we listened to them talking Japanese . Katsumi spoke rapidly  --  the day 's gossip , no , doubt  --  and Hana-ogi , washing our rice , said over and over atp166least two dozen times , " Hai ! Hai ! " The phrase always shot out of her mouth with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of her stomach , a cry of primeval terror . Actually it was merely the Japanese way of saying yes . But in addition to this machine-gun hai she kept nodding her head and chanting mournfully , " Ah , so desu-ka ! Ah , so desu-ka ! " To hear the girls in any trivial conversation would convince you that some sublime tragedy had overtaken us all . Joe finally asked , " What are you sayin ' ? " Katsumi looked up startled and explained , " I speak Hanakosanabout a fish my father catch one day . " I started to laugh but Joe asked quietly , " Was it a big fish ? " " More big than this one , " Katsumi said proudly . " Hanakosansay she never see such a fish . " I liked Katsumi 's name for Hana-ogi . Japanese girls often take their names from feminine or poetic words to which they generally add - ko or - yo . Thus at Takarazuka most girls had names like " Misty Snow " or " Spring Blossom " or " Starry Night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , I preferred the other form , Hanayo , and once Hana-ogi told me , " Hanako more Japanese but Hanayo more sweet . The longer I lived with Joe Kelly , reared in an orphanage and rejected by his foster parents , the more astonished I was that he could adjust so perfectly to married life . He was a consideratehusband , a happy clown around the house and the kind of relaxed and happy family man you see in the advertisementsof the Saturday Evening Post . Speaking of the Post , it helped me understand a little better what married life is . On May 30th the girls were all whispers and at dinner they sprang the big surprise ! It was an American holiday , so they had pumpkin pie . Where they had finagled the pumpkin we never knew , but the pie was something out of this world , for they had used the pumpkin as you wouldp167apples or cherries and had baked it just as it came out of the can and it was really dreadful . I took one look at it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Joe cut me short and tasted his piece . " It 's good , " he said laconically . The girls bit into their pieces and you could see them sort of look at each other as if to say , " Americans must be crazy . To eat something like this on holidays . " We finished the disgustingdessert in silence and four days later Katsumi , leafing through an old copy of the Post saw a picture of real pumpkin pie . She waited till I got home and surreptitiously asked me if that was pumpkin pie . I said yes and she asked me how it stayed so thick and so soft and I told her how you made pumpkincustard and she started to cry and when Joe came home she hugged him and kissed him and told him how ashamed she was and since Hana-ogi was n't home yet I sat glumly in my corner and thought about the time I had laughed at Hana-ogi for her sentence , " Lo , the postillion has been struck by lightning , " and I concluded that Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orphanage could understand a problemlike that while I had n't had the slightest glimmer . However , I must not imply that all Japanese women are perfect wives . A trip along our alley would convince anyone that Japanese homes contained every problem to be found in American homes ; plus some very special ones . In the narrow house next us lived the Shibatas . He was a minor business officialwho received practically no pay but had an enviable expenseaccount from which he drew on most nights of the week for expensive geisha parties . He siphoned off part of the expenseaccount to support one of the pretty young geishas on the side . It was rumored that he kept her in a second home near the center of Osaka and traditionally his wife should have accepted such an arrangement with philosophical indifference , but Mrs. Shibata was not traditional . She was modern andp168tried to stab her husband with a knife . At three in the morning when black-coated little Shibata-san came creeping home we could catch a moment of silence as the door to his house opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chase him with a club . She was notoriously shrewish , and Katsumi and Hana-ogi apologized for her . " Japanese wife expected to understand men like geisha , " they said . Nor were most Japanese wives the patient silent creatures I had been told . When Sato-san , a railroad employee , took his wife shopping she trailed a respectful three feet behind and never spoke a word unless spoken to by her immediate friends . But at home she was a tyrant and rebuked Sato-san contemptuouslyfor not earning more money . As I came to know the wives of Japan I had to conclude that they were exactly like the wives of America : some were gentle mothers , some were curtain dictators and some few were lucky charms who brought their men one good thing after another . I decided that which kind a man found for himself was pretty much a matter of chance , but whenever I looked at Hana-ogi I had an increasinglysure feeling that I had stumbled upon one of the real lucky charms . Across the alley lived the widow Fukada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being married . Sometimes at night we could hear the grandmotherscreaming at Masako that she was a slut , and other women in the alley agreed . The American baby was not wanted and was not allowed to play with pure Japanese babies , and although everyone in the alley loved Joe Kelly and Katsumiand although they were proud to have a great Takarazuka actress living among them with her American flier , there was deep resentment against Masako Fukada , who had disgraced the blood of Japan.  |p169Down  the alley were the hilarious Watanabes . His wife was almost as broad as he was tall . They got along together fine exceptthat Watanabe-san had a mistress even more compelling than a geisha : he was mad-crazy to play pachinko . He spent all his money at pachinko and all his spare hours at the pachinko parlor . When the police closed the parlor each night at eleven he would reluctantly come home and we would hear fat Mrs. Watanabe shouting derisively , " Here comes Pachinkosan ! Dead broke ! " The pachinko parlor stood on the corner nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinball games . For a few yen Watanabe-san would be handed seven steel balls , which he would shoot up to the top of the pinball machine and watch agonizingly as they fell down to the bottom , almost always missing the holes which paid the big prizes . The pachinko parlor on our alley was filled from morning till night and everyone was bitten by the pachinko bug , including Hanaogiand me , and it was a curious fact that my friendship with the pachinko players in that crowded parlor would later save my life . Across the alley from the pachinko room was the flower shop . You would have thought there could not be in that entire alley one rusty yen for flowers , but almost everyone who lived along our narrow gutters stopped into the flower shop for some solitary spray of blooms which was carried reverently home for the alcove where the gods lived . I can not recall a moment when there were not flowers in our alcove and I  --  who had never known a violet from a daisy  --  came to love them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it is impossible because in all the rest of the world there are no shops quite like these in Japan . It was a sex shop where husbands and wives could purchase tricky devices with which to overcome nature'sp170mistakes and short changings . To satisfy our curiosity Katsumisantook Joe and me there one day . The shy owner listened as we laughed at his amazing collection of sex machines . Then he said in Japanese , " Go ahead , laugh . Young Japanese men laugh , too . But when they 're married and reach forty they come to me for help . " Katsumi translated and then broke into an uncontrolled giggle . I asked her what she had said and she explained , " I tell him Joe no need help . " The shy owner smiled nervously and replied , " At twenty nobody needs help . " But the true wonders of our alley were the children . I could neither count them nor forget them . They had round faces , very red cheeks , straight black bangs , fat little legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese child cry . CertainlyI never saw one struck and I came to believe that the most delectable children I had ever seen were these noisy , hilarious children . Whenever they crowded around me as I came up the alley I loved Hana-ogi more . Each house in our alley was desperately packed , so that one tiny room often became the equivalent of a full-sized American home and these teeming masses of people lived and worked and had babies and argued politics just like all people across the world . But there was this difference . Not a shred of anythingwas wasted , not even the human manure which was so patiently gathered each morning and from which sprang the flowers and the food . I recall certain evenings that spring when I entered this narrow alley at close of day and the front of every house would be open and dozens of children would run , black-bobbed , to greet me and from every open room facing the alley the people of Japan would speak with me and I shared a warmth and goodness that I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was one of the people  --  one of the millions of people who cling to what/ever shred of hope and property they can grab hold of , and from this alley with the myriad children and the brawling and the flowers and the unwanted American-Japanese baby and the pachinko games and the sake drinking I borrowed a strength I had never had before.  |p172It  expressed itself in an unforeseen way . I was in my office at Itami Air Base when a sergeant appeared to tell me that Lt.Col . Calhoun Craford was outside . The florid colonel stepped in and got right down to business . " You think you 're smart " ( he said it : Yawll thank yore smaht ) " gettin ' a four-star giniral to come out and save your neck . You accustomed to hidin ' behind your pappy 's back ? " Then he let me have it . " My men been trailin ' you , Gruver . We know you and that tramp are holed up in enlisted man 's quarters . But we ca n't touch you because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . We 're sendin ' Joe Kelly back to the States . " " But what 'll happen to Katsumi ? " The fat colonel looked at me with disgust . " Who 's Kats-what's-his-name ? " " Kelly 's wife . " " The Jap girl . Not up to us to worry what happens to her . " " You 're not breaking up this family ? " " Do n't call it a family . The girl 's a cheap Jap tramp . " I said that Katsumi was a decent girl , that she was studying to become a Catholic , like her husband , but apparently Lt.Col . Craford hated Catholics worse than he hated colored people , for he said , " And when we finish with Kelly we 'll figure out some way to handle you . Father or no father . "  |p173He  left me and I sat for a long time staring at my desk , contemplatingthe mess I had made of things . I had proved myself a shoddy officer . I had loused up the life of an enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't done much betterwith Hana-ogi . Then I began to weigh what I had accomplishedin Japan and things looked brighter . I had come to know what a home meant , an unpretentious home where love was . I had found a beautiful girl filled with tenderness and grace and wit . I had learned at last to share my heart with anotherhuman being . And most of all I had discovered the tremendouspassion of turning down the bed roll at night and seeing the slim , perfect body of Hana-ogi . I jumped up and cried , " Gruver-san , if you lose that girl you 're nuts . Marry her , stupid . Marry her . ' ' jBut as soon as I had said the words I began to sweat and I remembered all the predictions my father had made that night in the Marine Barracks . My career gone , my wings and their promise lost , my place in my American world vanished and I with an Asiatic wife . It was then that my new-found courage asserted itself . I recognized the trick my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous seeds so that they could flourish at just such a moment , and I decided that it was against such tricks that I was revolting . I did not want to become a general like my father , with his cold cut-offness from the world . I did n't want to be a second General Webster , ruled by Eileen . And I certainly did n't ever want to become a Lt.Col . Craford . I wanted to be one man , standing by myself , sharing whatever world I could make with the woman who had helped me to discover that world . In my moment of resolution and light I knew that I would never waver from my purpose . I was going to marry Hana-ogi . I called Joe Kelly and asked him to meet me at a tiny barp174we knew in Osaka where M.P . ' s never came . It 's impossible to describe such Japanese bars to Americans . How can you explaina bar so small that it has space for only four customers and two hostesses ? " Joe , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure , Ace . " " I mean two secrets . Big ones ? " " Hanako havin ' a baby ? " " Joe , Blubber-gut is laying for you . He 's going to ship you home first chance he gets . " " That 's no secret . He threatened me openly two days ago . I did n't tell anybody . Did n't want to worry you . But he shouted , All you nigger-lovers are goin ' home . Soon . ' " " Joe , I want you to promise me you wo n't do anything stupid . " " Me ? I should be stupid like him ? " " Look . One night I heard you tell Katsumi you were going to shoot Blubber-gut . " " Me ? I 'm no rod man . What 's your other secret ? " I ordered another beer and took a big gulp . " Exactly what papers do you have to sign to marry a Japanese girl ? " Joe whistled and said , " Look , Ace . This ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! It ai n't for you . " " Joe , do n't jump to conclusions . I have n't told her yet . But so help me God , I 'm going to marry that girl . What are the steps ? " He repeated his earlier warning and I asked , " You mean you 're sorry you married Katsumi ? " A big grin broke on Joe 's face and he said , " One night I told you that bein ' married to that Buddha-head was livin ' . It ai n't . It 's somethin ' much finer than livin ' . It 's like you was dead and all the stress and strain was over and all that was left was the very best  --  and it 's the best because it 's all wrapped upp175in her . It ai n't livin ' , Ace . I used to live in Chicago . This is way beyond that . " I sat with my hands over my face and did n't look up for a moment . Then I said , " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Ace , I do n't believe you could take the bad time they give you . " " What do you mean ? " " They wear you down . Enlisted men get used to bein ' worn down but you ai n't had the experience of diggin ' your heels in real stubborn and resistin ' . " " How do you mean ? " " They give you so many papers . The chaplain prays over you . And everything they do they do with crazy smiles , like you was off your rocker and only they could save you . And what 's worse , they ask the girl so many heart-burnin ' questions . Hana-ogi wo n't tell you but some night when you kiss her she 'll break down and cry for an hour . I do n't think you could take it . " I said , " Tomorrow morning I 'm starting the paper work . " He said , " Ace , you 're a big man . It would make them look silly to lose you to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . " " I 'm ready . " " Ace , they 'll hit you with generals and admirals and men who knew your father . The only way you can swing it is to get the help of your Congressman . Who is he ? " " I do n't know . " " Where do you live ? " " I do n't have . . . " " Well , where do you vote ? " " I 've never voted . " For the first time I realized that I was completely a military man . The Air Force was my home . I cast my vote with the talking end of an F-86.  |p176Joe  studied this and said , " Do n't worry . Practically any Congressman would love to fight your battle . You want me to take it up with Shimmark ? He loves to get his name in the paper . I thanked Joe and said I 'd work it out somehow , but that very night they started to throw the big reasons at me , even before I had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force and marry her . It happened a long way off , in Texas , for that night I heard a radio program explaining why the Democrats of Texas were going to support Dwight Eisenhower for President . I had known the general at several different bases and had played with his son . Suddenly , there in the dark streets of Osaka , Eisenhower became the symbol of what a major in the Air Force might become : a man ready for many different kinds of action if his country needed him . For one hellish hour I walked the streets weighing what I was doing and then I found myself at the entrance to my alley , and skinny Watanabe-san had struck it rich at pachinko and ran out in the street to offer me a beer and I got a rosy glow on , and about eleven Hana-ogi came down to take me home , but I did not tell her then of the great decision I had made . In the morning I sneaked into Kobe , for I did not want either General Webster or Lt.Col @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American consulate . Luck was with me , for Mr. Carstairs , the fuddy consul , was not yet in and I could talk privately with his secretary , the horse-faced girl who had married a G.I.She recognized me at once and said , " You made my kid brother the hero of his whole block . " " How do you mean ? " " Your autograph . The kids take Korea seriously , even if grownups do n't . " Although she said this with a smile I noticed that she wasp177eyeing me suspiciously and after I had made a few awkward starts at conversation she put her two hands firmly on her desk and said , " Major Gruver , did you come here to find out about marrying a Japanese girl ? " I gulped and must have blushed , for she added immediately , " I can spot you guys a mile off . What are you ashamed of ? " I asked her what she meant by that and she laughed . " You all think there 's some tricky way to get around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your superior officers . " She looked up at me with such infectious amusement that I had to laugh , whereupon she said , " But you , Ace Gruver . I never thought you 'd tumble for a Buddha-head . " I fumbled a bit and asked , " Just what are the paper requirements ? " " I ca n't tell you a thing , Major . " You work here . " " Forbidden . You military heroes have to clear everything through your chain of command . " " You mean it 's as tough as that ? " " It 's tougher , Major . We do n't want men like you marrying Japanese girls . We make it extra tough for men like you . " " I was only asking , " I said . " Sure ! There , ohas n't ever been a soldier in here who really intended to get married . They were all only asking ! " " Then you wo n't help ? " The big girl looked out the door to see if Mr. Carstairs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Old Droopy Drawers lives by the book . He 'd fire me if he saw me talking with you about legal matters . But I figure if a man can shoot down seven MIG 's he 's entitled to some help . " She showed me a completed file on a sailor who had married a Japanese girl . I had heard of the paper work . I had even seen some of it during Joe Kelly 's marriage . But I had not compre/hended how repetitious and degrading it was . I began to understand what Joe meant when he said that only an enlisted man , conditioned to standing in line and taking guff , could see a Japanese wedding through . I said , " Is n't this a pretty tough obstacle course ? " The girl laughed and said , " If I had my way , we 'd make it tougher . Men like you ought n't to grab Jap girls just because they 're available . " " I do n't want a lecture , " I protested . " Look , Major . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a study of which Americans were marrying Japanese girls . The findings are n't pleasant . " She riffled some papers and read off the dismal case histories : " Wyskanski , Noel . Orphaned . No education . Had a fist fight with the Catholic priest . Reform school . " " Merchant , Nicholas . Ran away from home . Been in guard house regularly since being drafted . Two court-martials . Threatened the Japanese social worker who proved that the first girl he wanted to marry was a notorious prostitute . " " Kelly , Joe . Your friend . Worst record in the Air Force in Korea . Constantdiscipline problem . Accused of murdering a drunk in Chicago but case thrown out of court on technicality . Always on the verge of criminal prosecution . Recommended twice for dismissal from the Air Force . " She tossed Kelly 's paper aside and asked bluntly , " How 'd you get mixed up with a dead-end mutt like him ? " " He was in my unit . " " Did you meet your Japanese girl through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer but the smart girl understood . She put aside the file and said patiently , " Major Gruver , you 're simply not the type . These men  --  these perpetualfailures . . . " She hammered the file and turned away to blow her nose . At that moment the front door opened and in came prim Mr. Carstairs . In one instantaneous glance hep179saw me and the marriage file and his secretary wiping her eyes . He stepped precisely into the middle of the doorway and said , " My goodness , Major Gruver is n't thinking of getting married to a Japanese girl , is he ? " The secretary looked up and sniffed . " Yes , damn it all , he is . And I 've been telling him he 's a complete fool . " " You are , " Mr. Carstairs said . He passed through our room and said sharply as he left , " But there 's nothing to worry about . The Air Force would n't let such a stupid thing happen . " When he was gone the secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the paper work ? " I said , " Well . . . I have n't . .. " With great relief the big girl started to laugh . " I understand ! You have n't asked her , have you ? Thank God ! " I blushed and said , " Look , we 're getting married . " She ignored this and said , " I feel so much better . Ace , dozens of you men come in here to ask about getting married . But most of you have n't proposed yet . Then I breathe easy becauseeverything is all right . " " You have some special way of stopping it ? " " No , " she said surprised . " It 's just that first-class Japanese girls wo n't marry American men . They prefer Japan . Ace , believe me , it 's ten-to-one that the kind of girl you deserve wo n't marry you , and the kind you can get , you would n't want . " I looked at the shabby office and at the pile of marriage reports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file . Gruver , Lloyd . Well educated . Never in trouble . Best man the Air Force had in Korea . Clean-cut American type . Married a Japanese girl because he loved her . ' Show it to your Mr. Carstairs every da.y. , DIn real anger I went over to the village of Takarazuka , where I waited in a vegetable stall near the Bitchi-bashi and toward noon I saw the first Takarazuka girls go by in their swaying green skirts . Then Fumiko-san passed me and I hidp180in the back of the store until she had disappeared . Finally I saw Hana-ogi approaching and I had that rare experience that a man sometimes knows when he sees the girl he loves picking her way along a crowded lane unaware that he is watching , and at such times  --  when the girls are not on their good behavior , you might say  --  they are extraordinarily lovely and ratify doubly all thoughts and decisions of preceding days . Hana-ogi was like that . She wore a gray kimono flecked with silver and gold , and it encased her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intricate pattern through the crowds of noonday shoppers , and as she drew near my vegetablestall I was fluttering like a broken propeller but at last I knew what I wanted . I reached out , grabbed her arm , and drew her in beside me . The man who ran the stall smiled and moved out onto the pavement as if accustomed to having his shop invaded in that manner every day . " Hanayo ! " I cried with a passion I had never before experienced . " I 've made up my mind , and I 've started the paper work . We 're going to be married . " Apparently she did n't understand for she said , " What do you say ? " " I 'm going to marry you . Take you back to America . " I remember that the shop was filled along one wall with enormous white Japanese radishes , four feet long and thick as a man . Hana-ogi drew back against them and held her hand to her cheek , where in the Japanese style short hair grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and tears came into her dark eyes . " We no speak of marriage , Rroyd-san . No . No . " " I know it 's a surprise , " I said . " But I 've thought it all out and I 'm willing to give up the Air Force and find some other job . " " But Rroyd , I no go America . "  | " We 'll work that out , too , " I said . " Some time they 'll change this crazy law so a man can take his wife home . " " You no understand , Rroyd-san . I no want to go . " I stepped away from the giant radishes and stared at Hanaogi . It was incomprehensible to me that any Japanese girl , living in that cramped little land with no conveniences and no future , would refuse America . What was it the officer 's wife in the Osaka P.X. had said : " The damned little Jap girls lay in wait at street corners with lassos and rope the American soldiersin . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . " But she replied most strangely , " Some day you leave Japan , Rroyd-san . Before you go I like you see pictures of real Hanaogi . In Kyoto . " " I do n't want to see any pictures ! " I cried . " Damn it , I came here to tell you we 're getting married . " " You get auto tomorrow morning  --  early . " She moved quickly toward the door of the shop , then turned to kiss me passionately on the lips . " When you go back America , " she said , " I want you remember great beauty of Hana-ogi. "  |p182Early  next morning we left Osaka in Lt. Bailey 's Chevvy and drove along the side of a river which for untold centuries had carried water to the rice fields of this region . It lay far below the level of the road , hemmed in by strong dikes built many generations ago and upon all the land there was the mark of much toil and the footprints of many people . Wherever we looked women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyoto was memorable , for we saw in the distance the soaring towers of great Buddhist temples , their tiers built with corners upswept in the Chinese style . And along one street we caught a glimpse of the famed Heian Shinto shrine , a glorious vermilion thing with enormous bloodredtorii guarding it . But today we were not interested in shrines or temples . We went along a side street burdened with age-old pines , where underneath a canopy of evergreen we stopped to enter a museum . It was built like a temple , with nearly a hundred statues of stone and wood , as if the old heroes of Japan had gathered to greet us , frozen forever in their stiff ceremonial attitudes . The curator hurried up to us and when he learned that I could speak no Japanese he summoned a striking young man . He was in his thirties , I judged , and wore heavy glasses . Hep183had excellent teeth , a frank smile and a rare command of English . " I studied at Oxford , " he explained , " and served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two years in our store in Boston . What did you wish to see ? " It was clear that he did not know Hana-ogi and that he supposed her to be merely some attractive street girl I had picked up for the day . He was therefore somewhat distressed when she spoke to him in Japanese , so I interrupted and said , " I understand you have an unusual collection of prints of Hana-ogi , of Ogi-ya . " Immediately he withdrew deep inside himself and studied me carefully . Then he looked at Hana-ogi and bowed very low . " You are Hana-ogi-san of Takarazuka , " he said in precise English . " You are very beautiful . And you , Major , are Lloyd Gruver . Yes , yes . Even in Kyoto we have heard of you . " I did not know whether be meant that he had heard of me as a flier or that he had heard of Hana-ogi and me , but be nodded formallyand said , " I can truly appreciate your desire to see the famous prints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the frowning Japanese heroes , and I felt that I was in hostile land . In this strange building I at last got the feeling of being an invader , surrounded by an alien religion and a strange art many centuries older than my own native land . I experienced the feeling even more deeply when I sat on the floor in front of an easel while the young curator went to a locked cabinet . Hana-ogi must have sensed my uneasy thoughts , for she put her hand in mine and whispered , " Now you see greatest beauty . " I was totally unprepared for what I saw . I had developed a mental impression of the ancient Hana-ogi . She must have looked , I thought , something like my Hana-ogi : extraordinarily beautiful , yet with a distinctive oriental cast . I believed the pictures of her would look something like Botticellis.  |p184I  shall never forget the extreme shock of that first print . The young curator held it from me for a moment and said in reverence , " The first one is of Hana-ogi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is by one of our finest artists , Shuncho . " Then , bursting with pride and affection , he displayed the picture . It was disgusting . The girl 's face was pasty and flat . Her hair was a mass of yellow combs . She was swathed in seven kimonosthat gaped at the neck . But worst of all , her eyes were caricatures , mere slants , and her teeth were a horrid black . In this portrait of dead beauty I could not find one shred of loveliness . I must have betrayed my disappointment for both Hana-ogi and the curator tried to explain that the design was controlled by Japanese artistic tradition , the way a portrait of a woman by Picasso does not appear really beautiful . I remember trying real hard to remember who Picasso was , but before I could get it they took away the first picture and brought in another by an artist whose name I did n't catch , but my dismay was greater than before . The famous courtesan had the same pasty face , slit eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into such an angle that I remember thinking , " If she does n't straighten up she 'll strangle . " In her left hand she held one of the endless combs which she was jabbing into her mass of oily hair , and in her right she grasped a black ebony fan which made the whole picture look stupid . Even the half dozen kimonos were poorly painted and in odd colors . It was the third picture which caused the argument . I took down the name of the artist , Masayoshi , for he showed Hanaogireturning to the House of Ogi-ya after her elopement . She was dressed in many kimonos covered by a purple robe and followed by two barefoot servants carrying an umbrella and a massive bouquet of flowers . I studied the picture with dismay ,  |p185for  I recognized it immediately as one that Hana-ogi had describedfor me that night when she danced the story of her predecessor , but what she had not told me was that this picture of Hana-ogi showed a remarkably ugly woman with a big nose , dirt smears over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly ! " I cried . I felt defrauded . My Hana-ogi withdrew as if she had been struck and the young man pulled the print away . " I am afraid , " he said in clipped syllables , " that you have no appreciation of our art . " " I was told that this Hana-ogi was the most beautiful woman in Japanese history . " " She was , " the young man insisted . " But these pictures . . . " " It 's our style of art , " he explained . " But look at Hana-ogi-san here . This one . She 's really beau-tiful . " The young man did not look at Hana-ogi-san . Instead he took the portrait of the ancient Hana-ogi back to the cabinet and returned with another . Quietly he said , " I am afraid you are blind to the problem , Major . But would you like me to explainin a few words ? " " Indeed I would , " I said . " You 'll forgive me if they 're very simple words ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Hana-ogi I do n't want to go home disappointed . " " If you have a free mind , " he assured me , you will go home elated . The picture I 'm about to show you is by one of Japan 's supreme artists , Utamaro . Have you heard of him ? " " No . " " No bother , but will you believe me when I say his work is prized all over the world ? Good . You are going to see one of his loveliest creations . When you look at it do n't think of Hana-ogi . Think only of this heavenly yellow . "  |p186He  flashed the picture before me and the yellow was indeed like a fine sunlight . He continued his narration , pointing out the perfect proportions of the design , the exquisite line , the subdued color harmonies and the suggested textures . I followed him carefully and agreed with what he said . Then brusquely he said , " As for the face of Hana-ogi , we Japanese think it was sent down from heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some distant corner of my brain came the affirmation , " The men who knew this woman thought she was beautiful . " And immediately there came another terrible memory  --  of a time when some of us young officers were attending a wedding and we saw the bride and there was a moment of awful silence and somebody behind me whispered , " Well , every man thinks the girl he 's marrying is pretty . " And I could see myself back in America , about to introduce my Hana-ogi to strangers who had never known her and I could feel them cringing away from my Japanese girl  --  unlovely to them  --  as I now cringed away from the long-dead Hana-ogi . I looked again at the treasured face , at the curious slanted eyes and the black teeth and from my own humility and the vanished green houses of the Yoshiwara came the assurance that she was beautiful . I said , " I think I understand . " The young man started to take the Utamaro away but I said , " Let me study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing in the upper corner and asked what it was . During the remarkable discussion that followed the young curator stood crisply at attention with his left hand upon the easel . I have only to close my eyes to see him standing there with his faded echo of the great Hana-ogi . " It 's impossible to say what this printing means , Major . It 's a poem , written by some unimportant man who visited Hanaogi . These symbols are his name : The man from the other sidep187of Yanagiwara . That 's all we know about him , a stranger who came from a distant village and saw the great woman once . But his poem will live among us forever . " " What did he write ? " " I 'm sorry but I can not tell you the meaning . " " You ca n't translate the symbols ? " " Oh , yes ! " he assured me proudly . " I was translator to our Foreign Office during the peace treaty at San Francisco . But the Japanese language like Japanese beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the name Hanaogimeans flower and fan , and its symbols are woven into the poem , but what they are intended to mean in this particular poem no one can say . The stranger from Yanagiwara himself did not know . " " What do you mean , he did n't know ? " " In Japan a man sees a beautiful woman and he expresses words , but they have no specific meaning . " " How can words have no specific meaning ? There 's the symbol . Right there . Why ca n't you read it ? " " All , but I can , Major . Trouble is , I can read it in so many ways . According to one way the stranger from Yanagiwara is saying , Even a mere glimpse in autumn of that night-bloomingflower , Hana-ogi , floods my soul with summer . ' " " That 's clear enough , " I said . " But it is n't clear , because I 'm only guessing that that 's what the stranger meant , for the words can also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I once laid on a fan for a love of old days and brings no chill of autumn to my heart . ' " I was confused . " You mean those same symbols can mean such different things ? " " They can also mean many other things , Major . Our life injapan is one of implied meanings , hidden significances . Forp188example , they say that you have fallen in love with Hana-ogisan . Which Hana-ogi ? " At the mention of her name Hanayo-chan put her hand around mine and I said , " Which one ? This one . The living one . " But which of the living ones ? " " This one . Here ! " The young man , who must have hated Americans for taking his art galleries in Boston and London and New York , stood bitterly erect by the easel and said softly , " But there are many Hana-ogi-sans with us today . She is famous in Japan , this girl , and deeply loved . There is the peasant girl who is good to her mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in training to be a geisha . Did n't you know that her father had sold her to a green house ? There is the famous beauty who was rescued by one of the rich Matsudaira men . The one who committed suicide . His daughter , Fumiko-san , is at Takarazuka now . Or the gracious actress Hana-ogi who always used to be seen with Fumiko-san . Or the ascetic young woman who aspired to be Japan 's greatest dancer . Or the reckless girl who ran away with an American flier . You see , we are a very subtle people . Our words mean many things . " I think that Hana-ogi had some intimation of what the young man was saying , for she kept her hand close about mine and when he was finished she rose and pulled me to my feet . Staring purposefully at the young man she said quietly , " I never tie my obi so , " and she pointed to the picture of longdeadHana-ogi , the rare , the wonderful courtesan whose memorystill burned and she indicated Hana-ogi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advertise . I wanted to maul the young curator for having told me these things but suddenly he smiled at me and said , " I must show you one more portrait , Major . In some ways it is the loveliestp189of all . " He brought us a delicate thing , all gold and yellow and faded blue . From it a young Hana-ogi looked back across her shoulder at us , sweet and beautiful as I had wanted her to be . She seemed to tantalize the mind and in a lower corner of the picture appeared one of her youthful attendants , a child of nine playing with battledore and shuttlecock . Lovingly the curator indicated the child and said , " This was Tatsuta . Even the names of the children who attended our immortal Hanaogiare recorded . " Then quite unexpectedly he placed his hand tenderly on my Hana-ogi 's head and rumpled her hair . " This one was a Tatsuta , too . See , the obi tied in back . " I thought for a moment that he had told me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous of me ; but as we left the treasure room I turned and saw him jealously storing the forty-one portraits of the famous girl who long ago had graced the green houses of Yoshiwara and I realized that he was indeed in love with Hana-ogi , but not with my Hana-ogi . On the drive home we were silent until we came to a part of the river bank where three women were tilling a rice field . Then suddenly Hana-ogi took my hand and kissed it and whispered , " We very poor . My father no want to sell to geisha house . Japanese fathers love their daughters . Same like in America . But . . . " We never said another word about it , not about the Matsudaira man who had bought her nor about his daughter Fumiko-san for whom Hana-ogi now felt responsible . For a few minutes after leaving the museum I had feared that knowing my Hana-ogi 's history might make it impossible for me to marry her , but one mention of her father ended such doubts , for I recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night we had slept together . That was poverty , when a man sifted each grain of soil by hand to make it yield a little more rice . I knew that if Hana-ogi 's father had soldp190her it was because he had no human alternative . I said with new dedication , " Now we 'll get married , " but she merely drew closer to me and I believe that she had taken me to Kyoto so that I might know of her childhood and that if the curator had not told me , she would have done so when we studied the pictures . With my right arm I drew her tousled head to mine and drove the car quite slowly beside the ancient , turbulent river . I was disturbed , however , that she had not yet actually said that she would come with me to America . I judged that she was hesitating in order to provide me with an escape from my rash promise to leave the Air Force . Then , in a dramatic way , I learned that perhaps she really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed me Hana-ogi 's reasons for staying in Japan.  |p191This  gentle mask-faced Japanese woman came to the Marine Barracks in Takarazuka accompanied by a smart young woman who spoke good English and they explained that they wished me to accompany them on a matter of greatest importance . I followed them to the Bitchi-bashi , then through the vegetable stalls and onto the footpath leading to the girls ' dormitories . This was the first time I had been on this path and as I approached the building where Hana-ogi had lived before she met me I grew quite excited but then I saw the dormitory itselfand it was forbidding : a plain wooden building covered with bamboo matting and protected by a row of cryptomeria trees planted to make a high hedge . The house was like a fortress and I was pleased at the prospect of invading it . But my guide did n't stop there . Instead , she led me down a narrow path past the cryptomeria trees and up to a small hill that overlooked the river . There she stopped at a curious gate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening this she took me into a beautiful garden which surroundeda superior Japanese house made of highly polished wood . It was guarded by an enormous flat stone upon which sat nine young girls wearing the green skirts of the Takarazukap192uniform . The girls jumped to their feet and bowed very low until the elderly woman had passed . She led me to a room covered with exquisite white tatami and containing at one end a raised platform of matched cypress planks polished a golden brown . It was obvious that this was the room of a dancing teacher . The woman introduced herself as Teruko-san , one of the first great Takarazuka stars . She had been , in her day , a legend and now she handed the legend down to the young girls waiting for her on the rock . They came to her five days a week and submitted themselves to the tyranny of her masklike face which now drew close to mine . Teruko-san sat with me on the floor , arranging her kimono with precision , and I saw that her garments were five shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin line of blue showing about the neck . Her tabi were white and accentuated the outlines of beautiful and powerful feet . They reminded me of Hana-ogi 's superb feet and Teruko-san must have intended this , for she said promptly , " Major Gruver , if you cause Hana-ogi to leave us it is not only the great stage she will lose . It is also this . " With a slow motion of her hand , as if she were participating in a dance , she indicated the perfectroom , stopping with her finger pointed at a frame containinga massive motto written in strong characters by a great Japanese novelist . She said , " Our motto : Be pure . Be right . Be beautiful . ' " Then she said , " When I die Hana-ogi is to follow me , for she is our finest dancer . I believe she is to be even greater than I , for when I danced I was alone and stood out like Fuji-san . But today there are many good dancers and Hana-ogi dominatesthem all . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferentially toward her and she said , " Yes , theyp193are excellent because I teach them as a famous old man taught me . In this way we keep alive the art of Japan . " As Teruko-san droned on I could hear Hana-ogi 's bright voice with its sometimes-hoarse edge cutting at my heart , I could see the meticulous manner in which she folded the edges of her kimono to outline her wonderfully strong neck , and I could see the classic manner in which she danced . I could believe that these things had come in part from this room . Teruko-san said , " If you persist , Hana-ogi will never return to this room . " Then she pulled a clever trick . She said , " You must sit here , Major Gruver , for I am to give a lesson , " and the interpreter went to fetch the nine young girls . They came in quietly , practicedlittle steps on the tatami then deftly dropped away their green skirts and climbed onto the low stage in bright dancing tights . Teruko-san was transformed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stage-stamping dancer much better than even her best pupil . She led them through one single step for a long time and I detected one or two girls who looked as if they might honestly become dancers and I realized that Teruko-san had intended that I see in these struggling children  --  they were fifteen I judged  --  the Hana-ogi of some years back and as I looked at these lovely faces now perspiring as Hanaogidid when she had run through the alleys to our home , I could imagine the days and years she had studied . When the girls left , Teruko-san said , " I have wanted you to understand exactly what you are doing . " She led me to the gate and to my surprise dismissed the interpreter and walked with me back to the dormitory , which was deserted in the late afternoon . She nodded to the guard and took me to a small room , pushed aside the paper door and told me to enter saying , " Hana-ogi. "  |p194The  room was as beautiful as the girl I loved . Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which she kept her belongings . The rest of the room was bare and clean and glimmering . There were eight creamy white tatami , so it was not a big room , and six bright cushions around a very old brazier of gold and green ceramic in which charcoal rested on a pile of gleaming white sand . A low table and four jetblackbowls for food completed the furniture except for one shelf which held copies of the plays Hana-ogi had acted in . The only ornamentation was a single Japanese print in excellentcolors of a bridge suspended in the moonlight over a rocky gorge with a crescent moon low in the sky . I felt that I was growing to understand Japanese prints , and the more I understoodthem the more I liked them . But this time Teruko-san had been too clever , for it had been her intention that I see this room and lament that I was taking Hana-ogi from it ; but it had quite the opposite effect . The room cried out in the late afternoon shadows that I should go ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be destined for so narrow a prison . The wood of the room was beautiful , but Hana-ogi was more so . The tatami were neat , the books were important and the Japanese print no doubt represented one of the peaks of art  --  but so did Hanaogi , and in addition she was a glorious woman , one who delighted in hurrying through the dark alleys of Osaka to join the man she loved . But if her room gave me permission to love her , what I saw next gave me a direct order to do so , for as Teruko-san and I passed down the hall from Hana-ogi 's room I happened to look through sliding doors that were ajar and saw the room next to Hana-ogi 's . It was remarkable in that it was also of only eight tatami , but it was crowded with dolls and fluffy brown bears and pil/lows edged with pink and blue lace streamers and tables with birds blown out of glass and corners filled with delightful odds and ends . It was the room of a young girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy clutter so loved by people who do n't have to make up their minds . I looked at Teruko-san and she said , " Fumiko-san . " Then she pointed to the table , low and exquisitely carved in the ornate Chinese style , and with no English at her command told me that that was the table Fumiko-san 's father used when he committedhara-kiri in the debacle of August , 1945 . The room frightened me and I wanted to get out of it . At the entrance to the dormitory I bowed very low and said , " Domo arigato gozaimasu , Teruko-san . " She was pleased that I spoke even that trivial Japanese , so she bowed equally low and said , " Do itashi mashite , dozo , " and I hurried to the train that would take me back to Osaka just as fast as possible . How can I recall the journey of a young man desperately in love as he moves across the picture-book landscape of Japan to a city of canals where he will meet his beloved ? My train crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I had often waited for Hana-ogi and where young girls now passed swirling their green skirts . For a few seconds I followed the footpath that led to the dormitory and here four of the great stars walked arm in arm . At the dormitory itself I saw Fumiko-san entering the dark and towering wall of cryptomerias . Now I was in the countryside and I could see the rice fields crowding right up to the last inch of railroad tie . Beyond were the trim clean villages with roofs of red tile and temple roofs of golden tile . In the fields were old men pulling harrows and women digging , while along the village streets children laughed and played loud jumping games.  |p196There  was a momentary thrill as the train pulled into the junction town of Nishinomiya , for I knew that when I looked across the station platform I would see a gigantic poster for Swing Butterfly with a huge picture of Hana-ogi in the middle . I spent my time waiting for the through express , wondering what the people on that platform would think if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be with Hana-ogi and she would be slipping into a gray and blue kimono so that she could sit upon the floor with me for a bowl of cold fish and vinegar rice ? The express from Kobe roared in and I avoided the coach where the officers of General Webster 's command sat very formally in freshly pressed uniforms . Instead I sought out a back car from which I caught glimpses of the Inland Sea and soon we came to where the river emptied into the sea through great concrete culverts , and promptly we entered Osaka itself , where the train plunged through a canyon of ugly houses hung with laundry and into a tunnel which brought me to the noisy , crowded station . As I approached the canal I was alive with excitement . I was young and I was coming to the end of a journey that I wished I might make each day of my life : from Takarazuka to Osaka , where Hana-ogi was waiting . And when I reached home the wonder of my journey was increased , for there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven a colonel to Tokyo and Katsumi would be gone for two days on business of her own . Once more we had a home to ourselves . I slipped into my blue-andwhitecotton kimono and shared cold fish and rice with her . When the meal was over I said , " Teruko-san came to see me today . She showed me her dancing school . The one that could be yours some day . Now I know why you want to stay at Takarazuka . " She sighed and said she was glad that I understood why shep197could not come with me to America , but I added , " And I also saw your little room . With the lovely print . " I made my hands fall like the gorge in her solitary picture . At this she blushed and held her hand against the stray-hair sideburns along her cheek . I said , " And when I saw that bare room which holds you like a prisoner  --  no life  --  no one to love . . . " I caught her in my arms and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay upon the tatami watching her select her clothes for tomorrow I said , " So we 'll be married as soon as possible . You 'll love New York . You can see hundreds of shows , some like Takarazuka , but none of the actresses will be beautiful like you . " I was imagining her in New York , so I rose and showed her how she could pull the wanton hair that crept upon her cheeks up into place . She did so and studied herself in a mirror . " Now you look like an American girl , " I said . She pulled the hair back down and said , " Japanese way more better . " But I convincedher that if she wanted to she could look almost American , so she tucked her hair in and the Japanese sideburns were gone . This sounds strange , but I believe that on a New York street few would recognize that she was from japan.  |p198In  the morning I begged her to stay with me to the last minute , but she insisted upon leaving early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language we had finally invented for ourselves : Hana-ogi : Rroyd-san , you takushi preeze . ( Please get a taxi . ) I : Daijobu , I takushi , get , ne ? ( All right , I 'll get one . ) Hana-ogi : I rile stay with you . Keredomo I train go , honto . ( But I must catch the train , really . ) I : More sukoshi stay , kudasai . ( Stay a little longer , please . ) Hana-ogi : Dekinai , Rroyd-san . No can stay . ( I 'm sorry . I ca n't stay . ) I : Do shi'te , whatsahurry ? ( Hey , why hurry ? ) Hana-ogi : Anone ! Takarazuka , my job-u , ne ? I job-u go , ne ? ( Listen , I have a job . ) I : Chotto , chotto goddamn matte ! Takarazuka ichi-ji start now . Ima only ro o'clock , ne ? ( Wait a minute ! ) Hana-ogi : Anone ! Rroyd-san , you mess my hair , ne ? I beauty saron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweet meaninglessword which makes the sentences of Japanese girls musical and tender . ) I : No , no , no . Anone ! You takusan steky now . ( Listen ! You 're plenty pretty now . ) But she left , nevertheless , and my last warning was that shep199must have her hair done American style . Toward evening Joe blew in with some Suntory , the Japanese whisky we had both come to like so much , and we had a quiet celebration while we waited for the girls and rretty soon Hana-ogi arrived in her new hair-do . It was a transformation . " Wow ! " I cried . " She could walk down Fifth Avenue and knock them all dead . " She blushed nervously and I believe she would have been pleased with her American look except that Katsumi arrived and ruined everything . She had bandages over her eyes and peered out through slits . Joe immediately guessed that she had been in an accidentbut I remember looking with a certain agony at Hana-ogi and muttering to myself , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lousy operation ! " And I was right . Dear , good Katsumi wanted more than anything else to look like an American . Then Joe would be proud when he took her home ; so on the first day he had left her alone she had sneaked over to the quack doctor in Kobe . For eight dollars he had slashed her upper eyelids to make the Mongolian fold fall back into place . He had performed this operation over a thousand times and sometimes his remodeling enabled girls to lose their Japanese look completely . Proudly Katsumi stood before us and dropped away her bandages . Joe cried , " What have you done ? " Even more proudly the little girl opened her eyes slowly , one by one . " Now I have good eyes , " she said . The result was horrible . I gasped and Hana-ogi looked away . But Joe just stood there . He was about six feet from her when she turned to face him and he could see that what had been a glorious and typical Japanese face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could ever guess what he thought just then . Once he started to speak but stopped . Then he went over and kissed his wife and said , " By200damn , Katsumi , you look more like an American than I do . " " I so proud , " she said , dropping her new face against his arms . There was a moment of silent intensity in the room and then Hana-ogi said , " Rroyd-san , we walk take , ne ? " joe looked at me and asked belligerently , " Whatsamatta , anythin ' wrong ? " and I replied , " Nothing at all . I think Katsumi looks swell . " But as soon as Hana-ogi and I reached the canal she cried , " Why she do that ? She not proud to be Japanese ? " Deftly she thrust her two forefingers onto her upper lids and pulled them up into mere slits , crying , " I like Japanese eye . I like ! " Then she started to sob and I tried to comfort her , but she pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hair that I had tucked up and they fell upon her cheeks in the Japanese style . As she did this her fingernails caught in her flesh and a thin stream of blood trickled down to her chin . I tried to wipe it away but she cried , " I proud to be Japanese . I not want to be American . I like Tokyo , not New York . " I had to stand there in the cool night and watch her slapping at her face until the blood stopped . Then she turned to me defiantly and said , " You no like Japanese girl , eh ? You ashamed Japanese face . You want me cut my eyes , too ? " I put my arm about her and kissed the torn skin . I said , " When you pulled your eyes far up you looked like the Utamaro print . You were beautiful ; But that day in Kyoto I was n't prepared for such beauty . " I was about to say more when she clutched my arm and whispered , " Ssssh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the canal . They were the unlucky ones who had not been able to grab onto a G.I. for the night . Osaka was a leave city for our troops in Korea and had accumulated morep201streetwalkers than any other city in the world , so that any one girl 's chances were slim . They recognized Hana-ogi and gathered about her . " Is it true , " they asked , " that you are marrying an Ameri-can ? " When she said she did n't know they were depressed , for to them the highest dream they could envisage was to trap a G.I. who might take them to the States , but they knew there was little chance , for American chaplains and Japanese secret police investigated all girls , and prostitutes were weeded out . Unemployed for the night , they pressed in on Hana-ogi and asked , " Have you a picture ? " She had none , so they produced strips of paper on which she printed her name in the Chinese characters used for all names . One of the girls studied her signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hana-ogi ? " At first the actress refused to say , then , feeling deep in the Japanese mood , she said softly , " My name was Kaji . " Immediatelythe girl touched Hana-ogi on the wrist and cried , " You are kaji , kaji ! " Then she twisted her hands high into the air . I asked what this meant and Hana-ogi said , " In Japanese my real name means fire . " One of the girls who knew English struck a lighter some G.I. had given her and cried , " Fire , fire ! " Another girl quickly called , " Cigaretto , Major ? " I passed a package around and in the night I could see a ring of little flames , and later Hana-ogi said defiantly , " I am proud to be an actress for such girls  --  for all the girls in Nihon . " When the streetwalkers had departed I resumed my argumentand asked , " What did you mean when you said you did n't know if you were marrying an American ? " She made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night air , and said , " The fire goes out . " " No ! " I cried . " There are some fires that never go out . "  |p202She  leaned against a tree growing near the canal and said , " Long ago Teruko-san loved the Supervisor . They were very happy and were going to commit suicide at Kegon Falls . But they did n't and now he 's a famous man and she 's a famous woman and they meet sometimes and have tea . She speak me today . " " But the flame did n't go out  --  or she 'd have forgotten . Believeme , the flame was still there . " Then she said an astonishing thing . " You 'll go home and marry Eileen . . . " " Eileen ? " I cried . " Where did you hear . . . " I had never spoken her name . " Yes , " she said . " You marry Eileen ( she pronounced it Eireen ) your father tell me . " " My father ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me late one night . " Bitterly I kicked the earth , for I could feel my father orderingthings again . " Did he talk you into this ? " I demanded . " No ! He say if I want to marry you O.K. , but he know I never do it . " " What did he tell you ? " " He very nice , very kind man . He speak you marry Eileen . I think so too . " I pleaded , " Do n't believe what he said . Years ago he dragged me into a life . . . I 've done all right but it was never my decision . " She touched the insignia on my blouse and asked , " You no happy ? Air Force ? " I cried , " It 's been one life . . . I 've liked it . . . But there could be others . " She grasped my hand tightly and said , " Sometimes I have been afraid of you because you are in uniform . My brotherp203was in uniform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am afraid of uniforms . " Then she put her head on my shoulderand said , " But you  --  your father  --  good men . " t  --  I was deeply agitated and struggled despcmtely to get down  --  for once in my life  --  to the hard bed rock of living . I said , " Hanayo , you are the hope of my life . If you leave me all the things . . . " She said in Japanese , " I know , Rroyd . For me you are also the key . With you I could become a woman and a mother and we could travel in London . I could love you and help you . . . She became exquisitely tender and I knew then that with her as my wife I could find the solid basis for existence that had so far escaped me ; and I was aware that for her , too , I was the only escape she could ever know . If she rejected me now she could become only the glorious outline of a woman , imprisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other women . I lifted her in the air and cried , " Then we 'll be married ? " She stared at me and said , " No . " I dropped her gently to the bank and kissed her impassive , golden face , thinking bitterly of the stories I had read about white men in strange lands . Always the yellow girl tried to seduce these clean-cut men away from their decent white sweethearts , for everyone knew that yellow girls plotted evil ways to lure white men . And if the yellow girls succeeded the white men sank lower and lower toward barbarism . " Damn it , " I cried , " this story 's all loused up ! " When Hana-ogi looked up in surprise I said , " I 'm a West Point honor man . In the story you 're supposed to beg me to marry you . Hanayo-chan , please beg me , " ! She started to laugh at my comic plea , but then I think she glimpsed the empty years that faced her , for she took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of Japanese doom , " I do n't want to become the lonely old woman who teaches dancing . " ( I recall her words : " I not grad be woman old in house dance teach no man come . " ) Her lament burned my heart and I cried , " Then marry me . " This time she answered in a lower voice , still freighted with that inevitable sense of tragedy that seems to haunt the Japanese , " I never intended marrying you , Rroyd-san . **25;8016;TOOLONG are no good . We read about Japanese girls in America  --  what happened in Cedar Rapids . " " Then why did you come to live with me ? " I demanded in anguish . She pressed her lovely head against mine and said softly in Japanese , " I know it was wrong . But for me it was my only chance in life to love a man . No Japanese man would marry me  --  what the man in museum told you . Oh , maybe a fishcatchboy or a rice-plant boy , maybe such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cruel to wives like me . Rroydsan , in all the world you were the only man I dare love . " She started to cry , the bitter lament for a section of her life coming to an end at age twenty-nine . It was hellish to be there with her , to hear her committing herself to the inverted world of the Takarazuka girls and the green , flowing skirts and me to airplanes and the management of war . I grasped her hands and cried , " Hanayo-chan ! Please ! It 's our lives you 're speaking of . Marry me ! " Limply and in despair she drew her hands away . Then , raising her arms as if to embrace the entire sleeping city of Osaka she said with tragic finality , " I Japanese . I always Japanese . I never be happy nowhere . " ( As she said it : " I nebber be grad . " ) Then the misery of her heart overcame her and she started to cry again . Looking down , to keep her tears from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by thep205P.X. ' s in Japan . One of the prostitutes , photographed by some soldier lover , had discarded it . Delicately IIana-ogi stooped for the orange paper and pressed it out . Then with an achingly beautiful hand she pointed to the trademark used by Kodak in Japan : that tremendous and sacred statue of Buddha at Kamakura , the ancient capital . Its vast , impassive face was enshrinedas a symbol of the Japanese nation and slowly Hanaogi'shand left it and indicated her own symbolic face with its beautiful Japanese eyes and classic mouth . " One poet say my face same like this face of Kamakura . I very proud . " Then in a tender , forgiving gesture she pointed to our dark alley and asked sadly , " Katsumi-san marry American boy , ne ? What happen to her , desho ? " The answer to that one arrived next day in the form of a special Fourth of July present for Joe Kelly , our overseas hero . We had celebrated the holiday by sneaking out into the country with a couple of picnic baskets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some village near Kyoto and Katsumihad said , " Japanese love to celebrate . Even American holidays we enjoy . " But when we got back to Osaka , Joe found the fateful letter tucked under the door . We had all known it must arrive soon but even so we were unprepared . Joe 's hands trembled as he read the bad news . " They sending you home ? " I asked . " Yep , " he said weakly . He showed me the sheet of paper which I at once recognized as one not intended for enlisted men to see , and my West point training welled up . " How 'd you get hold of this ? " " A friend of a friend , " he said . I read the impersonal phrases which two months before would have meant nothing to me . " American military personnelmarried to Japanese wives will be rotated home immediatelylest their allegiance to the United States be eroded . "  |p206Farther  down it said , " This applies especially to personnel whose marriages have occurred since April I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage about commanders providingevery assistance to men who must make unusual arrangements for wives forced to remain in Japan . Joe asked bitterly , " What do they mean by unusual arrangements ? Getting her a job in a good whore house ? " " Joe , take it easy ! " " It ai n't easy to take . " " Joe , I 've seen hundreds of orders like this . They all peter out . " " I think they mean it this time , Ace . Should I write to my Congressman ? " In spite of my original feelings on this point I now said , " Take it clear to the President , Joe . " I turned and kissed blackened-eyes Katsumi on the cheek and said , " I wish we had a million gals like you back home . " Joe said , " This is important to you , Ace , because one of these days you may be tryin ' to bring Hanayo into the States . " " I 'm already trying , " I said . Then desperately I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started the paper work this morning . Just in case . " I noticed that Hana-ogi gasped at this and was about to protest , but Joe interrupted by pointing to the corners of the wood-and-paper house . " I had it good here , " he said grimly . " Wonderful wife , baby comin ' , friends , a home . Well , that 's the way the ball bounces . " As he surveyed the impending ruin he took refuge in the phrase which our men across Korea had adopted as their reaction to the dismal tricks of war : " That 's the way the ball bounces . " For Joe the ball took an evil twist . An implementing letter arrived next day with a cold , hard list of the men who were to be sent home and under the K 's Joe found his name . He tookp207the list immediately to Lt.Col . Craford , who said , " I told you you were goin ' home . I got four men on that list . Everyone of ' em 's been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Navin ' a baby . " All wives have babies . That 's what wives are for . " " Can I be transferred back to Korea ? " The colonel grunted , " You 're the fourth guy who would rather go back to war in Korea than go home to the States . You really prefer Korea ? " Joe saw a chance to remain in the area and cried eagerly , " Yes ! " Lt.Col . Craford turned away in disgust and said , " It 's disgracefulwhen a man prefers Japan to America , but when he 'd rather go back to Korea it 's insanity . " W . " , Then I can go ? " Joe begged . I " No ! " Craford shouted . " You get to hell home . All of you Jap-lovers , get home where you belong . " He looked at Joe 's papers and asked , " Where is your home ? " Joe said , " Osaka . " Craford flushed and said , " I mean your real home . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and shouted , " You get out of here . I ought a court-martial you . " Without thinking Joe caught him up on it . " Would that mean I could stay in Japan ? " Craford became apoplectic and sputtered , " All right , wise guy . All right . When the shipping list comes out you wo n't have to look . Because your name is gon na be first . " When Joe reported all this I got sore . I 've watched my father deal with hundreds of human problems and although he 's as tough a general as they come , he always puts men first . In France there was a saying in his outfit : " If your wife is dying , do n't bother with the colonel . He 'll say no . See Generalp208Gruver . He 'll say yes . " So I told Joe , " You hate the military , kid , but this is n't standard . I 'll fight this all the way to General Webster . " I caught the train to Kobe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling down at me . General Webster did n't smile . For the first three minutes he never gave me a chance to get a word in . " Who in hell do you think was just in here ? " he concluded . " The Supervisor of the Keihanshin Kyuko Railroad ! " He waited for this to take effect , but I did n't comprehend , so he said in disgust , " The railroad that runs the theater where you 've distinguished yourself  --  beyond the call of duty . " I waited for the explosion but there was none . General Webster smiled pleasantly and said , " It 's all been settled . The Japanese-American scandal has been solved by the **27;8043;TOOLONG . " He bowed and said , " His name was Ishikawa . " Mimicking a diplomat he continued , " The terms of the Webster-Ishikawa treaty are these . " He handed me a sheaf of stapled papers and said , " You fly back to Randolph Field . The actress girl goes to Tokyo . " " When ? " I cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  five days . " Then , to my amazement , he insisted that I have lunch with him , and when we got to the Officers Club Mrs. Webster and Eileen were waiting . We conducted ourselves with the punctiliousindifference you give a man who has returned from a leprosarium , but Mrs. Webster was too old a veteran of the social battlefields to play such a game for long . Her opening salvo was , " Have you seen this month 's show at Takarazuka ? The girl who plays the lead is lovely . " I was still sore about the way Joe Kelly was being treated , so I said to myself , " If all bets are off , here goes , " and I saidp209aloud , " I know the girl and she 's very talented , but I came to Kobe to try to argue your husband into letting Private Kelly remain in Japan . " " Who 's Private Kelly ? " Mrs. Webster asked . " His Japanese wife is having a baby and he 's being sent home  --  without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to change the subject but Eileen jumped in on my side , " Rotten trick , I 'd say . Her father said , " Do n't scowl at me . It 's an area order . " " What happens to the baby ? " Eileen asked . The general laid down his napkin and said , " I argued with Kelly for half an hour , warning him not to marry a Japanese girl . " This did not satisfy Eileen who asked , " Does the Army force them to desert their wives ? Are n't they legally married ? " " Yes , they 're legally married , " snapped the general . " We have to allow them to get married and then we have to leave the wife stranded . " " This is serious , " Eileen protested . " Does n't anyone try to prevent such inhuman foolishness ? " General Webster addressed Eileen directly , " I argued withthis boy . Lloyd argued with him . Where 'd it get us ? " But Eileen said , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the injustice of what 's going to happen . " Mrs. Webster interrupted and asked , " How are you involved in this , Lloyd ? " I took a deep breath and said , " Kelly 's from my outfit in Korea . " ( From the corner of my eye I saw the general sigh with relief that I had not embarrassed him by mentioning Hana-ogi , but I had no intention of avoiding the issue . ) " And it also happens that I 'm planning to marry a Japanese girl myself . "  |p210I  had dropped my napalm . The general gulped . Mrs. Websterblushed an absolute scarlet and Eileen put her hand on mine and said , " I always knew you had guts . " I said , " Thanks , I guess I 'd better go now . " Mrs. Webster asked weakly , " The actress ? " " Yes . " The general said , " Lloyd 's not marrying any actress . He 's being sent home on Thursday . " I started to leave but Eileen insisted upon walking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl and she the escort . " I 'm proud of you , Lloyd , " she said . " I wish you all the luck in the world . " We shook hands and I thought of a dozen things to say but none of them made much sense , so I said , " I 'm sorry we got things loused up , " and she said , " It was mostly my fault , " and then as I was leaving she laughed and said , " Rememberthe time I asked you if you ever felt like just grabbing me and hauling me off to some shack ? " We both smiled awkwardly at this and she said , " That 's just about what you did , was n't it ? But with somebody else . " She kissed me on the cheek and said good-naturedly , " Well , I 'm glad you turned out to be a man and not a mouse . " When I got back home I found Joe and Katsumi alone in a kind of dull panic . " I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even went to see the consul , but everyone flashes the marriage papers at you and says , You signed ' em . You knew you could n't take her to America . ' As if that made everything just dandy . " Since I already knew that his name was at the head of the list I had n't the courage to ask him what the latest hot dope was , but he came out with it , " I 'm first on the first draft . " Katsumi , saying nothing , prepared the meal while I watched the door for Hana-ogi . She arrived about seven and I could tell that she had already been ordered to Tokyo . She had ap211nervousness about her that I had not seen before and I wondered if she was aware that I was being flown home . We looked at each other for a moment as she kicked off her zori and then neither of us could continue the duplicity . She ran weeping across the tatami and cried , " Rroyd , Rroyd ! I Tokyo go five days ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I intended to crush her then so that she could never escape . " I fly back to Texas right away . " She pushed me away and cried , " You leave Japan ? " I nodded and she burst into sobs , calling to Katsumi in Japanese . The two girls stood in the middle of the room and looked at Joe and me and for the four of us the world slowly fell apart.  |p212There  is one Japanese custom I had grown to love and Hanaogifled to this as relief from the tension of our crumbling home . She went to the bath corner and started a charcoal fire raging under the huge square wooden tub . When the water was hot she called , " Come on , Rroyd-san . I scrub your back . " I went into the little room where steam enveloped me and washed down with soap , rinsing myself off before I climbed into the tub . The water was almost scalding and Hana-ogi took a kind of soft bark and scrubbed my back for twenty minutes while we talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been soaked away she soaped herselfdown , rinsed off and took my place while I scrubbed her back . As soon as we exited Joe and Katsumi took over and at nine we were all sitting cross-legged about the sukiyaki bowl while Katsumi served us an excellent meal . Hana-ogi said , " We never forget this time , " and the warmth of the bath , the vigor of the scrubbing and the good friendship of our home made us ignore for a while the penalties that hung over our heads . I think we all knew that never again in our lifetimes would we know quite the same intense friendship and love that we shared that night and Joe said glumly , " I hate to think of livin ' in some Chicago roomin ' house  --  waitin ' . " Toward midnight the inescapable gloom of our position settled firmly upon our little house so that Hana-ogi and Ip213felt we had to break free and walk in the cool night air . The stars over Osaka were the same that had shone upon America seven hours earlier : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I found myself an officer sworn to protect the United States  --  thinking that some clay we might catch up with the stars . But as so often is the case , no sooner had I entertained this fleeting thought than I willingly became more of an American than I had ever been before . For at the head of our alley appeared a large gang of toughs screaming , " Americans go home ! America go to hell ! Go home ! " They swarmed down the alley in frenzy . When they reached the house of Masako Fukada , the girl with the G.I. baby , they knocked the door in and dragged her into the street , screaming , " Kill the American bastard . " Before I could do anything , Hana-ogi dashed toward the center of the infuriated mob . Although she was risking her life at Takarazuka , and more besides , she dived for Masako , who was being kicked in the stomach , and threw herself across the girl 's body . This enraged the hoodlums , who waved their torches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with an American . I started for them but Hana-ogi cried a warning to stay away . This caused the mob to turn toward me and in the lurid light of their flickering torches these fanatical faces looked exactly like the cartoons of the Japanese barbarians we had kept posted in our ready rooms during the war years . I remember one horrible face rushing at me . It was distorted , evil , brutal and inhuman . " You 're for me , you Japanese bastard ! " I cried and launched a dive at his belly . Another Japanese swung a club upward at the same moment and I thought my head had been knocked away , but my momentum carried me on and I crashed into thep214ring leader and felt the wonderful impact of my body against his and the thudding fall onto the ground with him uttering a shaken grunt . I started to smash at his distorted and hateful face . At the same time I had sense enough to shout , " Hey , Joe ! " The little tough burst right through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a path to me and we tried to defend ourselves , but I was bleeding from the face and started to faint . " For Christ sake , " the little gangster cried . " Not now ! We got ' em runnin ' . " The next second he collapsed under three Japanese clubs and I fainted . Later I learned that the anti-American mob would have killed us except for the pachinko players . They were at the canal end of the alley , sitting gloomily in the dark after the closing of the pinball parlor and one of them to whom I used to speak in English when I played pachinko heard Joe shout my name . They realized we were in trouble and they knew we were their friends . Little Watanabe-san and the man who was keeping two geishas and the man whose wife beat him and the man who beat his wife and the man who had been in the penitentiary rushed up the alley . I am told there was a violent battle , but I knew nothing of it . The last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil masks , but Hana-ogi 's oval and yellow beauty as she lay fearful and with her eyes closed across the body of unconscious Masako Fukada . When they brought me to I heard little Joe repeating quietly , " No , no ! Do n't send for an Army doctor . Get a Jap doctor . " He was explaining to one of the pachinko players , " I learned it in Chicago . Never call a cop . Cops never help anybody . " When I wakened , with a touchy streak of bruised face , I saw Hana-ogi again . She said , " I not hurt . " Immediatelyp215I felt better and as the night progressed I began to feel absolutelygood , for our little house was crowded with alley people . They stood about in kimonos or sat cross-legged on the floor , sucking in their breath and sipping the green tea that Katsumisanserved them . They said , all of them and with repeated emphasis , " The hoodlums who attacked you  --  they were not Japanese . They were Korean communists . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember one young man , a tough , capable laborer who still wore the peaked cap of the Japanese army . I had played pachinko with him and had given his four children presents . He spoke in mumbled tones and knew no English but he said , " They were n't all Koreans . Many Japanesehate you Americans . But I fought against you in Guadalcanal . " ( I thought : " In those days you 'd have beheaded me . " ) " And you have behaved much better in Japan than I expected . Now I am your friend . Those in the street , they were com-munists . " All the same , next day Masako-san and her American baby left our alley and we never heard of them again . Masako 's mother stood in the roadway cursing the girl for having caused the riot and the other women of the alley looked away . That was Sunday . On Monday the Air Force officially notifiedjoe that he would be flown back to America on Wednesday . To joe it was the sentence of torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notice with dull resignation . He looked up grimly and asked , " Why should I be punished ? Why should I have to go back to the States ? " Automatically I replied , " The way the ball bounces . " " No ! " he shouted . " What 's there for me in America ? " I assured him , " You 'll get out of the Air Force and find a job and pretty soon Katsumi 'll follow you . " He looked at me sadly and said , " I wish it was goin ' to be  |p216I  recall every incident of that powerful and uneventful day . I drifted out to Itami to wind up my paper work and have lunch with Mike Bailey who told me , " My affair with Fumiko-san is washed up cleaner than a sergeant 's shirt on inspection . She said she was afraid something bad would happen . Suicide , broken life , unwanted baby . She said such things occurred in her family because they were aristocrats and took life awful hard . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brave . " I went over to Takarazuka for my mail and found a letter from my father which said , " I follow the war news more intelligentlysince my talk with you . No doubt your attractive little Butterfly has told you I called on her that night . You 're lucky to have known such a fine girl . I have hopes Mother and I shall see you in Lancaster one day soon . Until then , I am profoundly proud of a son who can bag seven enemy lanes . Harry . " In mid-afternoon I caught the train into Osaka and once more experienced an overpowering sense of identification with this strange land . The fields I saw could have been fields that Hana-ogi and I were working . The old people were her parents and the fat young babies were ours . The endless struggle for life was our struggle . Once when Joe Kelly had cried , " I do n't want to go back to America , " I was on the point of knocking him down as an unpatriotic moron . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can have many homes and one of them must be that place on earth , however foreign , where he first perceives that he and some woman could happily become part of the immortal passage of human beings over the face of the earth : the childbearers , the field tillers , the builders , the fighters and eventually the ones who die and go back to the earth . I had discovered this passionate emotion in Hana-ogi 's coun/try and1for me  --  a United States officer bred in patriotism  --  the crowded fields between Takarazuka and Osaka , the insignificantcanals , the tiny house , the tatami mats and the bed roll unfurled at night would be forever one of my hom4This haunting sensation stayed with me as I walked through Osaka that sunny afternoon for on passing a print shop I saw in the window an old wood-block portrait of some classic beauty of Japan . She had a mountain of black hair with big yellow combs stuck through , and she reminded me of that day in the Kyoto museum . Instinctively , I stepped inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happen to have a wood-block print of Hana-ogi ? " I asked . I wanted to take her with me when I left Japan . The proprietor grew quite mournfuland indicated that he had no English , but in a whisk he was out in the street shouting and soon the inevitable girl who had learned the language from sleeping with American soldiers appeared . " What you want , Major ? " she asked . " I 'd like a picture of 1 ana-ogi . " " Ah , so desu-ka ! " The man hurried back to a case and soon appeared with six of the glossy photographs sold at Takarazuka . They showed my Hana-ogi as a sheik , a Venetian gondolier , a Chinese prince and as three other handsome young men . I bowed very low and said , " I did not mean that Hanaogi . I meant . . . " and I pointed to the picture in the window . " Soda ! " cried the man . " Ah , soka , soka ! " cried the girl , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a picture I was one of them . Two hangers-on in the store joined us as the man shuffled through a stack of prints . Finally he produced one , a brilliant thing with iridescent black background showing Hana-ogi upon the day of her return to the green cages of Yoshiwara : glorious with amber needles through her hair andp218mauy kimonos . Her eyes were notably slanted and tinged with Mae , her teeth were jet black and the hair around her ear tame down in sideburns . She was timeless and she was Japan . The little street girl said , " This picture not real . Only copy . But very old . Maybe one hunner years . " The men watching sucked in their breath and complimented me as I carried away the living memory of Hana-ogi.  |p219It  seems strange , but I can remember each of the trivial things that filled this lovely Japanese day . When I entered our alley I passed the pachinko parlor and stuck my head in to thank the men who had helped me in my brawl with the communists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games that they scarcely looked up . I then crossed the alley to the flower shop and indicated that I wanted a bouquet for our house . The little man  --  I keep using that word because these men were really so very small  --  started a cascade of Japanese , then went to the street and shouted till a boy came . Always , in Japan , there is someone who knows English . This boy explained that since I must soon go back to America , the flower man wanted to give me three most special flowers . When the shopkeeper handed them to me they looked like the ordinary flowers that American girls wear to football games . I had often bought them for Eileen Webster but now the boy said , sucking in his breath in astonishment , " Very unusual , chrysanthemum blooming in July . " He added that this was the national flower of Japan and looked with absolute covetousness as I took them from the flower man . Thinking little of the gift I carried the flowers to our house , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath just as the boy had done , and Katsumi ran into the street to announce that we had chrysanthemums in July . Soon our littlep220room was filled with neighbors who sat upon their ankles staring at the three wonderful blooms . From time to time new men would arrive , bow to Hana-ogi , sit upon the floor and contemplatethis miraculous accomplishment . Even Watanabe-san left his pachinko to see . The boy who had been my translator joined us and explained this strange thing : " On the road to Kobe a florist has a big glass house in which he grows these flowers . In one section there are cloth blinds to keep out the sun . With an almanac to guide him , this clever man causes the sun to set earlier each day so that within the space of three weeks it seems to run the course of four months . The flowers are fooled . They think that autumn is upon them and they bloom . " The men sucked in their breath in admiration . Now Katsumi suddenly felt the first life in her womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold water and Joe , faced by the necessity of leaving his pregnant wife behind in Japan said loudly , " I hope just one thing . I hope Colonel Craford goes home and buys himself a new Buick , light blue , and I hope he 's drivin ' it down the avenue when I 'm cornin ' up the other way with a Mack truck . " I was about to caution Joe against taking a pass at Craford when I looked up to see Hana-ogi arranging her kimono . It was blue and white , very soft for summer wear . With it she wore two undergarments of thinnest cloth : pink silk and white cotton . I thought I had never seen her so lovely . Unmindfulof me she experimented with the sheer lines of her garments until she brought them into a pattern which made her more beautiful than the picture I had bought . I was about to share this with her when she raised both hands and combed down the hair about her face so that it rested in the Japanese style . Studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard me laugh and quickly knelt beside me . " Rroydsan , " she said . " I got to be this way . I Japanese . " I think shep221expected me to be hurt , but I unrolled the print and as soon as she saw the bold characters in the upper corner she cried , " Hana-ogi ! Rroyd-san , you buy ? " When we had studied the picture for a moment she went to Katsunti 's trunk and returned with a drawing brush and an ink stone . Using the firm Chinese characters long ago adopted for Japanese writing , she added a fresh column of print at the picture 's side : " Hana-ogi of Takarazuka-za loved an American . " I caught her in my arms and kissed her but in so doing I destroyed the arrangement of color and cloth at her throat so she stood and fixed the kimonos once more . For women in love there could be no garment more entrancingthan the kimono . As I watched Hana-ogi I knew that in the future , when even the memory of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American men will love all women more for having tenderly watched some goldenskinnedgirl fold herself into the shimmering beauty of a kimono . In memory of her feminine grace all women will foreverseem more feminine . When Hana-ogi was finally dressed , she and Katsumi sprang their surprise ! They were taking Joe and me to see the puppets of Osaka . Boldly , for we no longer cared who saw us upon the streets , we walked through the lovely summer 's dusk to an ancient theater , small and off to one side , where for many generations the famous puppets of Japan had been exhibited . The girls , resplendent in their kimonos , bought our tickets for a few yen and ushered us proudly into cramped seats , where we witnessed a remarkable performance . The stage was small and peopled with many men dressed in black . In their hands they carried four-foot puppets of strangely human quality who acted out one of Japan 's classical tragedies . At first it was impossible for me to accept the illusion , for it took three grown men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible . If the heroine were to walk across the stage , one of the towering black men openly manipulated the puppet 's kimono to simulate walking , another worked her left arm and kept her clothing arranged , while a distinguished old man , dressed in a shimmeringkimono and formal winglike jacket operated the puppet 's head and right arm . It seemed ridiculous to have six human arms so busy in vitalizing one doll , but before I was aware of the change , I had completely accepted the convention . Curiously , the towering black men did indeed become invisible , like spirits from another world organizing human life , and I became truly engrossed in the tragedy of these dolls . We were watching one of the many classical plays in which two lovers commit suicide . In this one a married man fell in love with a beautiful Yoshiwara girl , whom Hana-ogi identifiedfor me in the dark as " just like old-time Hana-ogi . " I do n't imagine any American has ever really understood the ins and outs of a Japanese tragedy but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly unbearable set of pressures . Just what these pressures were I never grasped but Hana-ogi and Katsumi wept softly and when I asked what about they said , " It 's so sad . People talking about this man . " But what I did understand was the musicians . For the mysterious men in black never spoke . The dialogue was sung by an amazing man accompanied by four musicians playing samisens . Maybe sung is n't the right word , for I have never heard more eerie sounds . The singer was a fat , bald-headed man in his late sixties who sat on his haunches , and as tragedy on the puppet stage deepened he would lean forward and scream in unbelievable fury until his round face became purple and the veins stood out in his neck . During love passageshe would narrate the scene in a quivering feminine wailp223and as the remorseless pressure of society bore down on the lovers he would make his voice rough and horrible like a broken saw against a rusted nail . To bear this man was a terrifyingexperience for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such overpowering emotion . I would defy anyonenot to be unnerved by that stupefying voice . Now , as the hounded lovers approached the historic scene at Amijima where they would commit suicide together , the mysteriousblack figures on the stage whirled about in what seemed like a confusion of fates , the wooden dolls marched stiffly to their doom and the inspired story-teller shrieked in positive terror while the muted samisens played doleful music . There was another sound in this remarkable tragedy , but this I was n't aware of until the curtain had closed : all the women near me were weeping and as I looked away from the epileptic singer , his face at last relaxed as if he had gone suddenly dead , I saw lovely Hana-ogi sitting with her hands folded in her kimono , sobbing desperately . She was so bereft that tears might have come to my eyes , too , but when I turned her face toward mine I saw that she was in no way unhappy . A look of ecstasy had captured her wonderful face and her eyes glowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , Hanayo-chan ? " " It was so beautiful , " she said . " What ? The singing ? " " No , " she replied softly , taking my hand . " The double suicide . It was so tender . " " What do you mean ? " I asked . The women around me were rising now and on each face I saw this same look of ecstatic satisfaction . Apparently the double suicide had inspired them even more than it had Hanaogi . I was not surprised , therefore , when she made no attempt to explain this mystery , but when I looked at Katsumi andp224saw on her tear-stained face the same look of rapture I had to acknowledge that for the Japanese audience this double suicide had provided a vitally satisfying experience . " What 's it all about ? " I asked Katsumi , indicating the weepingwomen . " The lovers , " she said quietly , pointing to the now barren stage . " At last they found happiness . " " They 're dead , " Joe said . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to our canal I became hurtingly aware that there would always be many parts of Japan that Joe Kelly and I could never penetrate . " What happened back there ? " I asked Joe . All I saw was a bunch of dolls and a man shouting . " The little guy laughed as if he had n't anything to worry about and said , " Every three weeks Katsumi-san breaks down into sobbin ' fits . You 'd think her heart had broken . Used to scare me sick . Then I found out what was cookin ' . First time it was an ex-army general who shot himself because he was charged with stealin ' government money . Katsumi said it was so beautiful she had to cry . Next time it was a geisha from Kyoto . Cut her throat . That was especially lovely . " Hana-ogi heard me laugh and turned sharply . I expected her to upbraid me but instead she took my hand and sniffled . " You not understand , " she said . " To have courage . To have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathway leading to our canal , conversation was broken by a substantial commotion . We heard voices crying and hurried to our own alley in time to see the launchingof a magnificent display of fireworks . " Ah ! " Hana-ogi whispered . " I forget . Tanabata ! " And long after the fireworks had ceased the people of our alley stood staring up at the stars . In Japanese Hana-ogi explained : " Vega , the princess star , fell in love with Altair , the herdboy star . Unlike Ameri/can fairy stories , the herdboy married the princess without any trouble ; then like our stories , he loved his wife so much that he allowed his sheep to stray so that the king threw him onto the other side of the Milky Way river . Once each year in July he swims the river and makes love with his princess . For the people of Japan this Tanabata is the night of love . " But Hana-ogi and I as we spread our bed roll reasoned that we had two more nights to spend together , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lay side by side listening to the exquisite sounds of the Japanese night . The old blind man who massaged sore muscles and burned moxa powder on nerves to make them well passed along our alley , sounding his melancholy flute and tapping with his gnarled cane . For a while there was silence . Then we could hear Watanabe-san coming home from his pachinko game with his wife snapping at his heels . Hana-ogi snuggled close to me and said , rAll time we never fight , " but I touched the trivial scar beneath her sideburns and asked , " What about the time I wanted you to become American ? " Then she grew somber and said , " Because I know you , now I better Japanese . You better American . " Then I almost broke down . I wanted to lose myself in her love and confess , " I ca n't live without you , Hanayo-chan . God , I can not face the lonely world withoutyour tenderness . " But I knew that we had two more nights to spend together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the next nights might be unbearable . I choked once and buried my face against hers , feeling her Japanese eyes against my lips , her black Japanese hair against my face .. " Oh , darling , " I whispered , " why ca n't you marry me ? " She clasped her arms about me as she had done that first night in the woods by the Shinto shrine and said , " Some people never love anyone . " ( She said it : " Rots peopre nebber rubp226nobody . " ) " Oh , Rroyd-san , I love you till my feet are old for dancing  --  till my teeth break off same like Hana-ogi 's . " I thought I could not bear this but then came the sweetest night sound I have ever heard , the soft passage of the noodle vendor , pushing his belled cart while he played a rhythmic melody upon his flute . All through the night the noodle men passed through the streets of Osaka sounding their lovely melody . Some used five running notes ending in a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random notes and a few , whom you came to remember and cherish , played songs that might have been termed love songs , for they seemed always to come by when you were sleeping with the girl who shared your bed roll on the tatami . For the rest of this night , as I recall , Hana-ogi did n't even place her arm across my body and although it seems ridiculous this is what we said . I asked , " Do n't you think we ought to take Joe and Katsumi to dinner tomorrow ? " She replied , " No , I think we should . " " Damn it , Hanayo , will you explain once more why you say , No , we should , ' and Yes , we should n't . " Patiently she went over it again . " In Japanese polite to say that way . If you speak no to me , I say no to agree with you . " " I still do n't get it . " " Ask me a question . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not marry you . " " But what I asked was , Do n't you want to ? ' " The game stopped for she whispered , " No , no , Rroyd-san . I do want to . " I grumbled , " I ca n't understand either your grammar or your heart . " She placed my hand upon her heart and the delicate goldenp227warmth of her slim body swept over me and she said , " My heart for you takusan , takusan . Remember when you say me that ? " I remembered , and as the sweet song of the noodle vendor echoed down our alley we fell asleep.  |p228If  Monday was peaceful , Tuesday was not . Hana-ogi and I woke about eight-thirty to find that Joe had left for one last appeal to Lt.Col . Craford . Katsumi , sensing that we would want to be alone , went out to lament with friends , so I started a fire and Hana-ogi , wrapped in a sheet , tried to get breakfast , but I kept pulling the sheet away until she finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slidingdoors and let the fire go out . At eleven Hana-ogi dressed for Takarazuka . I tied her obi for her and she insisted that I leave the ends dangling almost to the floor . Taking a few mincing steps she cried , " I maiko girl ! " Then deftly she swept the ends together in a bow , symbolof older girls , and said , " I virgin no more . I married woman . " So far as I can remember those were the last words she said that morning . I watched her go down the alley and all the women in the open-front stores and houses called out to her on that summer morning . She was gone only a few minutes when Joe came back . He was licked . He threw his cap on the floor and asked in final despair , " Ace , what can I do ? " " Take a deep breath , " I said . " Stick it out . They 'll have to change the law . " " In Washington they got fifty senators like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I le looked wild-eyed. oe ! Ease up . " How can I ? Ace , I 'm a no-good punk . If Igo home without Katsumi it 's pool halls and hamburger joints . I could n't take it . " For a while you have to . " He sat down cross-legged on the tatami and said grimly , " In Chicago I killed a man . A mixed-up affair  --  not all my fault . They could n't pin anything on me . I 'm not apologizin ' , because  it could just as well have been my fault . Because I was no damn good . And if I lose Katsumi I 'll be no damn good again . I knew there was something I ought to say , some standard word of courage , but I could n't think of any . Joe said , " A guy like you , from a good home  --  you would n't understand . For the first time in my life I 'm livin ' . At night when I hear Katsumi come up the alley shufflin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , little pillow next to mine  --  when I see the plain goddamn goodness in that girl . . . " He looked down at the tatami and I guessed that he had tears in his throat . I wanted to say that I knew but I was tied up . " Joe , promise me you wo n't get into trouble with Col. Craford . " He looked up at me as if Craford were already dead . " Him ? " he sniffed . " The only time I believe in God is when I think of that fat slob . God must be keepin ' score on bastards like that . Otherwise nothin ' makes sense . " I said , " Remember , Joe . You promised you 'd make no trouble with that . . . " I searched for a name and suddenly the total misery of Joe 's problem rose in my mouth like bile . I grew purple and cursed Craford for several minutes . I cursed my father and General Webster and Mrs. Webster and every convention that made it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was still quivering with accumulatedfury . Joe looked up at me and said , " Thanks , Major . I thought you felt that way . " I was still shaking . I said , " Even so I believe things 'll work out . " He said , " I do n't . " There was nothing to add . He knew how I felt . He knew I was with him . Maybe I had steered him away from some hot-brained mistake . That 's the best I could hope , so I went over to Itami to clear out my desk and borrow Mike Bailey 's car , but as I left the air base for the theater , where I was to see the last performance of Swing Butterfly , I had a disgusting experience which even at the time seemed to me a premonitionof tragedy . Outside the main gate of the air base at Itami a broad road stretched for more than half a mile . It was filled with cheap dance halls , beer joints , razzle-dazzle dives and plain whore houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and the stretch was known as " The 1,000 Yard Dash . " It was claimed that any American in uniform who could negotiate this honky-tonk strip and keep his pants on would receive a prize of $i , 000 for heroism beyond the call of duty . As I drove out of the air base for the last time I saw the frowsy halls : " Village Bar , " " Club Little Man , " " The Flying Bull , " and " Air Force Heaven . " Then , to my disgust , my car stalled and three girls promptly surrounded it . One climbed in and said , " O.K. General . Where we off to ? " Immediately an M.P . appeared and hauled the girl back onto the strip and gave me some brotherly warning , " Watch out for her , Major . She 's no good . " He saluted and pointed to a saloon up the stretch , " If you want something real nice , Major , you can trust the girls at the Silver Dollar . ' "  |p231When  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other direction had come a Packard from 7'oneyam,1 1 Ieis ; Irts , the nearby residential district where the big brass lived , ; 111 ( 1 in it were two colonels ' wives who knew me . They watched with disgust as the three persistent little street girls started to climb back into my car as soon as the M.P . had left . Aschucked them out I thought that some day in the future I would recall Hana-ogi and I would have to speak her name to someone and if he had been at Itami he would remember " The 1,000 Yard Dash " and the brassy prostitutes and he would wink at me and say , " Boy , do I know those Jap girls ? " But he would n't know , and nothing I could ever tell anyone who had seen Itami would explain Hana-ogi . I shivered at the wheel of my car and mumbled , " All this should have happenedfifty years from now . Then maybe there would have been a chance . In my day there was no chance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . Junior officers would boast , " You can say that General Gruver looks tough and formal but did you know that when he served in Japan he ran off with a geisha girl ? Yep , took her right out of a house . " But they would never know . However , the distaste of this experience along the strip was expelled by Hana-ogi 's exquisite performance . When I had first seen her I had been insulted by her burlesque of Americansand I had been unable to appreciate her ability . Now my reaction was different , for I discovered that even against my will I had to laugh at her lampoon of Americans . The reason was simple . She had studied with intimate care my mannerismsand now reproduced them in burlesque form . When she lit a cigarette she mimicked me , when she propositioned Madame Butterfly it was me trying to kiss her on the Bitchibashi . This time I , more than anyone else in the audience , enjoyed her burlesque of Americans.  |p232As  her big dance number approached I became apprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull her Japanese touch , but I was wrong , for in her samurai there was now a freedom and swagger that no maiko girl , as Hana-ogi termed the virgin dancers , could have created . Hanaogiwas the artist . Even more than mistress or wife , she was an artist , and if her American jitterbugging was more hilariousfor having studied an American at close hand , her Japaneseclassical dance was stronger for having known that Americannot as a subject for study but as a lover  --  as one who cried eagerly to marry her . I understood what she had said the night before . She was now a better Japanese . When intermission came I wanted to rush backstage and embrace her and tell her that no matter if she lived a million years cooped up at Takarazuka , I would be with her every time she danced  --  but I was not to see her , for I could not get into the dressing-rooms.  |p233CPL  . SHARKEY : " YOU damned Buddha-heads , you got ta stand back from the door . " So the rapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching Hana-ogi perform was never reported to her , for as I took my seat at the beginning of Act II an M.P . came up to me and asked , " Major Gruver ? " " Yes . " " You 'll have to come with us . " The curtain had not yet risen , so Hana-ogi did not see me leave and I was grateful for that , for I was trembling . I thought that Lt.Col . Craford was shipping me home early , but when I got outside and I saw two other M.P . ' s with guns I asked , " What 's up ? " " Airman Kelly , " they said . Joe ? " . " Yep . Deserted . " " Impossible . I saw him this morning . " " We know . We thought you might tell us . . . " Another M.P . broke in and said , " Ile was called special at 1300 . He was scheduled to fly out tomorrow but a special plane came through and Col. Craford said , Get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I checked him in at the airport at 1250 but before the plane took off he beat it . " " We figured you might know where he is . " " No ! Last time I saw Kelly . . . "  | " When was the last time ? " " About 0815 . No ! It was 112o . " You know where he lives ? " " Sure . " I had a dry ugly taste in my mouth as the siren wailed into Osaka . At Itami I asked , " Did the plane take off ? " " Yep . It 's desertion . " I began to sweat . Now Joe Kelly was really done for . Insubordinationand desertion would be the charge and he might never get Katsumi into the States , so I asked , " Jesus , are you sure he deserted ? " " I checked him in . Sharkey saw him leave . " We stopped at the canal and I led the way to the alley , where two M.P . ' s tried the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to break the freshly mended paper , but at that moment it seemed like my house and I did n't want the paper broken , so I said , " Maybe a chair 's against it . I 'll use the window . " One M.P . came with me to the back of the house while I forced open a window and started to crawl in . While my leg was still suspended I saw Joe . He was on the floor with his head blown apart by a .45 . Across him , obviously having died later , lay Katsumi with a kitchen knife plunged completely through her neck . For a moment I did n't call out or anything . All I could do was look at the floor  --  at the two lovers who had needed each other so much . The M.P . came up and looked over my shoulder . Then he called loudly , " You better break the door down , Sharkey . " I watched the frail doors bend and break . I heard the clatter of wood and the tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often come at dusk , dropping her silken packages on the floor , were gone . Sharkey took one look andp235said , " Get the camera . You wan na catch this just as it hap-pened . " Sharkey barked to the man at my shoulder , " Eddie , you inform the Jap police . " Then he saw me and said , " We 'll need you here , Major . " I got down out of the window and walked around to the front of the house where a crowd had gathered and where children were screaming the tragedy across the canal to other children . An old man pried his way in through the broken doors and came out to report accurately upon the double suicide . I was numb with helpless anger . Of all the people in the world , Joe and Katsumi Kelly should have been protected and kept alive . I thought of them laughing and helping each other and I got all sick inside , but then I thought of Hana-ogi , who would be coming home soon and I grew panicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like mad . And then I saw , on the outskirts of the crowd , two of the little prostitutes Hana-ogi and I had met the other night . They were already working the main streets and had stopped by to witness the tragedy . I said to them , " You remember Hana-ogi ? " " Sure , Major . " " You watch up there . Tell her to go back . Please . " " Sure , Major . You got cigarette ? " The other girl pointed to the house and jabbed herself in the stomach as if with a knife . " They kill ? " I nodded and they stared at the house with grim fascination . " Japanese girl and G.I. ? " I said yes and the little girls moved toward the head of the canal where they could intercept Hana-ogi while the reporters swarmed at me . They were bright young men , most of whomp236spoke English , and I had enough sense to keep my mouth shut , for if I had said anything at all I would have blurted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he insisted upon staying in Japan . " Finally I composed myself and said , " He was with my outfit in Korea . This is a complete shock . " The reporters saw somebody else and swarmed away but one stayed and asked , " Are n't you Ace Gruver ? " I nodded . " You the one living with Hana-ogi ? " I wanted to shoot him dead but everything had collapsed now , so I nodded grimly and he pointed up the canal . There at last she was , Hana-ogi . Late afternoon sun played upon her tousled black hair and illuminated the fall of her kimono . With eager pin-toed steps she hurried along the canal , coming so close that I could see the slant of her adorable eyes and that sweet mouth always ready with a teasing smile . The two prostitutes stopped her , informed her of the suicides and tried to prevent her from joining the crowd . She ignored them and started coming toward me down the canal bank but the newspaperman who was standing with me broke away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the crowd searching for me , and when she failed to find me she broke away from the guardian prostitutes and the warning newspapermanto fight her way resolutely toward the very spot where the police waited . In that moment I could see the reckless collapse of her world and instinctively a shout rose to my lips . I called in panic , " Lo , the postillion ! " She stopped . The smile that had crept upon the edge of her lips vanished and her lovely face once more became an impersonal mask . Standing on tiptoe , she peered across the crowd , still seeking me , but I hid myself so that she would have to go back . After a moment she turned away from thep237crowds that shoved toward the suicide house and T l.tst .. 1w her moving with extraordinary grace back to the 111.1111 . tteel The summer breeze , drifting down the canal , tti ; ( . d . t het kimono and twilight rested on her hair . I can still see t 1 u  --  f ( ) Id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved 1 ) ( 11 Ind a pillar and I never saw her again . For just as I started to run after her , Lt.Col . Cl af t l waddled up and he seemed almost to relish the tragedy . It proved he was right and that guys like Kelly were no damned good . He saw me and lurched over to repeat his warning that he was shipping me . . . " You bastard ! " I cried . " You stinking bastard ! " He jumped back as if I had kicked him and began to bluster but I could n't take any more . " You swine ! Kelly told me what you said to him , you bastard ! You killed this kid ! " He was astonished at my outburst and suddenly became aware that if I was really outraged I might carry the fight to my father , so he tried to pacify me , but I said , " Do n't be afraid of me , you dirty bastard . I 'm not going to squeal on you  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese police official said , " You come with me , " and for three hours while I ached to seek out HanaogiI had to answer questions and fill out reports as to the death of Katsumi-san . It was after ten o'clock when I was released and I caught a cab whose driver gasped when I said Takarazuka , but he drove me there and at eleven that Sunday night I hurried past the cryptomerias and into the dormitory where Hana-ogi lived . Apparently I was expected , for old Teruko-san and her grimfacedinterpreter were waiting for me . " Hana-ogi-san is not here , " they said firmly . " I know she 's here ! " I cried . " Hana-ogi-san is on her way to Tokyo . "  | " She ca n't be ! I saw her ! " " Please , Major Gruver . Hana-ogi-san is not here . " Unthinkingly , I forced my way past the two women and along the corridor on which Hana-ogi lived . The Takarazuka girls peered at me as I stormed past , then sighed when I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little things that made it hers were gone . From the next room Fumiko-san appeared and said , weeping , " Hana-ogi-san really go , Major . " I turned around like a madman . It could n't end this way  --  across a canal , over the heads of a hundred people at the scene of a suicide and Hana-ogi departs forever . " She 's here ! " I insisted . I stood helpless and then saw in one corner of her room a zori that she had forgotten . I stepped across the tatami on tiptoeas if she were still there , reproving me for not having removed my shoes , and I lifted the zori and it seemed as if her powerful , inspired foot were there in my hand , with the big toe clinging to the zori strap and the Japanese music beginning and the samurai dance about to start and Hana-ogi . . . oh , Hana-ogi .. . " Hanayo-chan ! " I shouted . " Hanayo-chan ! Where are you ? " From their doors the beautiful Takarazuka girls stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I screamed , " Hana-ogi , do n't leave me . " Then I felt Fumiko-san put her hand on my shoulder . " You go now , Rroyd-san . Is no more . " And she led me to the roadway.  |p239GENERAL  WEBSTER : " Whatevermakes you a better man makes you a better husband . " General Webster called me in to Kobe next day and said , " That was a dreadful affair last night in Osaka . " He asked me if I had heard any rumors that Lt.Col . Craford had handled the affair badly . I wanted to put a blast on the fat blubber-gut who had murdered Kelly , but something old and powerful insideme argued , " Why start a military mess ? " and I kept my mouth shut . Then I shrugged my shoulders and said , " I guess Craford handled it O.K. " But immediately I knew that I was reverting to the man I had been when I first argued with Kelly against marrying a Japanese girl . I was defending the Army against the man and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for General Webster said gruffly , " Lloyd , do n't take this so bitterly . Kelly 's dead . Nobody can do anything about it . You told me yourself he was a dead-end punk  --  beyond saving . " I looked at the general . A man under his command had committed suicide rather than return to the United States and he was shrugging it off . I asked , " What about that colonel in Tokyo who shot himself rather than leave his Japanese girl ? Or the major in Yokohama ? Were they punks ? " " Yes ! They were second-class men . I 've seen reports on seven such suicides and they were all shoddy material . First-class men sometimes fall in love with native girls , of course they do . Butp240they get over it . They forget the girls and they go home . They go back to work . " " Damn it ! " I shouted . " Why do men like you and my father call them native girls ? Ca n't you believe . . . " General Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow paper into my hand . " I suppose a young man 's no good if he does n't have the guts to fight for what he thinks is right , " he said . " You 've had the courage to fight for Joe Kelly and his native girl . It was gallant , Lloyd , but it was n't necessary . Read it . " The yellow paper was from Washington and it said a law was being passed to permit men like Joe Kelly to bring their Japanese wives into the States . " Now they do it ! " I cried . " They were doing it all along , " Webster said . " Everyone knew the old law was bad . " I thought of Joe and Katsumi lying in blood and I felt sick . I had to see Hana-ogi . In all the world she was the only person who could help me now . My heart and my mind cried out for her . " Sir , " I blurted , " I 've got to get to Tokyo . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't care what happens . I 've got to see Hana-ogi . " The general winced as I used the strange name , then said calmly , " If you disobey another order . . . " " All right , I 'll leave the Air Force . I 'll get a ... " I expected General Webster to hit the roof , but when he 's away from his wife he is n't so bad . He said , " Sit down , Lloyd . I 'm not going to throw my weight at you . You 're being a stupid idiot and we both know it , but you come by it naturally . " " What do you mean ? " This seems like 1924 . " " I do n't understand , " I said dully . " Your father was mixed up with a girl  --  the one I told you about . There was one member of our class you 've never met.  |p241Cha|p  named Charley Scales . I Ie had a chance in ' 24 to drop out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So your father decided to marry the girl and chuck the Army and go along with Charley , but some of us saner fellows talked him out of it . Must run in your family . " " My father was going to leave the Army ? " " Yep . He was all broken up . " General Webster laughed and scratched his chin . " I remember that we were quite sorry for him . We thought he was pretty weak to be broken up like that over a waitress . Look at him now . " I said , " I think he made a mistake in 1924 . " General Webster breathed a sigh of relief and said , " So do I , but I guess any man has a right to get mixed up with a waitress once . . . " " I do n't mean that . I mean he probably should have married the waitress . " " Lloyd ! Your father a Chevrolet salesman ! " " I mean he should never have married my mother . They 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a great general . " " I think he 's made a mess of his life . " General Webster got mad . " You think ! Who in hell are you to think ? Only a few men in any generation can be great generals . Do n't you forget it ! " I said , " I still want to marry this girl . " " Son , " General Webster said , " the Supervisor of Takarazukaand I stayed up late last night figuring how to keep his outfit and mine free of bad publicity over the suicides . We protected ourselves and we ca n't let you ruin things . " " At least give me a chance to say good-bye to her ! " " No , she herself wanted it this way . " " She did n't ! " " I saw her . She said to send you back to America . "  |p242I  said , " I do n't believe that . " So he handed me a letter which had been written two days before . I knew because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it I could hear her gentle voice groping its way through my language : Darring , Pretty soon ( That was a phrase I used a lot . . . ) our rest night . I Tokyo go . You America go . ( A passage was scratched out , then ... ) I not think fire die . Frame not go out . I think you many times . ( Then she added a passage from her phrase book . . . ) Ever your devoted and humble servant , and the letter was signed with the Chinese characters representingher name . How strange they were , those characters , how beautiful , how deeply hidden from me behind the wall of Asia ! I wanted to fling myself upon the floor and weep as Hanaogimight have wept had we been at home , but instead there came to me that sad and final Japanese word which she had refused to teach me : " Sayonara , Hana-ogi . Sayonara , you beautiful dancer . You 've chosen the tough way . I hope your gods give you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . Forgive me that I once thought you too ugly to kiss . You ca n't know it now but I fought my way through four M.P . ' s to kiss you good-bye and fat Col. Craford shuddered . Oh , Katsumi , sayonara . And Goddamn it , Sukoshi Joe , you died too soon . They 're passing a law right now to let guys like you bring your wives home . It was a good fight that night until I fainted . Sayonara , Sukoshi Joe . You did it too soon . To the alley and the canal and the little houses and the pachinko parlor and to the flutes at night  --  sayonara . And you ,  |p243Ja|pan  , you crowded islands , you tragic land  --  sayonara , you enemy , you friend . " But even as I said these words I knew that I had to put them out of mind , for I was forced to acknowledge that I lived in an age when the only honorable profession was soldiering , when the only acceptable attitude toward strange lands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. lLike the voice of my own conscience I heard , as from a great distance , General Webster saying , " Pull yourself together , son . Whatever makes you a better man makes you a better officer . " I looked up and said , " What ? " " I ought n't to tell you this , Lloyd , because it is n't official yet . But as soon as you get back to Randolph Field they 're making you a lieutenant-colonel . " Instinctively I saluted . The general said , " We 'd better move along . Eileen wants to drive us to the airport . "
