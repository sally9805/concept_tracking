Onetime Interior Secretary Harold Ickes had the venom of a John Adams and the gossipy nature of a Gideon Welles , but , unlike those famed governmental diarists , he lacked the sense of standing witness to history in the making . Harold Ickes was primarily interested in great events in so far as they soothed or ruffled Harold Ickes . Nevertheless , The Lowering Clouds ( Simon &; Schuster ; $6 ) , third published volume of Ickes ' sometimes fascinating diary , does make a contribution to historical accuracy : it should go far to correct the deep public impression that Harold Ickes was a lovable and forth right " old curmudgeon . " He reveals himself as a devious old egotist . <P> In point of time , The Lowering Clouds covers the two momentous years leading up to Pearl Harbor , yet Ickes was largely concerned with his efforts to achieve " the real ambition of my public service . " That ambition was to effect the transfer of the Forest Service from the Agriculture Department to Interior . " If Forestry is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am a bankrupt intellectually and emotionally , and I undoubtedly will resign . " His wife , Jane Dahlman Ickes , thought that " I ought not to resign in any event because , as she sees it I am too valuable to the country in this time of crisis . However , I regard this as the overestimation that a sweet wife who is in love is likely to place upon her husband 's activities and importance . " So , when the Forestry transfer was not approved , Ickes sent President Roosevelt a letter of resignation-neither for the first nor the last time . The President replied : " We-you &; I-were married ' for better , for worse ' - and it 's too late to get a divorce &; too late for you to walk out of the home%#151 ; anyway . I need " you ! Nuff said . " Ickes confided to his diary : " It is pretty difficult to do anything with a man who can write such a letter . " Ickes stayed on . <P> The Hobbyists . Harold Ickes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Douglas collected new poker-type games to name for his Supreme Court colleagues ( one was called " Bushy " after bearded Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes ) . Aside from Forestry , for example , Ickes made a grab for power over TVA , and when TVA Administrator David Lilienthal protested , Ickes wrote : " He is the type that wants his own little stick of candy to suck in the corner without anyone 's being allowed to go anywhere near him . " When a Roosevelt order deprived Ickes of some of his precious agencies , Ickes moaned : " I really believe that I am better physically when I am overworked . Ever since the President took PWA and other agencies away from me , I have felt a distinct loss in energy and initiative . " <P>
