Over the past few years , few contract negotiations in U.S. industry have been as bitter and bumpy as those between General Electric Co. and the C.I.O. 's International Union of Electrical Workers . With out fail , the I.U.E. 's trigger-tempered Boss James B. Carey peppered the company with shouts of " chiseling , " called its offers a " sham " and " an obvious trap . " Once , in a crescendo of rage , he bellowed that G.E . was an " aid and ally " of the Communists . Usually G.E . ' s negotiator , Vice President Lemuel P. Boulware , gave every bit as good as he got . <P> This year the script was totally rewritten . After a month of calm discussion , G.E . and the union signed a new five-year contract that made everyone happy . Cooed G.E . ' s Boulware : " A splendid settlement . " Echoed I.U.E. 's Carey : " A splendid settlement . " <P> To write the new pact , both G.E . and the union had given ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage like the one the auto workers got , the union quickly gave in when G.E . turned the idea down cold . In turn , the company agreed to a hefty $100 million package that would raise the average hourly pay for 100,000 I.U.E. workers by 34 over the next five years , give them what amounts to another 10 in fringe benefits . <P> Under the new contract , G.E . will give workers a 3% wage increase every year for five years , tack on an additional 1 per hour during the last two years , to boost the hourly average to $2.27 by 1960 . Beyond that , the company agreed to a cost-of-living formula Bunder which workers will get more pay if living costs go up , but take no cut if prices go down . It agreed to a new life-insurance plan equal to twice the amount of each worker 's annual pay , and to three days ' leave with pay in case of death in a worker 's family . Another benefit : a new form of " catastrophe " medical insurance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15,000 to care for a disabled worker . <P> As a final fillip to good relations , G.E . said it would reopen its contract at the end of three years for a 30-day review of the guaranteed annual wage . G.E . announced that it would undoubtedly still oppose the idea , but would be glad to sit down and talk in a spirit of mutual cooperation . Said G.E . ' s Boulware : " We are maturing into a kind of relationship that people ought to have . After all , we are dealing with a $1.2 billion payroll that affects 500,000 people . This is serious and it ought to be handled in a businesslike way . "
