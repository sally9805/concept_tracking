In their campaign to keep U.S. missiles out of Western Europe , the Communists have loudly insisted that Soviet intermediate-range missiles are all kept at home in the Soviet Union and not up on Western Europe 's frontiers . When Norwegian Foreign Minister Halvard Lange told his Parliament a fortnight ago that there are Soviet rocket-launching bases in East Germany , Poland and Czechoslovakia , a Soviet spokesman screamed , " That 's a lie ! " , and in the three satellite capitals , local Communists echoed the denials piously . But last week the West German government intelligence service backed up Lange 's charge , and other Western and neutral officials helped fill in some of the details : <P> From the East German island of Rgen in the Baltic Sea to the Rhodope Mountains near the Bulgarian-Greek border 1,000 miles away , Russia has built a snakelike chain of at least 14 missile-launching bases in six satellite countries . <P> The big base southwest of Liberec , near the Czech-Polish border , is believed to be the operations center for all the bases . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltic Sea resort of Kolobrzeg , one in Hungary near Lake Balaton , two in Rumania , three in Bulgaria , two in East Germany ( one , near Erfurt , is 150 miles from Bonn , 400 miles from Paris , 450 miles from London ) . <P> All of the bases are equipped not only with short-range missiles but with the Soviet T-2 IRBM , a two-stage liquid-fueled missile of 75 to 85 tons that can hurl a nuclear warhead from 1,200 to 1,800 miles , depending , says one Pentagon wit , " on how easy you scare . " <P> Red army patrols keep the local population away from the bases , pick up and lengthily question anyone who ventures too near . Originally , the bases were supplied with Russian weapons , but in recent months , intelligence reports say , three arms plants ( two at Bohumin , one at Snina ) have gone into rocket production in Czechoslovakia .
