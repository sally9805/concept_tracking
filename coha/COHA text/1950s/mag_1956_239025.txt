Steelworker Chief David McDonald bounced into a Washington cocktail party one afternoon last week in an angry mood . He told listeners that the steel companies had welcomed the strike of the 650,000 steelworkers as a chance to work off heavy steel inventories , and concluded : " If that 's the kind of game they 're going to play , I think I 'll keep the men out after the inventories are exhausted . " <P> If McDonald kept his impetuous threat , the strike might last another month , possibly longer . Last week Steel magazine reported that most companies had at least a 30-day inventory on hand , with Detroit , the biggest user , holding enough steel to complete the 1956-model run and make a slight start in 1957 . So far , most of the steel-using industries seemed to be feeling little pain . Steel warehousemen jacked their prices $5 to $12 a ton but reported no appreciable run on stocks . <P> Here and there , however , the strike was hurting . Some 40,000 soft-coal miners , returning to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furloughed ; with haulage revenues off as much as 75% in some instances , railroads slashed their work force heavily . The Pennsylvania not only laid off 18,000 men but cut nonunion wages 10% from the president on down . Rail-equipment makers began slowing down , with Westinghouse Air Brake and Pullman-Standard scheduling layoffs . Builders and oil companies , which had been fighting for steel even when the mills were operating , began cutting production schedules . Dallas ' Magnolia Petroleum planned to slash drilling starts 75% in the next few weeks . <P> Toward week 's end , prodded by Federal Mediator Joseph Finnegan , the two sides met in the same room for the first time in twelve days since the strike started , emerged after two hours with no signs of progress . McDonald announced he would no longer pose for pictures* with management representatives . Said he : " I do n't want anybody to get false illusions . " <P> <P> * He also banned pictures showing him smoking a pipe . A " down-East " organization had written accusing him , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " demoralizing the youth of the nation . " Said McDonald : " This pains me greatly . "
