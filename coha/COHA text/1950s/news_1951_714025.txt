txt The spate of gloom that has been flowing over us from the Middle East would be enough to depress Pollyanna . From the Vale of Kashmir to the Moroccan coast the news is bad . The Indian-Pakistani quarrel , Iranian oil , assassinations in the Near East , Egypt 's flouting of the Suez Canal convention , the demands of the Sultan of Morocco for more autonomy , communism , nationalism , social unrest , poverty , xenophobia  --  one looks in vain for some light and cheer . A. good , if slangy , American reaction ought to be : " So what ? " Is the United States figuratively to throw up its hands in despair and retire to its Atlantic Gibraltar ? That would hardly be the reaction of a world Power . The Middle East means too much . It is the crossroads of the world ; it has half of the world 's proved oil reserves ; it contains about 150,000,000 people without counting India and Pakistan ; it is the center and heart of Mohammedanism , whose followers stretch through Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism or to chaos would be a tremendous defeat for the democratic West and an equally great victory for the Communist East . A great Power like the United States would hardly be worthy of its role if It accepted such a defeat as inevitable . The dangers and difficulties in the Middle East are a challenge , and one that we must meet . The strength that the United States possesses , economically and militarily , provides , to begin with , strong bases for activity . It stands to reason that the plea which George , Assistant Secretary of State , made to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Friday on behalf of the Administration 's foreign aid bill ought to be answered in the affirmative . $540,000,000 is slated for military and economic aid to the Middle East . Every dollar of that could be a valuable investment , The military weakness of the Arab states is one reason for the lack of security and the fear of communism in the Middle East . The immense poverty of the vast majority of the people provides another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way to counteract the prevailing ill feeling toward America . We have to recognize and understand the depth and intensity of that feeling if we are to make any progress in the Middle East . Virtually every observer and traveler to that region testifies to an anti-American sentiment that we can not deny or ignore . Needless to say , this is part and parcel with the longer-standing and even more virulent attitude toward Britain . It is natural that the British , with their long history of domination in that area , should have to bear the brunt of the universal xenophobia . However , India has provided both our countries with evidence of the possibility of overcoming hatred born of nationalism . Once independence was granted , India and Pakistan became friendly to Britain and are now members of the Commonwealth . Our gesture in arranging for wheat shipments to India has , by all accounts , brought about a notable surge of friendliness toward the United States . Our prestige in Iran remains high , even during the present emotional crisis . There are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is hopeless , where we can not swing the balance , where judicious help and friendliness will not be rewarded . The chief problem in the Middle East is , of course , the hostility engendered by American aid in the creation of Israel . And the hard core of that problem is the existence of 900,000 hopeless , helpless , miserable Arab refugees from Palestine . Much will depend on how that specific difficulty is handled . It is planned to allocate $50,000,000 from the Truman aid bill for that purpose , which will be a good start . The Middle East is one front in the " cold war " where things may well get worse before they get better . But there is certainly no necessity for retreat in present circumstances . The campaign must and should be conducted in cooperation with the British , whose established position and long experience in the region make them valued and indispensable allies . There is no need to be downhearted . We have hardly begun to fight .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
