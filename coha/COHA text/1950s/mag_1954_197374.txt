To the casual passerby , everything looked normal around the University of Maryland 's treeless new Georgian campus at College Park last week . Fall classes had yet to begin , but in Byrd Stadium , Football Coach Jim Tatum ran his 54-man squad ( Pennsylvania mining and mill-town boys outnumber the 19 home-state boys ) through first practice with high hopes of repeating his undefeated 1953 season . But across campus , in an ornate , walnut-paneled office , the U. of M. 's new president , Wilson Homer Elkins , 46 , held his first press conference . Said he casually : " I do n't think that a university can continue on top , year after year , in football and not impair its educational program . " <P> Trim , stocky Wilson Elkins could hardly have found a better way to emphasize that Maryland is under new management . His predecessor , Harry ( " Curly " ) Byrd , was a onetime Maryland coach ( 1913-34 ) who had set out after World War II , with alumni support , to get Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years , he talked legislators into ever greater appropriations for the University of Maryland , and paid them in a current coin : football victories . When he resigned last January , after 18 years as U. of M. president , to run for governor on the Democratic ticket , Curly Byrd 's football team ( in five years , 43 victories , six defeats ) was the nation 's best . The university had been transformed from a small agricultural school into a sprawling , Midwestern-style campus with 25,000 students , a host of professional schools and thriving branches ( for the armed forces ) on four continents . <P> But in building Maryland 's great football teams and physical plant ( e.g. , a $375,000 hen house for poultry students , the $1,000,000 Byrd Stadium ) , Booster Byrd did little for the U. of M. 's reputation as an incubator of academic learning . Most scholars gave Maryland a wide berth , and of last year 's 2,045 graduates , only 373 received degrees in the arts and sciences . <P> President Elkins is determined to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star quarterback at the University of Texas and a onetime Rhodes Scholar , he came to Maryland after five years as president of Texas Western College ( 2,900 students ) . Well aware of Curly Byrd 's " enviable contributions , " he has no intention of plowing under the football team , concedes realistically that to attain distinction , a university needs endowment , and good football teams stimulate endowment giving . But in putting the accent on " distinction , " he plans " a strong academic program , " library expansion , and increased discussion of controversial subjects in the classroom . A Phi Beta Kappa himself , he also has a special goal : to raise Maryland 's academic standing so that , like more than 150 other colleges and universities , it will be qualified to award Phi Beta Kappa keys . <P> Maryland was not alone in plotting new directions . Last week the University of Chicago , which has long given short shrift to teacher training , announced that teachers , and students preparing to teach , would henceforth only have to pay half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
