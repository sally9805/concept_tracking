Grinning widely , James Riddle Hoffa , 44 , president-elect of the Teamsters Union , hopped out of a Manhattan federal courtroom one day last week , grabbed the telephone and called his wife in Detroit . The good news from Jimmy : a jury , after a four-week trial , failed to agree on whether Hoffa was guilty of conspiring to tap telephones illegally in his Detroit headquarters between 1953 and 1957 . <P> This brush with the law was mighty close . The jury ( seven men , five women ) voted 11 to 1 for conviction . Juror Earle T. MacHardy , a suburban sugar buyer who had said on selection that his firm 's dealings with the Teamsters Union would not affect the impartiality of his verdict , held out adamantly for acquittal . His reason : the U.S. Government had failed to make its circumstantial evidence stick . Though Jimmy was free to go ( on $2,500 bond ) , he was by no means out of the courtroom woods . Ahead lie : 1 ) outcome of a suit by 13 rank-and-file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the union last Oct. 4 , 2 ) disposition of a federal perjury indictment , 3 ) the certainty that the Government will take him to trial again on the conspiracy charge .
