Michigan 's Republican Senator Charles Potter , up for 1958 re-election in an intensely civil-rights-conscious state , last week added his name to the brief list of Senators who will fight for a filibuster-busting rules change in the opening days of the 85th Congress . The attempt is foredoomed , and has diverted attention from a significant fact : there is a real possibility that in 1957 the Senate , its rules unchanged , and the House of Representatives will enact the first major civil-rights legislation since Reconstruction . <P> The 1956 elections , which saw more Negroes voting Republican than at any time in two decades , convinced Northern and Western Democrats that they must start paying more than lip service to civil rights . The elections also encouraged Republicans to try even harder for the Negro 's vote . Result : at least 70 Senators and a healthy House majority are determined to pass a civil-rights bill . In the face of such strength , the Southern leaders of Congress , who pride themselves on recognizing ( and facing ) reality , are prepared to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in committee , they will probably let Congress get it out of the way early so that the 85th can move on to other business . Most likely form of the legislation : a moderate bill setting up a federal civil-rights commission-but possibly without the subpoena power that the Administration has requested and which congressional Southerners have violently opposed .
