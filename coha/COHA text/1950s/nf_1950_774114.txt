txt  | mean by this ? Since they can not be referring , except erroneously , to the merits of the language itself , they must have something else in mind . What they have in mind is quite clear : the literature of the period . From a literary viewpoint , Elizabethan England was very great ; and we often carry over our notion about this literary merit into our views on the merits of the language . What justification is there for such a carry-over ? None . Literature and language are two separate things , and the study and judgment of the two is quite independent . Of course , literature does not exist without language , since language is the medium of literary expression , just as paint is the medium of oil painting , or stone or clay is the medium of sculpture . But nobody would dream of applying to the chemistry and optics of paint , or the geology of stone and clay , the same measuring-sticks , the same judgments of value , that we apply to the artistic merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had much better stone in the Middle Ages ? look at all the beautiful cathedrals they built . " Likewise , the study and evaluation of language is a thing that has quite different approaches , techniques and conclusions from the judgment of literature as an art . To say that some word or form is better than some other , because Shakespeare or Milton or the King James Bible used it , is like saying that a particular color of red is better because Titian or Rubens used it . It may perhaps be better for getting a particular aesthetic or artistic effect ? that is the creative artist 's or critic 's concern , not ours ; but it is obviously not better from a scientific or practical point of view . The same type of professor who objects to the Italian word for " when " being written as KWAN-do ( see Chapter 3 ) also often objects to leaving literary values out of consideration in studying languages . One of them asked " Is it quite fair to treat a language like French , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly as we treat some little-known tongue of central Africa that has no literary , cultural , or esthetic values , or even a written form ? " . This question shows the same confusion between language and writing that we noticed before ; and it shows the confusion between language and literature that we have just been discussing . It obviously makes no difference in the merit of a language , as a language , whether it has a writing system connected with it ( a " written language " ) or not . Just as obviously , it makes no difference in the merit of a language , as a language , whether it has a literature connected with it or not . When we speak of the literary of cultural " values " of a language , we are really not talking about the language itself at all ; we are talking about the social standing , the prestige , of non-linguistic things such as culture and literature . Literature has no priority over language , and no relevance in determining our approach to language , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely a kind of crow-baited student of literature , but a scientist working independently and in his own right . To paraphrase a sentence of Bernard DeVoto 's , it is a fallacy to assume " that a language may be understood and judged solely by means of its literature , that literature is the highest expression of a language , that literature is the measure of language , and finally that language is subordinate to literature " . Literature , in itself a very valuable thing , is nevertheless not all of life ; literature and language both derive from life as a whole , not life or language from literature . In short , what the earlier state of a language may have been , what a word may have meant or sounded like at any earlier time , or what literature or culture may have been expressed in a language at any time , is quite beside the point when it comes to deciding whether any particular sound , spelling , form , or word is good at present . Purists  | have always been complaining of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their complaints . One such purist , in the earlier part of the seventeenth century , complained bitterly and railed against those who no longer used thou and thee in speaking to one person : " Do not they speak false English , false Latine , false Greek .. . and false to the other Tongues . . . that doth not speak thou to one , what ever he be , Father , Mother , King , or Judge ; is he not a Novice and unmannerly , and an Ideot and a Fool , that speaks You to one , which is not to be spoken to a singular , but to many ? O Vulgar Professors and Teachers , that speaks Plural , when they should Singular . . . . Come you Priests and Professors , have you not learnt your Accidence ? " Of course it did him no good . We now use you to speak to one person or more than one person , and we understand each other just as well and just as badly now as people did in the old times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . To insist on a language standing still , to complain because people no longer obey the rules of the " goode olde tymes " , and to object to supposed " corruption " of the language , is to act like King Canute ordering the waves to recede ? without the good sense of Canute , who ( as the story tells ) knew full well that his orders were futile and silly .  | In Part I , we 've been criticizing existing attitudes and ideas about language fairly strongly , and suggesting that they are not as accurate as they might be , and that because of this inaccuracy of our notions our society not only wastes much effort , but does much actual harm . At this point in the discussion , if anyone makes criticisms like these , there are at least two main questions we ought to ask : 1 ) " By what right do you make these criticisms ? " and 2 ) " What do you propose we should do about our language ? " . These are both very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to answering them , in the order we have just asked them . There are very good reasons , moreover , for taking them up in this order . The second question , what to do about our language , is of a practical order , it is true , and is immediate and pressing , whereas the first is theoretical , and deals with underlying facts and their analysis rather than with the solution of our problems . Yet we must always , before we try to solve a problem , have the necessary facts at our command , and understand how to go about arranging those facts and analyzing them scientifically ; otherwise we can have no guarantee that our solution will be anything other than guess-work . Therefore we should first find out specifically what linguistic science has to tell us with regard to language , and then see how we can apply this new knowledge to the problems that worry us . There is a further reason , in addition to the logical consideration of priority just mentioned , why we should first have a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to now , in general , grammarians and teachers and those who have told others how to talk and what to  | do about their language , have done so on a purely normative basis ? that is , setting up rules or norms and insisting that people follow them . Sometimes the normative grammarian has justified his dicta by appealing to " logic " , sometimes to tradition , and sometimes to just the weight of his own say-so ; but his attitude has always been authoritarian , i.e. depending on the force of authority and not on accurate observation and reasoning . The scientific attitude , on the other hand , rejects normative commands , and tries to base its conclusions on the greatest possible accuracy in observing facts , with the greatest possible objectivity , and on as careful reasoning and analysis as we can apply to the facts at our command . A true scientist also wants others to know as much of the truth as he can find out and make known , so that others also can follow his line of argument and , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has reached . Now if we were to proceed immediately to the linguistician 's recommendations for changing our current ideas and behavior connected with language , we would be skipping an essential step in the process ; and the linguistician , by presenting his findings and his advice without first giving his reasons for so doing , would be converting himself from a scientist into simply another normative grammarian . In this process , there would be no gain ; there is no use of substituting Language Authoritarian No. 2 for Language Authoritarian No. 1 . What we need to do is rather to find out how we can escape entirely from the clutches of authoritarianism of any kind in language , and how we can ourselves acquire the essentials of a scientific attitude , and if we need to or want to , go ahead on our own in studying and thinking about language without being dependent on " authority " . When we want to imagine how things would seem to somebody who could look at us in a wholly objective , scientific way , we often put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " coming to observe the earth and its inhabitants ,  | living among men and studying their existence dispassionately and in its entirety . Such a " man from Mars , or some equally impartial observer , would notice , among the first things he saw in any human group , that its members cooperate by means of signals . They lend each other a hand , literally , in many undertakings , and they are able to exchange the use of all their faculties . We can build skyscrapers and bridges , manoeuver airplanes and battleships , warn each other of coming dangers and tell each other of past happenings , by means of signals . Theoretically , of course , any one of the five senses ? touch , smell , taste , sight or hearing ? could be used to make such signals . But our senses of touch , smell , and taste do not distinguish very clearly or sharply between various feelings , smells or tastes , and our memories for these senses are not as exact as they are for sight or hearing . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , so far as clearness and sharpness of distinction and memory go : we can distinguish a signal that we see , and can remember it , just about as clearly as one that we hear . But hearing has certain advantages over sight , for signalling purposes : we can hear sounds coming from any direction , whereas we can see only things that are more or less in front of us ; and we have , built into our bodies from birth , a pretty complex group of organs that we can use for making sounds , and a wide range of sounds that we can make ? whereas the range of visible signals we can make unaided is quite limited . Furthermore , we can make sounds with the organs of our respiratory tract ( what cigarette advertisements call the " T-zone " ) without interfering with what we are doing with the rest of our body ? working , resting , etc. ? but any visible signals we might try to make ( say , with arm signals ) necessarily involve major disturbance to whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . So our " man from Mars " would observe that humans  | communicate by means of signals , and that these signals are primarily oral and aural ? made with the mouth and other " organs of speech " , and heard with the ear . He would observe this in any community he was in , from the Australian Bushmen to the tribes of the Congo , from the Navaho sheep-herders to the aristocracy of Buckingham Palace . In fact , this is the major , basic characteristic that he would find differentiating humans from other living beings : humans talk , and talk extensively . They are not , by any means , the only living beings to communicate by means of auditory signals ; but in the various animals that communicate with each other , the range and extent of communication is much less . Furthermore , our " man from Mars " or our ideal linguistician would see that when humans talk , their talk is not just a continual succession of babble , of sounds no two of which are alike or ever come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys gabble and jabber , or that babies prattle ; but in grown people 's speech , the world over , the same sounds and the same combinations of sounds keep recurring more or less frequently . In short , there are partial resemblances in the utterances that people make ; and , because people 's utterances have partial resemblances , we can say that all language has system ? in its sounds and in the way these sounds are put together . If anything has system , we can describe it , by saying briefly and compactly what are the partial resemblances of the elements of the system ; our " man from Mars " or our ideal linguistician could make a series of statements about these systems of auditory signalling , about these languages , he observed among humans , and thus could make a description of their speech . If he were to do this , he would be engaging in the most fundamental type of scientific analysis as applied to language , in descriptive linguistics . Another very important thing that our observer would  | see is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in the last analysis , in connection ( direct or indirect ) with something in the world around us , with reality . ( Let 's leave aside all philosophical discussion as to the nature of reality , and simply assume reality as something given , in the way we all do in normal living . ) That is to say , when the word book occurs in our speech , it normally occurs in connection , direct or indirect , with an object of the general type that might be described as " a series of sheets of paper in some way fastened together , or a composition or part of a composition that might be written on such a series of sheets of paper or other writing materials " . The connections in which a word occurs , the situations with respect to which we use it , are the word 's meaning . If a child has just learned some new word , say grass , and uses it to refer to some object that we normally call by some other name , such as a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply say that the child " does n't know what grass means " ? he has n't yet learned in what situations it is and is not used . That is one of the basic features of a linguistic signal ? it has to have meaning ; if it has no meaning , it is not a signal , and does not come under the subject-matter of linguistics . On the other hand , the meaning of a word is not by any means fixed , not so much as its sound ; for instance , the sound of the word book is reasonably definite and always predictable throughout the English-speaking world , but it has many different meanings , as in a big book ( referring to the actual tome ) , a long book ( the composition contained in a book , even before it 's printed and bound ) , or Book I of the poem ( referring to a part of the composition ) . The word book also has many special uses in phrases such as " to throw the book at someone " , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to book a ticket " , and so forth . The meanings and uses of even such a simple word as book are much less  | easily definable and predictable , and change much more rapidly , than the sounds and grammatical form of the word . Hence the linguistician considers it better to study language first from the point of view of its form ( sounds and combinations of sounds ) , and tries to avoid , as much as possible , basing his analysis on the shifting sands of meaning . In so doing , the linguistician gets away at the outset from the approach to language that we find in a considerable part of the Latin and English grammar we learn in our schools ? the approach based on meaning rather than form . Even our traditional definitions of the " parts of speech " like nouns , adjectives , verbs and so on , are based on meaning more than on anything else . Most of us probably were taught that a noun was supposed to be " the name of a person , place , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quality or accidence " ; and a verb , " the name of an action or state of being " . Unfortunately , however , this approach is inefficient and keeps us from getting an accurate idea of the way the system of signalling , the language itself , as Apposed to its meanings , is built . Meanings vary not only from one dialect to another , but from one person to another , or even in one person 's usage : how many of us use the words Communist or Fascist in exactly the same meaning as the next man does , or are absolutely sure of the exact meaning of every word we use ? For that matter , some meanings just will not fit into the definitions that grammarians give for linguistic classes such as the " parts of speech " . Take the word reflection . In English , the word reflection is certainly a noun , just as much as book , typewriter , ribbon , hat or any of the other thousands of nouns of the language ; but is reflection the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly any of these ; a reflection always involves motion , whether that of a light-wave or of a sound-wave or of anything else being reflected off  | something . It is more of an action , a happening , than a thing . Yet the word reflection , as any speaker of English who has learned a little grammatical terminology will tell us , is most certainly a noun . The reason we say that reflection is a noun is , not that it refers to a person , place or thing ( for reflection , light , matter and many other nouns do not ) , but that it fits into the system of the English language in the same way as do other words which we call nouns . The word reflection can take the suffix - 's ( reflection 's ) ; it can , if necessary , be used in the plural ( reflections ) ; it can have the word the used before it ( the reflection ) . Those things are true of all English nouns ; and they are all features , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this stage of our work , the only use we make of a word 's meaning is to determine whether the word is a true linguistic signal or not , and whether it belongs together in our analysis with other signals that have the same meaning ( as when we class went as the past of go ) ; otherwise , it is much safer to keep to the form , which is constant , and can be identified and described with much less trouble than the meaning . Our analysis has to be formal first of all ; this implies that it will also be somewhat on an abstract plane , and that we will be analyzing language itself before we come to examine the situations in which it is used . Language naturally does not exist in a void , nor yet in a lifeless world of logic or abstraction . People talk , and use language in all their activities , from the most everyday , commonplace contacts to the most intellectual type of reasoning ; that is , language is above all social in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up its social function later on . But we must first find out what language is , before we examine how it functions in the wider context of human affairs . Similarly the chemist , even though he may ultimately be interested in the function and use of some ferti- lizer or dyestuff , first analyzes it and studies its formal characteristics in terms of the frame of reference which has been worked out for chemical analysis . Our study of language , in addition to being formal , needs to be descriptive at the outset , before we proceed to further more advanced analyses . What we need , first of all , is to get as clear and complete an idea as we can get of the structure of any language we 're working on , as it exists or existed at a particular point of time , without letting our picture of the language be distorted by extraneous considerations . There are two types of undesirable approach which we are especially likely to introduce , and which can easily distract our attention from the work of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this first point , the linguistician 's task is not to prescribe what " should " or " should not " be said ; his job is to describe what actually is said , with as completely scientific and objective an approach as a human is capable of . He is interested in noting down factors of meaning such as the social connotations of " incorrect " forms , but considerations of " correctness " should never induce him to omit from his study or analysis such forms as ai n't , he done . From the scientific point of view , the truly sub-standard it ai n't , the supposedly sub-standard it 's me , the standard I 'm tired , and all other types of speech ( literary , dialectal , rustic , slang , criminal argot , etc. ) are of absolutely equal merit . That is to say , questions of merit or value just do not enter into the picture of linguistic analysis , however important they may be in the study of literature . Matters of " correctness " , of standard versus non-standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view of meaning , not of linguistic form . In the same way , the chemist or the biologist studies all chemical or biological phenomena with an impersonal , scientific attitude . Our culture has come to accept this situation with regard to the physical sciences , before it has extended the same recognition to the social  | sciences such as anthropology , of which linguistics is a branch . No one would now say to a biologist working on spirochaeta pallida : " That organism is the cause of syphilis , and venereal diseases must not even be discussed ; therefore you must stop working in your laboratory and reporting your findings on spirochetes . " Likewise , the linguistician approaches all linguistic systems with what he hopes is an equally unprejudiced eye , no matter what is the level of culture or civilization of the people who use them . Whether we consider American , West European , Bush Negro African , aboriginal Australian , or American Indian civilization to be the highest and " best " , we must use the same approach and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such lowly and usually despised media of communication such as Pidgin English ; and , when we study Pidgin English with a serious intent and go at it without preconceived notions as to its merit or fitness for use , we find that even Pidgin has a structure and a value of its own . The other distortion we mentioned , that which comes from a premature introduction of the historical viewpoint , is not basically anti-scientific , as is the prescriptive approach ; but its bad effects are just as great , and lead to just as faulty a picture of the state of affairs . At present , in English , the Romance languages , and other languages of the Indo-European family , nouns are definitely distinct from adjectives : among other things , nouns in English have their plural in -s , adjectives do not have a plural formation ; adjectives can have adverbs in - ly formed on them , nouns can not . The present state of affairs , however , seems to have developed out of an earlier condition in which , some thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parts of speech . So far , so good ; if we state these two situations separately , and then tell the historical relation between the two , no harm is done . But definite harm is done if we do as one scholar did , and make  | the statement " Grammatically , nouns and adjectives are identical ; their functional differentiation ... was a later development . " Identical at what point of time ? ? in IndoEuropean , yes ; in modern English , Romance , etc. , or even Latin and Greek , no ; and the statement , as it stands , is inaccurate and confusing . It is as if we were to say " Maine is really a part of Massachusetts , and Vermont a section of New York ; their functional differentiation was a later development , " just because that was the situation in earlier times . Historical considerations should not be allowed to obscure our first aim , which is to find out the facts as they are or were at whatever given point of time we are studying ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do so by comparing two or more sets of descriptive data . What the linguistician does , therefore , when he begins to work on any particular language or on any feature of language in general , is to get rid of any preconceptions he may have concerning the social standing or " merit " of language . Then he has to get a clear idea of the language 's structure , of what " makes it tick " , at the specific point of time and space he 's interested in ? whether it be the present or some time in the past ? and make an accurate description of it , at least for his own use and preferably published for others ' use as well . Such a work is called a descriptive grammar . He can then go ahead and study the variations from any particular dialect which are found either in space ( linguistic geography ) or in time ( historical grammar ) . In any of these kinds of study , the linguistician adopts certain divisions which fit his subject-matter . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemistry and others under inorganic chemistry , so the linguistician divides his work into three main branches : the study of 1 ) sound , 2 ) form , and 3 ) meaning . How he studies these branches of his science , we shall see in the next three chapters .  | One of the very first things that our " man from Mars " would notice , as we have already mentioned , is that human language is primarily an oral-aural system of signalling . In other words , all speech is made up of sounds . Sounds serve more or less as the building-blocks out of which our speech is put together . So , before he can go any farther in understanding how language is built and functions , our linguistician has to have a working knowledge of sounds ? how they are made by our organs of speech , how to classify them , and how they are used in any particular language he wants to work on . Sounds , of course , not letters ; all languages have sounds , only very few have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them ; and , as we saw briefly in Chapter III , writing is secondary in origin and importance , compared to speech . This brings us up against a fundamental difficulty at the outset : we have to get a new basis for our work . If we want to study the letters with which a language is written , we have little difficulty deciding how to study them : we take them in the order of the Roman alphabet , a b c d e f g h and so on ; or , if we are dealing with some other alphabet or system of writing , we take them in the conventional order that its users have established . But an alphabetical order , or any approach based on letters alone , will be of no use for studying sounds as such . We all know that our present alphabet is by no means sufficient to represent , with its meager twenty-six letters , all the sounds of the English language ; and , in all the other languages of the world , there occur hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . Any kind of approach based on the letters of our alphabet or any other kind of writing is doomed from the start to be inadequate .  | We have to study the sounds themselves ; but how ? One way that immediately comes to mind , and that is quite widespread in our everyday talk about language , is to take the effect that the sounds make on our ears . If we want to describe a sound , and are not quite sure on what basis to do so , one of the easiest things to do is to say " It 's ? well , I do n't know exactly , but something of a flat sound " ( or a " broad " sound , or " smooth " , or " harsh " , " soft " or " hard " , " bright " or " dark " ) . Kipling 's humorous story " How The Alphabet Was Made " gives several beautiful examples of this way of classifying sounds : " ... because it was a nasty , nosy noise , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they drew a picture of the big lakepike 's mouth for the greedy Ga-sound ; and they drew the pike 's mouth again with a spear behind it for the scratchy , hurty Ka-sound ; and they drew pictures of a little bit of the winding Wagai river for the nice windy-windy Wa-sound . . . . " But it is immediately evident that using the impressions of our own ears , our auditory impressions , in this way , will not be satisfactory ; if for no other reason , simply because the terms " flat " , " broad " , " soft " , " hard " , and so on , are purely impressionistic and do not necessarily mean the same thing to one person as they do to another . Speaking of a " broad a " may suggest one sound to me ( the sound of ah ) and another to you ( the sound of flat , perhaps ) . In French , the word grasseyer , meaning literally " to fatten " , has been used of a great many different kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way of knowing what was meant by it ; the phonetician Kr . Nyrop suggested that the best definition for grasseyer would be " a  | term , generally contemptuous , which people apply to other people 's pronunciation ; those who pronounce r in any given way , use the word grasseyer to describe any other way of pronouncing said consonant . " In short , trying to describe sounds in auditory , impressionistic terms is likely to give about as accurate results as would , say , describing chemical elements in terms of their smells . The impressions we get through our senses of hearing and smell can not be stated in clear and analyzable enough terms to be of any use in scientific work . But of course , the impressions which we get in our hearing of sounds are produced , as any student of elementary physics can tell us , by certain specific properties of the sound-waves in the air , as they strike our ear-drums . Might we perhaps analyze , not our impressions of the sounds , but the sound-waves themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds we hear ? We might indeed ; if we did this , we would be trying to study sounds , not from an auditory , but from an acoustic point of view . To date , though , there has been one great drawback to the study of acoustic phonetics : we have not had any way of recording and analyzing the sound-waves accurately enough , and up to very recently , the study of acoustic phonetics has not been profitable for linguistics . Such machines as were available , such as the kymograph ( a recording device for transforming the movement of sound-waves , or of a part of the vocal organs , into movements of a pen-point on a strip of paper ) , have not been able to give us full or accurate enough information . In the last few years , machines have been developed , such as the sound spectrograph , which can record and chart the characteristics of sound-waves as they occur in speech , and which can analyze for us the intensity , frequency , and other features of the sound itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second half of this  | century in linguistics will be the analysis of speech-sounds by machines such as the sound spectrograph . Then have linguisticians found some other way of talking about , analyzing , and describing the sounds of language , other than in mere meaningless impressionistic terms ? They have ; and , in the main , it has proven quite satisfactory . It is to describe the sounds in terms , not of their auditory impression or of their acoustic characteristics , but of the organs of the body used in producing them ? classifying the sounds by which organs are used , and how . This kind of phonetic study is known as physiological or articulatory phonetics , from the fact that we analyze the physiology of the articulation of sound . And it is much more exact to classify a sound as being made with the top of the tongue raised against the rear part of the palate , say , than as " hard " or " scratchy " . The first thing that our linguistician must know , therefore , in as great detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body that are used in making sounds ? the organs of speech . When we know all the organs of speech , and all the ways in which they are used in talking , we have a universal framework in which we can classify the sounds of whatever language we happen to work with . This framework is quite easy to learn : all human beings , of whatever race they may be , have the same organs of speech , and can make whatever sounds are customary in the language they are brought up speaking . We often hear it said that one sound or another is " impossible to pronounce " , or that innate differences of physiological structure make people of a certain race ? say , the white race ? inherently incapable of pronouncing certain sounds found in languages spoken by people of other races , such as Chinese or Japanese . This idea is quite unfounded . A white child brought up exclusively among native speakers of Japanese or Chinese will speak exactly as he hears them speak , and  | fully as well ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child brought up speaking a West European language , as many Americans have undoubtedly observed in the case of the Nisei . The organs of speech include essentially all the human respiratory tract . Air is drawn into and expelled from the lungs , which expand and contract under the influence of the diaphragm . DIAGRAM I THE ORGANS OF SPEECH As the breath moves to or from the lungs , it passes through the mouth , nasal cavity , pharynx , and trachea ( or windpipe ) . These and other closely related parts of the body ( such as the tongue and lips ) are the organs customarily used in speech . The air passes in and out of the lungs in a stream or column , called the breath-stream . In general , most speech-sounds are made on outgoing air , although in some languages ( such as Hottentot ) , there are genuine speech-sounds , often called " clicks " , made on ingoing air . Diagram 1 gives a cross-section of the human head and neck , showing the route that the breath-stream follows on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs of speech .  | When we send our breath-stream through the organs of speech , they do not necessarily remain motionless , fixed in one invariable position ; if they did , we would not be able to make any sounds at all with them , or would make a continuous , unchanging noise , like that which a jet of steam makes when escaping through a whistle . The human organs of speech can change their position , to a large extent , so as to make a number of different types of sounds ? as when we put our tongue low in the mouth to make the " ah " - sound , or high to make the " ee " - sound ; or when we send the breath into the nose to nasalize a sound , or else keep the breath out of the nose and make a non-nasalized sound . It is this mobility of the organs of speech , and the relatively great number of different activities and combinations of activities which they can engage in , that enables us to make a number of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language has been found in which there are only three or four sounds . Among all the sounds the human organs of speech can  - -  produce , there is a basic division , depending on whether we can produce the sound exclusively by forming resonance chambers in the mouth and nose or by making some kind of obstruction in the stream of breath to produce friction that can be heard , audible friction . The sounds we usually write ah , oh , uh , oo , ee , ay , aw are of the kind we make by forming resonance chambers with the tongue in different positions in the mouth . Those we usually write with the letters s , z , t , k , p , b , f , v are made by obstructing the breath stream and producing audible friction in one way or another . We could , if we wanted , call these two types of sound the " resonance-chamber " kind and the " **32;968;TOOLONG " kind ; but , for the sake of brevity and simplicity , we will use the traditional terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are  | following a procedure that is very common in scientific discussion : we are using familiar terms in a new way , and redefining our terminology . From now on , when we speak of vowel sounds , or of vowels pure and simple , we do not mean the letters a e i o u " and sometimes w and y " , as they tell us in our school grammars ; and when we speak of consonants , we do not mean all the other letters of the alphabet . We mean vowel sounds and consonant sounds as such , as we have just defined them , and without reference to any kind of letters ( marks you make with your fist ! ) at all . From time to time we shall redefine familiar terms and use them with special meanings , often rather different from those they popularly have . This is the same kind of thing that an economist does , for instance , when he redefines supply and demand , or when a chemist uses the words suspension or sediment , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning . In making both vowel and consonant sounds , we utilize the variations in position of the organs of speech from the vocal cords upwards . The phonetician isolates three main factors as being responsible for differences in sounds : the activity of the vocal cords , the place or position in which a sound is articulated , and the manner in which it is articulated . For every sound , we also distinguish three stages in its pronunciation : the onset , or time in which the organs of speech assume the position for its pronunciation ; the hold , or time during which they are in that position ; and the release , or time in which they leave the position . Often , a sound may be similar to another in all respects except that of onset , hold , or release : for instance , the tt of Italian fatto " done " is held twice as long as the t of fato " fate " ; the t-sound of English tin has a different kind of release from the eh-sound of chin . In its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward through the windpipe , in which there is a box-like structure of cartilage , that we usually call the larynx or " Adam 's apple " , and that contains the vocal cords . The vocal cords are two movable membranes ? not really cords like the strings of a piano or a violin , but mucous membranes , attached to the sides of the larynx . They can either lie along the side of the larynx without making any sound ; or be brought together completely to shut off the passage of the breath ; or be brought together partially , letting the breath-stream pass but vibrating as it passes and thus setting up sound-waves . A complete stoppage of the breath-stream by the vocal cords is called a glottal stop . The sound-waves resulting from the vibration of the vocal cords are known as voice ; a sound accompanied by voice ( usually all vowels and many consonants , like English b , d , v , z ) is called a voiced sound ; one not accompanied by voice ( like English p , t , f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the vocal cords on its way out of the lungs , the breath-stream passes various points in thepharynx , nose , and mouth , at which the column of air can be modified and sound-waves can be set up , either by the formation of resonance-chambers or by specific obstructions of one kind or another . In the nasal cavity there are no points at which an obstruction or other change in the breath-stream can be made , but the whole nasal cavity can be brought into play as a resonancechamber ( producing nasalization ) or else shut off from the course of the breath-stream , by the velum , a flap of flesh which hangs down at the back of the mouth , between mouth and nasal cavity , and whose movable tip is known as the uvula . When we have a cold and ca n't let the breath into the nose because the uvula is inflamed or the nasal passages are blocked by mucus , we ca n't use the nasal cavity as a resonance chamber even in such sounds as n and m , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of spring is coming . On the other hand , when we have  | the habit of not closing the nasal cavity off completely with the velum , as when we 've just had adenoids removed , or like the stock comedy figures of Farmer Hayseed or Uncle Josh , we give a certain amount of nasalization to all our speech , or " talk through the nose " . In the mouth or oral cavity there are a number of ways in which the breath-stream can be modified . Inside the mouth we have an extremely mobile fleshy organ , the tongue , which can be raised and lowered ; we can raise and lower either the front or the middle or the back of the tongue , and we can do this either in the center of the tongue or on its sides . The tongue , being attached to the bottom of the mouth , normally moves toward the roof or makes contact with it , somewhere between the very rear ( on the velum ) and the extreme front ( between the teeth ) . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought together , or the teeth can be put in contact with the lips ( normally , the upper teeth with the lower lips ) . For vowel sounds , the tongue does not come directly in contact with the roof of the mouth , but assumes various positions inside the mouth to form cavities that serve as resonance chambers , conditioning the specific quality of the vowel sound . There are two main factors that produce the characteristic sound of a vowel : the position of the tongue in the front or back of the mouth , and the height to which it is raised in the mouth . To these are , on occasion , added the two further factors of lip-rounding ( puckering out of the lips , as in the " oo " - sound ) and nasalization . Vowels are therefore usually classified by phoneticians according to two main categories : tongue-position and tongueheight . In tongue-position , three main varieties are distinguished : front , central , and back ; and in tongue-height , high , mid , and low . Further sub-divisions can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-mid . The tension or laxity of the tongue and other muscles are also often important . A vowel can always be classified in terms of these features of its pronunciation : for instance , our " ee " - sound is high front and tense ; our " ah " sound is low central and lax ; our " oo " sound is high back and tense . The " eh " sound is low-mid front and lax ; the " aw " sound is low-mid back and lax ; the " uh " sound is lowmid central and lax . Similarly for the other vowel sounds of English . In English , we make no use of nasalization , and lip-rounding is always automatic , our front vowels having the lips drawn back ( as in the " ee " , " ay " and " eh " sounds ) , and our back vowels having them puckered out ( as in " oo " , " oh " and some varieties of " aw " ) . But in other languages , the situation is different : for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and German have sounds in whose pronunciation the tongue is in the front of the mouth and the lips are rounded at the same time ( front-rounded vowels , like the sounds spelled u and o in German ) . Russian has a vowel-sound , named yeri , usually called " obscure " , but actually a high central vowel with lips unrounded . In consonants , the breath-stream is obstructed and audible friction is produced by one or more of the organs of speech being placed very close to or in contact with another . The tongue is the main factor in the pronunciation of consonants as it is in that of vowels ; but other organs of speech , including the vocal cords , the uvula , and the lips , may also be involved . The phonetician classes all consonant sounds as either voiced or unvoiced , according to whether the vocal cords are vibrating during their articulation or not ( see p. 70 ) ; in some instances , the muscular tension of the vocal organs seems to be more important than presence or absence of voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , or lax ( lenis ) . Every consonant sound is made in some specific position .  | There is of course an infinity of separate locations at which the tongue can make contact with the roof of the mouth . The main regions of the roof of the mouth are , from back to front , the velum , the palate , the gum-ridge , and the teeth . The palate has three main subdivisions : the rear part or soft palate , the middle part , and the front part or hard palate . There are a number of special adjectives which are often applied to sounds articulated at these various points : Table We make consonant sounds , not only in various positions , but also in different manners . There are a number of different ways in which the vocal cords , tongue , or lips can obstruct the breath-stream , either shutting it off completely or directing its passage through one kind of channel or another . - The stream of breath may be stopped entirely , as in English p , t , k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This channel may take the form of a narrow slit , as in English f , v ; or of a trough or depression ( a rill ) in the center of the tongue , as in English s.  | The air may also pass over the depressed sides of the tongue , as in some kinds of 1 . It may be modified by a single or repeated flap of some movable organ , like the lips ( in the interjection usually written brrr and in the " Bronx cheer " ) , the tongue ( in Italian and Spanish r ) or the uvula ( in Parisian French r ) . Or the breath-stream may be checked entirely and held while the nasal cavity is used as a resonance-chamber , as in English m , n and the sound we write with the letters ng ( e.g. in the word singing ) . Types of release may differ : a sound may be released with a little explosion ( like English p , t , k ) , with the tongue assuming position to form a rill ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in German pf ) . A number of adjectives are used to refer to the various manners of articulation , such as the following : Table While the stream of breath is being modified at a given point and in a given manner , still other things may be happening at the same time . The vocal cords may be suddenly drawn together and released explosively , in which case we call the sound glottalized ; a puff of air , or aspiration , may be sent out immediately after a consonant , which we then term aspirated . The breath-stream may be sent into the nose for a fraction of a second before a consonant is articulated , coinciding with the onset of the sound , which we then call a pre-nasalized consonant ( often found in African languages , in such names as Mbanga ) . If the tongue is raised close to the palate at the same time as the consonant is pronounced , the consonant is palatalized as in many Russian and other Slavic words . Furthermore , sounds are pronounced with different degrees of intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity is termed stress , and in English ( as in most other languages ) is quite important ? consider the difference between English contract ( noun , stressed on first syllable ) and contract ( verb , stressed on second syllable ) . Sounds : ire also pronounced with varying pitch , from high to low ; in English , variations in pitch help us to distinguish various types of sentence which otherwise have the same elements , such as You 're going home ? ( question ) from You 're going home . ( statement ) ; but-in many languages , such as Chinese , differences in pitch make a difference in the meaning of individual words , such as Chinese ma ( with high , level tone ) " mother " , ma ( with high rising tone ) " hemp " , ma ( with low rising tone ) " horse " and ma ( with low falling tone ) " scold " . Given this type of frame of reference , a phonetician can ,  | by establishing sufficient categories , take the sounds of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives to sounds are often rather formidable , such as " high tense front unrounded vowel " for the sound we usually write ee , or " unvoiced dental fricative " for what we normally spell th , as in thing . But a moment 's reflection will show that , in the long run , a classification of this type is not only more accurate and exact , but more helpful to our understanding of sounds ' nature and relation to each other . An elementary knowledge of phonetics helps us to see , for instance , that our " th-sounds " contain an h only in spelling , and that they are actually single sounds ? both dental fricatives , i.e. pronounced with a slit-like passage and with the tip of the tongue against the teeth ; they differ only in that the initial sound of thing is unvoiced and the initial sound of this is voiced . We also can see more clearly that , if I say writin ' instead of writing , I am not really " dropping " any sort of g : what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the voiced guttural nasal continuant which , although it is one sound , we write as ng . Our traditional system of writing , and the way in which phoneticians usually analyze individual sounds , predisposes us to think that sounds in the stream of speech , like letters in a line of writing , come one after the other and are quite distinct from each other . This supposition has had such a strong influence that purists often tell us " Be sure to pronounce all the letters , and do n't slur your sounds into each other , else you ca n't be understood . " Many phoneticians , however , have long suspected that this was not so . The onset of one sound often extends far back into the release , or even into the hold , of the preceding sound , and its release lasts into the onset of the following sound . This intermingling of various sounds is known technically as slur ( without , however , the un- favorable connotation often given the word ) . Our hearing , likewise , is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inevitable blending , over several hundredths of it second , in our perception of sounds ; this is technically termed smear . Due to the existence of smear in our perception of sounds , the presence of a certain amount of slur in our pronunciation serves an essential purpose , that of modifying sounds so as to let us know what is coming next or what has gone before . This is especially true of vowel sounds , which are modified by the surrounding consonants . Consonant sounds are often so short in duration , that the actual perception of consonants is lost in the smear of a few hundredths of a second ; and if we did not have the special quality of the consonant slurred into preceding or following vowels , we would not be able to know which consonant had been pronounced . In his important book Acoustic Phonetics ( 1948 ) , Prof. Martin Joos says : " Such identification of consonants by their effects on contiguous resonants is apparently depended on by listeners to a far greater extent than commonly supposed . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the majority of consonants make such faint impressions on spectrograms that we must suppose them to be either absolutely inaudible or at any rate so faintly inaudible as to be separately imperceptible .... If the speaker trained himself to reduce his slur to , say , one third the customary extent ... there would be very little profit in this improvement ' because the listener 's smear would still blend the segments together nearly as thoroughly as ever , but there could easily be a considerable loss in it because then the vowels would perhaps not furnish enough evidence to identify the consonants properly . " The purists , therefore , in advising us to separate our sounds and articulate each apart from the others , are giving us advice which , if followed , would render speech not more , but less intelligible !  | To date , we have been referring to sounds in three ways : either by circumlocution , often long-winded and clumsy , as when we say " the initial sound of thing " or " the sound spelled with the letters ng " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the ee-sound " or " the oo-sound " ; or , in the most recent part of our discussion , by more complicated technical terms like " unvoiced dental fricative " or " voiced guttural nasal continuant " . But for sustained and at the same time efficient discussion , the linguistician finds all three of these ways of referring to sounds quite unsatisfactory . The first is long-winded , and it describes sounds in terms of letters of the English alphabet , an inexact and ambiguous procedure at best ( what is the sound of ei ? ) . The second is shorter , but likewise depends too much on conventional spelling ; and the third , although scientifically more exact , is still too consuming of time and space . Ca n't we find something simpler , clearer , and more consistent , to represent sounds on paper ? Of course we can . All we need to do is to devise a set of symbols , in one-to-one correspondence with each sound we want to represent ; we can then use these symbols to make marks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory or help us to keep them in mind for further discussion . This is , of course , the same type of procedure , using rigorously defined symbols , that we find , say , in mathematics or in chemistry , where certain letters or other marks are assigned specific meanings ( Fe = iron ; a lowered numeral after a chemical symbol = the number of atoms of an element present in a molecule of a compound , as in H2O = " two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen " ; etc . ) . Such a set of symbols , used to represent the sounds of human speech , is ? as we have mentioned already ( p. 38 ) ? called a phonetic transcription . To be wholly accurate  | and useful , a transcription should fulfill two requirements : each symbol should stand for only one sound , and each sound should be represented by only one symbol . Of course , our traditional English spelling is quite inadequate to serve as a phonetic transcription ; the twenty-six letters of the Roman alphabet will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human speech . To make up for the deficiencies of our alphabet , many people have devised systems of phonetic transcription . A few systems , such as Bell 's " Visible Speech " and Pike 's " Functional Analphabetic Symbolism " , abandon all use of the Roman alphabet , insofar as it represents sounds ; if they use letters at all , they use them to stand for organs of speech involved in pronunciation , place or manner of articulation , etc . Most phonetic transcriptions , however , use our traditional Roman alphabet as a base ; but , in the first place , they use each letter only in one fixed value . So for instance , in a phonetic transcription , the letter g always stands for a voiced guttural plosive stop ? the first sound of the word get , never the first sound of gem . Then , to provide extra symbols where the Roman alphabet proves insufficient , new letters are introduced , or alterations are made in the shape of familiar letters . Letters can be taken over from other alphabets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , we may use the Greek theta 8 to stand for the first sound of thin , and the Old English letter t for the first sound of this . We can turn a letter upside down or on its side : for the last sound of sofa , phonetic transcriptions often use the letter e turned upside down , thus : a , and for the vowel sound of law , we use an upside down c , thus : a . Small capital or italic letters may be assigned special values , as when we write 1 for the vowel sound of bit . We can change - some part of a letter 's shape : for instance , lengthening the righthand leg of the letter n to make a special symbol for the sound  | usually spelled ng , thus : D ; or curving the bottom part of the letter z down and around to make a symbol for the middle consonant sound of measure , the " zh-sound " : 31 . We can put various small marks ( often called " diacritics " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dots , small straight or curved lines , either above , below , alongside or through a letter , as when we use the letter c with an inverted circumflex accent v above it to stand for the first sound of cheat : 6 ; or the letter o with two dots over it to stand for the vowel sound of French pear fear " : o . Sometimes a line is written through a letter to indicate some special kind of sound , as in the symbol i to stand for an 1-sound pronounced in the back of the mouth , as we usually do in American English full . Phonetic transcriptions are usually set off in square brackets , , to make it clear that they do not represent conventional spelling or any other kind of transcription . There have been many phonetic transcriptions devised in the last hundred or so years , such as Lepsius ' alphabet , designed in Germany in the middle 19th century and used very widely for recording native languages in former German colonies ; the alphabet of the American Anthropological Association , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often abbreviated IPA ) ; and others , including quite a number of partial modifications of IPA , such as Kenyon 's version adapted to American English , or Bloch and Trager 's . The designers of IPA originally intended it to be full enough to cover all the possible sounds of human speech ; at the end of the last century and the beginning of this , it attained very wide currency among phoneticians and language teachers , and is used in most beginning language books , in a great many foreign-language dictionaries , and in a few English-English dictionaries , such as the Kenyon-Knott Pronouncing Dictionary of American English . ( Most ordinary dictionaries , however , do not use a true phonetic transcription , but resort to the makeshift expedient of simply putting one kind  | of mark or another over conventional spelling . ) But IPA is not the only possible or permissible phonetic alphabet , as some phoneticians seem to think . Any symbol , any letter , is as good as any other for the purpose of representing a sound ? provided you first define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent , and then stick to it . The following list gives the most common phonetic symbols used for transcribing English , together with definitions in articulatory terms and examples for each . Most , but not all , are taken from IPA . Those who are interested will find a supplementary list of phonetic symbols used for other languages , in the Appendix ( p. 253 ) . Phoneticians often arrange symbols in the form of charts , using dimensions on paper to stand for position and height of vowel articulation , or for position , manner , and voicing in the pronunciation of consonants . Here , for reasons of space , we give the symbols in alphabetical order , except that vowels are given first , then consonants , then other symbols . Symbol Articulatory Definition Example Table  | Table  | Table Heavy stress is indicated by a superior vertical tick ' , and stress intermediate between heavy and weak by an inferior vertical tick , , whereas weak stress is usually left unmarked : e.g. procrastination pro , krzestr'ne an , procrastinate pro ' - kraesti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colon : or : 6 raised dot ? : e.g. bead bi:d , bird . A puff of breath ( aspiration ) after a consonant is indicated by an apostrophe written after the consonant symbol : e.g. puff p'Af . Not only the specialist in phonetics , but the general Iinguistician as well , finds a phonetic transcription absolutely essential as a basis for further work of any kind . The slight initial effort of learning some new-characters and getting accustomed to using others in strange or unusually consistent values , is far outweighed by the ultimate gain in reliability and ease in use . The linguistician trying to work without a transcription is as hampered as would be a chemist , say , or a mathematician deprived of all his chemical or mathematical symbols . The great period of the careful and detailed study of phonetics , on an articulatory basis , was from about 1870  | to 1920 ; in those fifty years , phoneticians amassed a great body of knowledge for describing the pronunciation of sounds and for symbolizing them in transcription . We still use all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a while , linguisticians began to see that phonetics alone , although an immense step in advance as compared with the unwieldy and ( in some cases ) utterly unworkable study of a language through its ordinary spelling , was still not the last word in the analysis of speech-sounds . It came to be a mark of virtuosity in a phonetician to distinguish , by ear or by mechanical means , as many different sounds as possible , and to devise special symbols to represent them ; it is said that Daniel Jones could hear 120 different vowel sounds in English . A transcription representing every minute difference in sound is called a narrow transcription , and is very useful in the first stage of phonetic analysis . But some , workers in phonetics , reacting against this excessive complexity , began to simplify their transcription by omitting distinctions that did not seem great to their ears , and thus evolved a somewhat less complex type of phonetic writing called broad transcription . For instance , in a narrow transcription , the sentence The pool was empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given as to ' p'uwl waz ' rmptij an ba on a ' lii waz ' ajdol in a narrow transcription representing my own speech . A broad transcription would omit notation of the aspirated p in pool and of the upward glide following the vowels in pool and lea , but would still mark the difference between the alveolar ( 1 in lea and the velar 1 in pool , mill , idle , and the same sentence would be given in broad transcription as ' bo ' put waz ' empti an to an tba ' li waz ' ajdal . Yet , although it was clear that phonetic transcription needed to be simplified and used only for marking essentials , the " broad transcription " principle did not wholly  | meet this need . Phoneticians tended to omit details that seemed to them unessential , without explicit and rigorous criteria for their procedure , and on the basis of their own i-npression of what was essential and what was not . From about 1920 on , and chiefly through the efforts of such men as Edward Sapir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trubetzkoy and his group in Prague , advanced linguisticians began to see that sounds are important only as they perform a specific function in language ; and this they do by differentiating the meaning of words . So linguisticians began to concentrate on discovering and symbolizing , not only speech-sounds as such , but those functional units of speech-sound that are significant , i.e. that make a difference in meaning . For such significant functional units of sound , the term phoneme is generally used ( as we mentioned on p. 35 ) ; and for an individual sound functioning as part of such a unit , the terms positional variant and allophone are both in use . This further stage of analysis , which builds on phonetics and is known as phonemics , has by now been accepted by all forwardlooking linguisticians as an essential part of linguistic anlysis . When the linguistician sets about working over his phonetic data in order to determine the phonemes of a given language , he first tries to find all the contrasts between sounds that establish differences of meaning between words . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelled p and b occur in different words that have different meanings , such as pit and bit , pat and bat , pike and bike ; lie says , therefore , that these two sounds belong to two different phonemes . Similarly for the two sounds that are spelled th ; that they belong to two different phonemes is shown by such contrasts as those between either and ether , between this and thick . Having found all the possible contrasts between sounds , the linguistician then examines the  | sounds which do not contrast with each other , to see which sounds he can group together . This he does by applying certain technical criteria , asking : 1 ) Which sounds are most similar ? 2 ) Which sounds complement each other , each occurring where the other does not ? 3 ) Which groups of sounds fit the pattern of the other sounds of the language ? Those groups of sounds which fulfill these criteria and which behave as single units of significant sound , are classed as individual phonemes . ( It is possible , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allophone , whereas others are made up of two or more allophones or positional variants that meet the requirements just set forth . ) In many types of American English , there are two sounds normally written as 1 , but phonetically quite distinct : the alveolar variety which we find at the beginning of a syllable , in such words as lead ' lid , look ' luk , light ' lajt ; and the velar variety at the end of a syllable , in words like mill ' mil , fool ' fuwl , wool ' wul . The first is transcribed with the phonetic symbol 1 , the second with l ; the difference is easily audible and also observable by mechanical means . But these two sounds never make a difference in meaning between two words in English . They are distinct , but phonetically similar , in that both are voiced laterals . They complement each other , or occur in complementary distribution , in that 1 occurs only at the beginning of a syllable , and I only at the end of a syllable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , in that the 1-l group together are found in the same kind of position ( beginning and end of syllable ) as single consonant sounds like r . Hence , by our criteria , the two sounds 1 and I are , in these varieties of American English , positional variants or allophones of the same phoneme , which for convenience ' sake we may transcribe as /1/ . The sentence given on p. 84 would be transcribed phonemically as / ' 6o ' pul waz ' empti on ' 6a ' mil an Zia ' li waz ' ajdal/ . Phonemic transcriptions are usually placed between slant lines : / / , to distinguish them from phonetic transcriptions or from ordinary spelling . A parallel from the detective story may help to explain our  | criteria . When a given character ( say , the butler ) is always off the scene when the murderer is on , and the murderer always off when the butler is on , we begin to suspect that the butler and the murderer are the same ( they are in complementary distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical similarity ( in sex , height , size , etc. ) to be identified as the same person . Moreover , if there is a choice among several possibilities for the murderer , in order for the butler to be the murderer he must fit into the pattern of the story ( in a detective story , have some motive to commit the crime ) . Phonemics does not in any way supplant phonetics , but simply builds further on the results obtained in phonetics , with a change in emphasis . Likewise , a phonemic transcription represents a shift in the aim of our notation ? from that of representing every identifiable sound , to that of representing only functionally significant units of sound . It differs from a narrow phonetic transcription basically in being simplified and " essentialized " , and from a broad phonetic transcription in being based on a rigorous procedure of analysis . It has the advantage of not being cluttered up with non-significant features , and of representing only essentials . On an even more advanced level of analysis , much presentday work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound which compose phonemes , their components ; this study is called componential analysis . Thus , in the English vowel sound i ; the vowel of beet ) , its components are front tongue position ( as opposed to u ) , high tongue position ( as opposed to e or a ) , and tenseness of articulation ( as opposed to r ) . The components of i , on the other hand , are frontness and height of tongue position , and laxness of articulation . If we choose , we can symbolize any high front vowel by /i/ and add a special symbol , say/7 , to represent tensearticulation ; or , going one step further , we can identify /7 with the palatal semi-consonantal glide /j/ , and then add /j/ instead of / " / for tenseness of articulation . We then write r as /i/ , and  | i as /ij/ ; bit becomes /bit/ , and beet is transcribed /bijt/ , in such a partially componential transcription . And likewise for the other English tense vowels : /e/ , /u/ and /o/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /ow/ . At present , the merits and demerits of this procedure ( often called re-phonemicization ) are a matter of debate . It permits us to reduce the number of unit phonemes we set up , and to make our transcriptions typographically simpler ; often , a semi-componential re-phonemicization seems to give a neater analytical pattern . But much recent work of this type is open to doubt on theoretical grounds ( e.g. the theories of Bloch and Trager on English vowels ) . The basic necessity of phonemic analysis is now agreed on by all ; how far it is to be carried in the direction of componential analysis and re-phonemicization , is still a matter of personal preference rather than of scientific method . When we are dealing with a language for which there exists no traditional system of writing , phonemic analysis serves as the best basis for devising an orthography for the language . Where there is a conventional orthography that has become petrified and no longer represents the actual phonemes of modern speech ( as in English , French , Spanish , etc. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation and the relation between writing and speech , and to help measure the accuracy of traditional doctrines of pronunciation and grammar . Often the spelling of a language distinguishes phonemes which are no longer separate in modern speech ( as in the case of Spanish b and v ) ; or , even more often , fails to make distinctions which are phonemically significant ( as between the two sounds represented by th in English either and ether ) . In early 16th century Spanish , the letters b and v stood for two different phonemes , probably pronounced like English b and v. Spanish grammarians of that period describe b and v as having separate sounds , and later grammarians copy the state- ments of the earlier ones on this point . These statements , and the belief that b and v , being separate letters , must somehow be pronounced differently , have persisted in school grammars of Spanish down to the present . Yet , in normal speech , the situa- , lion is quite different . Modern Spanish has indeed two souuds , the voiced bilabial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . These two sounds are phonetically similar ? both bilabial , both voiced . They are in complementary distribution , since the plosive sound b occurs only at the beginning of a breath-group or after 1 or m , and the fricative sound a occurs only in other positions . The contrast between b and 0 never makes any difference in the meaning of words , and hence is not significant . We can therefore group these two sounds in Spanish under the same phoneme , which we may transcribe /b/ for choice . The letters b and v , on the other hand , in modern Spanish orthography both stand for the same phoneme /b/ : for instance , it is the phoneme /b/ which we have in Spanish /babe/ " he lives " ( spelled vive ) and in /bebe/ " he drinks " ( spelled bebe ) . The use of b or v in Spanish spelling is purely arbitrary , the choice depending usually ( though not always ) on the spelling of the Latin word from which the Spanish has developed . The use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : Spanish has a phoneme /b/ , under which are grouped two sounds b and 0 , the former occurring initially in a breathgroup and after 1 and m , and the latter occurring elsewhere ; and this phoneme is represented in conventional orthography I ) y the letters b and v arbitrarily , the choice depending usually on etymological criteria . Since each language has its own organization , its own economy , the phonemes of one language are not the same as those of another . We find that the sounds of each language fall into a distinctive pattern , and we have no right to expect the language to have the same pattern as another . Any feature of sound may be highly significant in one language and completely without phonemic significance in another . For instance , the little puff of breath  | or aspiration after a consonant in English does not make any different in meaning , and we can pronounce pooh ! with or without aspiration after the initial p-sound without changing its meaning . In Chinese , however , aspiration makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiration means " not " , whereas p'u-dz with aspirated p means " store " . English , on the other hand , makes such distinctions as that between the vowel of bad and the vowel of bed , which speakers of most European languages do not make and hence have a hard time making in English . In general , adult speakers of any language can hear and imitate without special training only those phonemic distinctions which their own language has taught them to be attentive to ; in order to hear and make unfamiliar phonemic distinctions , we normally need to have our attention specially called to them and often have to be carefully instructed in the means of producing them . On the other hand , we often have great difficulty in perceiving differences between sounds in our own language which are present on the phonetic level but which are not significant phonemically , like the difference between the two 1-sounds in lea and full . We also find that , when we treat the phonemes of each language , each dialect , each individual variety of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justification for saying that the pronunciation of one dialect is " careless " or " sloppy " in comparison with another . On the contrary , we find that each and every language or dialect has its own phonemic distinctions ? different , perhaps , from those of some other language or dialect , but none the less real and valid , and of equal value with all others . Sometimes people make statements like the following : " Some thirty years ago an English poet said that the Cockney in speaking with as little speech as possible had reduced speech as near as may be to a stream of uniform vowels bespat- tered with slurred consonants . ' Since then this speech has spread with its characteristics developed so much that you may hear whole sentences without a definite consonant , and this gradual atrophy of the powers of articulation goes on unheeded by the educational powers that be . " ? J. G. Anderson , Le , , Mot Juste ( New York , 1932 ) , p. viii . But all we have to do is to analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately , in order to see that the Cockney 's speech shows , not a " gradual atrophy of the powers of articulation " , but simply a different type of articulation from what is socially accepted as standard . The educated person , through the very fact of being educated to accept only one type of speech as standard , is without the scientific equipment and training necessary to analyze other speech than his own , and without the objectivity necessary to recognize its equal validity even when it differs from his own . The study of sounds , in phonetics and phonemics , serves as an indispensable base for further linguistic analysis . Unless we are sure what sounds the speakers of a language make , and how those sounds are grouped into functional units or phonemes , we have no assurance that our more advanced analysis , either of form or of meaning , is accurate . Every worker in linguistics has had the experience of doing a certain amount of work on a language , then analyzing his results and realizing he must have failed to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check up by listening some more and hearing what he had previously missed . We suspect the same kind of thing must have happened in the writing down of many languages no longer spoken , and that is what makes work on ( say ) Latin or Greek so tantalizing ? we can no longer go back to native speakers and check up . In such a situation , the conscientious linguistician is forced to rely on indirect evidence ? such as the statements of grammarians ,  | rhymes or other features of versification , and inconsistencies of spelling ? to do the best he can in establishing at least an approximative and reasonably plausible idea of what the dead language 's sounds and phonemes must have been . Then , when he has gotten the best phonetic and phonemic analysis possible for the language he is working on , the linguistician is ready to go ahead and analyze its grammatical structure .  | Phonemes , naturally , do not occur in isolation , but only joined together as the elements , the building-blocks , of continuous speech . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of combinations of letters into words , and of words into sentences ; with , often , the further injunction that " every true sentence must contain a subject or a predicate " ( like I see or the man runs ) , and that any combination of words not containing a subject and a predicate ( like yes , John or How much ? ) must be simply a mutilated form of a complete sentence with some part left out . The linguistician tries to avoid this approach , as it is incomplete and over-simplified . As we have just seen , the linguistician thinks in terms of phonemes , not of letters ; and he also finds that the term word is often inaccurate or misleading . In some languages , like Eskimo or French , it is hard to tell whether such a thing as a word , in our sense of the to m , exists at all . So we avoid the term word , and speak rather of greater or lesser parts of an utterance . ( Whenever any person has said something with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of speech is an utterance . ) Furthermore , the linguistician wants to have a convenient term for any part of au utterance ; he uses the word form in this sense . Whenever we speak of a linguistic form , we mean an utterance or any of its parts , long or short , that has meaning ( is meaningful ) . In the light of this definition , the following are all linguistic forms : John ! ; How much ? ; Please do n't ; the man I saw yesterday ; Who was the man I saw you with yesterday ? Our task is now this : for any language we are dealing with , to find out what the forms of the language are , to discover the patterns they fall into , and to classify them , so that we can make a series  | of statements about them that will 1 ) be accurate ; 2 ) be concise ; 3 ) show the patterns of the language . A good descriptive grammar will give us such a series of statements , telling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but the facts and system concerned . One thing the linguistician notices at the very outset is that in many languages , not all forms can be spoken as separate utterances . In English , for instance , we can say boy ( singular ) , and we can say boys ( plural ) ; but we ca n't say -s meaning " plural , more than one " alone . We can say walk , lash , or wash , and we can say walked , lashed or washed ; but we ca n't say - ed ( pronounced in these verb forms as -t ) meaning " action in time past " alone . We need to make a distinction , which proves very fruitful in further work , between linguistic forms that can occur alone , calling them free forms , and those that ca n't occur alone , calling them bound forms . When we look at the forms of English and other languages to determine whether they are free or bound , we may get some surprises . We are usually taught that the and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms as good , book , run , etc. ; this is because our grammars use writing , not language , as their point of departure , and call anything a " word " that is written with space before and after it . But in speech itself , there are no spaces before and after " words " in normal rapid utterances ; and we find that the and a , an never occur alone or separated from other forms in normal speech ( except when we quote them artificially as linguistic examples , for instance speaking of " the definite article the " ) . So we find that among the bound forms of English we must count , not only those that we might at first consider bound ? like prefixes and suffixes ? but also some forms like the definite article the and the indefinite article a , an . In French , the bondage of individual forms has gone so far that most of the " words " of the language are really bound forms ? not  | only prefixes and suffixes , articles , prepositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all verb and noun forms , and many adverbs . This makes a difference in practice as well as in theory , too , as we find when we start to learn French ; if we try to speak each French " word " separately , treating it as if it were like our words in English , our listeners simply wo n't understand us . Then , when we have determined which forms are free and which are bound in the language we are working on , our next job is to find into what sets we can divide them , into what classes they fall . The resulting divisions we naturally call form-classes . We are all familiar with the form-classes of English , Latin , etc. , under the name of " parts of speech " , which is the name the traditional grammars give to classes like nouns , adjectives , pronouns , verbs , etc . The structure of the forms of a language is called its morphology ; and analyzing a language with a view to finding out its morphology is called morphological analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the minimum forms ( both free and bound ) in the material we have at our disposal , and then to observe carefully which forms always occur in connection with which others . In all the languages that have been studied as yet , linguisticians have always found more than one class of forms ? in other words , there has not yet been found a language without any distinct form-classes or " parts of speech " determined by one criterion or another . Working with English , for example , we soon find out that there is one class of forms that occur before the ending which is written - ed ( a spelling that stands for the three pronunciations /-ad -d - t/ , such as added /'aedad/ , organized /'orga , najzd/ walked /'wakt/ . We also find that there are other forms which never occur before this ending ; for instance , we never say directoried /da'rcktarid/ . This is a valid reason for putting forms like add , organize , walk into a separate form-class in the language  | and giving them a special label ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly well . We have to carry out this procedure for all the forms in the language , and we come out in the end with a set of classes into which all the forms will fit . By definition , we have to keep up this work until we 've devised enough classifications to cover all the forms of the language ; otherwise our description is incomplete . Most of us know already , from our school training , the classification of English forms into " parts of speech " : nouns , adjectives , pronouns , verbs , adverbs , prepositions , conjunctions , interjections . It is worth realizing that these " parts of speech " , these form-classes were set up originally over two thousand years ago , and not in connection with English or any other Germanic language . The Greek grammarians of the Alexandrian period first worked them out for their own language , and the grammarians of the time of the Roman Empire then applied them to Latin . As we might expect , the " parts of speech " fitted the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin was pretty similar to that of Greek , they fitted Latin form-classes with only a few minor difficulties and necessary adaptations . When we try to interpret English in terms of Latin and Greek form-classes , it is still not too hard ( English is indeed related , though distantly , to Latin and Greek ) ; but it will hardly work as well as it did for Latin . Nouns , adjectives , pronouns , verbs ? those we can set up for English with very little difficulty . Adverbs and prepositions , however , give us a certain amount of trouble , and so do conjunctions . These classes overlap to a large extent ? for instance , before belongs to all three : we can say before dinner or before we go home or Why did n't you tell me before ? Their use is rather different from that of their Latin and Greek equivalents ( Never use a preposition to end a sentence with ) .  | The description of English and other languages of the Indo-European family in terms of Greek and Latin parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part-of-speech system is common to the Indo-European family of languages . But when we try to force languages which are not Indo-European , which have totally different structures from Indo-European languages , into the mold of Latin , we often get sad results . In the fist place , a grammarian who works on some language of alien structure knowing only Latin and no linguistics will end up by giving , not a true picture of the language he is trying to describe , but just a list of equivalents of Latin parts of speech , declensions , and conjugations . When he finds that the native speakers of the alien language use their speech-forms differently from those of Latin , the untrained observer often concludes they must be so stupid that they ca n't distinguish one part of speech from another , and confuse ( say ) nouns and adjectives with verbs , and mix up their prepositions with their nouns . In the language of the Marshall Islands , for instance , we find three classes of forms , one of which includes various words whose meaning is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; another Marshallese form-class includes some words corresponding to English nouns , some that are like English adjectives in meaning , and some which translate English verbs ; and still another of their form-classes corresponds roughly to our pronouns . In Columns A , B , and C are given examples of these three form-classes in Marshallese : Table  | The forms in column A all have different suffixes added to them which tell who the possessor is , as in nej-ii " my child " , nej-im " thy child " , nej-in " his child " , etc. , and likewise in the other forms given in that column . Such suffixes indicating an owner are called personal posAssive suffixes ; they are found in many languages , such as Hungarian , Hebrew , and so forth . The forms in Column B can not have personal possessive suffixes added to them ; if we want to indicate an owner for any one of the forms in this column , we have to make a phrase , consisting of a-d " my property " , a-m " thy property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " followed by the Column-B-type form : thus , " my suffering " is ao madak , literally " property-my , suffering " ; " thy work " is am jerabal , literally " property thy , work " ; " his clothing " is an nuknuk , and so on . Those of column C are about like French " conjunctive " and " disjunctive " pronouns , in that they substitute for forms of the types shown in columns A and B , and are used either alone ( as are nga " I " , kwe " thou " , like French moi and toi respectively ) or are limited to occurrence before a form of type A or B , as in i-jerabal " I work " , e-bat " he , she , or it is slow " ( like French je , it respectively ) . A typically Marshallese sentence is e-bat am jerabal " you work slowly " , literally " it-is-slow property-your-work " . Now the native speaker of Marshallese is not mixed up in his own language , or confused as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form-classes do not correspond to those of Latin or English . The Marshallese have a perfectly good , useful organization of the structure of their language ; it just happens not to be the same organization that ours has . In describing Marshallese structure we can , if we wish , use our familiar labels , and call their forms of the first type " nouns " , those of the second type " verbs " , and those of the third type " pronouns " . This is a perfectly permissible procedure , but we must always remember that our terms " noun " , " verb " and so on are mere labels , which must be re-defined in terms of the language we are describing . Some of the Marshallese words we call  | " nouns " are to be translated only with English preposition-plus-pronoun phrases ; some of the words which for the Marshallese are " verbs " we would translate with English " nouns " , and others with words of the kind we term " adjectives " . There is no inherent quality about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a verb in all languages ; which part of speech a word falls into in English or in Marshallese , is determined purely by considerations of linguistic form . Nor is there anything inherently better about the English way of classifying forms than there is about the Marshallese , or vice versa ; the two types of classification are simply different , and one type of linguistic organization is as good as another . The procedure the linguistician follows in establishing the forms of a language is that of discovering partial similarities , and peeling out all the combinations of sounds that have the same meaning . For each form he gets in this way , he observes and states under what conditions he finds it ? that is to say , before or after which sounds and which ' forms , and with what meanings . Sometimes we find it convenient to operate with certain algebraic devices in our work . In English , for example , the plural of sheep is sheep , and the plural of deer is deer , whereas the normal plural of nouns is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or - es , as in hats , dishes . To be able to treat the plural forms sheep and deer on the same basis as hats , dishes , and to consider sheep and deer as also being made up of nounplus-suffix , we use the apparently artificial but very convenient book-keeping device of saying that sheep and deer have a zero-suffix . The linguistician also tries to make his statements come in the most convenient order , so as to avoid excess verbiage and repetition , especially the complicated statements of " exceptions " which clutter up so many grammars ; this often makes our descriptions quite terse , but in the end adds to their efficiency , in addition to saving paper and ink .  | Among the plural suffixes which we find added to nouns in English , there are two , zero and - en , which are relatively rare , occurring in only a few instances each . In a listing of English noun plural suffixes , these two would be given first , with an exhaustive list of the nouns they occur with . The suffixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the occurrence of which is very extensive and is determined almost wholly by the nature of the preceding phoneme . We would , therefore , make a list like the following for the English plural suffixes added to nouns ( with the exception of foreign plurals like formulae , cri-teria ) : Table Once the linguistician has discovered all the forms of the language , he goes on to classify them into meaningful units . The individual forms are the raw material of his classification in morphological analysis , just as the individual sounds were his raw material in establishing phonemes . Exactly as we grouped one or more sounds into a phoneme or significant functional unit of sound , so we do with forms , grouping one or more into a functional unit until we have done this for all the forms of the language . For such a unit of form , we have the term morpheme , made up out of the Greek root morph- meaning " form " and the same ending - eme ( meaning approximately " distinctive unit of . . . " ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sound or sounds which go to make up a phoneme  | are called its allophones , in some recent discussions the form or forms which constitute a morpheme have been called its allomorphs . In establishing the morphemes of a language , we follow the same type of technical criteria as we did for its phonemes : all the forms that go to make up a morpheme must have the same meaning , must complement each other , and must together form a group that functions as a unit in the economy of the language . We find in English such morphemes as the noun-plural-suffix , the noun-possessive-suffix , the past-tense-suffix for verbs , etc. , as well as thousands of individual " words " ( nouns , verbs , adjectives , and so on ) . Thus the various suffixes listed just before the preceding paragraph meet the requirements just given , and are to be classed together as allomorphs of the English noun-plural-suffix morpheme . They all occur added to nouns , and have the meaning of " plural , more than one . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any contrast between the various plural suffixes . Taken as a group , they fit into the pattern of the other suffixes in English , such as the possessive suffix for nouns or the past tense suffix for verbs . The linguistician works over his material until he has classified all the forms in the language as allomorphs of one morpheme or another . One of his tasks is to notice and list all the relations between allomorphs and between morphemes : the changes in phonemes ? addition , loss or replacement ? that he finds when one morpheme is joined with another , and the conditions under which they occur . In English , most nouns do not change before a plural ending ; but some do . We can see this by contrasting regular pleurals like hat ? hats , lass ? lasses , sofa ? sofas with irregular plurals of the type wife wives , life ? lives , loaf ? loaves . In these last-mentioned plurals , the final f-sound of the noun is replaced by the v-sound before the plural suffix . The same kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked by identical spelling , is found in house ? houses , wreath wreathes , etc . Another kind of replacement of phonemes is found before the zero suffix of the plural , where the vowel phoneme of the noun changes , as in goose ? geese , mouse ? mice , man ? men . Such alternations in phonemes , occurring in connection with morphemes , are called by the portmanteau adjective morpho-phonemic , an obvious ccnbination of the Greek root morph- " form " with phonemic . Other examples of morphophonemic changes are easily found . We have seen replacements of phonemes in the examples of English nouns just mentioned , and it can also be observed in English " strong verbs " like sing ? sang ? sung . Addition is found in the plurals of certain Spanish nouns ; the plural morpheme is /s/ , and before it /e/ is added to the end of the noun under certain conditions ( after consonants and with certain not all nouns ending in stressed vowel ) , as in the following : Table  | Here , the past participle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and , as we can see by comparing the column of verb-roots with the column of participles , each root loses some part of itself before the participle suffix . We can best state the relationship in a single formula by saying that " each root in the left-hand column is modified by losing the last vowel or diphthong and all that follows it " ; thus dev- " owe " is reduced to d- , to which the past participle ending -u /y/ is added , giving d-u " owed " . ( The circumflex accent mark here and the cedilla under the c in recu are mere peculiarities of spelling . ) In the root av- " have " , moreover , the entire root is lost in speech , and the past participle consists of the single phoneme /y/ , which represents the participle ending added to zero root ; but in spelling , the zero root is represented by the letter e , and the past participle is spelled eu , , though pronounced simply /y/ . Sometimes , linguisticians set up special symbols for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , it 's convenient to symbolize , for English , an /f/ which changes to /v/ , with a capital /F/ , and hence to transcribe wife , life , loaf morphophonemically as /'wajF/ , /'lajF/ , /'loF/ respectively . Such symbols are convenient in saving repetitious verbiage , as are all algebraic short-cuts of this type . After the morphemes of a language have been determined , and all the morphophonemic alternations stated , the linguistician now passes to finding out in what combinations the morphemes occur , and how he can class them as a result . This work is one which has to be undertaken separately for each language , and which can not be described in the abstract except in a very general way . Each language has different combinations in which its morphemes occur , and different meanings for the morphemes and their combinations . In some languages , such as those of the Romance or the Algonquian families , we find that many or most of the morphemes are bound ; in others , like English and Ewe ( a language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morphemes are free . In some , like Latin , Greek , aid Sanskrit , there is a great deal of irregularity in the alternation of phonemes within morphemes , and great complexity in the way bound morphemes are added to each other ( for instance , in Latin noun declensions or verb conjugations ) ; whereas in others , such as Hungarian or Turkish , there is little morphophonemic irregularity , and morphemes are added to each other in a very clear and transparent fashion . A good example from Hungarian is the word lathatatlanul " invisibly " , whose elements are all quite distinct : tat- " see " is a verb root , a free form ; - hat-  means " be able " and can occur as a free form , but compounded with other verbs makes forms that mean " be able to . . . " , as in What- " be able to see " ; - atlan is a suffix which makes negative adjectives on verbs or adjectives , so that lathatatlan means " invisible " ; and - ul is an adverb-forming suffix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as transparent as this . For over a century , it has been the fashion to make a rough classification of languages by types , distinguishing three main supposed types : " isolating " , " agglutinative " , " synthetic " . " Isolating " languages were said to be those in which most of the morphemes are free and have meaning when standing alone , as in the case of English words . " Agglutinative " referred to those whose morphemes are strung along one after the other , with individuality and meanings apparent at the first glance , As in Hungarian lathatatlanul " invisibly " . A " synthetic " language was supposed to be one of the kind in which many morphemes are bound and there is a great deal of irregularity in the alternations of phonemes within morphemes , as in such Latin noun-declensions as homo " a man " , hominis " of a man " , homini " to a man " , etc . For some American Indian languages that seemed to show extreme complexity , and that have long " words " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole English sentence , the term " polysynthetic " has been invented : a good example of such a language is Eskimo . But all these terms are only approximative and inexact , and the term " polysynthetic " is particularly unsuitable ; many familiar languages , such as French , are fully as polysynthetic as Eskimo in having long phrases consisting almost wholly of bound forms . In Eskimo we can find such utterances as /a:wlisa-ut-iss ? arsi-niarpu-4Ja/ " I am looking for something suitable for a fishline " . But such a sentence as this is almost exactly paralleled by such a French utterance as **36;1002;TOOLONG " I did n't have much work to do there " . The fact that we write the bound forms in French as separate words ( je n'y ai pas eu beaucoup de travail a faire ) disguises the fact that they are indissolubly linked in speech , nearly as much so as the elements of the Eskimo utterance . What morphemes we will find can not be predicted for any language . Individual " words " , of which each language has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language to another , and so do those morphemes that show what are usually termed " categories of inflection " . We usually think that such familiar categories as number , gender , tense or person must be universal in human speech , and we tend to look down on any language that does not show them . When we look at the evidence , however , we see that those categories are anything but universal . Many languages make no distinction in linguistic form between singular and plural , or between past , present , and future . On the other hand , we may find distinctions that are unknown to us , such as the classification of nouns according to the size or shape of the object referred to , or whether it is animate or inanimate ; or a distinction in verb forms according to whether the action is complete or incomplete .  | After determining all the morphemes of a language , we pass to a more advanced level of analysis , that of syntax , in which we analyze the structure of the larger combinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases and clauses , at least for English and West European languages in general . A phrase is a group of forms which can take the place of a single form in an utterance . For instance , we can take such a very simple English sentence as boys run , and expand the form boys by adding other elements , as follows : Table and so forth . In all these phrases , a speaker of English will consider , even without conscious analysis , that the noun boys is the most important element , no matter how far we expand the phrase ? even beyond the limits of the last expansion . This is not only because of the meaning involved , but also because of factors of linguistic form : if we use any of these phrases as the subject of the verb , the verb must be in the plural , as in the boys have come ( in  | standard English , never the boys has come ) ; and the verb being in the plural is determined by the fact that the noun boys is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form boy is the one which determines the function of the whole phrase , and so we call it the center or head of the phrase ; the parts of the phrase other than the head , we call attributes . Thus , in the phrases given in the preceding paragraph , boys is the head , and the , good , five , these , all , here , and who have eaten their supper are attributes . Most phrases in English are of this type , consisting of a head with one or more attributes ; they have their center inside themselves , and are referred to in technical language as endocentric ( a term formed from Greek endo- " inside " and centr- " center " , with the ending - ic ) . Some phrases , like those introduced in English by prepositions ( e.g. in the book , for me , by looking , to go ) , do not have this structure , and have no head or attribute ; since what determines their function , their center , is not inside themselves , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centr- + - ix ) , The linguistician 's task is to find and tell what types of phrases occur and what their structure is , in terms of the form-classes and morphemes permissible . Then , finally , we come to the structure of utterances taken as wholes . In every language , we notice that there is a certain type of single form or phrase , or combination of forms or phrases , which occurs normally as the largest usual unit of utterance : this the linguistician terms a clause . There is , in general , more than one type of clause in any given language : in English , we have clauses which consist of a noun or pronoun plus a verb ( or an equivalent phrase in each instance ) , like John runs or The six fat boys sat eating apples . We also have clauses that do not have that structure , such as Yes . No . Why ? Why not ? Not at all . Where ? In the garden . Eating apples . For English , the type of clause that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is statistically the most common of all , and is the most consistent in its structure , whereas other types of clauses in English have various structures ( endocentric phrases exocentric phrases , or special words like yes , no , or hey ! ) . Whatever type of clause is the most common and the most consistent in any given language , the linguistician calls a major clause ; all others are minor clauses . In English , therefore , a major clause is one of those whose structure is noun or pronoun + verb , and the others ( including those usually called " elliptical " ) are minor . Minor clauses are just as legitimate , linguistically , as major clauses ; they are not " incomplete " and have nothing " left out " except in comparison with major clauses ( whose definition is , after all , a matter of statistical frequency ) . Most ordinary conversation contains , in the give-and-take of speech , a large proportion of minor clauses , which is quite correct and as it should be for clear understanding : Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What for ? It 's not time yet. ? How so ? It 's noon. ? No kidding ? In that brief dialogue , there is a total of eight clauses , three major and five minor . Traditional grammars often speak slightingly of " elliptical " sentences , and imply that they are in some way incomplete or fail to convey meaning accurately ; which is not true , as a minor clause has just as definite and accurate a meaning as a major clause . In other languages , we find other types of major clause . Whereas in English a noun or pronoun is one of the basic elements of a major clause , in many languages a verb alone suffices as basic element ; for instance , in Italian the verb corre alone means " he ( she , it ) runs " , canto is " I sing " , dormiamo is " we sleep " . Traditional grammar would say in this connection that these Italian verbs have subjects which are " implicit but unexpressed " ? somewhat of a contradiction in terms , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply is not there .  | In Russian , Hungarian , and other languages , there is a type of major clause which consists just of a noun or pronoun combined with a noun or adjective , the meaning of the clause being " identity " or " equality " . For example , the Hungarian sentence ez a konyv jo means " this book is good " ; it is a combination of the noun-phrase ez a konyv " this book " plus jo " good " . Other types of clauses may be found in other languages , until we get , radically different combinations of elements in American Indian languages such as those of the Algonquian , Iroquoian , or Siouan families . The determination of phrase-structure and clause-structure is carried out in accordance with essentially the same criteria as those applied to the analysis of phonemic and morphemic structure . The linguistician 's chief task is to discover what are the smaller combinations of morphemes that can be substituted for single morphemes , and then what larger combinations can be substituted on higher levels , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave in expanding the single noun boys to a long phrase . The significant relationships in syntax , that is , how phrases and clauses are constructed , are then stated in terms of functional units , just as are those of phonology and morphology . In recent years , especially by Zellig S. Harris and his followers , techniques have been worked out for an algebraic , quasi-mathematical symbolization of all grammatical relationships , involving the establishment of formulae and equations , and their ultimate reduction to a very few formulae for a language 's basic clause types ; for English , Harris arrives , after many complicated operations , at a clause formula : N'V4 with certain pitch patterns ; in this formula , N and V stand for " noun " and " verb " respectively , and the superior numerals indicate levels on which forms or combinations of forms may be substituted by other combinations . Most present-day lin- guisticians , however , have not attained this degree of concentration or of abstract symbolism ; nevertheless , we try to be as concise and economical as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods in analyzing sounds and linguistic forms , we have necessarily had to be extremely sketchy , and to concentrate more on bald statements of basic aims and concepts rather than on specific techniques or examples . To expand this outline and to put flesh on the bare skeleton of our discussion , would require a separate book , with much fuller detail both as to the linguistician 's procedures and as to concrete exemplification . The chief lesson we need to learn from modern descriptive linguistics at this point is that the analysis of language is like that of any other systematic structure ? an operation to be carried on with a scientific approach and with objective , rigorously applied criteria . We base our observations on facts as they are and we draw our own conclusions from those facts , not what somebody says the facts or the conclusions ought to be . We must be especially careful not to let our own language or the traditional notions of Anglo-Latin grammar we learn in school lead us astray . Applied to English , our customary Latinizing grammar is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is downright wasteful . Up to a relatively recent time , English grammar books used to follow their Latin models so closely that they gave whole sets of forms ( paradigms ) which were nothing but slavish translations of Latin paradigms , such as Table  | Even our grammarians have by now seen that such a procedure tells us nothing about the structure of the English noun , since , as we can see , the English noun table does not change in such a paradigm , and such a Latinizing list as this obviously just does not fit the English language . But our English grammars still give us , all too often , such paradigms as this : Table A paradigm like this , too , is wasteful and uninforming , since only the one verb be has more than two forms in the present ( am , is , are ) , most verbs have only two forms ( do , does ) , and some have only one ( can ) ; and the difference in person and number is , in general , made clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the clause , and not by the verb form itself . It would be much simpler , clearer , and more informative to list these English verb forms in some such way as this : Table A linguistician attempting to make a complete description of a language will , of course , do as thorough a job as possible in the various types of analysis we have discussed ? phonological , morphological , and syntactical . Naturally , the completeness of his description will depend on two things : the extent and the accuracy of his information .  | If he has only meager materials , or if what he has to work o i is not very reliable , his description will of course suffer , in completeness , trustworthiness , or both . The ideal situa1 ion is that in which a trained linguistician devotes all his time and attention to describing his own language ; he can t hen be his own source of information ( or informant ) and can , over the years , note down all the forms , all the types of utterances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinalyze , classify , and describe them completely . No one has ever wholly measured up to this ideal , and perhaps it is an ideal impossible of complete attainment ; the closest t hat anyone has ever come to it was in the description which the Hindu grammarian Panini wrote of Sanskrit , the language of the Old Indian hymns of the Vedas . Next to this ideal situation , the best possible thing is a trained linguisticlan working in close collaboration with an intelligent and reliable ( not necessarily educated ! ) speaker of the language under analysis . Some good descriptions of languages have been produced in this way , in recent years notably Mary Haas 's grammar of Tunica and Stanley Newman 's grammar of Yokuts ( two American Indian languages ) . A trained linguistician working with a not so intelligent or reliable informant is the next best choice ; certainly such a combination is preferable to having a person without training in linguistic analysis attempting to work on a language , no matter how good a source of information that person may have . Informants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an informant is educated in the traditional grammar and folk-lore about his own language , he may try to tell the analyst , not what he really says , but what he thinks he ought to be saying ? exactly as Miss F'idditch told her class to say it is I and then when talking naturally said it 's me . If the informant is ignorant or stupid , he may not understand what the linguistician is  | trying to get at and hence may give him misleading information ; or the informant may develop an inferiority complex , or think he is being put through some kind of an intelligence test , or become antagonistic in some way , if he is not handled properly . But the point is that a trained linguistician can see where the difficulty lies and take steps to straighten it out , and can analyze even imperfect material and make at least some sense out of it , whereas , on the contrary , one not trained in linguistics is very likely to bungle any analysis he undertakes , even of the best material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would-be analyst has been exposed to the traditional grammar of English or Latin , for then he is likely to interpret everything he meets in terms of English or Latin structure , as expounded in the orthodox text-books . The classical examples of this kind of mis-analysis are the descriptions of " exotic " languages of America , Africa and Asia made by well-meaning but linguistically naive persons such as mis= sionaries , who discovered the categories of Latin in every language they met . As a result , it is very hard to make any sense out of many missionary grammars forced into the Procrustean bed of Latin categories . Some of the most frequent misinterpretations of linguistic structure fall into three main types , which have been facetiously termed : 1 . The " Barmecide " or " St. Patrick " school of linguistics , in which the analyst tells , not what is present in a language , but what features familiar to him are absent ( " Japanese has no grammatical gender and no distinction of number " ) . 2 . The " Ripley " school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange or unusual to him , listing idly jotted oddities ( " Ainu has a curious duplication of the French-Celtic expression for eighty ' ' four twenties ' " ) . 3 . The " Bullamacow " school , in which the analyst says  | that a language makes up for some lack or other by using separate words where we might have expected merely different grammatical forms ( " The gender of Japanese nouns is determined by sex " in that Japanese has separate words for " bull " and " cow " , " uncle " and " aunt " , etc . " ) . Interestingly enough , scientifically accurate and reasonably complete descriptions ? quite rare for any language ? have been made , up to the present ( 1948 ) , for more " queer " or " unusual " languages than for " familiar " tongues such as those of Western Europe . The reason for this is not far to seek . Modern scientific linguistics has developed fastest in those fields where it was least hampered and restricted by the influence of traditional grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little grammatical work had been done before . The great anthropologist Franz Boas was one of the leaders in this type of work , insisting ( by example and by teaching , especially in the Introduction to the Handbook of American Indian Languages ) that the 1inguistician , when approaching an American Indian language or any other , had to take it on its own merits and on its own terms , seeking to discover its own system rather than that of some different language , Latin or any other . Following Boas , Edward Sapir and Leonard Bloomfield applied this same criterion , as have their more recent disciples . But in work on languages like English , French , Italian , German , etc. , where there is a strong tradition of grammar modeled on that of Latin , most people who are at all interested in grammar have had a strong attachment to traditional grammatical terms and analysis , and have reacted strongly against any attempted change in the tradition . For instance , some recent discussions of French have used a somewhat different approach than the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that it is more convenient and concise , in dealing with the language  | itself as spoken , to start from the feminine as basic and derive the masculine from the feminine ( rather than to start from the masculine , as is usually done ) . From the outcry that was raised against this innovation , one would have thought the very foundations of grammar were being shaken . And yet this approach is not especially new , since it goes back at least to the time of the great French phonetician Paul Passy in the 1880 's . The Lord did not create the masculine grammatical gender before the feminine in the garden of Eden , nor did St. Paul declare the feminine grammatical gender to be the " weaker vessel " . The protests against the unwelcome innovation were due simply to the fact that it went counter to tradition and to custom ? a fact which was apparently to outweigh all possible convenience and usefulness the new approach might have . However , progress is gradually being made to applying to familiar European languages the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has already given such excellent results when applied to unfamiliar or " exotic " languages . There is still a great deal of work to be done in this field , and new recruits to the field of linguistics could do no better than to apply their talents to the description of a European language . If progress continues to be made , we should have , by the end of the century , at least adequately accurate and complete descriptions of European languages , as well as of many others .  | 8 . LANGUAGE HAS MEANING Language does not exist in a vacuum . Language is used in human society , for purposes of communication , and hence has meaning . Our discussion in the previous two chapters has been based on form and concerned with the analysis and description of linguistic structure , and we have paid relatively little attention to matters of meaning as such . Yet we must always keep the factor of meaning in mind , as a decisive criterion for determining whether a sound or a form has functional significance or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usefulness , and is its very reason for existence : no one would care to juggle with so complicated a system of vocal habits , unless they were able to convey meaning by it and thus profit by their use of it . We have said several times that language exists by virtue of its use among human beings as a system of signalling ; and the meaning of any linguistic signal is the situations in respect to which we use it , as we saw in Chapter 5 . We have just used a somewhat complicated way of defining meaning , especially by speaking of " the situations in respect to which " we use linguistic signals . Why could n't we have made it simpler , by saying " the situations in which " we use linguistic signals ? There is a very good reason : because linguistic signals are often used when what they refer to is not present in the actual situation between speaker and hearer . If I am at a lunch counter , see a piece of pie , and ask the waitress " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pie is present in the situation itself ? both the waitress and I can see it , and she can get it for me then and there .  | But if there is no pie on the lunch counter , I can still ask " May I have some pie , please ? " , and the word pie has the same meaning , even though no pie is present in the speaker 's and hearer 's situation . There may be some pie out in the kitchen , and the waitress may bring it to me ; or there may be none available , in which case I go without pie ; but in either case , I can refer to pie , and the word pic can have a relatively definite meaning ( " a certain kind of pastry with one kind of filling or another " ) whether there is any pie around at the given moment or not . This second type of situation is extremely frequent . The use of language in such a situation ? to refer to something that is not present ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use displaced speech is what gives language its tremendous effectiveness as a means of achieving most intricate social coordination . We can relay messages from one person to another , almost indefinitely , until in the end we attain some desired goal , such as receiving a shipment of rails from a country halfway around the globe ? and almost wholly by the use of displaced speech . One basic assumption in linguistic analysis is that in every language ( or dialect ) , some utterances are alike as to form and meaning . Otherwise , of course , if the speakers of a language could never depend on similarity of form and meaning for any given combination of sounds , from one moment to the next , communication would be impossible . But we have already noted that linguistic form is far more nearly constant , and more easily identifiable , than linguistic meaning . This is because of the relatively limited range ? of phonemes , morphemes , syntactical features ? which linguistic forms cover , and because of the immense range which is covered by the situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is to say , when we analyze all the factors in any human situation , even the simplest , in which language serves as a means of  | communication , we find that their ramifications are enormous . Even such an apparently clear meaning as that of the word pie is much more complicated than we might think at first sight . There are quite a number of different kinds of pie ( e.g. apple , blueberry , chicken , " Eskimo pie " ; shallow , deep-dish ; covered , open-top ; and so on ) , and not the same in the various parts of the English-speaking world . The chemical and physical constituents of pie , simple though they may seem , are very complex , and even , in the present state of our scientific knowledge , not wholly definable . Moreover , the meaning of the word pie , like that of every other word , differs for each situation in which it occurs ? depending on the state of mind , attitude , and so on , of the speaker and the hearer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie , for instance , may cause me pleasure or disgust , or leave me indifferent , according to how I am feeling , how hungry I am , the previous experiences I may have had with pie , and so forth . Emotional factors such as these last are usually left out of dictionary definitions ( it would be hard to include them ) , but they are very real factors in the total meaning of any linguistic signal in each specific situation in which it is used . To give a complete definition even of pie would be a tremendous task , and it would be much harder in the case of admittedly more elusive terms such as justice , love ( noun and verb ) , or matter . But the meaning of any specific linguistic form is purely arbitrary . There is no underlying connection , no inherent and inescapable relationship , between any linguistic form and what it signifies . The same animal is referred to in English as dog , in French as chien , in German as Hund , in Hungarian as kutya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . From the point of view of pure logic , there is no relationship between any of these combinations of sounds and the animal " canis familiaris " to which they all  | refer . It is wholly a matter of social convention ; the meaning of words is something determined by the usage of the speakers of a language , not by some divine fiat ; and the only reason we make the word dog refer to an animal of the species " canis familiaris " and the word cat refer to one of the species " felis Lybica domestica " , rather than vice versa , is that we , as speakers of modern English , are in the habit of doing so , and have learned this habit from other speakers of English . On the other hand , different languages use the same combinations of sounds with entirely different meanings : the English word do means " perform , act " and is a verb , whereas French doux ( pronounced almost exactly like English do ) is an adjective meaning " sweet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning " thou , you " . All meaning reflects our experience of the universe we live in . It is a commonplace to say that if we have had no experience of something , then we do not know what it means ? not only linguistically , but also emotionally and in our social adjustment . Yet our experience of the universe is something which , in itself , is indivisible , and any division we set up in our experience ? as the meanings of our language inevitably lead us to do ? is of necessity conventional . The spectrum , for instance , is a continuous scale of light-waves , whose length ranges from 40 to 72 hundredthousandths of a millimeter ; but our language and its meanings cut the spectrum for us into various shades , from violet through indigo , blue , green , green , yellow , orange to red , thus segmenting our experience for us into quite arbitrary divisions . For colors which the human eye can not perceive and hence experience directly , our language simply offers no terms ? and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terminology referring to kinship ought , theoretically , to be quite easy and simple , and yet even in English our kinship terminology  | shows surprising quirks and gaps . We have , for instance , the words brother and sister , but no popular term for " person born of the same parents " without reference to sex . The anthropologist uses the term sibling in this meaning , but it still remains a learned term . When we go from one language to another , it is immediately obvious that the segmentation of experience differs , in the meanings which different languages ascribe to forms . This is true even ( and especially ) in what we might think the most simple and self-evident words and meanings : be , get , have , do . No two languages have exactly the same range of meanings , covered by comparable forms . In Spanish , the meaning of English be is covered by three verbs : estar and haber , referring to " being " in a given location or not adhering to a fixed norm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fixed norm . To translate our word get into any other language , we have to resort to half a dozen or more different equivalents , as we can see from the various meanings of get in such expressions as to get ( " obtain " ) some money , I got ( " became " ) sick , he got ( " arrived " ) home after midnight , he got ( " received " ) a prize , I 've got to ( " must " ) go home , or do you get ( " understand " ) met For the speaker of French , the verb se promener ( literally " to promenade oneself " ) covers all that segment of experience involving making an excursion or short pleasure trip , no matter by what means ; if he looks for a single , simple English equivalent , he 'll be disappointed , and will have to resort to various expressions like take a walk , go for a ride , etc. , which force him to specify what means of locomotion are involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " exotic " languages ( e.g. Japanese or some American Indian language ) , the entire classification of experience , even in the grammatical categories of the language , is totally different from what we are accustomed to .  | Yet , despite all the difficulties in the way of analyzing meaning , the study of meaning ( semantics ) has made considerable progress , and linguisticians have been able to note certain facts of considerable importance . One is that a great many linguistic forms have more than one meaning , that is , are used in more than one type of situation . The word book can have several different meanings , as we pointed out earlier ( p. 57 ) ; and we could cite a great many other examples , such as these chosen at random : try ( I 'll try to do it ; I 'll try it meaning " I 'll sample it " ; they 're going to try him for murder ; it 's enough to try anybody 's patience ; I 'll try out the fat ) , or party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party line on the telephone ; he was party to the crime ; the party of the first part ; this party meaning " this person " ) . Whenever a form has two or more meanings , its users almost always regard one of them as the central meaning ( also called the " literal " meaning ) and the others are considered marginal ( or " transferred " or " metaphorical " ) meanings . Sometimes it is hard to tell whether a given combination of phonemes represents a single form with two or more widely divergent meanings , or two or more distinct forms , as in the case of ear ( the human ear vs. an ear of corn ) . In general , the central meaning of a form is the meaning in which we use it most consistently , and which we assume it has unless there is some special reason to look for a transferred or marginal meaning . As Leonard Bloomfield says ( Language , p. 149 ) : " Sometimes the practical feature that forces us to take a form in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smith is a fox is bound to be taken in transferred meaning , because we do not call real foxes Mr. ' or give them familynames . He married a lemon forces us to the transferred meaning only because we know that men do not go through a marriage ceremony with a piece of fruit . "  | The existence of transferred meanings and their relation to the central meaning of any given form is a thing which of course varies from one language to another and also , within the same language , in the course of time . Many metaphors which we think are normal and self-explanatory seem quite foreign to speakers of other languages ; no speaker of French would ever use oiseau " bird " in such transferred meanings as " fellow , guy " ( He 's a queer old bird ) or " a Bronx cheer , or other kind of derisive or unfavorable reception " ( He gave me the bird ) . Some metaphors common in earlier English seem out-of-date to us now , like Mark Twain 's frequent use of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some which are very common now , like off the beam or in the groove , would have been incomprehensible in Mark Twain 's time ? partly because the practical situations on which they are based ( radio , phonograph records ) did not exist . In addition to transferred meanings , there 's another kind of supplementary value that forms can have . Analysts of meaning distinguish between denotation , or the meaning a form has for all those who use it , and connotation , or the special additional meaning the same form may have for some one speaker or for certain speakers . In general , our dictionaries give us only the denotation of a form ? as much of its meaning as can be stated objectively and for all the speakers of the language . Mathematicians and scientists strive to avoid all connotations in the meaning of their terms , a perfectly valid and attainable goal in the specific and carefully delimited type of work they are doing . Sometimes purists tell us we should do likewise in everyday speech , but such an aim is hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any human being 's life and environment ? and , even if it could be attained , it would remove from our speech much that makes it in- teresting and living , including all poetry and imaginative use of language . Connotations may be individual in their extent ? that is , only one speaker may have a special connotation for a form ? or they may extend to whole groups of speakers or even the majority of those who use a form . Each of us has some words which convey a special flavor , for us alone . The word swerve , for example , has for me a very unpleasant connotation , due to its use in connection with a childhood accident ; whereas , on the other hand , because I happen to be an electric railway enthusiast , the words street-car , elevated , subway fill me with a much warmer glow of pleasure than they give to the majority of their users . An individual or private connotation of this type is just as real as a more widespread one , but , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no communicative value . Of the more widespread connotations , perhaps the most common are those which ascribe words to cultural ( social ) levels and to functional varieties . A form like ai n't or I seen has the same denotation as is n't or I saw , but quite a different connotation : many people think that the first pair connote undesirable characteristics on the part of the speaker , such as ignorance or illiteracy or carelessness , whereas the second pair carry a connotation of desirable characteristics . We have already seen , in Chapter 2 , that these connotations are primarily a matter of social or cultural standing , and hence we may speak of cultural levels in the connotation of forms ; linguisticians distinguish primarily between standard ( socially acceptable ) and nonstandard , which includes sub-standard ( not socially acceptable ) . Among non-standard types of speech there are a number of different levels , including urban sub-standard ( T'oity-t'oid Street ) and rural dialect ( Scottish a hae nano for " I have n't got any " ) . Often confused with cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional varieties of speech ? determined , not by the cultur Al standing of the speaker , but by their use in speaking or writing , and differing according to the degree of familiarity they connote . There are some words or turns of speech that we would use only in a formal situation , such as the " subjunctive " be in unless this be so , or the expression busy though he may be , or such items of vocabulary as vociferation for " yelling " , contingency for " chance " , enumeration for " listing " , and so on . Most of our formal vocabulary has been taken over from Greek or Latin by men of letters or others with special learning , and hence is called learned vocabulary . There is a whole range of different situations , from the purely formal through the semi-formal ( as in a university lecture ) to the wholly informal ( private correspondence or familiar conversation ) ; and , to a certain extent , we feel that some forms are suited to one type of situations and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of a speech from the platform or the pulpit ; he has bats in his belfry is extremely informal ; and most of our vocabulary and usage falls in between these two extremes . These two contrasts ? that between standard and substandard , and that between formal and familiar ? combine to produce four main types of usage ( given here with examples ) : Familiar standard : He did it too soon Formal standard : He did it prematurely ; am I not ? Familiar sub-standard : He done it too soon ; ai n't I ? Formal sub-standard : Between you and I ; are n't I ? The last-mentioned category is the kind of speech we often hear from sub-standard speakers who try unsuccessfully to use formal standard language on occasions which they feel demand it . Prof. John Kenyon cites , as further examples of semi-literate or sub-standard formal usage , a radio speaker 's announcement " Sun day will be Mother 's  | Day " ( which many hearers misunderstood , thinking he had said Some day will be Mother 's Day ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one two three " ( = from one to three ) . Other types of connotation , often on the formal or learned side , are those of archaisms , foreignisms , and technical terminology . It sounds either Biblical or Shakespearean to use the - th ending in the third person singular of a verb : he goeth , she cometh ; and even more archaic to use ye ( as in Hear ye ! ) or the second person singular pronouns thou , thee and the corresponding verb forms in - (e)st : thou singest , or I tell thee . If we use a sprinkling of foreign words or phrases in our speech or writing , we convey to our hearers the impression that we know more than one language , and also ( often ) the idea that we are seeking the exact term to refer to some strange thing or concept , as when we speak of Panzer divisions , of the Politburo , of Indian aspirations towards svaraj ( self-government ) , or of Puerto Rican jibaros ( hillbillies ) . Borrowings from other dialects of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight affectation in the use of specifically British vocabulary such as cove for " guy , fellow " , lift for " elevator " or tram for " street-car " . Technical terms have all kinds of different connotations , which depend essentially on the social standing of the calling they are associated with , such as bebop and gut-bucket from jazz , stick ' em up ! and scram ! from criminals ' vocabulary , or schistosomiasis and beta-haemolytic streptococcus from medical terminology . We can also give a humorous twist to our speech , by making use of mock-forms , which have a purposely ridiculous connotation . We make fun of learned or formal vocabulary by inventing and using such words as discombobulate , busticate , ruction , rambunctious ( and the verb formed on the last-mentioned , rambunct ) . Students plowing their way  | through Shakespeare or Milton often intentionally add the ending - est where it does n't belong , together with humorous use of thou and thee : in high school we used to say such things as Wiltest thou comest to the officest with me-est @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of foreign speakers ' accent in English , as in the following quotation : " Pugsy . . . appeared to have a fixed idea that the Italian language was one easily mastered by the simple method of saying ' da ' instead of the ' , and tacking on a final a ' to any word that seemed to him to need one . " Say , kid , ' he began , has da rent-a man come yet-a ? ' . " ? P. G. Wodehouse , Psmith , Journalist . Slang is distinguished as such by its connotations , which are those of extreme familiarity ( sometimes sub-standard , sometimes not ) and of very recent introduction . On the margin of the standard language , there are always new words or new meanings for old words being introduced , which at the time of their introduction have a strongly slangy flavor . Very often these new usages do not become permanent , or they linger in the speech-habits of only one age-group ; when I was a child , my parents would often tell me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that word , preferring to tell someone to scram ! . I later found that skidoo ! and twenty-three ! , both in the meaning of " get out ! " , were slang usages current in the early 1900 's ; the first of them I remember from my childhood in the 1910 's and 20 's , and the second I never heard in normal speech . Similarly , the expressions funny ha-ha and funny peculiar , as slightly jocular ways of distinguishing the two meanings of funny , were current in the 1930 's and still are in my own usage ; they seem out-of-date to younger persons . On the other hand , some slang expressions " catch on " and we soon forget that they began as slang ; we now  | speak of jazz music , eating a sandwich at a snack bar , or riding in a jeep , without realizing that jazz , snack , sandwich , bar in the sense of " eating or drinking place " and jeep were slang at one time or another . In fact , all neologisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin as slang , except in those branches of terminology where ( as in scientific and philosophical study ) there is an established tradition of word-coinage or re-definition . Also coming under the head of connotations are the factors of taboo on sex and other obscene terms , which we discussed in Chapter 2 ( pp. 19-21 ) . Here , too , there are various degrees of taboo or impropriety ; I can , under certain circumstances , speak or write the word whore , whereas there are some other words which I know , but which I would rarely speak and never write . Of this same type , essentially , are the connotations of ominous meaning that we attach to some words , so that we replace them by other , less strongly connotative expressions ( euphemisms ) : in our society , with our intense fear of death , we 're often afraid to say if I should die , and instead we say if anything should happen to me ; some people are afraid to mention such words as syphilis or venereal disease , and substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a certain extent , these ominous connotations are unreasoning survivals of older superstitions to the effect that a name has some magical power of its own , and that hence naming some evil thing or spirit might bring its evil workings upon us ; this was why , for example , the Greek goddesses of revenge , the Furies or Erinnyes ( " Furious Ones " ) , were called by the Greeks , not by their real names , but Eumenides ( " Gracious Ones " ) . And yet , despite such observations as these , the linguistician can not at present say very much about meaning , because meaning lies largely outside his field of analysis .  | The linguistician can simply define linguistic forms and their approximate meaning , but he can not do the work of the chemist , the physicist , the anthropologist , etc. , in analyzing and defining the further ramifications of ultimate physical and social structure involved . To define meaning completely and exactly , even that of the simplest linguistic form , we should have to have a complete knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything going on inside the body and head of every speaker and every hearer . This is manifestly impossible . Meaning remains something approximate and indefinite , much more so than linguistic form ; and yet we are left with the paradox that meaning , even with the difficulties it presents us ( both the analyst and the unreflecting speaker of a languate ) , is what makes language effective in human society . Perhaps future scholars will discover a way in which linguisticians can state meaning as precisely and as concisely as they can do for form ; when this is done , we shall be able to correlate form and meaning without running the risk , as we do at present , of losing sight of the simple essentials of form in the maze of meaning .   Not everybody talks the same way ; this is a commonplace whose truth we can all observe . People of different social classes , of different occupations , of different cultural groups in the same community , will show variations in their speech even from one individual to another , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their speech from one place to another : variations in sounds , in forms , in arrangements of forms , and in vocabulary and meaning . If you go into a drug store east of the Alleghenies and ask for a milk shake , you are likely not to get ice cream in the mixture of milk and syrup ; west of the Alleghenies , you will get ice cream , in greater quantity the farther west you go . If you ask for tonic outside of Eastern New England , you are likely to get some kind of hair restorative or other liquid for improving your health or bodily condition ; but in an area whose center is Boston and which extends outward for about fifty to a hundred miles , a request for tonic will get you a bottle of ginger ale , root beer , or some other drink of the kind that elsewhere is called " soda pop " . If you 're from south of the 40th parallel , you are likely to have the z-phoneme in your normal pronunciation of the third consonant of greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to have the s-phoneme . This kind of variation is so widespread that we all recognize its existence , and we can normally tell by a person 's speech at least what general part of the country he comes from ( New England , the Southeast , the Midwest , etc . ) . Those who have special training in the study of regional variation in speech can often come much closer to placing people 's geographical origins by the way they speak . Dr. Henry Lee Smith Jr. , in his radio program " Where Are You From ? " from 1940 to 1942 , would under- take , on the basis of a person 's pronunciation of certain key words , to guess that person 's home and not be more than fifty miles off ? and he was correct in over eighty percent of the guesses he made . Such a performance as Dr. Smith 's is made possible by the fact that not only the social and occupational variations of speech , but also the geographical variations , follow definite patterns and can be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out about geographical variations in language , first of all goes to as many places as he can in the region he 's interested in , and finds out how people talk in those places . If we are interested in tracing the regional variations of only one or two features of speech in pronunciation , forms , or vocabulary ? such as the meanings of milk shake , or the terms for " earthworm " , or the pronunciation of the word on ? we can listen to the speech of many informants from many points . If , on the other hand , we want information on a great many matters , or have only a relatively short time at our disposal , we must of necessity restrict our investigation to a smaller number of speakers and places . The places whose speech we investigate are often called the network of points we cover , and we study material gathered from a wide-meshed or fine-meshed network in an area according as there are few or many points and/or speakers we have been able to observe ; naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our observations can be . We have to be sure , too , that the speakers we have as informants represent the normal speech of their localities ; for instance , a person ( like the present writer ) born in North Carolina and brought up in Minnesota , New York City , New Jersey and Illinois would not be a very trustworthy source for information on the speech-patterns of Ithaca , N. Y. ( where he now resides ) . The linguistician makes just as close and accurate ob- servation of his informants ' speech as he can . Ordinary spelling is , for all topics but those of vocabulary , far too uncertain and inaccurate to serve our needs for careful registration of the sounds we hear ; therefore , we use the narrowest of phonetic transcriptions to record what our informants say . ( The phonemic pattern of each local dialect may be different from that of others , and so we must take care not to let phonemic interpretations or simplifications creep into our phonetic transcriptions at this point ; for geographical study of language , non-phonemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than phonemic distinctions . ) We start out our investigation into regional variations of speech with a questionnaire , determined by preliminary study , and containing a list of the words and expressions we want our informants to give us their customary equivalents for . We ask each informant for the same items , so that we 'll have comparable material for each point when we 're through : " What do you call this ? pointing to a table , a pen , a hat , etc . " ; " What do you call the serenade they gave a newly-married couple ? " " How do people call pigs ( cows , etc . ) ? " . As the informant gives us the answers , we take them down in careful phonetic notation , usually with one or more carbon copies to minimize the risk of loss . Here , as in working with an informant in general , the linguistician has to be careful , in the first place not to offend or frighten the informant , and also to avoid ( as far as possible ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trick the investigator , or unintentionally give him " elegant " or " fancy " forms which it later turns out they themselves never use in normal situations . When we have our materials gathered ? and , if possible , phonograph records made also ? we collect them all together and edit them . When they have been carefully edited and prepared for publication , they can be published   in any one of various ways : we can print our transcriptions on an ordinary page , in columns , like a set of logarithmic or similar tables , with , say , a single column for each informant whose speech we investigated , and all the responses to a single question printed across the page on the same line ; or we can have our page arranged in the shape of a map , with the informants ' responses placed on the map in the relative positions of their localities , as MAP 1 shown in the sample map above . This latter way of reproducing the material is perhaps the best , and certainly the easiest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite costly , since the lettering usually has to be done by hand and the printing costs are very high . A collection of such tables or maps , each one giving us the geographical distribution of informants ' responses for a single item ( word or phrase ) , is called a linguistic atlas , and is an extremely valuable source of information for our knowl- edge of present-day speech and of its past history . There are linguistic atlases either completed or in process of planning or completion for many countries ( Germany , France , Italy , Corsica , Rumania , Catalonia , Spain and Portugal , the Mediterranean basin , etc . ) . For the United States , a three-volume atlas of New England ( over 600 maps ) was published in 1940-3 , and gathering and editing of the materials is well in hand for the remaining East Atlantic states and under way for the northern Middle West . When the geographical distribution of words and phrases has been gathered and recorded in maps and tables , the linguistician can then set to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing we do is to mark the divisions between features of speech ( pronunciation , forms , syntactical combinations , vocabulary ) ; such a linguistic division or boundary , setting off one linguistic area against another , is called an isogloss . If we take such a map as the one reproduced on p. 136 , we can draw a line around the area , say , in which the word tonic is used in the meaning of " soda pop " , thus marking the isogloss dividing the tonic area from other areas . ( Note well that an isogloss such as this , drawn on the basis of a map which represents only a sampling of localities and informants , is of necessity approximate , and is not to be taken as an absolute . ) Since it would be in general undesirable to mark up the maps of the original atlas we are working on ? after all , a linguistic atlas is an expensive thing , which very few people can own for themselves and which an individual would not like to spoil even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on blank maps or base maps , which are outline maps of the region covered by the atlas we are working on , with numbers to correspond to each of the atlas 's numbered localities . We can simply draw isoglosses on the base map as we look at   the materials contained in the atlas , or we can make conventional marks ( squares , circles , triangles , plus-marks , x 's , etc. , in various colors ) to represent whatever features we want to ? contrasting sounds , word types , etc. ? of the map we are studying . The map for tonic shows various kinds of conventional marks ; that reproduced on p. 137 gives isoglosses , in this case for the area within which Latin - rj-  changed into - j-  in Tuscany . Once the mechanical aspect of transferring and abstracting the content of the atlas maps or tables is taken care of , we can proceed to making deductions about the various areas and their relation to each other . We find three main types of area , according to the prevalence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of the areas . In some areas , a given sound or form ? like tonic in the area around Boston ? is universally prevalent , in a compact region centering around a specific point or focus : this type of area is called a focal area . In others , such a feature as tonic for " soda pop " is present only sporadically and at certain points ; or , if we are comparing more than one isogloss ( as in the map on p. 137 , which shows the extent of the sound j coming from Latin - rj-  in Tuscany and nearby regions of Italy ) , we find that there is considerable spread between the various isoglosses and that they flare out or cross and re-cross each other . This indicates that we find whatever feature we are studying only partially , and not in all words ; an area showing sporadic distribution or spreading , flaring isoglosses is called a graded area . Finally , we often discover some features only in areas which are outlying or cut off from frequent communication with other areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; such areas we term marginal , as in the map on p. 138 . In general , we can place a historical interpretation on the geographical distribution of a linguistic feature . In the   simplest cases , the presence of a word ( sound , form , etc. ) in a focal area like that of tonic around Boston or of - jfrom Latin - rj-  in Tuscany , tells us that it has been there for a long time , long enough to have become thoroughly customary in the whole area and to have edged out all competitors . Its presence in a graded area ( like the outer Tonic IN NEW ENGLAND edges of the tonic area or that of Tuscan - j-  ) tells us that there is a spread taking place or that there has been one in recent times ; but we can not tell simply from the map alone in which direction the spread is taking place , and whether , say , tonic or Tuscan - j-  from Latin - rj-  is gaining or losing ground . But if we find a feature only in marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest of the territory we 're dealing with , the conclusion ? spout lneaus resporue : the /Arm is regularly used by the jot orison ! o prompted response the term is familiar to the informant but not his customary ohe Tonic in the sense of ' soda water ' is confined to the wholesale trade area of Boston The subsidiary trade centers of eastern ? ? ? New Fnyland ( Providence , Worcester and Portland ) appear to be passive in this instance .   ara within outer limits of aio ? ? is usually that a feature now evident only in the marginal areas was once more widespread , and used to cover a much larger territory . The study of the geographical distribution of language ,   linguistic geography , is of great importance for our understanding both of linguistic history and of present-day The shaded areas show those parts of the French speech-area in which /k/ has not been shifted to /c/ or /ts/ , or later developments thereof , in cheval " horse " from Proto-Romance /kabdllu/ . After map 269 of the Atlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught us , above all , that language covers territory ? not only in the static meaning of that expression , but more especially in its dynamic meaning .   Language is constantly on the move : features of speech are spreading from one place to another . The instance of tonic in New England is instructive : we can see from the map that its extent , in the meaning " soda pop " , correlates closely with the wholesale trade area centering on Boston . When this type of drink was introduced in Boston , it was termed tonic , presumably to induce customers to favor it because of supposed medicinal values , or else to avoid restrictions of one type or another ; and , along with its distribution to wholesale dealers who bought from Boston jobbers , the term tonic spread . Together with this type of drink , customers in the Boston wholesale trade area became familiar with the name tonic , both the drink and the name being at first importations from Boston . Importations of this kind are known as borrowings ; and linguistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language originate in a given place ? usually a cultural center such as Boston or New York in America , or London , Paris , Madrid , Florence in Europe ? and then are borrowed from the cultural and linguistic focus of diffusion by other , outlying areas . A feature which originates in a given place is at first an innovation in contrast to whatever preceded it , as was tonic meaning " soda pop " at one time in Boston , or - j-  taking the place of - rj-  in the speech of Tuscany . The innovation is then borrowed , i.e. imitated by the speakers of the surrounding territory ? usually , though not always , because an innovation coming from such a cultural center as Boston or Florence enjoys prestige , higher social standing . As the innovation spreads , the outer edge of its area presents the appearance of a graded area , and in the inner core of the area it eventually replaces all its competitors so that the central part of its territory comes to be a focal area . Finally , the defeated competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of spread is carried through to its   conclusion , even the marginal areas are wiped out and the innovation is solidly evidenced throughout the entire territory . This process takes place , not only with individual sounds and forms , but with entire complexes of linguistic features , i.e. with entire dialects . In this way , the dialect of a given region which is politically , economically , or culturally dominant in a country comes to be the standard language of the country as a whole . For instance , in the early Middle Ages in Europe , national states were almost non-existent or very weak , and the largest effective political unit was the duchy or province , or in some countries ( such as Italy ) the city-state . Correspondingly , the largest linguistic unity was the regional dialect , and before about 1200 or 1300 most writings in the vernacular were specifically identifiable , not as " French " or " Italian " or " Spanish " , but as Norman , Picard , Leonese , Asturian , Milanese , Genoese , Venetian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four hundred years the various national states ( France , Spain , England ) became essentially unified politically and economically ; and each , one particular region ( normally that of the capital : Paris , Madrid , London ) set the pattern for the rest of the country , its language going along with its political , economic and cultural dominance . Significantly enough , Italy was not unified politically until 1870 , considerably later than the rest of the countries of Western Europe . Up to 1870 , Italy was divided into small fragmentary city-states , duchies and minor kingdoms ; and its linguistic development went along with its political history ? a single national standard language did not find universal acceptance until after political unification in 1870 . Even the economic importance of Florence from about 1250 on , and its cultural supremacy from about 1350 on , were not able to bring about the unquestioned dominance of its language ? on which modern Italian is based ?  | as the political sway of Madrid , Paris , and London did in their respective countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , the local dialects are of equal social standing : in the early Middle Ages , the speech of Northeastern England , of Scotland , of Southern England were all equally acceptable , and each person spoke and wrote without hesitation in his own dialect . Likewise in France , Spain , Italy and the other countries of Europe ; in Italy , for instance , thirteenth- and fourteenth-century writers used their own local speech , very little modified under the influence of other Italian dialects : Bonvesin da Riva of Milan wrote in Milanese , Jacopone da Todi of Umbria wrote in Umbrian , the anonymous Roman author of the famous Life of Cola di Rienzo ( the fourteenth-century republican rebel whom Wagner dramatized in his opera Rienzi ) used his native Roman dialect , and so forth . But as soon as the dialect of any particular place or region comes to acquire special prestige for non-linguistic reasons such as political , economic or cultural dominance , then speakers of other dialects begin to have an inferiority complex concerning their normal native speech , and want to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation then forces the local types of speech into an unfavorable position vis-a-vis the standard language , and use of a local dialect comes to have the connotation of lower social or cultural standing . In the European countries in general , this happened by stages : there first arose regional standard languages ? in France , those of the region around Paris ( the so-called Ile de France , whose language is termed Francien ) , of Picardy , of Normandy , of Champagne , of southern France ( Provencal , itself based on the speech of several sub-regions ) ; in Italy , those of Sicily , of Tuscany , of Lombardy , etc . Then a single region acquired political , economic , or cultural dominance over the   others , and consequently linguistic dominance as well , so that the various regional standards were in their turn relegated to the status of inferior social acceptability : Francien became the basis of modern standard French , because Paris became the capital of France ; Castilian became the basis of standard Spanish , because Madrid became the capital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of standard English . Finally , with the development of literature in the standard language , a split occurs in the standard language itself , a more formal or literary variety being distinguished from the less formal , everyday , colloquial variety ; and for some whose ideal is that of static perfection defined as a set of rigid norms , the literary language ( or , in some instances , even a particular sub-dialect of the literary language , such as poetic usage ) becomes the exclusive standard , in contrast to which even colloquial standard is unacceptable . In the meanwhile , especially in large urban areas such as those of Paris or London , innovations have gone on arising , as they always do ? but they have arisen too late to be included in the standard language as it was at the time of its rise to dominance . So , for instance , the cockney of London " drops his h 's " , that is , no longer has the hphoneme at the beginning of a word , saying ' ouse instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of heat , and so forth . The lower-class speaker of Parisian French merges the phonemes represented in spelling by a and a ( front and back low vowels , respectively ) and generalizes the latter in all positions . He converts the element - t- il ( roughly equivalent to does he ... ? , in such a question as donne-t-il ? " does he give ? " ) into an interrogative particle , usually written - t'y , which he adds to all statements to turn them into questions , as in to vas-t'y ? " are you going ? " . The Florentine develops , in place of the single unvoiced plosive stops p t k between vowels , the corresponding fricative sounds , and says la hasa " the house " instead of la  | casa . Other speakers of the standard language ? from the dominant center or from other regions ? then feel that these later , obviously lower-class innovations are not socially acceptable , and reject them as " vulgarisms " ; witness the attitude of the ordinary speaker of British English towards " dropping one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Yorker 's pronunciation of , say , bird . The conflict that then arises has two further consequences : 1 ) misunderstanding of the nature or condition of the unwelcome innovation ; 2 ) over-correction . For instance , the non-Tuscan speaker of standard Italian often misunderstands the conditions under which the Tuscan substitutes a fricative for a plosive stop , and thinks that the Tuscan would say also a hasa " to ( the ) house " where standard Italian would write a casa but pronounce accasa ; actually , the Tuscan speaker would say la hasa " the house " , but accasa " to ( the ) house " . Likewise , the ordinary American thinks that lower-class New Yorkers say boid for bird , oil for earl , etc. , and , taking his cue from the approximate spelling boid , oil , thinks that the New Yorker uses the vowel sound of for in such words . Actually , the New Yorker shares this particular feature of pronunciation with a good part of the Eastern seaboard , and does not use the vowel sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard this pronunciation from natives of Princeton ( New Jersey ) , Virginia , Tennessee , and Texas , as well as from many upper-class New Yorkers . In more concise , technical language , the difference is this : the New Yorker , etc. , pronounces bird as ' bAid , with a very short A sound , and with the tongue somewhat to the rear in the mouth ; his naive hearer equates this back A with his own a sound , and thinks , wrongly , that the New Yorker is saying ' baid , without understanding the New Yorker 's phonemic pattern .  | People are also often likely to misunderstand the social extent and acceptability of such a later innovation in the regional dialect on which the standard language is based . The supposedly " vulgar " pronunciation written boid , oil for " earl " , etc. , is normal in all of New York City and wide areas on the Eastern seaboard , and I have heard it from such obviously acceptable speakers as heads of departments in Hunter College and Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( they call it " confusion " ) of the two phonemes usually spelled in and un , or of the two phonemes usually spelled e and e , is vulgar , and characteristic of extremely low-class speech in Paris ; but in fact , all we need do is to keep our ears open , to realize that these phonemic mergers are to be heard from all Parisians of whatever class , even from such as will insist vehemently that they never merge the phonemes in question . Then , the speakers of non-acceptable regional or social dialects try ( naturally ) to acquire more acceptable speech patterns . But neither they nor their critics have the requisite linguistic training to analyze the situation objectively and accurately , and all the non-standard speaker has to go by is a blanket condemnation ? often based on misunderstandings such as those we have just been discussing ? of some particular feature of his speech . The cockney who has been told he must not " drop his aitches " comes to the conclusion that he ought to put an h-sound at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : since he has been condemned for saying ' Arry , ' Erbert , ' Ounslow for standard Harry , Herbert , Hounslow , he puts in an h in such words as Alice , Anna , or Ealing , and makes them into Halice , Hanna , Healing . This process is known as over-correction or hyper-urbanism . Catullus , the Roman poet , made fun of a man who over-corrected on his aitches , a certain Arrius who pronounced chommoda for commoda  | and hinsidias for insidias ; finally he left Rome for Syria , and everybody 's ears had a rest , until the frightful news came from the East that the Ionian sea was now the Hionian sea . Catullus implies that Arrius was a social parvenu , whose ancestors had been slaves ; and , in fact , over-correction is a thing we find very often among people who are insecure about their normal speech and go too far in imitating what they take to be " better " usage . In the same way , a person from the country who said Marthy for Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he had been taught that the final vowel in his pronunciation of those words was " incorrect " , would easily go too far , and say Cincinnata for the standard form Cincinnati , or Missoura for Missouri , substituting in such words the final vowel of sofa for an actually quite normal and correct -i . In some instances , as in the local pronunciations of Cincinnati and Missouri , such an over-correction becomes established as the regional standard . When a standard language has been established , it often borrows forms from other dialects ( regional , social , or occupational ) , for various reasons : distinctive meanings , humorous connotations , or to establish or avoid pleasant or unpleasant connotations of one sort or another . The Northerner who has come in some contact with the social structure of the Southern states may use the term po ' white trash , with an approximation of the Southern pronunciation po ' , although in all other situations he will use his normal pronunciation for poor . Such expressions as thar she blows ! ( originally from whalers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or petrol or tram ( British English ) have the flavor of the regional or social types of speech from which they were taken . A good example of dialect borrowing for favorable connotation is French amour " love " . As this word goes back to the Latin stem amor- , we should normally expect ameur just as hora " hour " gave heure and dolor- " pain , sorrow " gave douleur ; but we actually find ameur only in rustic dialects and with the meaning " rut ( period of sexual excitement in animals ) " . The French form has the vowel normally spelled ou , not that normally spelled eu as we would expect ; it is clearly a borrowing from Provencal ( Southern French ) , in which the development to ou is to be expected in this word . We know that in the Middle Ages Provencal was the prime literary language of love , and that the Provencal poets formulated and expressed doctrines of courtly love which found widespread acceptance throughout the European upper classes ; we conclude that Northern French ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form amour from Provencal because of the literary and social prestige of the form , and that the indigenous ameur was then relegated to the meaning of " animal love , rut " . Borrowings of this type are not limited , of course , to the relations between one dialect and another , or between standard language and dialect . Borrowings between mu- ' tually unintelligible languages are also very frequent ; we are all familiar with such foreign words in English as blitzkrieg , kamikaze , Gay-Pay-Oo , spaghetti , smorgasbord , chile con carne , fortissimo , au revoir . We are perhaps less aware of the fact that many other words , which to us seem completely familiar and form part of our everyday usage , are of foreign origin : of the words in the first part of this sentence , for instance , the following are wholly or partly of Latin origin : fact , completely , familiar , form , part , usage , foreign , and origin . Every language has foreign borrowings of one sort or another , even German or Finnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage tribes . Often , indeed , the borrowings have taken place so long ago or have become so familiar that the speakers of the language no longer recognize them as borrowings , as in the case of our chair ( from Latin cathedra ) or table ( from  | Latin tabula ) , or of German Kaiser " emperor " from Latin Caesar , Strasse " street " from Latin ( via ) strata " paved ( way ) " , or Kreide " chalk " from Latin creta . From more remote languages , we have in English such words as sugar , from Arabic , and ultimately from Sanskrit carkara " gritty substance " ; thug , from an East Indian word ; or squash , from an American Indian language . There is not and has not been for thousands of years a " pure " language , in the sense of one without any borrowings from a foreign language . Sometimes purists want us to avoid all words that are not of " pure Anglo-Saxon origin " , not realizing that if we were to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of our vocabulary , and indeed of the part that is most useful in its analytical and technical function . Borrowing between languages normally occurs in connection with cultural contact ( here we are using the term culture in its broadest sense referring to all activities which men learn , from their birth on ) . Where a cultural borrowing is made , that is , where people take over a certain custom or thing from others , the word referring to it often goes along with it , as in many instances we can all call to mind , such as spaghetti , opera , pianoforte , sonata from Italian ; frankfurter , wiener , hamburger , sauerkraut from German ; or English terms in other languages , like Spanish beisbol " baseball " , Athol " football " , nocaut " knockout " . These are instances of words which travelled along with the institutions or things which they referred to ? which had previously been unknown in the countries to which they were introduced . In other cases , the foreign word gave a particular flavor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of meaning to , which it referred : there were lightning-like campaigns conducted long before 1940 , but the term Blitzkrieg referred to the particular style in which the German Panzer divisions ,  | aided by the Luftwaffe , especially its Stulca dive-bombers , conducted that type of warfare . Americans living in Puerto Rico have the normal English word bus at their disposal , but nevertheless often refer to the local vehicles ( which have characteristics all their own ) by the Puerto Rican Spanish term guagua , and to a station wagon as a " little . bus " or guagiiita . All such borrowed words are often called loan-words . A special type of borrowing is that in which words themselves are not borrowed , but direct translations are made from one language into another , so-called loan-translations . Strong emotion was regarded by Greek Stoic philosophers as something morbid , and was called by them pathos " suffering , disease " ; the Romans translated this by passio " suffering " , from which our word passion was later borrowed . We use the term passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passion of Jesus Christ , and otherwise use it in the meaning of the Latin loan-translation passio " deep emotion " . In French ca va sans dire means literally " that goes without saying " , and figuratively " that 's obvious " ; in English we often use the loantranslation that goes without saying , and likewise a marriage of convenience for French un mariage de convenance , or a superman for German Ubermensch ( given currency by the philosopher Nietzsche ) . Only a few loan-translations achieve acceptance in any given language , and other literal translations of foreign idiomatic expressions sound strange or ridiculous ; such an expression as I 'm in train of writing makes no sense in English unless the hearer is familiar with French je suis en train d'ecrire " I 'm in the process , the act of writing " . Single words are most easily borrowed from one language to another ; and when they are borrowed , they are normally adapted to the structure of the borrowing language , in sound and in form .   Thus , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who know a certain amount of French ; most speakers of American English say /ga'radZ/ ; in England , the stress has ? in accordance with normal English patterns ? been shifted to the first syllable , and the word is pronounced by upper-class speakers as /'g vra / with a French-type ending , but by lower-class speakers it is wholly Anglicized into /'gwridZ/ . Loan-words , once assimilated into the body of a language , serve as bases for further formations just like all other words : for instance , on the noun chauffeur , borrowed from French , we now have the verb to chauffe ( as in I had to chauffe my mother around all day ) ; and a suffix like - able , originally used only in Latin or French loan-words like inevitable , amiable , has now become so general that it can be added to any English verb , as in such forms as eatable , seeable , lovable . Not only individual words , however , but sounds , phonemic distinctions , and even structural patterns may spread across language boundaries and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most of the Romance languages , the r-sound is a tap made with the tip of the tongue against the inside upper front teeth ( a voiced dental flap ) ; but since the seventeenth century , a different kind of r , made by allowing the uvula to hang freely and vibrate in the breath-stream , has become fashionable , first of all in French , originating in Paris and spreading from there to other urban centers . It was imitated in languages other than French , spreading along with French courtly behavior in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries : it has become the normal urban representative of the r-phoneme in German , and is widespread in Spanish and Portuguese as a variant of the long rr phoneme . The suffix - able , which we just discussed , was first abstracted from French loan-words in English and has now become one of our most widespread and produc- tive English formative elements . The suffix - (e)teria was present originally in the one word cafeteria ( a borrowing from Italian cafeteria " coffee-shop " ) and then generalized from that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where one serves oneself " , as in groceteria , hatteteria . Even the whole structural pattern of a language may be affected in this way ; for instance , Armenian , originally a language related to English and the other Indo-European languages , has gradually favored more and more those regularized structural patterns which resemble those of the neighboring Turkish , until Armenian is now far more similar in pattern to Turkish than it was formerly . All these different types of borrowing ? dialect and inter= language , in vocabulary , phonemes , or structure ? are of course not made in a void ; as the Italian scholar P. Goidanich once said sarcastically , they are not " packed up in boxes and shipped across country by rail , " to be opened and distributed impersonally at the receiving end of the - line . The intermediary in all cases of borrowing is some one who is bi-lingual , to the extent of having at least some slight knowledge of both the source from which the borrowing is made ( standard or foreign language , etc. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional dialect or borrowing language ) . The New England farmer who goes to town and hears a new pronunciation for road and takes that new-fashioned pronunciation back home with him ; the soft drink salesman who travels out from Boston and sells tonic to the country stores in Massachusetts , New Hampshire or Maine ; the scholar who reads German , and not finding a good English equivalent for German Leitmotif ( literally " leading theme " ) , takes the word over into his speaking or writing in English ; the journalist or radio commentator who similarly knows and uses such words as French maquis " underground resistance movement " or   German heil " hail " and Fiihrer " leader " , because of their special connotations and even make further English formations such as heiling the Fiihrer ? all these are active helpers in the borrowing and transmission of loan-words to the speech-community at large . And this is a process which will alway go on as long as cultural interchange between groups takes place , and which no amount of puristic protest or condemnation can ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we examined instances of linguistic borrowing , that is , of features of language ( sounds , forms , structural patterns ) being taken over by one dialect from another , or by one language from another ; and we saw some of the things we can learn from the study of linguistic geography . This is one way in which a language can change ? by importation of features from some source outside itself , from some external source ; and we can therefore call this kind of change in language external change . All external change is , by its nature , borrowing , whether the source is a dialect closely or distantly related to the dialect which does the borrowing , or an unrelated language . It was to this kind of change ? primarily to obsolescence and revival of archaic forms ( i.e. , borrowing from an earlier stage of the language ) ? that Horace was referring to when he wrote in his Art of Poetry : Multa renascentur quae iam cecidere , cadentque Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula , si volet usus " Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life again , and words which are now in honor fall into disuse , if usage so wills it . " This observation is quite well-founded and justified . Languages change , over the centuries , so much as to render them completely different in the space of only a thousand years or so . If Horace , for instance , were to come to life today and converse with a speaker of modern French , the two would be completely unable to understand each other . Imagine a speaker of Old French ( of , say , around the year 1000 ) added to the conversation , and the situation would not be much better . The speaker of Old French would not   be able to act as interpreter , but instead would have great difficulty in understanding either his linguistic ancestor ( Horace ) or his linguistic descendant ( the present-day speaker of French ) . They would have in common a great many words that were related historically , but which would be too different from each other to be understood ? such as the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the speaker of Old French aicst , and the modern Frenchman with just one phoneme , a vowel similar to our " oo " sound . The entire linguistic systems of Latin , Old French , and Modern French differ so greatly that speakers of the three languages would each have to learn two other languages in order to grasp what the others were saying . The same would hold true for a speaker of the English of King Alfred 's time , one of Chaucer 's time , and one of our own time , if they could try to converse together . However , when Horace discusses borrowing of archaic forms , he is seeing and presenting only a part of linguistic change ; and so would we , if we took into account only the results of external borrowing , such as we study in linguistic geography . Theoretically , it might be possible to keep an otherwise-normal speech-community hermetically sealed off from all outside sources of borrowing ( including knowledge of past stages of their language ) , and maybe even ? by extremely detailed supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the speech-community . But even in such a completely isolated , regulated community , the language would still change , no matter how much effort was made to keep it stable . For , in addition to borrowing or external change , there is another force at work to keep language constantly changing , which would work no matter how little external influence were exerted on the language : internal change . Internal change is , in its turn , of two subvarieties : internal   borrowing , and evolution or organic change . The inner evolution of a language , particularly in its phonemes , goes on gradually , and speakers of the language are often not even aware that it is going on , or else they see only such a small part of the total pattern of change that they do n't realize its import . After some hundreds or thousands of years have passed , however , a language comes to be very different from what it was at an earlier stage ; and the changes have taken place so gradually and so inevitably that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or analogy , is the kind of change that takes place when a child says foots instead of feet , oxes instead of oxen , sticked instead of stuck , or breaked instead of broke . We usually call such forms as foots , oxes , sticked , breaked " mistakes " and all of us ? even the most illiterate users of sub-standard English ? train our children to say feet , not foots , and so on . Yet what lies at the root of these " mistakes " is an extremely widespread process , which we call analogical replacement . What has happened when the child has said foots or sticked ? Simply this : he has heard and learned a whole host of " regular " formations ? plural formations such as root ? roots , hat ? hats , book ? books , map ? maps , box ? boxes , and past formations like kick ? kicked , lick ? licked , trick ? tricked , rake ? raked , in the hundreds and thousands . He has simply made his new formation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part ) the " regular " ending -s - es and adding it to foot or ox . Likewise , he has taken the " regular " past ending - ed or break " on the analogy " of other pasts like kicked , raked , and so on . He is making what we often call an analogical new formation , by borrowing an element of linguistic form or construction ( here the nounplural suffix -s - es or the verb past suffix - ed ) from one part of our linguistic structure ( here the " regular " formations ) and adding it to another ( here the " irregular "   forms ) . This is a kind of borrowing , just like external borrowing ; but the source of borrowing is not somewhere outside but within the language itself , and so we call it internal borrowing . Analogical changes of this kind are often presented in the shape of proportional formulas , with x standing for the new-formation , thus Table Sometimes , objections are made to our statement of analogical replacements in a proportional formula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that naive speakers would not be capable of exact enough reasoning to make up a formula of this sort and carry it out . There are two answers to this objection : 1 ) that what we are giving here is a description of what takes place , not a statement of reasoning that we might necessarily expect from a naive speaker , who speaks normally without abstract analysis and who habitually does perfectly many things he could not possibly describe ; and 2 ) that even naive speakers from time to time are perfectly conscious of the basis for their analogical formations . The great Danish linguistician Otto Jespersen tells the story of a Danish child who should , according to normal Danish usage , have said nikkede " nodded " as the past of nikker " nod " , but said nak instead on the analogy of stak " stuck " , whose present is stikker . When the child was corrected , he immediately retorted " Stikker ? stak , nikker ? nak " , showing that he knew perfectly well on what analogy he had made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a proportion . From the point of view of the present language , analogical new-formations like oxes or taked are " mistakes " ,  | forms that would be uttered only by children or others learning the language , or by adults when tired or flustered ( that is , as " slips of the tongue " ) , and that would not be accepted by any native speaker at present . But there are always some forms with regard to which our usage is not fully settled , even that of normal adult native speakers of the language , and for which we may use first one and then another alternative . We have , for instance , the " irregular " plural formation hoof ? hooves , and the " strong " past tenses wake woke , dive ? dove ; yet we often hear and make regularized forms for these words : hoofs , waked , dived . That is to say , in some respects our usage is fluctuating ; and in the course of time , we will gradually come to favor one competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , until at last one is triumphant and drives out the other completely in normal everyday usage . What we often fail to realize , however , is that some , forms which seem fully fixed in our present language were , in earlier times , analogical new-formations , and went through a period of newness , and then of fluctuation , before displacing older forms entirely . Our plurals days and cows are both analogical replacements of earlier forms which would have sounded quite different if they had developed normally into Modern English . Old English had the singular dag " day " , plural dagas , and cu " cow " , plural cy ( in which the letter y stands for a vowel like that spelled u in French or it in German ) ; the Old English plurals , had they developed normally , would have given dawes and kye ( rhyming with high ) in present-day English . But we do not say day ? dawes or cow ? kye ; we use the regularized plurals days and cows instead . This is because around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newformation , borrowing the stem day from the singular to replace the stem dawe- in the plural before the ending -s . In the plural of cow , there were two successive analogical  | formations . Around the year 1300 , people started to use the plural kyn , with the analogical plural ending -n ( which was then very frequent , but survives now only in oxen , children , brethren ) . The form kyn survives at present as an archaism , kine ; in its turn , it was replaced around 1600 by the plural cows , in which the plural ending -s was borrowed from the majority of nouns and added to the singular cow . There must have been a time when days seemed as much of a " mistake " as foots does now , and ? slightly later ? a period when days and dawes were in competition just as hoofs and hooves are now . If we extend our timeperspective far enough back , we can see that we use relatively few plural formations which are direct continuations of those in use four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance when it comes to judging forms like hisn , hern , and so forth , or he done , of the type we discussed in Chapter 2 ( p. 9 and following pages ) . When an " ignorant " person borrows the ending -n from the possessive pronoun mine and adds it to the adjectives his , her , our , your and their , to make the distinctive possessive pronouns hisn , hern , ourn , yourn , theirn , this procedure on his part is not due to ignorance or stupidity . It is due to exactly the same process of analogizing , of regularizing the forms of the language , that we saw in the instances of cows or days , and that has gone on in producing a great many other forms we now use . The analogy in this instance is , of course : Table and so forth . Likewise , such a past tense as he done is traceable to some such analogy as this : Table That such forms as hisn or he done are not accepted as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forms themselves ? they are perfectly respectable analogical forms , with as much right to existence as cows and days ; the thing that makes them unacceptable is simply the connotation of social disfavor which has been attached to them . Very often , internal borrowing ( analogy ) comes into play when linguistic forms become irregular and grammatical relationships are obscured as a result of changes in phonemes . This is what happened in the case of English day ? dawes ; it has happened in recent centuries in such instances as those of the old plurals eye ? eyen , shoe ? shoon , brother ? brethren , which have now been replaced by the more transparent and easily understandable formations eyes , shoes , brothers respectively ; or in such past tenses of verbs as help ? holp , work wrought , now regularized by analogy in the new-formations helped , worked . In English noun plurals and verb pasts and past participles , the trend of development is slowly but surely towards analogical leveling of irregularities ; even though forms like gooses , mouses or drinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " now , they may perhaps be perfectly normal by two or three hundred years from now . Today 's analogical " mistakes " are often tomorrow 's competing forms , and dayafter-tomorrow 's " correct " forms . In other instances , analogy works rather to restore distinctions that have been lost through phonemic change . The Italian imperfect singular is an excellent example of this . The three forms of the imperfect singular in Latin ? first , second , and third persons ? ended in - bam , - bas , - bat respectively , as in Table During the development of Latin into Italian , final -m , -s , and -t ceased to be pronounced , and all three of these forms   would have developed normally into Italian cantava . In other tenses of the verb , however , changes in sound did not obscure the distinction between first , second , and third singular ; and hence there was a strong pressure from the pattern of the rest of the language , to re-establish such a distinction where it had been lost through the disappearance of final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents were written in Italian , the second person singular of the imperfect was distinguished from the other two persons by the substitution of the ending -i , taken ultimately from the second singular of the present in verbs like audis " you ( sg. ) hear " , whose ending - is developed regularly to -i . The second person singular of the imperfect was thus remade analogically into cantavi ; in Old Italian , the first and third singular both were cantava , the normal development of both cantabam and cantabat . In later times , the ending -o was borrowed from the first singular of the present ( as in canto " I sing " ) and used instead of -a as a distinctive first singular ending in the imperfect also . The following table show the historical development of the imperfect singular from Latin to Italian , with daggers placed before the forms which are analogical replacements : Table Analogical change is always at work in language ? not only in inflectional forms like foots and taked , but also on the level of word-formation , syntax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing ones , by extending the use of some prefix , suffix , or other formative element . On the analogy of Jacobite " follower of King James " , Adamite " descendant of Adam " , Hamite " de- scendant of Ham " , and similar formations in - ite , we can coin such terms as Hicksite or Buchmanite . We take the prefix de- from formations like decode , deface , derail , and add it to other nouns to make new words such as delouse , degut . Sometimes we separate the elements of a word differently from the way earlier speakers did , and thus remodel the word : so , for example , in the Middle English phrases a naddere " a certain kind of snake " and a napron " a small cloth " , the n was taken as being part of the indefinite article an , and the phrases were redivided as an addere ( Modern English an adder ) and an apron , respectively . The analogy in these instances was something of this kind : an other : other = a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as Leonard Bloomfield points out ( Language , p. 407 ) : " From the sixteenth century on , we find English subordinate clauses introduced by the word like . We can picture the innovation in this way : to do better than Judith:to do better than Judith did = to do like Judith : x where the outcome is the construction to do like Judith did . " Changes in the meaning of words are also due to analogy : to the extension of the situations with respect to which the words are used . There is a shift in the central meaning of the word , and what was formerly a marginal meaning becomes central , whereas the old central meaning becomes marginal or eventually disappears . In Old English , for example , the word bede meant " prayer " ( it is ultimately related to German beten " to pray " ) ; however , in saying one 's prayers , one used a rosary , a succession of little spheres on a string , as part of the process . Counting   one 's bedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers , as , counting the little spheres on the string ; and the word bead thus came eventually to mean , not " prayer " any longer , but what it does now , " a little sphere " of one kind or another ? by now , no longer necessarily connected with a rosary at all and even usable in connection with bead-like , spherical shapes such as beads of perspiration . Similarly , Middle High German kopf meant " cup , bowl , pot " ; during the late Middle Ages , its meaning shifted to that of " head " , which it has in Modern German . The word kopf was used in the meaning " head " , first of all in a special situation ; we find it in texts which describe battle scenes , in which a warrior smashes some one else 's kopf . At first , this usage was probably a loantranslation of Old French teste , which had developed the meaning " head " out of an earlier meaning " pot , potsherd " ; it was then extended analogically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations in which heads were referred to . The proportional formulas for developments like those of English beads and German kopf would be set up more or less like this : Table The process of semantic change is an entirely normal one , and is going on all the time , as when someone uses awfully in the sense of " very " . Here , too , the meaning of awfully is being extended from some situation where " fearinspiring " and " extremely " are very close to one another : Table When someone uses terribly , fearfully , or the like in the same way , it is simply on the analogy of awfully in the meaning of " very " . There is no more sense in protesting   against such an extension of meaning in the case of awfully than there is against using bead in the meaning of " little spherical object " , or German Kopf in the meaning " head " . Up to this point , we have been talking about analogical change in language , as a kind of borrowing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , in that our discussion has dealt with changes within linguistic systems , but we have still been dealing with borrowings . At a couple of points we have hinted at another kind of change without taking it up in detail , as when we said that Old English dagas would have developed normally into modern dawes , and that final -s and -m ceased to be pronounced during the transition from Latin to Italian . The kind of change involved here is not one of analogical replacement , but of development in the phonemes of the language : phonemic change . As phonemes change , linguistic forms ? being composed of phonemes ? change also , even without the help of analogical new-formation ; f9r instance , as when Latin cantabam , cantabas and cantabat all merged into cantava through the effects of phonemic change . Phonemic change , and the resultant change of forms and constructions , is what we referred to on p. 154 as organic change . This is the kind of linguistic change that the speakers of a language are least aware of , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of language came to realize the existence of . This is because phonemic change and its results take place quite gradually , so much so that the ordinary speaker does not realize its existence . Yet organic change is the most basic type of linguistic change , and is at the base of all other change in language ; analogical replacements are normally due to the fact that phonemic change disturbs the pattern of a language , either introducing divergent developments like day ? dawes , or leveling distinctions as in the case of Italian cantava . When we speak of phonemic change , what we mean is   this : that the phonemes of a language , its significant functional units of sound , change in the course of time . They change in their make-up , that is , in the sounds which compose the functional units ; they change in their relationships to each other within the language ; and they change in the positions in which they can occur . There was a vowel phoneme in Latin which was spelled u , and pronounced approximately like our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wall " , nuda " naked " , Luna " moon " , tu " you ( sg . ) " . This phoneme is normally continued in Modern French by a phoneme which has a sound different from the one it had in Latin , the tongue being in the front of the mouth instead of in the back , in such words as mur " wall " , nue " naked " , tune " moon " , tu " you ( sg . ) " . This u-phoneme in Latin belonged to a series which also included the vowels o and a ( pronounced like our " oh " and " ah " respectively ) , which had in common the feature of being pronounced with the tongue in the back of the mouth ; its relation to the other phonemes of the language has changed in French , so that its continuator belongs to a series characterized by the tongue being in the front of the mouth with the lips rounded . In the meanwhile , the older o-phoneme has changed also , so that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou ) in some words ( like vouloir " to wish " from Lat. volere , ponce " thumb " from pollicem ) , and a sound spelled eu and pronounced with lips rounded and tongue in the front of the mouth , as for German o , in other words ( like soeur " sister " from Lat. soror , douleur " grief " from dolorem ) . Phonemes can also change , as we said , in respect to the positions in which they occur . For instance , Old High German b d g ( " hard " g ! ) could occur at the end of a word as well as elsewhere , but in Modern German the occurrence of these phonemes has come to be limited to the beginning or middle of a word , and at the end of a word they are   automatically unvoiced ( cf. p. 72 ) , that is , replaced by p t k respectively . Hence the Old High German words gab , " ( he ) gave " , bad " bath " , and tag " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b , d , and g , are continued in Modern German by forms which are spelled the same , but pronounced gap , bat , and talc respectively ; on the other hand , the Modern German plurals gaben " ( they ) gave " , Bader " baths " , and Tage " days " have the sounds b d g unchanged , since they are not at the end of the words . In this way , phonemes can change , split , and merge : and this they are doing ceaselessly . During the course of hundreds and thousands of years , the phonemes of any given language change so much as to alter entirely the building-blocks out of which the speakers of that language make their meaningful utterances . What sounds they can use in their speech and how they can use them , depends wholly on how their habits of pronunciation are patterned at their particular point in the language 's evolution . There is no factor of physical heredity involved , nor yet of psychological disposition or the like ; nobody has ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our linguistic ancestors , the speakers of Old English , who were also the physical ancestors of a great many speakers of Modern English , were able to make the sound which they wrote as y and which is spelled u in French and u in German ; we , however , have entirely lost the habit , so much that we have considerable trouble learning this sound when we meet it in French or German . A few centuries ago , Dutch had a sound like that which we spell th in , say , ether ; there has been little change in the population of the Netherlands since then so far as racial , cultural or psychological characteristics are concerned , but Modern Dutch has lost this sound entirely , and the present-day Netherlander has a hard time learning it when he studies English . We could go on and multiply examples ad infinitum .   Often , features of sound ( such as voicing , vowel length , and so on ) lose , acquire , and then lose again their functional significance in any given language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important in Latin , where the distinction in the length of the final vowel was all that marked the difference between many forms , such as mensa " a table " ( nominative case ) and mensa " from a table " ( ablative case ) . This distinction in vowel length was lost in the Romance languages , and the later developments of fatum " fate " ( with long a ) and of malum " bad " ( with short a ) are alike in their treatment of the vowel a . But in Middle French , around the year 1400 , the consonant s ceased to be pronounced at the end of a syllable , and any preceding vowel was lengthened ; this lengthening was indicated in spelling by a circumflex accent ( A ) written over the vowel letter . At this time , therefore , such a word as paste " paste " came to pronounced and spelled pate , differentiated from pat(t)e " paw " only by the length of the vowel a . This distinction has again been lost since the seventeenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patte " paw " , though still spelled differently , are pronounced alike , both with a short vowel . Phonemic change does not take place simply at random , however , with one phoneme developing in one direction and another in another direction . Just as the phonemes of a language fall into a certain pattern , so do their changes fall into patterns , which we often call shifts . When the long vowels of Middle English changed , for instance , they all shifted in the same direction , towards a higher position of articulation in the mouth . An important change in the vowel system of Old French took place not long before our first literary documents were written , that is to say , not long before 900 A.D. ; this shift involved the breaking or splitting of several vowels into diphthongs , or their articu- lation in a higher position in the mouth , when they were stressed and when no consonant followed in the same syllable . In the " great English vowel shift " , the Middle English long vowels shifted upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given diphthongs in modern pronunciation : Table The following table gives examples of diphthongization and raising of stressed vowels in a " free " syllable ( one in which no consonant follows the vowel ) in Old French , as opposed to their remaining the same in " checked " syllables ( in which a consonant follows the vowel in the same syllable ) . The stage preceding Old French in linguistic history is usually termed Proto-GalloRomance ( abbreviated PGRom . ) . Old French spelling is given in italics following the phonemic transcription . Table   Note the symmetry of the developments in free syllable : the high-mid vowels /e/ and /o/ changed into /ei/ and /on/ respectively , the low-mid vowels /e/ and /o/ into /ie/ and lug/ ; and the low-central vowel /a/ developed into a front , slightly raised vowel which we may write as /ae/ , and which was undoubtedly intermediate in sound between /a/ and /E/ , with which latter it eventually merged . We can not say , however , that there is any specific trend in phonemic change as a whole ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given language or family of languages . Earlier ( especially nineteenth-century ) writers often talk about " phonetic decay " as if all sound-change involved only slurring or loss ; and this notion has gradually seeped into our folklore about language , as exemplified , say , in the quotation on p. 90 . However , this is far from true ; some phonemic change does involve loss or merger of phonemes , but other shifts in phonemic structure involve splits in phonemes , the rise of two phonemes where there was only one before ? as in the diphthongs which developed out of earlier simple vowels in Modern English and Old French which we have just discussed . Phonemes change , but the resultant condition is neither better nor worse than what went before ; we can not speak , in general terms , of either impoverishment or enrichment as a result of phonemic change . How do phonemes change , and why ? Both of these questions have worried linguisticians and laymen , ever since our science became aware of the fact of phonemic change . By now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably good answer to the first , but not as yet to the second . As to the " how " of phonemic change , the usual idea of nineteenth-century scholars was that sounds changed more or less by themselves , much as plants or other organisms evolved . The idea of the phoneme had not yet been elaborated , and linguisticians tended to think of individual sounds as the building-blocks of language ; and sounds   were thought of as undergoing a kind of spontaneous evolution in the course of time . Later , when we had arrived at the notion of the phoneme ? not an individual sound , but a functional unit comprising one or more sounds ? it was evident that the important thing was change in phonemes , and that in some way the sounds comprised in a phoneme gradually changed ; Bloomfield , in 1933 , said " Historically , we picture phonemic change as a gradual favoring of some non-distinctive variants and a disfavoring of others " . Recent theoretical discussions have cleared up our idea of the relation between phonetic and phonemic change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the function of sounds ? whereas phonetic change precedes phonemic change , and involves non-significant , non-functional displacements in the speakers ' habits of articulation . In the instance of the Old French diphthongization and raring of stressed vowels in free syllables , for example , we must assume that at first there took place a non-significant , non-distinctive change in articulation , conditioned by the position of the vowel in a free syllable . As long as the syllable remained free , the difference in pronunciation was determined by and statable wholly in terms of surrounding sounds , and the diphthongs or raised vowels met all the requirements for still being classed as allophones of the simple vowels out of which they had developed . ( For convenience , we may refer to this intermediate stage as Pre-French . ) But somewhat later , one of the changes which took place was the loss of all final vowels except /a/ , which changed to /a/ . This loss of final vowels caused many consonants which had previously been between vowels to come at the end of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowel ( since there no longer was a following vowel ) . With this change , there now came , in the stage we call Old French , to be a contrast between simple vowel and diphthong , or between low and raised vowel , before a consonant in the same syllable ; and since we can no longer state , for Old French , that the diph- thongs or raised vowels occur under specific conditions , we have to treat them as functionally distinct , i.e. phonemically different , from the vowels out of which they originally developed . The following table gives a more detailed picture of the transition , phonetically and phonemically , from Proto-Gallo-Romance to Old French , in the words listed on p. 161 . Each word is now given in phonetic and phonemic transcription . Note that in the Pre-French stage , the diphthongization or raising of the vowel has no phonemic significance , and hence is indicated only in the phonetic transcription , between square brackets ; in the Old French stage , the phonetic change has acquired phonemic significance , and so is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question " Why do phonemes change ? " , therefore , we can answer " Because habits of articulation change , and then are re-interpreted in a different function from that which they had before . " The question then becomes , naturally , " Why do habits of articulation change ? " , and to this we have as yet found no satisfac- tory answer . When we say " satisfactory answer " , we mead valid correlation between change in habits of articulation and other aspects of human culture or environment . All kinds of suggestions have been made ? correlation with climate , with race , with national psychology , and so forth ? but none that will hold water . At present , it looks as if we must simply say that habits of articulation are subject to changes in fashion , just like habits of dress , eating , and so forth ? and , just as these latter vary with no apparent reason , so do habits of pronunciation . No linguistic system has a watertight organization ; all languages have loopholes for change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance and hence are subject to the vagaries , of fashion . The Italian poet Dante , the first great thinker on the subject of linguistic change , said : " Since , therefore , every human language . . . . has been remade in accordance with our whims since the confusion of the Tower of Babel . . . and since man is a most unstable and variable being , language can not be long-lasting nor stable ; but like other human things , such as customs and dress , it has to vary in space and time . " This is as good a statement of the situation with regard to phonetic ( not phonemic ! ) change as has yet been made ; and the further solution of the problem now merges with the general question of why all human habits , all human culture changes . One thing seems clear : that change in habits and culture is the way in which man adapts himelf to his environment , and has done so for a million or so years , substituting cultural change for biological change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this problem is a matter for anthropologists ? including linguisticians ? to attack and solve in the future . Linguistic change has been going on for thousands of years , right under people 's noses ; and yet , except for a  | handful of anticipators in preceding centuries , only in the past hundred and fifty years have people made any start in its analysis . Why this delay ? In the first place , no one had a satisfactory technique for describing people 's linguistic habits , until the Greek grammarians developed a technique for their own language , and the Sanskrit grammarians developed one for theirs . Even then , the Greeks and the Romans , and also the ancient Hindus , were primarily interested in their own language alone , in that of their own times , and from the point of view of " correctness " ; they had little sense of historicity , and little interest in things plebeian or barbarian . And , most important of all , even though they had techniques for description of their own language , they had none for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This situation was made more or less permanent by people 's misunderstanding of a condition that was present from the late period of the Roman Empire onward : the coexistence of Latin , as a fixed form of speech and writing learned in the schools and used in the Church , and the currently-spoken and rapidly developing everyday speech of the common people . Those who , like priests , monks , and lawyers , learned Latin were taught to regard it as the only correct form of language , in fact as " grammar " par excellence , and to see in the everyday vernacular nothing but a " corruption " of Latin , which ? as Dante put it ? was " acquired without any rules , as one sucked one 's mother 's milk " . Both Latin and the vernacular were regarded as having co-existed at all times , and people failed to see any historical relation between them . Intellectual prejudice played a part here , too : the pride of the educated and of the grammarians led them to despise the untutored speech of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , however , some people began to see that there was a historical development from Latin to the modern Romance tongues , and that these   latter were not mere corruptions due to " ignorance " or " mental laziness " of lower-class speakers , but the result of normal , regular , inevitable change , whereas the apparent correctness of modern Latin was due simply to its being kept artificially alive in Church and schools . The truth of this assumption was made evident in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Italy , when the gap between Latin and vernacular was made even wider by the humanists ' reform of Latin writing , and re-introduction of strict adherence to the norms of the Golden Age of Latin literature . To a sixteenth-century Italian , Claudio Tolomei , goes the honor of first stating clearly the basic principle of what we would now call regular phonemic change , which he deduced from , observing the Italian ( Tuscan ) words derived from Latin words beginning in pl- . He noticed that most Latin words beginning in pl- were continued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieno " full " from Latin plenus , Italian piano " level " from Latin planus , Italian pile " more " from Latin plus , and many others . On the other hand , some Italian words had pl- representing Latin pl- , as in plora " he implores " from Latin plorat . Tolomei explained this difference in development by assuming that the normal continuation of Latin pl- in Italian was pi- , saying : " ... and I would be so bold as to say that in the original and pure speech of Tuscan men , this was a universally valid rule i.e. that Latin pl- gave Italian pi- , and that all those words which are now used and written differently , such as plora " he weeps " , implora " he implores " , splende " it is resplendent " , plebe " populace " and the like , were not taken from the middle of the town squares of Tuscany i.e. from everyday speech , but were set up by writers , and by someone who wished to enrich the language , preferring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in Latin , without giving them the form of Tuscan speech i.e. without substituting pi- for pl- . . . because without a doubt the common usage of earlier times would , had   it inherited these words , have said piora , impiora , spiende and pieve , and we have manifest evidence of this latter in that in the vernacular we call pieve a church devoted to the religious services of the common people . " This passage from Tolomei is very important ; it contains , not only in germ , but fully developed , all the essential points of modern historical linguistic analysis . Tolomei starts out by making one basic assumption : that phonemes change regularly , and hence explains the Italian words with initial pi- like pieno " full " , piano " level " , and pit ) , " more " as being the normal representatives of Latin plenus , plenus , and plus respectively . That leaves a group of forms , a residue , which show , not pi- as we would expect according to the formula just set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older approach would have shrugged off the discrepancy as mere happenstance , since there was not supposed to be any historical relation between Latin and Italian anyhow . Tolomei , however , is forced by his basic assumption to find an explanation for exceptions to his rule ; and he finds it in a further assumption , that the residue showing the discrepant treatment pl- is due to some other factor than phonemic change : in this particular case , to direct borrowing from Latin , of the kind we now call learned borrowing . Tolomei thus distinguishes between two kinds of words in modern Italian : those which developed in everyday speech ( like pieno , piano , piiu ) and those which were not developments in everyday speech but were taken directly from Latin by writers and other learned men ( words like plora , implora , spiende , plebe ) . He notices and comments on the existence of pairs of words , both from the same source , but one of which developed in everyday speech ( pieve ) and the other of which was taken directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now called historical doublets . Tolomei , four hundred years ago , hit on the basic ele- ments of historical linguistic science ; unfortunately , after his time , no one continued or improved on his method , ai ( l grammarians were too concerned with prescribing " correct " speech and with forcing all languages into the mold of Greek and Latin grammar , to make any real progress in studying languages from a historical point of view . Real , enduring progress towards a scientific approach was not made until about a hundred and fifty years ago , at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century . People 's horizons had been steadily broadening , so far as their knowledge of the world 's languages were concerned , until by 1800 something was known of a number of exotic languages , the most significant of which were Sanskrit ( Old Indic , the language of the ancient hymns of India ) and Finnish . When these languages became known , it was quite evident that there must be some relationship between them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European languages , and between Finnish and Hungarian ( and various Siberian languages , but no others in Europe ) . For a while , and due to the old confused notions about the relationship of languages , people thought that all the other languages related to Sanskrit must be derived from it ; we still come across that notion from time to time , in uninformed quarters . Soon we began to see that , rather , Sanskrit was a sister language to Latin , Greek , the Germanic , Celtic and Slavic languages , and so on . The first person to state this relationship clearly was Sir William Jones , one of the first great Western Sanskritists in 1786 , pointing out that Sanskrit in relation to Greek and Latin " . . . bears a stronger affinity , both in the roots of verbs , and in the forms of grammar , than could possibly have been produced by accident : so strong , indeed , that no philologer could examine them all three without believing them to have sprung from some common source , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , though not quite so forcible , for supposing that both   the Gothick and the Celtick , though blended with a very different idiom , had the same origin with the Sanskrit . " During the first half of the nineteenth century , a great deal of work was done by scholars to reconstruct the parent language from which Sanskrit , Latin , Greek , Germanic , Balto-Slavic ( the intermediate ancestral stage of the Slavic languages such as Russian , Polish , etc. , and of the Baltic languages like Lithuanian ) and Celtic must have originated . Similar reconstructions were made for Finno-Ugric , the ancestral language of Finnish , Hungarian , and a number of languages in Siberia . Between the languages of each of these groups there are a great many correspondences , in sounds , forms , syntax , and vocabulary , which simply can not be due to mere chance nor yet to borrowing ( no matter how widespread ) , but can be explained only on the hypothesis of differentiation from a single earlier source . Take such sets of words as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Old Church Slavonic , Gothic ( the earliest attested of the Germanic languages ) and Old Irish : Table
