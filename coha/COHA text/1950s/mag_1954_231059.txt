After Publisher Gardner ( " Mike " ) Cowles folded pocket-size Quick last year , he quickly found a buyer for the magazine . The Philadelphia Inquirer 's Publisher Walter Annenberg bought the title from Cowles for a reported $250,000 , put out his own biweekly Quick in a larger format ( TIME , July 20 ) . Annenberg , who also publishes Seventeen , Daily Racing Form and Morning Telegraph , hoped to succeed where Mike Cowles failed by using his Inquirer gravure presses , selling no subscriptions or ads and sticking to newsstand sales . He estimated he could break even with 1,000,000 circulation . Last week Annenberg admitted defeat . After experimenting for nine months with the reborn Quick without ever putting out a good magazine , he folded it . Quick did not sell enough newsstand copies to make money , and the cost of getting ads and mail subscribers was too high .
