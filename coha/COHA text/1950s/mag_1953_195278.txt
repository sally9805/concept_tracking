Ever since Stalin 's death , the Kremlin gang had been passing out a carefully blended mixture of honey and vinegar which seemed to signal a softening of Soviet foreign policy . The first clues to the new Communist policy were small and ambiguous . Last week , however , came two stronger indications of a new line . <P> In Korea , a U.N . liaison officer , called to Panmunjom by the Reds , was handed a startling letter . Dispensing with the usual Communist invective , the Red commanders accepted U.N . Commander Mark Clark 's month-old proposal for an immediate exchange of " seriously sick and seriously wounded " prisoners of war , according to the terms of Article 109 of the Geneva Convention . Such an exchange , U.N . officers estimated , might involve about 3,000 of the 123,000 prisoners now held by the U.N . and perhaps 1,000 of the 12,000 prisoners the Communists admit they hold . It was unlikely that more than 200 to 300 Americans would be returned . Close Study . On the surface , the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a proposal for more truce talks , it apparently was not conditional upon any further negotiations . Nonetheless , the U.N . command was understandably leary . " We are going to study this offer very closely , " said General Clark . " We want to be sure there is n't anything in it we do n't understand . " <P> While Clark was still studying the Communist note , the Chinese made a second and far more important proposal . In a Peking radio broadcast , Chinese Premier Chou Enlai , who had recently returned from Moscow , abandoned Chinese insistence upon forced repatriation of all P.W.s , the issue which caused the breakdown of the Panmunjom talks . Admitting that there are some Chinese who do n't want to go home- " captured personnel of our side who , under the intimidation and oppression of the opposite side , are filled with apprehension " - Chou suggested that prisoners who reject repatriation be handed over to a neutral state . Four months ago , Communist China had turned down a somewhat similar proposal by India . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to the bloody war in Korea . . . that we take this new step . " <P> International Poker . Like the skillful international poker players they are , the Chinese accompanied their new truce offers with strong ground attacks on the U.N . battle line . They gave no indication as to why they had extended the olive branch again . Bitter experience had convinced most U.S. observers that Communist concessions are always made in the hope of lulling opponents into dangerous relaxation . The lull the Communists were seeking this time , however , may come in any one of three handy sizes : <P> 1 ) Korean Size . More stalling at Panmunjom talks to give the Chinese more time to build their defense in Korea before the new U.S. Administration strikes for a decision there . <P> 2 ) Asiatic Size . Quick agreement on a Korean truce , designed as a prelude to another blow elsewhere in Asia . <P> 3 ) World Size . A general cold war armistice designed to give the whole Communist world a chance to settle the problems arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Eisenhower " liberation not containment " drive .
