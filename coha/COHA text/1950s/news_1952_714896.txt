txt Governor Adlai E. Stevenson came out strongly in favor of continued Federal investment in public power and other natural resource deveeopment programs , but also promised to be " eagle-eyed and tightfisted about these expenditures . " He took his stand in an address late last night before a Democratic party rally here , and billed as one of the " major " speeches of the Democratic candidate 's current Western campaign swing . Stevenson praised the Federal Government 's public power program as a key factor in the development of the Northwest , ' If the Government had not built them , they would not have been built at all , " he declared . " Hard American common sense concludes that where private enterprise is unable or unwilllag to develop our resources , the Government should . " The Federal Government will continue to make such investmen 's . Mr. Stevenson continued , but he did hedge this campaign pledge with another against excessive spending . National Gains , Not Local " When we invest in projects that more than pay for themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public wealth and our heirs will profit from our wisdom . But it is public funds we invest . The return of the investment must be real , not hypothetical , and the gains must be national , not merely local . " Gov . Stevenson then declared that " we must be eagle-eyed and tight-fisted about these expenditures . " He said ; " The magical phrase , engineering feasibility , the blessing of the local interests are.not enough to justify a public project . It must pass the harder test of comparison  --  would this money be better spent in rehabilitating eroded farm land in the South or exhausted range land in the West rather than on reclaiming desert ? And it must pass another , more immediate testis the coming fiscal year the one in which to start this investment of public funds at all " " The candidate admitted these were difficult problems with projects from all parts of the country ' competing for public investment . " I am not sure that the office of the presidency is well enough equipped , as things stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he stated . " The Hoover Commission has made suggestions for ' increasing the effectiveness of executive review : it may be that even better means can be devised . I intend to find out . " Aides said Stevenson was referring to Hoover Commission proposals to set up in the Executive Branch a second review of spending proposals , in addition to the present Budget Bureau scrutiny , and to make other changes leading to a tighter rein on spending programs . The Stevenson speech attacked private inter ests for their opposition to particular resource development projects , but closed by seeking their cooperation in this field . The Democratic nominee recalled the op -- position from private groups to the building of Grand Coulee and other power projects He said these had been attacked as a waste of taxpayers ' money and " an interference with the sacred right of private monopoly to leave a region undeveloped . " " But these projects were built , " he continued , " and far from diminishing , stifling or crippling private enterprise . these activities of the Federal Government have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and in the lest of the country " The battles in this field are not over , Gov . Stevenson said " The Government is contemplating additional developments that will add more badly needed kilowatts to the power supply of the Northwest , " he stated . " More water for the lands that stand ready to produce . More transportation to get the products cheaply to market . There will be opposiLon in the future , as there has been opposition in the past . But the resource development of the West will go on because the people  --  not just the people of the West but of the whole country  --  want it to go on . " Mr. Stevenson said private opposition had been seen not only in the power field but also against Federal protection and development of the national forests . And here again . he asserted , private enterprise has in the long run benefited nom the Federal Government 's activity . Increasing Power Needs Finally , Stevenson recalled the recent report of President Truman 's Materials Policy Commission and its predictions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fuel and raw materials . He said this meant that planning to deal with soil , water , min. erals , power and other problems must be " unified , on a wide front , by integrated plans , by cooperative effort . This means better ad. ministratrve arrangements within the Federal Government and intelligent and better coordi ? nated action by states , by localities and by private enterprise . Gov . Stevenson said he had emphasized public policies because he is a candidate for office and wanted to make his stand clear on the problems he might face as president . " But , " he concluded , " I believe with all my heart that the job of wisely using the resources which nature endowed the U. S is very largely a. job for private action . It requires every private landowner , every mine and timber operator , every man in private enterprise , to act with an eye for the public good as well as private gain . I thoroughly believe that the majority of Americans are men of good will , who put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
