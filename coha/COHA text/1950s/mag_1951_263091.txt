On records and on paper , a Paris Opera basso , Roger Rico , seemed a natural to enter Broadway 's South Pacific in the role that the Met 's Ezio Pinza* created two years ago . After listening to his records and noting that he would be the first real Frenchman to play the hit musical 's French planter , Co-Producers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II sent for Rico , auditioned and hired him . <P> Rico 's seven weeks of rehearsal posed a special problem : he speaks no English . Patiently , with the help of a wire recorder , he learned his lines phonetically while studying a French translation to learn what they meant . Last week , when the time came for Rico to begin his 15-month contract run in the show , Manhattan reviewers were invited to the debut . <P> While admiring his voice , the critics greeted Rico 's performance with a polite calm that none seemed able to maintain in the hot flush of first seeing South Pacific . The New York Times noted , half apologetically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the middle-aged role , and that he had " a tendency to overaccentuate his facial expressions . " Struggling tensely with his phonetic English , he projected no notable charm or sex appeal . Above all , he lacked the support of Pinza 's costar , Mary Martin , whose place has been taken , but not exactly filled , by Martha Wright . <P> At week 's end , however , even with the second team playing , South Pacific 's standees were still turning up as regularly as its cast , and the end of its phenomenal popularity seemed nowhere in sight . <P> <P> * For news of Pinza 's latest role , see CINEMA .
