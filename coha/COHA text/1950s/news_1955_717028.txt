txt Perhaps it is because When ? in people ? as in trees Bow ? and plants ? the vital What ? juices begin to flow more briskly now . Perhaps it is because people are moving about more outdoors and thus there are more opportunities for casual communication . Perhaps , due to some chemical change not fully understood , man 's level of curiosity rises in the spring . Whatever the reason , this is undoubtedly the season for questions . These questions can be catalogued in three groups : the " when ? " and the " how ? " and the " what ? " All three can be irksome and very often are , but the worst iz the first . The " when ? " quesBehind tions all lead toward the Query : one thing : work . Work Not work that one proposes to do one 's self  --  good , honest toil like spading up the garden or reviving the faded lawn  --  but work of a trifling , unwholesome kind , such as painting shutters or screens , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , for someone to ask when one is going to put up some wire or a trellis for a rose bush that has not yet even been bought . If one is wise about this season 's effect upon the glands one will shrug off such questions . After all , the matter of trellis and/or wire has been discussed , pro and con , for a year or two . It can wait . This unseemly haste about " when ? " will subside with the first good drop in the temperature , accompanied by a cold rain . The " how ? " quesTrying tions arise after one One 's has been trapped into Patience answering affirmatively and specifically some " when ? " query . Once one has said when he will do some task around the house , like rehanging the sagging garage doors so that ( they can be opened by anyone weighing less than 200 pounds , ' there are always people about who want to know " how ? " A good craftsman has plenty to think about without being called upon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishly said he would do . And especially he does not like to be asked " how ? " about a task when he is not sure himself in what manner he will proceed . One does not ask a playwright how he will write a play ; one should not ask a man how he proposes to fix a loose drain pipe , fifteen feet from the ground , using a six-foot ladder . But people do ask . Especially in the spring when they are brimming with questions . They also ask Favorite " what ? " In the springQuery time when little chilof Youth dren are frisking about they like to stop , spying someone hammering or digging , and ask " what ? " One is never sure how to answer these little ones , their faces without guile . If one is busily turning over soil with a spade and in reply to " what ? " says he has just found a uranium mine , it is possible the curious child may carry home this response , with interesting consequences . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " eight times in five minutes  --  that most of these small and active questioners do not hear anything that one says but merely enjoy the sound of a voice that does not belong to their parents . Taking no chances , one explains as briefly as possible " what ? " to all corners , even though it is hard to explain to a 4-year-old master of the " what ? " the significance of a bale of peat moss . There is another This One and lesser division of Is Easy spring interrogation , to Dodge to wit , " where ? " It is lesser because it is easily coped with . If anyone asks where one proposes to put this and that in the garden , one obligingly points grandly in this direction and that or  --  if exceptionally well prepared  --  produces a crudely drawn diagram of a garden plot and in glowing terms describes how lovely this summer 's flowers will look here , there and there . One is careful not . to be toe specific , and to speak knowingly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 Of all this season 's questions , ? where ? ? is the easiest to fend off . Indeed , it should be encouraged , for when the attention of the curious can be diverted to " where ? " that unfriendly , ominous " when ? " may not be asked R.t all , and spring made more pleasant thereby .
