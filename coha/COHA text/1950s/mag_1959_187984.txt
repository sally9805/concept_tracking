The day that Gamal Abdel Nasser persists in calling Victory Day-actually the anniversary of the withdrawal of the unbeaten British and French troops from Suez two years ago-has become an Egyptian holiday . Last week it was observed with massed schoolboy gymnastics and by the symbolic refloating of one of the ships sunk to block the canal . It was also marked by a speech from a somewhat subdued Nasser , who for the first time attacked the Communists . His oratory hardly matched the invective he has expended on the West , but it was a start . <P> The Communists he brought into the Middle East three years ago are now fighting him and sabotaging Arab nationalism in Syria . They " opposed the union of Syria and Egypt because they thought it would destroy their opportunities , " he told the crowd at Port Said . " Some " of their members , he went on , even called for " disunity . " <P> To " investigate " the troubled Syrian situation , Nasser announced appointment of a three-man committee , including his police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Baath Socialist leader who rushed his country into union with Egypt last year precisely to avert a Communist takeover . <P> Day after Nasser 's speech , Damascus ' Communist newspaper Al Noor went out of business . Syrian Communist Boss Khaled Bakdash , the leading Communist in the Arab world , went underground . Nasser 's Syrian proconsul , Colonel Abdel Hamid Serraj , was more emphatic than Nasser . " The Communist Party has shown its real self , " he said . " Its attitude is treason to the Arab cause and a dagger 's stab directed by people who do not represent the real face of the Syrian region . " <P> Yet , if Nasser had decided at last that he was in jeopardy from the Communists , he was moving cautiously . At week 's end there were many rumors but little evidence of Communist arrests in Syria . He carefully made no mention at all of the even touchier situation created by the Communists in Iraq . Nasser 's regime signed a contract with a Soviet delegation in Cairo for the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagandists , covering the boss 's anxious retreat , put out the naive-sounding line that Arabs must distinguish sharply between bad local Communists and good Russians . Nothing in the Syrian unpleasantness , wrote Nasser 's trained seal . Editor Mohammed Heikal of Al Ahram , must be allowed to affect " in any way the great victory we achieved in earning the friendship of the Soviet Union . "
