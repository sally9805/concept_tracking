" <P> Republicans cheerfully accepted the challenge to debate the issue of evil in government operation . In cold fury , Dwight Eisenhower replied to Truman and Stevenson at his news conference . " America , " he snapped , " believes I am honest , that I am not a rascal , that I am not a racketeer . " Added Richard Nixon at Gettysburg : " We 'll be glad to compare the moral standards of the Eisenhower Administration to the Truman Administration any time of the day or night . " <P> The comparison : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real or apparent , under the Eisenhower Administration are easily isolated .
