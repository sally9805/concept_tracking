It is the destiny of the professional soldier to wait in obscurity most of his life for a crisis that may never come . It is his function to know how to solve it if it does come . It is his code to give all that he has . <P> In 1944 Frank Dow Merrill , then an obscure , 40-year-old U.S. infantry officer , found his crisis in Burma . Under command of General Joseph Stilwell , the Allies were set to drive across northern Burma to Myitkyina , key Japanese defense base and main air base from which fighters menaced the allied air route over " the Hump " to China . With a newly built road eastward from Ledo in northern India , they would intersect the Burma Road , reopen the land route to China . <P> Nameless Mission . West Pointer Merrill got command of an esoteric collection of U.S. infantrymen . They formed the 5307th Composite Unit ( Provisional ) , whose parenthetical appendage proved symbolic . Culled from jungle-trained troops throughout the Pacific Theater , including a full battalion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3,000 men volunteered for a nameless " dangerous and hazardous mission . " <P> " Merrill 's Marauders " made American infantry history in the semi-guerrilla tradition begun by Rogers ' Rangers and Morgan 's Raiders : small groups of troops with heavy firepower , designed for mobile , long-range harassment behind enemy lines . The Marauders ' job : surprise encirclement and roadblocks behind the Japanese front as Stilwell 's mainly Chinese forces drove slowly toward Myitkyina . <P> No man looked less a leader for the daring end-run tactics than studious , shy Frank Merrill , a pudgy , peaceful staff officer with bad eyes and a weak heart , who had had little experience commanding troops . But Merrill was a professional of high intelligence and remarkable tenacity . <P> Decisive Moment . " We will walk back into Burma , " said Merrill firmly , as his men left India in February 1944 . For the next four months , supplied by airdrops and using only mules and their own feet for transport , they slogged 500 miles across the most nightmarish terrain on earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack Japanese 18th Division , whose commanders were convinced that the regimental-strength Marauders totaled two full divisions . <P> Flitting and stabbing day and night , sometimes fighting as long as 36 hours without food or water , crawling on hands and knees up sheer mountains , the end-running Marauders met the Japanese in obscure clearings with names like Walawbum , Shaduzup , Inkangahtawng , Miangkwan . This was the primitive Burma where tribesmen had often never seen a white mana harshly foreboding land of thunderous rivers and almost impassable jungles , where leeches clung to a man and drained his blood while stinking rot filled his soggy boots , where it rained 160 inches a year and nearly every Marauder shook with malarial fever . <P> Merrill walked always with his men , outworking and overworking them , seldom more than 100 yards from his fighting perimeter . Everything he had ever learned came together in the decisive moment of his life . If a precious radio broke down , he could repair it himself , then outwit Japanese jamming by telling his enemies a fairy tale in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his message in English .
