The seeds of a new French revolution were being sown last week in a small shop near the Arc de Triomphe . There , crowds of customers were enthusiastically shopping in France 's first discount house , with prices of refrigerators , toasters and all other goods cut a flat 20% under prices fixed by manufacturers and retailers . In two or three days , the yellow-fronted shop did as much business as others in the neighborhood handled in a year . <P> The man who opened the store and set out singlehanded to revolutionize France 's noncompetitive retailing system is Maurice Gattegno , 47 . Until two years ago Discounter Gattegno was a small shopkeeper in a nation of small shopkeepers ( one to every 43 consumers ) , most of whom have no employees , gross less than $5,000 a year , and keep two sets of books - one for themselves , one for the tax collector . Firm believers in high , fixed prices and low turnover , many sell only three shirts or two pairs of shoes a day , heartily approve the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gattegno , who owned a small camera shop , was made of more imaginative stuff . Visiting Manhattan in 1954 , he was amazed by midtown discount houses . " It struck me that France was living in the past , " said he , and he sailed home to try the discounters ' methods in his own sleepy shop . <P> Customers poured in . To handle a daily turnover that increased a hundredfold , Gattegno took on 20 employees at wages remarkable for France : $250 a month for salesmen , $225 for the lowliest packer-more than three times the going rate . The first year Gattegno grossed $714,000 . Moreover , said he proudly : " I pay my full taxes . I do n't have two sets of books . " <P> The howls against Discounter Gattegno 's " American plague " were just as vehement as those hurled at his American counterparts . Sternly calling on manufacturers to boycott his booming business , French retail-trade papers scornfully labeled him " Monsieur 20% . " Virtually the entire Paris press , fearful of losing regular accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent of General Electric , refused to sell him its appliances . <P> Friends &; Enemies . But smaller manufacturers , though publicly outraged , kept right on selling to Gattegno for the compelling reason that he pays cash , buys ten times more than his competitors ( although they usually ask him to keep their transactions secret ) . And through Gattegno 's own throwaway newspaper , Moins Cher ( cheaper ) , Parisians heard and spread the word to 12,000 new customers last year alone , while the French government hinted that credit is surely possible for a man who understands so well how to cut the cost of living . <P> Discounter Gattegno , who grossed about $1,500,000 last year , plans to open a new American-style supermarket this spring with three floors of food , appliances and clothing , smack in the heart of the poor people 's Paris near Gare St.-Lazare . Its name : Chez Monsieur 20% . Says he : " I will make new enemies among French retailers . But what interests me are the customers . They are my friends . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
