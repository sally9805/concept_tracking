Most Broadway offerings are based on the obvious notion that a show is not worth producing unless it promises to enrich its backers as a long-run hit . Last week , however , Broadway blossomed with a smash hit that broke rules , and may break records . The American National Theatre and Academy ( ANTA ) opened its revival of Thornton Wilder 's timeless piece of vaudevillian anthropology . The Skin of Our Teeth , first produced in 1942 ( and greeted by a mixed chorus of cheers and catcalls-plus a Pulitzer Prize ) . The ANTA production 's glittering stars : the U.S. theater 's Grande Dame Helen Hayes and **28;10967;TOOLONG George Abbott as mankind 's eternal Mr. and Mrs. ; Musicomedienne Mary Martin as Mr. and Mrs. maid and humanity 's eternal hedonist , raising hell in halcyon eras and doubting heaven in adversity . <P> Generic George . Though Skin could probably play to full houses for the rest of this year , it is scheduled to close in September after only 23 performances . With hardly a line deleted or dinosaur added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 13 years ago . His tearfully laughable story of mankind , allegorically and often outlandishly larded into the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. George Antrobus of Excelsior , N.J .. is just the same . What has changed , in hot war and cold , is the audience . Today 's playgoers , themselves survivors of some close shaves , can sympathize more feelingly , even in the shadow of a mushroom cloud , with generic George Antrobus as he survives not only a war but an ice age , the Flood , and his own folly as well . <P> Such a play , ANTA Producer Robert Whitehead reasoned last April , might prove a special tonic for the peril-surfeited people of France . He hand-picked Skin as his own pet project for inclusion in a " Salute to France . " This cultural export ( financed by thousands of U.S. donors ) plunked down before Parisians the Philadelphia Orchestra . New York City Ballet , two U.S.-sponsored art shows , plus first-class stage productions of Oklahoma ! and Medea ( TIME , June 6 ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six full-house performances , the dramatic showpiece of Salute . Salute marked the first invasion of the laggardly U.S. onto a critical cultural battlefield of the cold war . Skin opened after only two hectic rehearsals in its Paris theater . Some 200 sittie-talkies caught a running translation for its French-speaking viewers . In general , Paris critics raved , though a few found it " furiously intellectual ' ' or " slightly incoherent . " <P> In Chicago , and Washington , D.C. , where it toured , and back home in Manhattan , audiences have hailed Skin ever since . Cried the New York Times 's persnickety Brooks Atkinson , dean of Broadway 's critics , " Perfect . ' ' Rejoiced the Herald Tribune 's Walter Kerr : " Perhaps even the theater will survive . ' ' Thornton Wilder 's wild and wise romp is now fast making up the $73,000 deficit incurred by Salute . Best news of all : Salute should be completely out of the red after the U.S. at large gets its chance to see The Skin of Our Teeth as an NBC-TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
