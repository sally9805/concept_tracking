His devout Methodist father had expressly forbidden him to read the book , but 13-year-old William Ernest Hocking of Joliet , Ill. could not resist the temptation . A usually obedient boy , he sneaked Herbert Spencer 's First Principles out to the haymow , read with horrified fascination the book 's conclusion that whatever Supreme Power might lie behind the universe , it " is utterly inscrutable . " When he had finished , young Hocking realized that " father was right : the damage was done . I had started out life with a perfectly sound brand of orthodox religion . Now , I had lost it all . I was obliged to work the thing out for myself . " <P> William Hocking has spent a lifetime working the thing out . In so doing , he won fame as one of the top half-dozen U.S. philosophers of his day . A tall , courtly scholar , he made all knowledge his province , and in an age of shriveling faith and swelling skepticism , he steadfastly refused to repudiate the universe or the God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 , William Hocking occupied a place as the nation 's foremost living exponent of Idealism-one of the least heeded , but most healing , of all philosophies . <P> Cheapest Place . Hocking became a professional philosopher almost by accident . He started out to be an engineer , had already enrolled at Iowa State College as " the cheapest possible place to get an education . " Then , one day in the college library , he began reading the works of William James . " Right then , " says he , " I decided to aim for the place where James taught . " <P> At Harvard , he found not only William James but also Idealist Josiah Royce . Hocking promptly adopted both these men as " my honored masters . " In the first , he found a challenge , in the second , a response . Over the next 40 years , he gradually molded that response into an eloquent philosophy of his own , passed it on to hundreds of Harvard students . Though of formal bearing , he never lacked fire : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his heart that " to know that the world has a meaning is the philosophic minimum . " <P> Whatever Works . In his search for that meaning , Hocking was willing to meet the pragmatists on their own ground . Though he rejected the principle that " whatever works is true , " he regarded the negative statement that " whatever does not work is not true " as a valid test for any philosophy . In his first book , The Meaning of God in Human Experience , he boldly applied the test to religion .
