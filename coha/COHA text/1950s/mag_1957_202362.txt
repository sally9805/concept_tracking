" Is it wrong to believe in the Constitution of the United States ? " asked the editorial in Tennessee 's Clinton Courier-News last week . " Is it wrong to try to preserve peace in your community , to try to prevent individuals from being led astray by irresponsible rabble-rousers ? " From Editor-Publisher Horace Wells these were not rhetorical questions . His weekly paper 's remonstrances against the hooligan-led integration riots in Clinton last year ( TIME , Sept. 10 ) have spurred threats against Wells 's family , a dynamiting near his home , attempts to get a boycott going against the paper . But the paper has lost only 300 of its 3,845 subscribers , and Newsman Wells , 50 , has never weakened in his conviction that the Supreme Court 's integration decree must be obeyed , however unwelcome it may be . <P> Last week , after he had appeared as a Government witness in the contempt trial of White Supremacist John Kasper and 15 Clinton citizens . Editor Wells 's questions were resoundingly answered at the National Conference of Weekly Newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There Wells received the <P> Southern Illinois University 1957 Elijah P. Lovejoy Award for " realistic devotion to the principles of law and order " that exposed him to " the scorn and abuse of a large segment of his community . " It was Horace Wells 's third award this year . The others : a special award from the Tennessee Press Association , a National Editorial Association citation for " courageous personal journalism .
