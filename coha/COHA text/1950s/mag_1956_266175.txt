What makes Prime Minister Nehru a master of compromise is his distaste for simple defeat . But last week it looked as if Nehru would have to admit that his Congress Party scheme for revising India 's state boundaries according to language blocs was a dead duck . <P> <P> The rioting that began in Bombay ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) spread right across India . Mobs squatted on railroad tracks to halt trains , crowded onto airfields to prevent planes from landing , blocked roads with trees , broke into jails and freed convicts , looted stores , ripped down telephone wires . Newspapers that had given Nehru steady support were charging the government with " moral bankruptcy . " The prestige of the Congress Party had never been lower . <P> Risking New Delhi 's current yellow jaundice epidemic ( 50,000 cases ) , ministers and party leaders hurried to the capital . Counseled Bombay Congress Party Boss S. K. Patil : shelve the entire states-reorganization scheme . Instead , Nehru , looking overstrained , his white hair curling from under his Gandhi cap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly more populous units which would cut across linguistic lines . <P> Congress Party leaders dutifully took these proposals home , blandly proposed the merging of Bengal and Bihar ( total pop . 65 million ) , the merging of Bombay state with huge slices of Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad ( approx. pop . 43 million ) , the merging of Madras with Mysore and Travancore-Cochin ( approx. pop . 55 million ) . Gasped the opposition parties : a plot to hold power through creating a group of superstates . <P> While rioters paused to debate the new issue , Nehru watched an official parade celebrating the sixth anniversary of the Indian republic . Down Ruler 's Way came lumbering elephants with blue foreheads and flowers painted on their hindquarters , bearded Sikhs in bright turbans , Madras Regiment soldiers behind their famed fifes and drums , felt-hatted Gurkhas . At Nehru 's side was his good friend Lady Mountbatten , wife of the last British Viceroy . Afterwards Nehru told a group of young army trainees : " Redistribution of states is only , after all , for administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision can be changed . " <P> Politically acute Indians had no difficulty in interpreting Nehru 's words . What would happen , they now thought , was that Nehru would announce that the big merger plan was too vast for hasty decision , and under cover of this smoke screen would defer indefinitely all plans for the reorganization of states , including those which had set off the riots .
