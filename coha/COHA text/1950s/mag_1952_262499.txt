Among the inequities of the World War II excess profits tax was the definition of " normal earnings " as the average profits for the years 1936-39 . Anything over the average was taxable at a maximum rate of 90% . Many corporations complained that the base was unfair since they had been pouring money into expansion or new products during the ' 36- ' 39 period , thus their earnings were smaller than normal . For them , Congress left a loophole in the act : section 722 . It provided for a rebate for corporations who could prove their 1936-39 average abnormally low . <P> Last week Du Pont reached through the loophole and pulled out a rebate of $29 million , the biggest E.P.T. repayment so far . Du Pont argued that during the base period it had poured millions into expansion for nylon and other new products which it did not start selling until 1939 . Thus , a substantial part of its war profits was not " excess profits , " and was " plainly not attributable to the war economy .
