When Katharine Hepburn , Joan Fontaine , Jean Arthur , Merle Oberon and Ingrid Bergman speak their lines on France 's movie screens , they talk French as fluently as natives . This is not strange because each of them uses the same native tongue and larynx ; tiny , blue-eyed French Actress Paula Dehelly does the talking for all of them . <P> Paula is one of 200-odd French actors who eke out their stage salaries dubbing French dialogue on Hollywood sound tracks for the French-owned Syndicat de Post-Synchronisation . Theirs is difficult and exacting work . Sometimes they must sit for eight hours a day watching and listening to their stars . " When Bergman 's lips pop as she says ' my , ' my lips must pop as I say ' mon , ' " explains Paula , who tries to duplicate not only the stars ' inflections but their voices as well . " Sometimes I have to watch Bergman make her speech three , four or even five times before I am ready . I stare and stare and watch her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . " <P> Last week Paula refused to make her lips pop like Ingrid's-She and the other dubbers had decided to hold their stars ' tongues and go on strike for higher pay . " I have only the most grandiose notions of what Bergman got for playing Joan of Arc , " said Paula , " but I do know that for being her French voice I got only $148.50 . " The dubbers ' strike leader , Actor Georges Hubert , scoffed at reports that the strike was a Communist attempt to turn off the flow of U.S. pictures to France . " We have only the old-fashioned capitalist aim of more dough , " he said . " We think it not enough that French actors dubbing for top American stars get only $80 to $140 the picture . We want to boost the figure to at least $182 . " <P> " They want to be considered creative actors , " snorted a spokesman for the dubbing company , " when in reality all they do is copy . They may be fat and ugly themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a foolish argument , for which Actor Hubert had a prompt answer . " Is Paula Dehelly fat and ugly ? " he cried of the svelte little player ( see cut ) whom many a Parisian had applauded on stage &; screen in her own right . " I put it to you , is she fat and ugly ? Piece of a rotten turnip-she is not . "
