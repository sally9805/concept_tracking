txt One of the incidental results of the address of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Martin before the Investment Bankers Association is that the incoming Congress and the new Secretary of the Treasury will clearly understand where the top government banking and credit authority stands in regard to management of the national debt . Without saying so in set terms , Mr. Martin indicated that the Board is steadfast against any revival of the idea that the Federal Reserve System should be the submissive handmaiden of the Treasury . In the not too recent past that idea has been carried to absurd and indeed dangerous lengths . Some of its extreme proponents , like Representative Wright Patman of Texas , have in effect proposed to make the Reserve System a mere adjunct to the Treasury , in order that the government might spend without limit on welfarism and " borrow " at Low interest rates by stuffing its obligations into the Reserve Banks . There is no reason to suppose that George M. Humphrey , who becomes Secretary of the Treasury next month , will disagree with Mr. Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , there is ample reason to expect that he will share Chairman Martin 's belief that the judgments of value rendered in the free market place " will be better than any that can come from any supermen or any super-staff in Washington . " The new Treasury head  --  and Congress  --  will have been reminded by Mr. Martin that dire predictions of great harm to the government 's credit to result from the " unpegging " of the government bond market by the Reserve System last year proved groundless ; that in fact the effect of that action has been wholesome . It is true as Mr. Martin says , though we have all been in danger of forgetting it , that the motive forces of a free economy center in free markets . And it can be added that this principle applies as fully to the capital market as to any other .
