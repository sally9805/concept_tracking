Rubber Ruble Plot <P> Sir : <P> While sending balloons into the air over Russia carrying messages of freedom , why not also attach some American-made Russian currency ? Imagine the feeling of independence each Russian citizen would have if he were to become suddenly wealthy . Of course , Russia would have inflation , but it might jar loose a revolution . The beauty of my proposal is that Russia could not very well retaliate because they could n't print our money any faster than we 're spending it right now . <P> If our leaders in Washington had more initiative they would take a page from Stalin 's book and keep Russia so busy solving her internal problems that she would n't have time to foment wars . <P> DON KROGER <P> Lincoln , Neb . <P> Liquor &; Pearl Harbor <P> Sir : <P> According to the W.C.T.U. , if it had n't been for whisky , there would have been no Pearl Harbor TIME , Aug. 20 . And if my aunt had wings , she 'd be an F-86 . Seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be mighty restless , to see the credit handed to something else . After all , it was one of the best surprise attacks ever made . . . <P> I am not a drinker , and I do n't approve of drunkenness . I also do n't approve of people who blacken the memories of 3,000 dead men who are not able to speak for themselves . Sunday morning is a day when things are allowed to ease off , in the Army , at least . The Japs had that in mind . But in spite of their well-planned action , there were a lot of men who fought back , surprised or not . . . <P> Is there any way one can get the W.C.T.U. another string for their harp ? . . . <P> JOHN P. CONLON <P> Newark , Ohio <P> New Disability Bill <P> Sir : <P> Re the new disability bill TIME , Aug. 27 : " A barefaced grab of public money " is right ! Why not put all veterans on pension as soon as they 're discharged and spoon-feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we veterans have received enough and ought to get along on our own by now . . . <P> <P> JOSEPH S. PAPROCKI <P> Chicago <P> Sir : <P> It is comforting to know that all the gold bricks , latrine lawyers , sick-call specialists can line up for their $120 a month . As an ex-member of the expendable 106th Division , who was stupid enough to find himself overseas fighting for somebody 's turnip patch , and to lose a leg , how do they do it ? <P> . . . I have worked 70 hours a week ( when I had a job ) and for as little as 90 an hour , in an effort to make my income equal my prewar earnings . I am furnished , free , a clumsy artificial leg with none of the postwar improvements , which will not be replaced as long as I can hobble around with it . <P> To my ex-Russian P.W . friends , who are , I presume , in Siberia now : " Buddy , it 's cold here too ! " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Colonel 's Candidate ? <P> Sir : <P> Re the Aug. 20 article , " The Case Against Ike " : Thank you for keeping us informed on the Republican Party 's own worst enemy , namely , dear old Bertie McCormick . To many who live in and around Chicago , the Tribune is bought and read strictly for the comic strips . The rest of the paper , in particular the editorials , would be funny if the whole thing was n't so sad , unfortunately so because there are undoubtedly many people who read the colonel 's hogwash and believe it .
